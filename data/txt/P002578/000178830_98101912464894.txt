SUDAN
NEW HALFA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
1.01      Agriculture dominates Sudan's economy.  It contributes nearly 40% of
gross domestic product, a substantial proportion of Government revenues, 90%
of exports, and provides a livelihood to over two-thirds of the labor force.
The sector includes rainfed and irrigated crop production and livestock. Crop
production involves both traditional and modern mechanized farming methods.
1.02      The Sudan covers 600 million feddans (fd) or 2.5 million km 2
The northern third is largely desert but annual rainfall increases gradually
southward to about 200 mm around Khartoum, 400-800 mm in the central belt,
and 1,500 mm in the extreme south. Of about 200 million feddan (fd), classi-
fied as agricultural land, 80 million fd are suitable for crop production
but only 17 million fd are currently cultivated, of which over 4 million fd
are under irrigation. The remainder is grazing land and forest. Major crops
are sorghum, groundnuts, millet, cotton, wheat and sesame. Livestock includes
15 million cattle, 16 million sheep, 11 million goats, and 2 million camels
mainly owned by transhumant traditional pastoralists. Major export crops are
cotton and groundnuts which have accounted respectively for 52% and 18% of all
exports in recent years. Other important agricultural exports are livestock/
livestock products, sesame and gum arabic.
1.03      The total population of Sudan is about 17 million.  The total labor
force is 4.7 million. Eighty-five percent of the rural population lives at
or below the estimated per capita absolute poverty income level of US$80.00.
To augment their incomes many small subsistence farmers hire themselves out
on mechanized or irrigated tenancies. They form a highly mobile labor force
of about one million people. Even so, seasonal labor shortages do occur.
A key factor to the adequate availability of labor will be the ability of
the modern sector to pay the going market wage rate for unskilled labor.
1.04      During the first half of the 1970's, Sudan's agricultural economy
achieved a 4.5% average annual growth. Groundnut, wheat, sesame and rice
production all increased by over 130%, but cotton declined. Increases in
cultivated areas accounted for most of the increased production but, this
was accompanied by static or declining yields and a fall in the sector's net
contribution to Government revenue. Since then the growth rate declined,
and between 1970 and 1977 exports in real terms declined by some 13%.



- 2 -
1.05      The irrigation sub-sector produces over 50% by value of Sudan's
exports and covers over 4 million fd. The largest scheme is the Gezira
Managil complex of some 2 million fd. The 0.4 million fd New Halfa scheme
is the second largest. All irrigation water is obtained from the Nile basin.
Under the 195  Nile Water Agreemest with Egypt, Sudan's share of the available
84 milliard m is 18.5 milliard m . Over the last decade, the area of irrig-
ated land increased on average by 3.5% a year. Yet, the area devoted to
cotton (Sudan's most remunerative export crop) fell by nearly 10% overall.
Average cotton yields declined from 4.3 to 3.5 kantars of seed cotton per
feddan and from 1971 to 1977 the total volume of cotton exports fell by 35%.
There were some technical and institutional reasons for this. Maintenance was
increasingly neglected in many of the public irrigation schemes. Spare parts
and other inputs were not supplied. The sharp rise in the world price for
cereals in 1974 also had an impact. But of equal importance was the framework
of explicit and implicit disincentives to growing cotton. These included an
appreciated exchange rate for the conversion of cotton export receipts, the
application of an additional cotton export tax, and the disproportionate share
of production costs borne by cotton in the public irrigation schemes.
1.06      In June 1978, a stabilization program was announced as part of an
agreement with the IMF. Subsequently, Government, with Bank Group assistance,
formulated and adopted a new Three Year Public Investment Program (1979-81)
designed to restrict development expenditures to most urgent infrastructure
needs and priority projects in the agricultural sector. A new Export Action
Program focusses on rehabilitation of the existing irrigation schemes as the
quickest and most cost effective means of increasing production of the major
export crops - particularly cotton and groundnuts. Rehabilitation is also
important in the irrigation sub-sector because the water requirement will soon
reach the amount allocated under the Nile Agreement, and the development of
additional sources would involve large capital outlays.
1.07      In May 1979, Government reached agreement with the IMF on a set of
policy actions to be taken by Government in order to obtain access to resources
under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for a period of 3 years in an amount
equivalent to SDR 200 million. Ceilings were placed on the expansion of bank
credit and controls were imposed on recurrent budgetary expenditures. External
borrowings were to be limited. At the same time, Government took steps to
recast the pattern of financial incentives in the agricultural sector along
lines consistent with Sudan's comparative advantage in international trade.
These include - abolition of the cotton export tax, and changes in the cost
recovery system of public irrigation schemes by revamping agricultural produc-
tion relationships. The monetary ceilings have made it necessary for Govern-
ment to review its investment priorities and concentrate its resources on
rehabilitation and infrastructure projects. Government's attempts to introduce
land and water charges, and revamp the agricultural production relationships
on the Gezira Managil Scheme have already generated strong tenant reactions
but Government intends to proceed with their implementation.
1.08      World Bank Group commitments to Sudan to date total US$673.4 million.
Of this, US$32.7 million are IFC commitments. There have been eight loans (two
on Third Window terms) and 24 credits for a total of 28 projects. Nineteen



- 3 -
projects and one technical assistance project, funded by UNDP and executed by
the Bank, are under implementation. About 45 percent of the total Bank/IDA
lending has gone into agricultural development: three irrigation projects;
three rainfed mechanized farming projects; three smallholder development
projects, two in the southern region and one in the west; a livestock market-
ing project, an agricultural research project and the recently approved Agri-
cultural Rehabilitation Program. Projects in other sectors include: three
power projects, two education projects, two highway projects, a domestic
aviation project, four railway projects, a port project, a technical assistance
credit and two credits to the Industrial Bank of Sudan.
1.09      The Agricultural Rehabilitation Program Credit includes funds for
the study of cost recovery and tenant charge systems in the public irrigation
schemes of Sudan. The study is to be a joint effort of the Government and
IDA and an action program for implementing agreed recommendations is to be
decided on before September 30, 1980. It is anticipated that the study
recommendations could form the basis for a revised cost recovery system
which could be introduced at New Halfa during the life of the Project.
1.10      Physical progress in implementing development projects in Sudan has
been poor, and is becoming worse as a result of the economic crisis. Many
projects have difficulty in getting key materials--cement, fuel, timber, of
which there are periodic shortages. Belated delivery of equipment and sup-
plies due to transportation difficulties also affects most projects. The
continuing drain of skilled manpower from Sudan to neighboring countries,
where job opportunities are better, takes its toll on effective preparation
and implementation of projects. Relatively frequent changes in ministerial
appointments also create problems. Beyond these difficulties there are other
shortcomings traceable to inordinately cumbersome Government procedures. For
example, there have been protracted delays in getting parliamentary ratifica-
tion of agreed development projects and, subsequently, in obtaining legal
opinions from Government. There have also been inordinate delays in meeting
effectiveness conditions, mainly because of problems in establishing new
institutions or project accounts, hiring key staff, completing necessary legal
documentation or concluding required cofinancing arrangements. These problems
have been brought repeatedly to the notice of Government authorities, and
efforts are being intensified to help resolve them.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A.  The New Halfa Irrigation Scheme
Background
2.01      The scheme, which covers 447,000 fd in Kassala Province (Map IBRD
14172), was developed between 1962 and 1969 with Egyptian grant funds --
primarily to resettle people (the halfawyeen) displaced when the town of 3Wadi
Halfa was flooded by Lake Nasser. It is designed to use 1.62 milliard m
of water each year which it draws from the Khashm-el-Girba reservoir on the
seasonal Atbara River.



- 4 -
2.02      The scheme area is divided as follows:
(a)  22,000 tenancies                              330,000 fd
(b)  Halfawyeen freehold land                       24,000 fd
(c)  Reserved areas                                 19,000 fd
(d)  Research sub-station                            1,000 fd
(e)  Afforestation                                   2,500 fd
(f)  Sugar estate                                   41,000 fd
(g)  Infrastructure and waste                       29,500 fd
447,000 fd
The Project area would comprise the scheme area excluding the sugar estate.
2.03      The land is flat with an overall slope toward the north of about
45 cm per km, relieved by a few isolated, small, rocky hills. The climate
(Annex 1, Table 1) is semi-arid with an annual rainfall of 250-500 mm which
peaks in the summer months of July and August. Temperatures range between a
mean minimum of 15 0C in January to a mean maximum of 42 0C in May.  The soils
are heavy, deep-cracking vertisols that contain over 40% of montmorillonitic
clay. They are low in nitrogen, but otherwise suitable for sustained crop
production.
2.04      When the resettlement of the 7,000 halfawyeen families was com-
pleted, the remaining tenancies were allocated to local pastoralists (the
nomads) making a total of 22,000 tenants. The population in the Project area
is about 300,000 of whom 68,000 are halfawyeen, 148,000 nomads, 50,000 migrant
laborers and 34,000 inhabitants of New Halfa town. The rural population is
distributed over about 25 planned villages and many spontaneous settlements.
There is little integration between the halfawyeen and nomads. They have
different origins and customs, and because of this, were settled separately.
Organization
2.05      The organization of the scheme reflects an intended partnership
between the Government, the New Halfa Agricultural Production Corporation
(NHAPC), and the tenant. The Government for its part has been the sole source
of external financing and in effect exercises ultimate control by prescribing
the powers and responsibilities of NHAPC and the relationship between NHAPC
and the tenant in the form of a Tenant Lease Agreement. NHAPC, a statutory
corporation, established by legislation has a board representing the various
interested parties and is responsible for supplying goods and services to the
tenant, both in kind--notably seasonal inputs including tractor services, and
the maintenance of scheme facilities such as water supplies--and cash advances
for labor. The tenant cultivates his farm in accordance with a prescribed
cropping pattern using family and hired labor. They repay the Corporation for
the goods and services it supplies out of crop proceeds and have their own
organization in the form of a tenants' union.



2.06      To a limited extent in some parts of the scheme, tenants have
organized themselves into cooperatives to provide services to their members.
Currently, there are 67 cooperatives, 26 of which provide farm machinery
services. The balance provide flour mill processing, consumer and trans-
portation services. In addition, there is one big flour mill cooperative
which is a joint venture of 22 smaller cooperatives. The 26 farm machinery
cooperatives, comprised of halfawayeen members, own about 50 tractors, disc
plows, and harrows which supplement their own needs and are sometimes used
to provide contract services to others including the nomads who have not yet
formed cooperatives.
Crop Production
2.07      Each tenant has a 15 fd holding which is divided into three fields
called hawashas (haw) of 5 fd each. The fields must be farmed according
to the crop rotation and management regime determined by NHAPC. In addition,
the 7,000 halfawayeen tenants were allocated 24,000 fd of freehold land where
use is not controlled. The current cropping program is an agronomically sound
three year rotation of cotton/wheat/groundnuts. Cotton and groundnuts are
grown as summer/rainy season crops planted between May and August. The wheat
is a winter/dry season crop planted in October/November. Yields since 1967/68
have been low and variable (Table 1). The pattern of freehold land use has
been about one third each to vegetables, wheat and groundnuts, and fallow and
natural pasture.

2.08      The contract machinery services provided by NHAPC is primarily for
cotton cultivation but extends to wheat and groundnuts because of insufficient
private and farmer cooperative contractors. The shortage of foreign exchange
in recent years has left the machinery pool short of spare parts and replace-
ments. Overall the scheme requires 250 serviceable tractors but by October
1979 only 85 were reported to be in working order. Other agricultural machinery
was similarly in short supply. The machinery is maintained in NHAPC's poorly
equipped workshops that need structural improvement. Tractor fuel is supplied
by rail from the refinery at Port Sudan. Deliveries are erratic and adequate
local availability is further prejudiced by inadequate storage capacity which
is limited to about one month's requirements during the peak cultivation period.



- 6 -
2.09      NHAPC's inability to provide sufficient machinery services has
largely contributed to the recent decline in the area cultivated (Table 2)
and the comparatively low yields.

Irrigation
2.10      The Khashm-el-Girba D m was completed in 1964 with an initial reser-
voir capacity of 1.3 milliard m . The average annual inf ow is about 12
milliard m which varies between a peak of 5-7 milliard m /month in August to
nil in March-May. The reserXoir capacity was rapidly reduced through silta-
tion to about 0.8 milliard m in 1976, and despite flushing measures, which
were introduced in 1971, the capacity is projected to fall by about 6% per
year. The current annual gross water requirement from the reservoir is about
0.97 milliard m  for the3present cropping system at 48% cropping intensity.
Of this, 0.46 milliard m is required from stored water for the continuous
irrigation of sugar cane, for wheat during October to February, and for
irrigations of the groundnut and cotton crops between November and January.
Under the Project the cropping intensity would 3increase to 87% and the aniual
water requirement would rise, to 1.68 millard m , of which 0.65 milliard m
would be required from stored water for the same purpose as before plus
earlier pre-irrigations of groundnut and cotton crops in May and June. How-
ever, this cropping pattern will have to change as the stored water supply
diminishes. As it is undesirable to reduce sugar cane production below the
factory capacity, the area cf this crop should remain constant at 25,000 fd.
Moreover, it would be counter productive to use stored water needed for
cotton and groundnut production to sustain the wheat area, particularly if
this precludes the possibility of earlier pre-irrigations of the former.
Hence, given Sudan's current economic and financial difficulties, the summer
crops (cotton and groundnut--Sudan's major export crops) should be given
priority over wheat (paras 1.05 and 1.06). A reduction in the wheat area
remains the only other immediate option. The annual storage capacity and
related wheat area are projected in Annex 1, Table 2, until the year 2003
when no wheat could be grown.



- 7 -
2.11      Several long-term options are available.  These include the pro-
vision of additional storage by the construction of another dam upstream.
Government has feasibility studies in hand for this. Another option would
be to replace the wheat area in the rotation by summer crops, i.e. to put
the whole 330,000 fd under cotton and groundnuts in a two crop rotation.
However, the design capacity of the canal system limits irrigation in the
tenancy area to 220,000 fd. To increase the area would require a major
reconstruction of the canal system. The introduction of the long furrow
system as a means of improving water management would help delay the decline
in the wheat area but would require substantial land leveling and the con-
struction of a drainage network. Both the last two options would require
large investment and may be difficult to justify within the time frame of the
diminishing supply of stored water. In the short term, the only practical
solution is to find a suitable rainfed summer crop. The problem of making
a choice between the several possibilities available is being addressed in
the consultant's study referred to in para 2.37.
2.12      Water is conveyed to the Project area from the dam through a main
canal with a design capacity of 100 m /sec. and is distributed through a net-
work of smaller canals. With the exception of the section developed before
1965, covering about 60,000 fd, the system is based on canal night storage and
day field application using the angaya (basin) system with hand constructed
bunds. It is well designed. The pre-1965 system has no night storage and
was designed for continuous irrigation. Initially it worked well but once
maintenance declined a resistance to night work appeared. At present the
tenants operate an inefficient daytime system using too little water with
consequent loss of agricultural production.
2.13      In October when the reservoir is full the water flows by gravity
through three pump-turbines (Annex 1, Chart 1) generating a maximum of
6 MW of electricity as a by-product. This continues until the reservoir -
canal level head falls to 2 m above the canal level (May), and the water is
delivered through two radial gates. From about May to August the reservoir
level falls below the canal level and water has to be pumped. Whilst this
pumping head is less than 4.5 m (June-July) the three pump-turbines are
used. Then, at pumping heads greater than 4.5 m (August, during flushing)
four additional high lift pumps must be used. The power for this pumping
is generated by two 3.9 MW Kaplan turbines and three 1.3 MW diesel generators
originally installed in 1964. Two of the latter are currently unserviceable.
2.14      Water management follows the traditional system for Sudan and
suffers typical misunderstandings between NHAPC staff - who estimate water
requirements and organize field applications - and MOIHE staff, who operate
the canal system. Lack of a reliable telecommunications system within
the irrigation area hampers efficient operation. Poor maintenance of the
quaternary (Abu Ishreen) and field canals (Abu Sitta) by NHAPC and farmers
is also a constraint.



-8-
Health
2.15      The Project area (para 2.02) and its surrounds are served by two
rural hospitals and a regional referral hospital with 289 beds in New Halfa
town. Out of the 113 villages, 41 have medical facilities but they are poorly
distributed and provide inadequate coverage. In the early years of settle-
ment, particular attention was paid to sanitation, the provision of clean
village water supplies and the control of the two main communicable diseases,
malaria and bilharzia. Since then, the water filtration plants have not been
properly maintained and the two diseases are still prevalent.
Scheme Management
2.16      The scheme's agrLcultural affairs are managed by NHAPC which is
well structured, reasonably well staffed and has been under good management
over the last few years. Hlowever, it lacks the financial resources, agricul-
tural, canal and road making/maintenance equipment, transport and communica-
tion facilities, and field staff housing needed to do its job properly. In
addition, its accounts department is weak. This results in poor financial
control and a lack of management information which is a fault common to many
public agricultural corporations in Sudan.
2.17      Until mid-1979 NIAPC was one of 11 agricultural production subsi-
diaries of the Government owned Public Agricultural Production Corporation
(PAPC). As such it was starved of operating funds and did not have sufficient
autonomy to make the policy and management decisions needed to run the scheme
efficiently.
2.18      PAPC has been dismantled, consistent with the findings of the
Agricultural Sector Survey Report (May 18, 1979), and NHAPC has been recon-
stituted as an independent major public corporation. Government is reviewing
the reorganization of its parastatals and is expected to discuss a draft
program of reform with the Association by September 30, 1980.
2.19      NHAPC maintains a close liaison with the institutions which control
or influence other aspects of the scheme. These include the tenants and the
Tenant's Union with whom N}IAPC has a good working relationship, the MOI for
irrigation, and the PEWC for electric power. Others are the Kassala Provincial
Administration for health, roads, domestic water, and education, and the
various marketing agencies, namely Cotton Production Corporation (CPC) for
cotton lint, private merchants in New Halfa and the Sudan Oilseed Corporation
(SOC) for groundnut, SOC for cotton seed, and the New Halfa Flour Mill for
wheat.
Scheme Financing
2.20      The key constraint to increased production can be clearly traced to
inadequate funding. As a subsidiary of PAPC the income derived from NHAPC's
cotton lint was paid direcl:ly by CPC to the Bank of Sudan (BOS) where it was
credited to PAPC's account., This account was also used for all 11 of PAPC's
subsidiaries. As of mid-1979 it had an accumulated deficit of nearly LSd 60
million. NHAPC derived its finances from PAPC in the form of monthly advances.
These were geared to a budget which was drawn up by NHAPC and submitted to



PAPC, then BOS, for approval. NHAPC geared this budget to what was needed
to prepare all 330,000 fd for production. By the time it was approved it had
been subjected to substantial cuts. As a result NHAPC has never had sufficient
funds to bring the whole scheme into production.
2.21      The problem of inadequate funding most seriously affected NHAPC
when, in 1975/76, a poor season affected all irrigation schemes in Sudan. New
Halfa's cotton area fell from near 110,000 fd in 1973/74 and 1974/75 to 81,000
fd, and its production to about 30% of that realized in each of the preceding
two years (Table 2). Its traditional cost and revenue sharing, debt and cost
recovery arrangements produced a negative tenant's price for cotton and had to
be modified to avoid tenant's realizing the highest cotton yields receiving
the highest negative returns and vice versa. PAPC's ability to fund its 11
subsidiaries including New Halfa became heavily dependent on the BOS. The
Ministry of Finance has an item Deficits of Agricultural Production Corpora-
tions within its recurrent budget, but funds from this source were not called
upon. Of all 11 PAPC's subsidiaries New Halfa was seen as the scheme that
could be most rapidly brought back into production and in 1976 Government
requested Bank assistance to redress the deteriorating trend.
2.22      Since 1975/76 NHAPC has continued to be starved of finance.  It had
to continue to use a cost and revenue sharing, debt, and cost recovery arrange-
ment (the Joint Account) that could only work if most tenants grew cotton and
the majority of them could then realize greater than "break-even" cotton yields.
It could not command the foreign exchange to maintain its plant and equipment
and was subject to erratic fuel deliveries from Port Sudan. It had to canni-
balize its broken down plant and equipment to keep the remainder operating,
and direct all its available resources towards maximizing the area of irrigable
land that could be prepared for production. Cotton was given priority, but
the standard and timing of NHAPC controlled operations declined.
2.23      An increasing number of tenants found it increasingly difficult to
produce break-even cotton yields. Their willingness to participate in cotton
production fell. Many reduced their labor inputs to the minimum required to
receive the cash advances NHAPC was obliged to pay for specific cotton and/or
groundnut operations under the traditional arrangements. With declining
tenant participation an increasing proportion of whatever land could be
prepared by NHAPC and sown by tenants was never effectively brought through
to harvest. In 1979/80 some 70,000 fd of cotton land were prepared: as at
October 1979 only about 12,000 fd were reported to be worth spraying (Table 2).
2.24      Tenant willingness to grow cotton was further eroded because of
the time it has taken NHAPC to settle the accounts of the few who were able
to realize break-even cotton yields. However, much of this delay was beyond
NHAPC's control. The time lag from the first land preparation for cotton to
receipt of crop proceeds has not taken less than 2 and was at times taking
longer than 3 years to finalize, whereas the time lags for groundnut and wheat
between initial land preparation and selling the harvests were about one year
and six months respectively. These latter two crops were sold privately by
the tenant for cash within days of threshing.



- 10 -
2.25      Few, if any, tenants attempted to settle their loans from NHAPC
for groundnut and wheat production until their cotton accounts had been
finalized. Even then the only tenants who presented themselves (para. 2.28)
to NHAPC to settle were those who anticipated total cotton receipts in excess
of all loans advanced by NHAPC for cotton, groundnut and wheat. In recent
years only about one-third of all tenants growing cotton have been able to
achieve cotton yields high enough to break-even with all NHAPC loans.
NHAPC loans extended to all other tenants were invariably left to accumulate
on NHAPC's books. As at December 1978 these unrecovered debts had accumul-
ated to about MSd 5.0 million and include recent increments of about LSd 0.5
million per year. These debts are a serious drain on NHAPC's resources, but
are unlikely to be recovered because much of this LSd 5.0 million debt is
owed by debtors who cannot be identified.
Debt Recovery
2.26      A major cause of the decline of the New Halfa scheme has been the
failure of the Corporation to recover its costs from the tenant reflecting
both the inability of the scheme to generate adequate revenues and the nature
of the cost recovery mechanism currently practised. The central feature of
this mechanism is the Joint Account which shares cotton costs and revenues
between the Corporation and the tenant. Its origins lie in the earlier domi-
nance of cotton in the cropping pattern on irrigation schemes and the fact
that cotton was, and remains, the only crop to be marketed through the public
corporations thus providing them with a control on revenues from which cost
deductions could be made.
2.27      Conceptually the Joint Account was intended to carry all the tenant
costs incurred by the public corporation associated with the cultivation,
processing and marketing of cotton, and in due course be credited with the
proceeds of that crop. The net amount was then divided approximately equally
between the tenant and the Corporation. Out of its share the Corporation was
intended to meet all other direct and indirect scheme costs. To the extent
that these include costs attributable to crops other than cotton the Joint
Account is skewed against cotton. In the case of New Halfa, where equal areas
of cotton, groundnut and wheat were prescribed in the cropping pattern from
the scheme's beginning, about 40% of these direct and indirect scheme costs
are attributable to groundnut and wheat. In addition, because both cotton
costs and revenues are shared the tenant can neither realize the full profit-
ability of cotton nor, in the case of low yields, the full loss. Finally, in
the case of New Halfa, the Corporation has no lien on the revenue proceeds of
groundnut and wheat has to recover its loans to tenants for these crops by
cash repayments from tenants.
2.28      In practice tenants failed to make repayments to the Corporation
for the goods and services which they had received from it for groundnut and
wheat, and the Corporation had no choice but to make recoveries against the
proceeds of tenants' cotton crops. Thus de facto the cotton crop came to
carry the Corporation's cultivation costs of crops other than cotton, while
tenants enjoyed the full proceeds of such crops marketed privately. This
in turn led to a decline in cotton production (exacerbated by other circum-
stances) to the point that revenues from cotton were inadequate to meet its
costs of production.



- 11 -
2.29      At current yield levels, the Joint Account generates a price for
cotton which under existing cost and revenue sharing and debt recovery arrange-
ments leaves the average tenant with a loss from cotton and positive returns
from groundnut and wheat.  Moreover, by defaulting on NHAPC loans, all tenants
growing less than break-even cotton yields (or maybe no cotton at all) retain
the cash advances which the Corporation pays them for part of their labor
costs. Thus they have cause to regard their sales receipts from groundnut
and wheat, plus the cash advances for cotton and groundnut, as their wages
for labor expended on their tenancies. Alternatively, of those who do grow
cotton, many do so simply because the Corporation was able to prepare their
land. These tenants have come to regard whatever seed cotton they deliver to
the Corporation as full payment for all loans they received in cash or kind to
grow cotton, groundnut or wheat. However, if each crop was to bear its full
costs of production and tenants were to receive relevant farmgate parity
prices, cotton would be by far the most profitable.
2.30      The Joint Account mechanism has the potential to recover costs pro-
vided most tenants grow cotton and realize cotton yields that exceed break-
even levels. However, the skewed effects of the mechanism and its failure
to provide individual incentives demand that the system at least be modified
and be made to work. Nonetheless the timing of such intended changes will
be critical. Tenants at New Halfa currently do not have the resources to
increase their loan repayments and are sceptical that the Corporation will
ever have the capacity to improve its services to them and thus put them in
a position to repay at higher levels. Through their Tenants' Union they are
well organized and can call effective strike action, as occurred on the Gezira
Scheme in 1979 when similar adjustments to the cost recovery mechanism were
introduced. It is therefore important that the proposed changes be introduced
to coincide with the anticipated increases in production which would follow
the proposed Project investments.
Tenant Incomes
2.31      Although the total area cropped each season is known, the distri-
bution of crops between tenancies is less certain. An estimate based on
1978/79 data suggests that nearly 60% of the 22,000 tenancies were growing
only one crop; nearly 30% two crops; about 10% three crops; and a few (perhaps
1%) none at all. Consequently, tenancy incomes vary widely. Moreover, only
77% of all tenants were growing cotton.
2.32      It is estimated that in 1978/79 about 80% of the 22,000 tenants
would have received a total of less than hSd 300 per annum from their tenancy
after repayment of debt, but before paying labor--that is, about 80% of the
tenant population would have had to live at or below the absolute per capita
poverty level had they been solely dependent on their tenancy. Moreover, a
similar percentage of tenants could not have paid the going market wage rate
for hired or family labor. (An average tenancy would require about 180
mandays of labor per year.) This is important because most tenants have
other sources of income--the halfawyeen from their freehold land and paid
employment, and the nomads from livestock and off-tenancy rainfed sorghum;
and although no tenant is prepared to willingly release his tenancy, his
willingness to work it diligently and strive for higher yields using his own
or hired labor is significantly influenced by tenancy earnings and the number
of mandays this requires vis-a-vis alternative earning opportunities.



- 12 -
2.33      The available evidence suggests that the individual will opt to
work his tenancy and settle his debts, if after repaying, he can earn the
going market wage rate foor unskilled labor of about 1Sd 1 per manday. But,
amongst the defaulting tenants, any who realize yields which give rise to a
return of less than hSd 1 per manday before repaying loans will be increas-
ingly motivated to seek alternative sources of income.
Current Situation
2.34      In 1978/79 and 1979/80 wher, NHAPC was only able to bring a total
of about 160,000 fd into production NHAPC permitted tenants to grow some
sorghum. Over all 22,000 tenancies this averaged about 0.07 haws per tenancy
in 1978/79 and 0.14 haws in 1979/80 (Table 2). In addition, in 1979/80 NHAPC
allowed irrigation to continue on the cotton area that was not being sprayed
(Table 2) presumably because it was not worth bringing through to harvest.
It also allowed some of the unutilized groundnut area to be irrigated. The
volunteer plant growth (mainly weeds) so produced is being used by tenants
for fodder. Although such land and/or water use cannot be financially justi-
fied, NHAPC's decision to let it happen was understandable. First, the only
alternative would have been to physically prevent it, and this would have
been almost impossible to police. Second, it protected the at present good
NHAPC - tenant and Tenant Union relationship without which any future produc-
tion would be seriously jeopardized. Third, with the exception of the land
and water involved all expenses had to be borne by the i:-n-Ints. Fourth, it
kept many tenants and migrant laborers within the command area of the scheme
where their labor could be hired by other tenants who did have cotton and
groundnut to tend--thus reducing the possibility of inadequate labor further
eroding the areas of cotton, groundnut and to a lesser extent wheat (heavily
mechanized) that could be brought through to harvest.
B. Rehabilitation Strategy
2.35      The New Halfa scheme was developed on a sound agronomic base.
However, because NHAPC lacks the physical and financial resources to meet its
responsibilities on time and to standard, the entire command area cannot be
brought into production. Yields are depressed, tenants fail to settle their
debts, and NHAPC is building up a substantial deficit.
2.36      The scheme has the natural resources, the basic infrastructure and
management to be financially attractive to tenants and benefit the national
economy. In the short term the most effective way of bringing it back into
full production is to provide NHAPC with the resources to do its job properly.
Moreover, such an approach would require a minimum of social and institutional
changes -- both of which are liable to delay implementation -- and can be
carried out independently of longer term developments which are, in any event,
limited by the diminishing water supply. In addition, the suitability of
separating an immediate rehabilitation from long term development is in line
with the country's urgent need to improve the use of available resources for



- 13 -
increasing foreign exchange earnings as quickly as possible. New Halfa
offers an immediate opportunity to do this by increasing cotton and groundnut
production for export.
2.37      In 1976, Government requested Bank assistance to redress the deter-
iorating trend and take further steps to develop the scheme's resources.  In
1977, Agrar-und Hydrotechnic GmBH was engaged as consultants, using funds
from the IDA Technical Assistance Credit 614-SU, to carry out a feasibility
study in two phases.  The first phase addressed the immediate problems of
rehabilitating the scheme and the consultant's Phase I report provided the
basis for appraisal by the Association in November 1978.  The second phase
study is underway and besides focussing on the identification of a suitable
non-irrigated substitute for wheat it would deal with longer term issues such
as the development of cooperatives, changes in crop processing and marketing,
and the improvement of water management. However, investment for the second
phase would have to be evaluated against the diminishing water supply and may
be difficult to justify unless an additional upstream reservoir is constructed.
2.38      Having regard to the complex financial situation of NHAPC the New
Halfa scheme would be better served by creating a new corporation which
would be free of past financial encumbrances. Accordingly, the creation of
a successor corporation was proposed. This was done in early 1980 under a
special Establishment Warrant which provides the reconstituted Corporation,
hereinafter referred to as NHAPC (1980) with the structure and power required
to make appropriate policy and management decisions and enter into suitable
lease and credit agreements with tenants (para. 4.02)
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The Project would, over five years, rehabilitate NHAPC (1980) by
providing it with the means to quickly increase and sustain agricultural
production through the efficient use of the available land, water and human
resources. Specifically, the Project would include:
(a) agricultural machinery, workshop facilities and fuel storage;
(b) buildings comprising field staff housing, stores and a
training center;
(c) road making and canal maintenance equipment;
(d) initial rehabilitation of the canal system;
(e) vehicles;



- 14 -
(f) electro-mechanical equipment for the dam;
(g) telecommunications;
(h) a mechanical delinting plant;
(i) training;
(j) technical assistance and consultancy;
(k) health, including rural water supplies, field health
centers, malaria and bilharzia control programs; and
(1) cash required by NHAPC(1980) in the first three
Project years.
3.02      Using the inputs provided, the Project would bring nearly all the
available irrigable tenancy land of 330,000 fd (66,000 haws) into production
by Year 3 (Table 3).  The same total area would be maintained thereafter, but
a fodder crop would gradually replace wheat as the siltation in the reservoir
reduces the quantity of stored water available for wheat (para 2.11).

3.03      In order to expedite Project implementation, financial consultants
and a procurement officer would start work early in 1980 under a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) (para 3.39). With the assistance of NHAPC's
technical staff, the procurement officer would prepare documentation for the
purchase of the agricultural and workshop machinery and spares, road and canal
maintenance equipment, vehicles and telecommunication equipment, and would
advertise tenders during the second half of 1980 (Annex 1, Chart 2). Delivery
of the goods would be expected to start during mid-1981 and all should be in
operation during early 1982. On this basis, the entire irrigable area should
be in production in Project Year 3 (1982/83). To ensure good distribution of
irrigation water and better tenant participation, the initial canal rehabili-
tation component would be carried out in the two dry seasons 1980/81 and
1981/82. Building construction and delivery of the health component vehicles
and equipment would be scheduled to start during the last quarter of 1980.
In order to help maintain production until the first full crop season (i.e.
cropping season 3 which spans Project year 1982/83) spare parts for agricul-
tural machinery would be purchased starting in 1980 using the PPF.
3.04      The Project would increase crop yields through the use of better
and more timely agronomic practices made possible by the provision of the
additional agricultural machinery, workshop facilities and fuel storage
and by improving field staff efficiency. The measures to be introduced
would include:
(a) early planting of groundnut and cotton crops and the
use of improved seed;
(b)  the mechanization of cotton and groundnut planting,
fertilizer placement, and some groundnut harvesting
to minimize labor constraints at peak periods;
(c) better irrigation management through the provision of
a telecommunication network, and better road and canal
maintenance;
(d) training programs to improve staff efficiency and farmer
knowledge, backed up by a technical assistance program.
3.05      Land preparation for cotton is typically carried out from March
to May, followed by harvesting and ginning from November to April. Land
preparation for groundnuts is from March to April, followed by harvesting
from October to November. The crop is threshed and sold between February
and April. Wheat is grown from September to February and harvested, threshed
and sold in March. This pattern would continue in cropping seasons 1 and 2
of the Project. However, by late 1981 sufficient agricultural machinery
should be on-site to recommence land levelling and deep plowing. Thus in
cropping seasons 3 and after field operations for cotton would commence with
a disc harrowing in November - December. Land levelling (December - May),



- 16 -
ridging and fertilizing (May - June), sowing (June - July) etc. would follow
for an October - March cotton harvest. Deep plowing, however, would be
accommodated without changing the schedule for hand harvested groundnut (March
through April) or wheat (September through March). Mechanically harvested
groundnut would be threshed and sold in December/January. Fodder crop field
operations would start in July and finish in October/November. As a result,
commencing with cropping seasons 3 all 22,000 haws of land scheduled for
cotton would be land levelled and all 22,000 haws of the wheat/ fodder crop
land would be deep plowed -- that is, every 3 years the entire 66,000 haws of
tenanted land would be land levelled and deep plowed once.
3.06      With the exception of the electromechanical equipment components,
the Project would be implemented by NHAPC (1980) (para 4.01). NHAPC (1980)
would be strengthened by the Project's Technical Assistance component (para
3.25). The electro-mechanical equipment would be purchased and installed by
PEWC.
B. Detailed Features 1/
Agricultural Machinery and Spares (US$12.6 million)
3.07      The Project would provide US$1.6 million for the purchase of about
113 additional 70 HP wheel tractors to bring NHAPC (1980)'s total tractor
fleet up to 250. It would also purchase additional agricultural equipment
(US$2.2 million) so that the machinery available from the Corporation and
the Cooperatives would be sufficient to carry out the cropping program
indicated in Table 3, i.e. 300 tractors, 250 three-furrow mounted disc ploughs,
175 trailed disc harrows and other equipment. The total machinery requirement
is based on the assumption that 80% of all tractors would be serviceable
during periods of peak demand, namely May and September. The project would
also provide US$4.8 million to maintain the strength of the machinery pool
for both the Corporation and Farmers' Cooperatives. The Corporation's combine
harvesters do not require replacement, but spares would be provided (para
3.08).
3.08      Also US$4.0 million is provided for spare parts, for the additional
agricultural machinery and the replacements. This is made up of US$0.3 mil-
lion for initial tractor spares on the 113 additional tractors (para 3.07)
and US$2.6 million for general spares required on the new equipment. In
addition US$1.1 million would be provided for the Corporation's combine
harvesters.
1/   Costs shown are baseline costs.



- 17 -
Workshops (US$1.6 million)
3.09      Workshops would be improved at an estimated cost of US$1.6 million.
At the Project's headquarters in New Halfa town the dirt floors in the four
main workshops would be replaced with concrete. Shelving, cupboards and
other necessary fittings would also be constructed, and some US$80,000 would
be used to purchase essential workshop equipment and tools. The scheme is
divided into 19 Blocks. In the eight which have no workshop, new facilities
would be constructed and equipped. In the remaining eleven the existing sub-
standard facilities would be renovated.
3.10      When fully developed in Year 5, the facilities would enable effi-
cient maintenance routines and minor repairs to be carried out in each Block
and for major overhauls and repairs to be carried out at headquarters. This
would allow the tractors and implements to be distributed equitably around
the scheme and their management decentralized (para 4.05).
Fuel Supplies (US$0.9 million)
3.11      Storage is at present limited to 58,000 gallons in four tanks in
New Halfa town and one 5,000 gallon tank in each of nine Blocks. Supplies
are delivered to New Halfa by rail and to the Blocks by lorries. However,
because the national demand for rail freight services exceeds the Sudan
Railway's capability, fuel deliveries are unreliable and this, coupled with
the scheme's small storage capacity and poor internal road network, often
restricts tractor operations, particularly in the rainy season. This unsatis-
factory state of affairs would be resolved by providing two additional 100,000
gallon storage tanks in New Halfa town with pumping and fire-fighting equipment
and direct connections for offloading rail tankers.  The additional provision
of two tanker-trailers to haul fuel from Port Sudan should ensure reliable
deliveries.
3.12      At Block level, 67 additional 5,000 gallon storage tanks would be
installed to bring the storage capacity up to 20,000 gallons in each Block.
Management would ensure that the fuel supply in these tanks would not be
less than 10,000 gallons per Block at the beginning of the rainy season, thus
ensuring adequate reserves for about four months. The tanks would be elevated
so that refuelling would be by gravity.
Buildings
3.13      Staff Housing (US$6.1 million).  The Project would resolve the
scheme's most urgent housing problem by providing 111 houses so that each
of the 6 Sections and 19 Blocks, respectively, would have the minimum housing
requirements to appoint and deploy the field staff needed to operate the
Project. A further 15 houses would also be provided for the incremental
staff proposed for the Technical Assistance and Training components. Four
grades of housing would be constructed with minor modifications to standard
designs already in use in the Project area. These standards are not elaborate
and if reduced would seriously impair the ability of the Project to appoint
and retain the minimum field staff needed to o0erate the Project.  The cost
(US$6.1 million) is estimated at ISd 280 per m plus 20% for infrastructure.



- 18 -
3.14      Storage (US$3.5 million).  Apart from the construction of two 500 m
stores which are urgently required at the Project headquarters for insecti-
cides, tyres and spare parts, this component would focus on bringing the
facilities at Section end Block levels up tS the minimum for efficient field
operations. One 360 m store and one 162 m open-si5ed shed would be built
in each of the six Sections, and six stores of 720 m each would be constructed
to complete the development of one such store in each Block.
3.15      TraininRenter (US$0.5 million).  This would comprise i classroom
and workshop (340 m ) together with an accommodation block (800 m ) for 25
students. The center would be provided with furniture, equipment and teaching
aids. It would be sited near the headquarters main workshop so that use can
be made of the workshop tools and equipment in the training programs.
Road and Canal Maintenance Equipment
3.16      Roads (US$4.1 million).  The Project would establish a Road Main-
tenance and Construction Unit (RMCU), comprising two road teams, each equipped
with a 140 HP bulldozer fitted with rippers, one 105 HP wheel tractor, one
125 HP motor grader, two 7-ton dump trucks, two 2,000 gallon water tankers,
a sheeps foot roller, flat steel wheel power roller, and a four wheel drive
pickup vehicle. The unit would also be equipped with a 135 HP excavator.
3.17      Using Project funds, RMCU would reconstruct the 130 km spine road
system which connects New Halfa town with the six agricultural Section head-
quarters (Map 14172). The spine roads would comprise compacted soil embank-
ments 10 m between shoulders, raised 50 cm above ground level, covered with
a 10 cm layer of gravel. An additional 5 cm layer of gravel would be laid
to provide a carriageway 6 m wide. Fourteen bridges and 26 pipe culverts
would also be constructed. The equipment would also be used to maintain all
the scheme's roads and carry out spot improvements where required.
3.18      Canal Maintenance (US$1.7 million).  Three additional 300 HP crawler
tractors and ditchers, and three sets of replacements for the three existing
crawler tractors and ditchers would be purchased, together with two new 125
HP motor graders. Spare parts would be provided for a full overhaul of the
existing equipment and the subsequent maintenance of all the equipment.
These purchases, together with the existing equipment, would allow each
of the six Sections to have its own canal maintenance unit of one crawler
and ditcher with which to maintain the Abu Ishreen canals. The motor graders
would be used for drain construction and maintenance. The main, major, and
minor canals supplying water to the Abu Ishreens would be maintained by MOI
as at present.
Initial Rehabilitation of the Canal System (US$0.2 million)
3.19      The purchased canal maintenance equipment would not be operational
until Project year 3. Prior to this it was agreed that the Abu Ishreens would
be cleaned and maintained by NHAPC (1980) under contracts which would be
furnished to the Association promptly upon their preparation and enable the



- 19 -
work involved to be commenced and completed no later than January 31, 1981 and
March 31, 1982 respectively without disrupting irrigation within the Project
area.
Vehicles (US$5.4 million)
3.20      The Project would provide an additional 61 four wheel drive pickups,
12 small saloon cars, 10 lorries, 44 motorcycles, and an annual supply of
spare parts. A further 175 vehicles would be purchased over the five year
life of the Project to replace existing vehicles and maintain the total number
at the minimum required for the staff to operate efficiently.
Electro-mechanical Equipment (US$1.8 million)
3.21      Project funds would be used for PEWC to purchase the spare parts:
needed for the installation of the new 3 MW diesel generator at the dam;
to get the two 1.30 MW diesel generators at the dam into working order; to
rehabilitate the three pump turbines, two Kaplan turbines and the switchgear;
and to employ engineering consultants to supervise getting all the electro-
mechanical equipment at the dam in good working order, provide on-the-job
training to PEWC staff, and prepare a detailed future maintenance program
for PEWC to follow.
Telecommunications (US$0.2 million)
3.22      Telecommunications would be improved by installing a VHF Radio
Telephone System, comprising a base station at New Halfa and 10 solar-powered
sub-stations at strategic points in the Project Area, including the dam (Map
14172). The base station would be designed to permit the simultaneous con-
nection of six sub-stations and would have a range of about 35 km. The system
would permit connections to the public telephone network at New Halfa. The
cost includes installation charges and a fee to the Sudan Telephone Public
Corporation for site survey, design, specifications, tendering, evaluation and
supervision of installation.
Ginnery Delinter Plant (US$0.5 million)
3.23      A mechanical delinter would be provided which would have a capacity
of about 6.5 t of cotton seed per 8-hour shift, and would reduce the fuzz to
about 3% by weight thus making the seed suitable for efficient mechanical
planting. About 1,000 t of delinted seed would be produced each year, which
would be sufficient to plant the projected 110,000 fd at 9 kg/fd and allow
for wastage. The delinter would be installed in one of NHAPC's ginneries.
Training (US$0.2 million)
3.24      In addition to the cost (US$0.4 million) included in the building
component (para 3.15) of constructing a training center, the Project would
provide furniture, equipment, teaching aids and operating costs of US$170,000.
These facilities would be used to develop a training program (para 4.15) under
the direction of a senior mechanical engineer, supported full time by an
agricultural instructor, two mechanic instructors and junior staff. Part



- 20 -
time lecturers would be provided from the Corporation's qualified staff of
mechanical, civil, agricultural and electrical engineers, agriculturalists,
and visiting specialists.
Technical Assistance and Consultancy (US$1.4 million)
3.25      To assist the newly reconstituted NHAPC (1980) implement the Project
and operate the agricultural and irrigation routines efficiently, the Project
would provide specialist staff to establish a Procurement Unit and a Develop-
ment Planning Unit. Both Units would be part of the existing Technical
Planning Office. The Procurement Unit would comprise an internationally
recruited procurement specialist for two years together with local supporting
staff. They would institute procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank,
and arrange for the timely delivery of all goods and services purchased with
Project funds. The Unit would establish working arrangements with other
agencies for the expeditious clearance and transportation of imported goods.
The Development Planning Unit would comprise four internationally recruited
staff, namely an agricultural economist, an agriculturalist, a field water
management specialist and a financial advisor. The Unit would have the
following main duties:
(a) design and implement a monitoring and evaluating system
and provide Project management with soundly based analyses
and recommendations for improving the Project's efficiency;
(b) provide Project management with economic, financial,
irrigation and agricultural technical assistance;
(c)  provide Project management with cost and credit infor-
mation and recommendations for their improvement; and
(d) prepare quarterly progress reports and a Project Completion
Report.
3.26      The cost of the internationally recruited staff is estimated at
US$7,000 per man month plus contingencies and travel provisions estimated to
cost an additional US$1,750. The procurement specialist has been appointed
and it was agreed that the other four appointments, to run for 3.5 years each,
would be made after consultation with IDA and preferably by September 1, 1980.
3.27      The technical assistance program would also include provision for
the employment of financial consultants who have already been retained under
the PFF to review the Corporation's accounting system and introduce improved
procedures. This contract involves a total cost of US$130,000 (about US$10,000
per man month including contingencies and travel provisions) and is to be com-
pleted by December 31, 1980. Funds (total US$90,000) are included to hire
the engineering consultants required for the Khasm-el-Girba Dam electro-
mechanical equipment component (para. 3.21). Finally, US$52,000 equivalent
is included to engage consultants to recommend: (a) precise debt recovery
procedures; and (b) criteria for (i) extending finance to defaulting tenants,
(ii) defining persistent default, and (iii) imposing sanctions against per-
sistent defaulters (para 4.24).



- 21 -
Health
3.28      General Disease Control (US$2.1 million).  The component would com-
prise additional buildings, equipment, vehicles, staff and running costs to
augment the Public Health Service in the Project area with the main objectives
of providing a better distribution of health services, and improving the anti-
malaria operations. The dispensary in the Raira area (Map 14172) would be
upgraded, re-equipped and staffed to become a full Health Center which would
permit the local treatment of many patients who would otherwise have over-
burdened the two main hospitals. Three Dressing Stations in the larger
outlying villages of the Debaira and Sasaraib agricultural sections would
be enlarged and upgraded to Dispensaries, bringing the total number in the
New Halfa Town Council area to nine. Seven new Dressing Stations would be
constructed, equipped and staffed to serve the nomad village areas which
currently have no such facilities. The siting of these Dressing Stations
would be specified and agreed to in the relevant Annual Work Program (para
4.03). The component would also include 18 new sets of primary health care
equipment for use by community health workers in selected villages and nomad
groups, which have constructed a suitable building for use by the community
health worker. Adequate Government staff is available.
3.29      Ten utility vehicles and three lorries would also be provided,
mainly for use in the malaria control program, and three ambulances for
general use in the Project area.
3.30      Operating costs would be provided during the five year Project
implementation period for staffing and running the facilities developed by
the Project and for the vehicles and for the purchase of about 20 t/year of
Malathion for mosquito control and one million tablets per year of anti-malaria
drugs - Chloroquine, Pyrimethamine and Primaquin. Thereafter, the operating
costs would be borne by NHAPC (1980).
3.31      Bilharzia Control (US$0.7 million).  In order 2to improve anti-
bilharzia operations, the Project would provide a 100 m laboratory with
equipment, two utility vehicles and operating costs including incremental
staff, chemicals and drugs (mainly Bayluscide and Metifonate), vehicle
running and training.
3.32      Rural Water (US$1.6 million).  Four new Filter Stations would be
constructed in the nomad villages near agricultural sections 13, 14 and 15
(Map 14172) to replace unserviceable units. The new units would be of the
slow filter type used successfully elsewhere in the Sudan. Each unit would
have a design output of 10 1/sec and comprise a piped inlet from a nearby
canal, gravity operated circular sedimentation, filter and chlorination tanks,
a pumping unit and header tank. Funds would also be provided to renovate and
improve 50 of the existing 53 filter stations in the Project area. The works
would include border fencing, structural repairs, and replacement of pumping
units, and the construction of improved (piped) inlet systems. In order to
improve the operation and maintenance of the filters, the Project would
establish a trained eleven man maintenance team equipped with a utility
vehicle, 5 ton tipper truck and supplies of chlorine, sulphate and maintenance
materials.



- 22 -
Cash Requirements - First Three Projlect Years (US$36.7 million)
3.33      NHAPC (1980) would commence operations with only fixed assets and
a modified Joint Account system of cost sharing, debt and cost recovery. As
a result NHAPC (1980) would have to fund between 2 and 3 full years' opera-
tions before its debt and cost recovery mechanisms produce an excess of cash
inflows over cash outflows. In the first three Project years the excess of
cash outflows over cash inflows is estimated to accumulate to approximately
US$36.7 million. US$23.9 million would be due to the outflows in the first
Project year necessary to provide farm inputs, prepare land, maintain Corpo-
ration staff, provide other services and, in addition pay MOI an estimate of
its costs of supplying irrigation water including the maintenance of the main
supply canals and drainage channels servicing the scheme. During this year
cash inflows would be negligible. The second year's excess of outflows over
inflows of US$7.1 million would be principally due to low tenant repayments
and cotton revenues obtained from the first year's planting (caused by the
small number of hawashas harvested and relatively low cotton yields). These
inflows would be insufficient to offset the outflows required to bring the
second season's crops into production and meet the salaries and expenses of
the Corporation. The third Project year's excess of US$5.7 million would
reflect the increased outflows associated with the increased areas brought
into production (Table 3), and the continuing Corporation costs which would
be only partially offset by cotton revenues and tenant repayments from the
first and second cropping seasons. Cash requirements subdivide into three
categories of expenditure.
3.34      First are the costs of operating the Corporation in providing
agricultural, engineering, and, administrative services to tenants (except for
the Plant Protection Division's expenses which are included in farm inputs).
These Departmental Costs amount to US$11.9 million, US$6.1 million and US$3.0
million (net of applicable NHAPC (1980) inflows) respectively for the first
three Project years.
3.35      Second, working capital is required during the first three Project
years to finance farm inputs including cash advances for labor. Farm input
requirements are estimated to amount to US$8.4 million for seeds, sacks,
fertilizers, insecticides and other items which would have to be acquired
in Project year 1 but which would not be reflected in cash inflows (cotton
revenues) until Project year 2. Thereafter, revenues would provide sufficient
cash inflows to finance farm inputs in each succeeding Project year. Cash
advances to tenants for labor would amount to US$3.3 million in Project year I
decreasing to US$0.8 in Project year 2 when the advances required would be
partially offset by tenant repayments relating to Project year 1. They would
then increase to US$2.6 million in Project year 3 as greater land areas are
brought into production.
3.36      Third, in Project year 1, NHAPC (1980) would commence to pay MOI
for all its costs of supplying irrigation water to the scheme (para 6.02).
But, until cropping season three tenancy incomes would be inadequate for NHAPC
(1980) to recover these through appropriate crop charges -- even in cropping
season three only about two-thirds of all irrigated land is brought through



- 23 -
to harvest (Table 3). The charges levied against tenants in that cropping
season would start to appear as a cash inflow to NHAPC (1980) in March of
Project year 3. However, the net cash outflows associated with this component
in Project years 1 and 2 amounting to US$545,000 would have to be carried by
NHAPC (1980).
C. Project Cost
3.37      Total Project cost is estimated at about US$105.0 million with a
foreign exchange component of about US$51.5 million (49%). Estimated costs
are summarized in Table 4.
3.38      Cost estimates are calculated as at February 1980 and are based
on recent quotations and appraisal estimates. Except for the cash require-
ments a physical contingency of 10% has been provided. In addition, price
escalations for all components have been estimated using international price
inflation percentages, because it is expected that Sudan will experience rapid
domestic inflation accompanied by frequent and sufficient devaluation. Total
contingencies represent 22% of baseline costs using international price
inflation rates of:
1980/81   1981/82   1982/83   1983/84   1984/85
(Year 1) (Year 2) (Year 3) (Year 4) (Year 5)
Equipment and Civil Works      10.5        9          8         7          7
The relatively low percentage of total contingencies in part reflects the
estimated high levels of expenditures in the first three Project years.
Import duties and other taxes estimated at US$10.5 million have been included
in the total Project cost.
3.39      A PPF of US$530,000 has been approved to cover the estimated foreign
exchange costs of (a) a financial consultancy (para. 3.27) (US$130,000--pre-
viously estimated at US$150,000); (b) an internationally recruited procurement
specialist (para. 3.26) for about 9 months (US$80,000, a service which would
continue for 2 years); and (c) spare parts to rehabilitate existing agricul-
tural and canal maintenance machinery and motor vehicles (US$300,000).

D. Proposed Financing
3.40      The Project will be financed in the following amounts and proportions:
-------------------US$ million 1/----------------------
Foreign            % of Total      % of Net
Local Cost  Exchange  Total  Project Cost  Project Cost
IDA                          7.5        32.5     40.0       38             42
IFAD                         5.0        10.0      15.0      14             16
ADF                           1.0        9.0      10.0      10             11
Government                  29.5          -      29.5       28             31
Net Project Cost          43.0        51.5     94.5       90            100%
Government Duties & Taxes  10.5           -       10.5      10
Total Project Cost        53.5        51.5    105.0      100%
3.41      The proposed IDA Credit would be on standard terms to Government.
The financing arrangements would be covered by three legal instruments.
First, the Regulations of NHAPC (1980) and the Tenant's Lease Agreement which
would, inter alia, specify the debt and cost recovery arrangements for goods
and services provided to tenants by NHAPC (1980); second, a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between Government and NHAPC (1980) which would specify that all
Project funds except those for the electro-mechanical equipment and associated
consultancy services would be on-lent to NHAPC (1980) for 20 years with the
capital and accumulated interest (at 9%) to be amortized at 9% over 15 years
from Project year 6; and third, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Government
and PEWC which would specify that Project funds budgeted for electro-mechanical
equipment and associated consultancy services would be onlent to PEWC for 20
years including a grace period of 5 years at a 12% annual interest rate. The
execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements would be conditions of Credit
Effectiveness. NHAPC (1980) would onlend to Farmers Cooperatives US$1.0
million as medium term loans for agriculture machinery against a down payment
(to be determined by the NHAPC (1980) Board) with the balance to be repaid in
not more than five annual installments bearing interest at 12% per annum
(currently loans to farmers are at an interest rate of 7% annually). It would
also onlend about US$30.0 to tenants for farm inputs, agricultural services,
and labor, on terms consistent with the Tenant's Lease Agreement.
3.42      Total Government contributions to the Project before deducting taxes
and duties would amount to US$40.0 million. Assurances were obtained from
Government that an account in the name of the Project would be opened and a
line of credit would be arranged from the Bank of Sudan through this account
of not less than LSd 2.0 million to meet initial Project expenses. Thereafter,
during the execution of the Project, Government would transfer funds to this
account quarterly in accordance with the financing plan and cash flow projec-
tions embodied in the Annual Work Program (para 4.03).
1/   Amounts include contingencies.



- 26 -
3.43      Under a joint financing arrangement IDA would contribute a Credit
of US$40.0 million and IFAD a loan of US$15.0 million equivalent for financing
a part of total expenditure for machinery and equipment, vehicles, spares,
civil works, materials, and technical assistance and consultancy and the
foreign exchange portion of the Corporation's operating costs (Table 5).
IDA's contribution would be on standard terms and IFAD's Loan would be for
50 years and carry a service charge of 1%. The joint IDA/IFAD financing would
consist of 77% foreign exchange and 23% local costs. The local cost financing
is justified since 51% of net Project costs are local costs and the Project
would mainly benefit persons in the absolute and relative poverty income
brackets. Assistance from ADF would be under parallel financing arrangements.
ADF finance would cover part of the expenditures on machinery and equipment
and would consist of 90% foreign exchange and 10% local costs.
E. Procurement
3.44      Items to be financed under the IDA Credit and IFAD Loan would be pro-
cured as follows: contracts exceeding US$100,000 for the supply of machinery
and equipment, vehicles and civil works construction in the Project Headquarters
area would be subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with World Bank guidelines. The items would be aggregated for tenders in
order to attract major contractors and suppliers. Civil works would qualify
for 7-1/2% domestic preference under ICB procurement. The building construc-
tior. program is dispersed and involves the rehabilitation of field workshops
and the construction of new stores and sheds at Section and Block headquarters.
Access is difficult in some areas and these contracts are unlikely to attract
international bids. Accordingly this program would be implemented by NHAPC
(1980) using local competitive bidding (LCB) and where not possible, then by
force account. The largest contract is not expected to exceed US$1.0 million.
The rural water supply works (US$1.4 million) would be carried out by the
Ministry of Energy and Mining which is accustomed to constructing these.
3.45      Contracts for less than US$100,000 and in aggregate totalling no
more than US$500,000 would be procured through LCB in accordance with Govern-
ment of Sudan standard procedures which were reviewed at appraisal and are
acceptable to IDA. Local supplies of equipment and materials would qualify
for 15% domestic preference under ICB procurement. The Gezira Board procures
all the country's fertilizer and pesticides and would procure the requirements
for NHAPC (1980) by ICB in accordance with World Bank guidelines. Procurement
of technical assistance and consultancy services would be done in consultation
with IDA for all Project positions financed out of the IDA Credit. Fuel oil
and lubricants would be purchased through normal local channels. Critical
spare parts would be purchased after consultation with IDA from the sole or
principal manufacturer of the equipment. Other spare parts would be purchased
through competitive bidding. For contracts under US$10,000, comparative
shopping or purchasing off-the-shelf would be used.

F. Disbursement
3.46      The disbursement of the IFAD Loan would be administered by IDA.
The proceeds of the Credit and IFAD's Loan would be disbursed over about six
years according to agreed ratios. Disbursements of funds from the IDA Credit
would be on the following basis:
(a)  100 percent of the foreign expenditures and 70 percent of
local expenditures for civil works (US$11.2 million);
(b)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and 40 percent of
local expenditures for machinery and equipment and spares
(US$9.4 million);
(c)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and 20 percent of
local expenditures for vehicles (US$2.9 million);
(d)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and 25 percent of
local expenditures for insecticides (US$0.5 million);
(e)  100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of
local expenditures for seeds, fertilizers, other farm
inputs (US$6.9 million);
(f)  100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants'
services, health operating costs and NHAPC operating
costs (US$5.9 million).
US$2.7 million equivalent of the proceeds would remain unallocated, and
US$0.5 would be used to repay the PPF.
3.47      Disbursement would be fully documented.  Disbursements for the
health facility and rural water operating costs, and civil works, if under-
taken by force account, would be made against statements of expenditures,
the supporting documents for which would not be submitted for review, but
retained by the Corporation for inspection by IDA supervision missions. The
documents would be audited and the audit report submitted to the Association
within three months of the end of each fiscal year. As strengthened by the
Project the Corporation would have adequate staff and controls for the
preparation of such statements of expenditure. A schedule of estimated
disbursements is shown in Annex 1, Table 5. Any funds remaining in the Credit
Account upon completion of the Project would be available for reallocation
to Project related expenditures at the discretion of IDA.



- 29 -
G. Accounting and Auditing
3.48      NHAPC's provisional, unaudited operating results for 1976/77 and
1977/78 show losses of bSd 1.8 million for fiscal year 1976/77 and bSd 1.13
million for fiscal year 1977/78. The balance sheets at June 30, 1977 and
1978 show Capital and Reserves of bSd 1.61 million and bSd 0.47 million
respectively; these figures are net of accumulated losses of ISd 3.86 million
at June 30, 1977 and iSd 4.99 million at June 30, 1978.  However, the state-
ments are considered unreliable and uninformative. This is indicated by the
negative inventory figures at the'end of each fiscal year; the failure to
provide up to bSd 5.0 million for likely bad debts (which would result in
a negative capital and reserves position); and the stating of fixed asset
costs at net instead of gross figures. An important feature of the recon-
stituting of NHAPC (para. 4.01) and the Financial Consultancy provided by
the Project (para. 3.27) would be that NHAPC's accounts would be wound up
thus permitting the balance sheet of the new Corporation - NHAPC (1980) - to
reflect only the assets and liabilities appropriate to its future operations.
3.49      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) NHAPC (1980) would keep a comprehensive set of accounts for
the Corporation including a separate set of accounts for the
expenditure and recovery of Project funds, that are acceptable
to the Association. The accounts would be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. The
accounts, together with the auditor's report, would be sub-
mitted in English to the Association annually no later than
nine months after the end of each financial year. Its
initial accounts relating to its position at the time it was
established, would be audited and submitted not later than
December 31, 1980.
(b)  NHAPC (1980) would keep separate accounts for the provision
and recovery of seasonal (para 4.18) and medium (para 4.25)
term loans extended to tenants and co-operatives respectively,
and would have them audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Association. The accounts together with
the auditor's report would be submitted in English to the
Association annually no later than three months after the
end of the financial year.
During negotiations the Association discussed with Government the adequacy of
Government auditors to carry out the requirements outlined in this paragraph,
and indicated that, if deemed necessary, Government would be asked to consider
alternative arrangements.



- 30 -
3.50      PEWC would be required to keep separate accounts for the expendi-
ture of Project funds. These separate accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association and copies of the accounts
together with the auditor's report would be submitted in English to the
Association annually no later than nine months after the end of the financial
year. An assurance was obtained to this effect from Government at negotiations.
H. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.51      The Development Planning Unit (para 3.25) would design and implement
a monitoring and evaluation system for the Project. This would detail the
sequence of events of all NHAPC (1980)'s responsibilities to tenants for each
cropping season plus a complete inventory of all scheme and cooperative plant
and equipment together with an assessment of each item's operational status.
It would also prepare a schedule for the implementation of all non-field
operations, the inputs these require and an assessment of the likelihood of
them being on-site, on time. From this the Unit would produce a critical path
network and a series of contingency plans for NHAPC (1980) to consider in the
event that critical deadlines cannot be met. It would be modified on a moving
3-month basis and be partially or completely reworked as necessary against the
arrival of plant and equipment, fuel, other essential supplies, the incidence
of adverse climatic conditions, contractor, tenant and migrant labor performance
and/or availability.
3.52      The Unit would be expected to utilize the results of the Phase II
studies and to build on these with appropriate field surveys to derive an
estimate of the Project's impact on tenant and migrant labor incomes. Then,
using the data so generated, prepare a Phase II project for submission to
NHAPC (1980) on or before the end of the fifth year following credit effec-
tiveness. The Unit would also conduct its own field trials and recommend to
NHAPC (1980) the extent to and times at which the results of its own and the
Phase II studies should be introduced in successive cropping seasons. It
would prepare quarterly reports covering all aspects of its work and a Project
Completion report. The latter would be submitted through NHAPC (1980) to IDA
no later than six months following Project completion.  Government assurances
were obtained that this reporting procedure would be followed.
3.53      In addition the Unit should develop a system through which MOI
water indents can be provided quarterly then updated, as necessary to meet
changing climatic conditions. It should maintain up-to-date inventories of
all serviceable plant and equipment, fuel, fertilizer, and other essential
inputs and develop a system which can provide a weekly up-date on how best
to deploy these resources particularly during periods of peak activity.
It should aim to produce objective data on the time it takes for all field
operations, the cost of operating the workshops, and all other relevant data
required to update and allocate to specific crops all machinery and other
charges levied on tenants -- including the cash advances paid to tenants for
the various cotton and groundnut operations. It should also clearly identify



- 31 -
all NHAPC (1980) costs or overheads not covered by specific crop charge rates
and check that these are being allocated or distributed equitably between
whatever crops are being grown. The above Development Planning Unit work
program would provide the basis on which the Annual Work Program (para 4.03)
including the annual budget and quarterly funding requirements of NHAPC (1980)
would be constructed.
I. Environmental Impact
3.54      Crop Protection.  Pest control by spraying cotton with insecticide
has been practiced extensively in the Sudan for over 30 years, and would be
used in the Project against whitefly, jassid nymphs, aphids, bollworm eggs
and larvae. These are common pests in cotton. All the drugs currently used,
notably Rogon (a dimethoate), Sevin (a carbamate), aldrin, and DDT, are tested
by residue analysis and for compliance with the prescribed specification.
All drugs are also subjected to field te3ts and, if found acceptable, are
registered by the Pesticide Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, which
controls the importation and use of pesticides. Application is normally
carried out by aerial spraying by experienced contractors with well main-
tained equipment, using efficient techniques which minimize drift. The
risk of people in the area being directly contaminated is therefore minimal.
However, the extensive use of pesticides will continue to pose long term
risks until safer alternative drugs become available at suitable costs.
Meanwhile, it would not be profitable to produce cotton without chemical
pest control. An assurance was obtained that all pesticides used in cotton
production would be subjected to rigorous field tests for their environmental
effect and control over their importation and use.
3.55      Human Health.  Since the main vector of malaria in the Project
area, Anophele gambiae, is now resistant to the chlorinated hydrocarbon
group of insecticides, the proposed control campaign would use the relatively
high cost alternative Malathion, coupled with the on-going anti-larval mea-
sures. Neither Malathion nor larvicidal oils present adverse environmental
effects. The use of Bayluscide at focal points in the canal system may
affect fish in the immediate area, but there is no evidence from on-going
operations in the Gezira that its intake in drinking water is harmful to
humans.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
New Halfa Agricultural Production Corporation
4.01      The Corporation would be the main implementing agency, but the
relationships of the parties which exercise control of the scheme would
continue to be determined by the cost recovery and revenue sharing system



- 32 -
specified in the Regulations of the Corporation and the Tenant's Lease Agree-
ment. The Project proposes to modify the existing cost recovery and revenue
sharing system (para. 6.01) but the proposed modifications could be tentative
pending the results of the study to be carried out under the Agricultural
Rehabilitation Program Credit (para. 1.09). Therefore, it is not at present
possible to predict the final relationships between the Corporation and the
Government, and the Corporation and the tenants. Moreover, the nature of the
modifications proposed is such that much of the legislation under which NHAPC
was constituted remained broadly acceptable. However, because the financial
disarray of NHAPC could not be readily rectified, a new Corporation, unencum-
bered by past debts and obligations was necessary.
4.02      Accordingly Government recently established NHAPC (1980) through a
special Establishment Warrant which is generally acceptable to the Association.
In addition Government agreed to issue separate corporate regulations covering
such Project specific matters as the Tenant's Lease Agreement (Schedule A),
the Annual Work Program (para. 4.03), and cost recovery aspects (paras 6.01-
6.07). The main differences between the old and new legal arrangements of
the Corporation are that it would in future (a) operate under its own Board
of Directors instead of a Management Committee and be directly responsible to
the Minister of Agriculture; (b) be empowered on behalf of Government to grant
and administer Lease Agreements which control occupancy, land use, cost and
revenue sharing, the provision of credit, debt and cost recovery. It was
agreed that NHAPC (1980) would only extend services to those tenancies for
which it holds a current, signed Tenant's Lease Agreement. However, Government
would retain the right to instruct the Corporation as to the content of this
lease agreement and thus impose the cost recovery system practiced. A draft
Tenant's Lease Agreement substantially comprising the provisions included in
Schedule A attached has been agreed with the Association. It was further
agreed that neither the NHAPC (1980) Regulations mentioned above, nor the
Tenant's Lease Agreement would be substantially changed without the prior
agreement of the Association.
4.03      It was agreed at negotiations that the principal mechanism for
implementation of the Project would be a detailed Annual Work Program. The
objective would be to facilitate a full annual review of progress in Project
implementation jointly by Government and IDA and to make possible technical,
financial or institutional modifications or adjustments of the Project as
experience is gained. This is particularly important with respect to cost
recovery. Details of the documentation and supporting information each Annual
Work Program shall contain and the criteria upon which the Association's
approval shall be based are presented in Schedule B. Draft Annual Work
Programs would be submitted by NRAPC (1980) to a Project Steering Committee
no later than April 1 each year. Government has confirmed establishment of
this steering committee which is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and
comprises representatives of the Ministries of Finance, National Planning,
Irrigation, NHAPC (1980) and the Bank of Sudan. It is empowered to approve
Annual Work Programs on behalf of the Government for the New Halfa Project.
After review, the committee would submit the program to the Association each
year no later than May 1 and the Association would, within three weeks of



- 33 -
receipt of the proposal, inform the Government and NHAPC (1980) of its accep-
tance or comments. The first work period ending June 30, 1981, would be
submitted to the Association within two months of Effectiveness of the Credit.
Subsequent programs would be submitted by May 1, and cover the year commencing
the following July 1.
4.04       NHAPC (1980) would administer the scheme through its Director
General operating through three departments (Annex 1, Chart 3). Its field
operations would continue to be implemented through six Divisions further
sub-divided into a total of 19 Blocks. NHAPC (1980) would continue to deter-
mine the crop rotation and which crop would be grown in each hawasha and the
agricultural operations to be carried out by tenants and their timing. If
necessary, the Corporation would carry out the operations by force account and
debit the tenants' accounts. It would also continue to provide an agricul-
tural extension and training service focussed for effectiveness at the village
level on the main crops produced in the rotation. Specialized advice would be
provided in horticulture to increase production from the freehold plots (para
2.07). Farm inputs, mainly fertilizer, would be provided by NHAPC (1980), and
aerial spraying for pest control in the cotton crop would be contracted out as
at present and supervised by its Plant Protection Division.
4.05       The Engineering Department, which would play a prominent role in
Project implementation, is well organized and staffed. With the facilities
and equipment provided by the Project it would be capable of operating and
maintaining the additional machinery services required to bring the Project
area into full production. These services would be decentralized progres-
sively as the staff housing and repair facilities are developed by the
Project at each Block headquarters. A typical unit in a Block would comprise
12 serviceable tractors, 3 undergoing maintenance or minor repairs in the
Block workshop, and a suitable range of agricultural implements. The unit
would be managed by the Block Inspector who is responsible to the Manager
of the Agricultural Operations Department for all activities in his Block.
His team of about 90 people would include agricultural, irrigation, clerical,
workshop and general staff who would receive technical direction from their
parent department.
4.06       The Corporation's present Civil Engineering Division has a building
construction capacity of some ESd 500,000 per annum. It would continue under
the Project to construct Field Division and Block Headquarter stores using
local contractors for the supply of materials. It would provide contract
documents using standard designs for the remainder of the building program
which it would contract out and supervise (para 3.44). It would also install
and maintain the new telecommunications system (para 3.22). The Agricultural
Engineering Division would establish and operate the Road Maintenance and
Construction Unit (para 3.16), implement the canal maintenance component (para
3.18) and supervise the initial canal rehabilitation component (para 3.19).
The Ginnery Division would install and operate the delinter provided by the
Project (para 3.23).



- 34 -
4.07      The Chairman/Director General of NHAPC (1980) has been appointed
after consultation with the Association; any subsequent appointments to this
post would be in consultation with IDA. In addition the Corporation would
require assistance with procurement and this would be provided by the Project
(para 3.25). Since efficient and timely procurement is critical to the
success of the Project, an internationally recruited procurement specialist
has been appointed. The appointment of a Financial Controller to NHAPC (1980),
after consultation with the Association would be a condition of credit effec-
tiveness; any subsequent appointments to this post would be in consultation
with IDA.
4.08      The Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) would be responsible through its
Department of Dams for maintaining and operating the Khashm-el-Girba Dam.
It was agreed at negotiations that this responsibility would (a) be carried
out under regulations and arrangements satisfactory to the Association which
would among other things provide for the periodic safety inspection of the
Khashm-el-Girba Dam in accordance with sound engineering practice to determine
whether there are any deficiencies in the condition of the structures or in
the quality and adequacy of maintenance or methods of operations which may
endanger safety; (b) involve the use of consultants (i) whose qualifications
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Associa-
tion; and to (ii) carryout such inspections; (iii) prepare periodic reports
that shall be furnished to the Association with each Annual Work Program;
(iv) specifically describe the action taken by Government relative to the
recommendation provided for in such reports.
4.09      MDI would also be responsible through its Department of Irrigation
Services for operating and maintaining the major, main and minor water supply
canals and the drainage channels servicing the scheme. These functions have
been exercised by MOI on all irrigation schemes in Sudan for many years and
standing instruction on proven procedures are available for their trained
staff to follow. However, problems may arise from inefficiencies in water
management and lack of coordination between irrigation and agricultural staff
and tenants. If these arise they would be addressed by the Technical Assis-
tance Team and appropriate remedial action would be recommended to the
Chairman/Director General. Each problem and the remedial action taken, if
any, would be fully reported in the ensuing Annual Work Program. Any not
satisfactorily resolved would be brought to the attention of the Project
Steering Committee. The Committee's decision would be reported in the
ensuing Annual Work Program and implemented once the Annual Work Program
involved has been accepted by the Association.
4.10      The Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC), which is a
Government owned public utility company, operating throughout the Sudan,
generates electricity using water provided by MOI's engineer at the Dam
and from its diesel generators. It also purchases electricity in emergen-
cies from the sugar factory. PEWC provides power when required by MOI's
engineer to pump water from the reservoir into the main canal and to operate
booster pumps in the canal system, it also distributes power to the Project's
ginneries, New Halfa and Khashm-el-Girba towns, and the flour mill.



- 35 -
4.11      Project performance critically depends on the reliability of water
supplies from the Khashm-el-Girba Dam. During May to August this must be
pumped using power generated by two 3.9 MW Kaplan turbines and three 1.3 MW
diesel generators originally installed in 1964. Two of the generators are
currently unserviceable but there are at the dam the component parts of a new
3 MW generator. The remaining electro-mechanical equipment is also in need
of repair and/or maintenance. It was agreed that PEWC would have all presently
installed electro-mechanical equipment at the dam in good working order by
December 31, 1980 and would have installed the new generator by December 31,
1981. Government currently employs a consultant engineer to the Khashm-el-
Girba Dam. It was also agreed that Government would employ consultants to
(a) supervise getting all electro-mechanical equipment at the dam in good
working order, (b) provide on-the-job training of PEWC staff, and (c) prepare
a detailed future maintenance program for PEWC to follow. In addition the
Government agreed that the qualifications and terms and conditions of employ-
ment of these consultants would be satisfactory to the Association and a
report on the state and use of the electro-mechanical equipment would be
included in each Annual Work Program.
4.12      Local Government Councils (LGC).  The Project Area is served by four
LGCs, namely New Halfa Town Council, New Halfa Rural Council, Khashm-el-Girba
Rural Council and the El Sabaat Rural Council. These councils provide (inter
alia) health services to the Project area under the authority of the Peoples'
Local Government Law 1971 under the direction of the Kassala Province Executive
Council. However, the Project's two health components (general and malaria
control, bilharzia control) would be implemented by NHAPC (1980) and the staff
required would be made available by Government. Assurances to this effect
were obtained from Government.
4.13      The Ministry of Energy and Mining would carry out the new construc-
tion and renovation of existing water filter stations (para 3.32) under
contract to NHAPC (1980). The works would be supervised by NHAPC (1980)'s
Engineering Department which would take them over when completed and would
operate and maintain them.
Staffing and Training
Staffing
4.14      NHAPC (1980) has an establishment for 3,400 posts, of which 2,500
were filled at appraisal. In addition there is a high staff turn-over, but
like other public corporations in the Sudan, there is a strong cadre of well
experienced staff that is capable of developing the Project with a minimum
of external assistance.
Training
4.15      Courses would be held covering the in-field operational and mecha-
nical engineering skills required by tractor and harvester drivers. Other
courses would cover workshop skills. These would be conducted at New Halfa
with the assistance of the Department of Labor's ILO supported Vocational



- 36 -
Training Centre which is located in Khartoum. They would be so structured
and coordinated that newly recruited drivers could, if they wish, eventually
qualify as mechanics.
4.16      Agricultural Field Training would be directed and supervised as
at present by the Agricultural Extension Division which prepares programs
for Block Agricultural Staff to implement mainly through evening classes in
the villages. However, these programs have not been having the required
impact, mainly because farmers are disillusioned by NHAPC's failure to provide
timely and efficient agronomic and irrigation services. As the Corporation's
performance improves under the Project, tenants should become more responsive.
The agriculturalist provided by the Project (para. 3.25) would monitor the
training program's impact and recommend improvements. In addition, three
week courses would be held annually in New Halfa--one for leading farmers,
and one for professional Corporation staff. These would be conducted by
senior Corporation staff and visiting lecturers provided by the Project.
4.17      During negotiations assurances were obtained that a training program
acceptable to the Association would be included in each Annual Work Program.
B. Credit
Seasonal
4.18      Under long established arrangements prevailing in Sudan, tenants
on public irrigation schemes receive loans and advances from the concerned
public corporation. The New Halfa scheme follows this practice. Tenants
thus receive loans in kind for such inputs as fertilizers, seeds and sacks,
for farm cultivation, aerial spraying services and, in the case of cotton,
for collection, processing and marketing (other crops being marketed by
the private sector). In addition tenants receive cash advances for part of
the cost of the recommended labor inputs for specified operations involved
in the cultivation of cotton and groundnut and the harvesting of cotton.
Under the Project these arrangements would continue. Such goods, services
and cash advances are provided directly to the tenant; the loans extended by
the Corporation to cover the cost of these in whole or in part are hereinafter
referred to as "direct" loans.
4.19      In the past the total overhead cost of providing the above goods
and services and cash advances was recovered from the Corporation's share
of cotton revenues. This arrangement has its origins in the ease of recovery
brought about because cotton was (and remains) the only crop marketed through
the Corporation. Although these overheads include costs incurred in providing
cash advances and/or goods and services to crops other than cotton the extent
to which all overheads could be recovered depend on the value of the cotton
crop. Moreover, in the past no attempt was made to determine or recover the
cost of supplying irrigation water. It was agreed at negotiations that under
the Project this cost recovery system would be modified. All overheads,



- 37 -
including the costs which the Corporation has to incur to re-establish itself
(i.e. mainly as represented by the Corporation's cash requirements for the
first three years), all other Project costs excluding the health component,
and the cost of supplying irrigation water would be identified, realistically
costed, and equitably allocated to each crop. It was further agreed that
these costs constitute "indirect" loans to tenants that should be eventually
recovered.
4.20      The principle of allocating direct loans to crops and recovering
these from tenants is already strongly established. Unit costings already
exist. The crop to which each should be allocated, and the time each good,
service or cash advance is actually supplied to the tenant can be readily
identified. The same is not true for indirect loans. Appropriate data on
which to base unit costings does not currently exist. Some can only be
determined ex-post and the precise times at which others are actually sup-
plied to the tenant is obscure. It was therefore agreed at negotiations
that the value of indirect loans should be determined retrospectively on an
annual basis and that the most appropriate time to make this determination
would be as at March 1 each year. Accordingly, it was agreed that: (a) all
direct loans would be charged to the relevant individual crop account of each
tenant at the time a specified good, service and/or cash advance was supplied;
(b) all indirect loans to be recovered with respect to a particular year would
be charged to the relevant individual crop account of a tenant as at March 1
and fall due for payment March 31 of the same year.
4.21      The tenant receives the proceeds from wheat production around March,
from groundnut production between January and April, and from fodder crop
anytime from October through April. Cotton would be harvested from October
through March, but cotton marketing is more protracted. The Corporation
could expect to receive the first proceeds from cotton lint sales as early
as the following May and the last perhaps by December so that after finaliz-
ing its cotton accounts it would be in a position to settle with individual
tenants in the following March (it has taken longer in the past), some 12
months after tenants delivered their seed cotton to the Corporation's cotton
collecting centers.
4.22      Accordingly, it was agreed at negotiations, that:  (a) the recovery
of indirect loans would be geared to the average tenant's ability to meet
these charges from net tenancy cash flows; (b) all direct loans would fall
due for payment in the March 1 through June 30 period 12 months after the
concerned crops were harvested; (c) interest at 12% annually would be
charged monthly on all outstanding crop account balances; (d) the indirect
loans relating to the twelve month period ending March 1, 1981 would form the
basis for determining an upper limit to the initial Tenant's Lease Agreement
signing fee (Schedule A) and a lower limit would be determined relative to
the average tenancy's net cash inflow; (e) tenants would be required to report
in person to Block level accountants to pay this initial signing fee in cash;
(f) the Corporation would continue to open a separate individual crop account
for each crop grown by each tenant, and new General and Individual Joint
Accounts for cotton each cropping season which would commence with the first
direct loan made for any one of the crops to be grown in a particular year to
June 30 of the year following the harvest of these crops and span a period of
about 32 months.



- 38 -
4.23      The ability of the Corporation to recover its direct and indirect
loans is crucial to its future financial viability. To this end it was
agreed at negotiations to set up a special unit, the Tenant's Credit Unit
(TCU) which would each month commencing March 1, 1981, receive from the
Corporation's Financial Controller a list showing the outstanding balance
on each tenant's individual crop account for each crop. Tenant's unable to
meet their indirect loan repayments during March each year would be referred
by the Block level accountants to the TCU for extended financing. Any who,
in the opinion of the TCU, are not eligible for such extended financing would
be denied access to further Corporation services and TCU would be responsible
for identifying and providing a list of these tenants through the head of the
Agricultural Operations to the relevant Section and Block level staff for
implementation. This procedure basically removes the decision making aspect
of this problem from the relevant Section and Block level staff to a level at
which tenant/field level Corporation staff relationships should not be impaired.
However, in making its decision the TCU if it so desires would be empowered to
call for reports on the concerned tenant(s) from the relevant Corporation
staff. It would also be empowered to form and call for similar reports from
ad hoc tenant committees. Remedies of NHAPC (1980) include written warning,
fines, forfeiture of standing crops, termination of the Tenant's Lease Agree-
ment and eviction from the tenancy.
4.24      Under the Project the first direct loans would fall due for payment
on March 1, 1982 and become outstanding as of July 1, 1982. By this time the
TCU would have been in operation over 12 months and its procedures and cri-
teria for assessing eligibility for extended financing, recognizing persistent
default, and the circumstances under which it proceeds to implement remedial
action should be reasonably well established and known to all tenants. In
addition, Section and Block level staff should be instructed to (a) peruse
their books and pre-identify which tenants could have difficulty in meeting
direct and indirect loan repayments due in the following March - June period,
and (b) approach these tenants to ensure they are aware of their obligations
and options under the revised Tenant's Lease Agreements. Such pre-identifica-
tion would be done independently of the TCU and based purely on the outstanding
direct and indirect loans on that tenant's individual crop accounts vis-a-vis
that tenant's deliveries of seed cotton to the Corporation all of which data
would be available at Block level. Once the TCU receives the June 30 lists
for each year from the Corporation's Financial Controller, it would assume
responsibility for the collection of any due and outstanding tenant debt for
that cropping season. This would enable the Corporation's Finance Division
to close its accounts for that season as of June 30 each year. However, its
Block level accountants would continue to be used by the TCU to receive any
tenant payments and fines that are not overdue relative to any extended
financing programs or impositions set up with tenant(s) by the TCU. In
addition the TCU would assume the responsibility of providing the Chairman/
Director General and hence the Board and Financial Controller with monthly
data relating to the volume of extended financing approved, the quantitative
implications this has on the anticipated repayment of bad debt and an explicit
statement on the need to realize bad debt. It was agreed at negotiations



- 39 -
that (a) the Corporation would engage consultants whose qualifications and
terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Association
not later than September 1, 1980 to help establish the TCU and thereafter
advise on its procedures and practices in a consultancy role. In particular,
this consultancy would, prior to January 31, 1981, specify in a form suitable
for inclusion in the Tenant's Lease Agreement, the precise debt recovery
procedures that should be followed, the criteria on which the provision of
extended financing should be based, the criteria on which persistent default
should be assessed, and the sanctions that should be applied; (b) the TCU
would be set up and staffed no later than January 31, 1981 by personnel
selected from the Corporation's existing Finance Division or as otherwise
appropriate; and (c) that the responsibilities, activities, and effectiveness
of the TCU along with any intended modifications to its operations in the
ensuing year, would be fully reviewed and/or presented in each Annual Work
Program.
Medium Term
4.25      Up to US$1.04 million has been included in the US$12.6 million
agricultural machinery component (Table 4) for the purchase of replacement
tractors, disc harrows and ridgers for the cooperatives. These items would
be provided to the Cooperatives on credit terms and conditions similar to
those used by the Agricultural Bank of Sudan, namely a cash down payment
equal to a percentage to be decided by the Board of Directors of the price of
such machinery, and repayment in not more than five annual installments; the
interest rate would be not less than 12% per annum. The borrower would pledge
its members' crops and/or give NHAPC (1980) a lien over its existing assets
sufficient to meet the value of the loan. TCU would carry out the technical
and financial appraisal of the applicant and loans would only be granted on
the approval of NHAPC (1980)'s Board of Directors. Government assurances to
the above were obtained at negotiations. This operation would be accounted
and audited separately from NHAPC (1980)'s main accounts (para 3.49 (b)).
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
A. Production
5.01      Full production from Project interventions would be achieved in
cropping season 5. This would be harvested October - March 1984/85 when a
total seed cotton output of 100,000 t is expected of which 82,500 t would
be incremental. At the same time some 130,000 t of groundnut is expected
(98,500 t incremental) and wheat output is budgeted to peak at 44,000 t
(31,300 t incremental). Fodder production, in the absence of a better sub-
stitute for wheat, is budgeted to have risen to 36,000 t of which 31,000 t
would be incremental (Table 6). The yield estimates (Table 6) on which these
output data are based relate to harvested areas (Table 3). The high percentage
increases mainly reflect the low average base yields being realized at present
(Table 1). Projected future yields can be considered conservative, and they
are already being achieved by the best of tenants.

B. Marketing
5.02      NHAPC (1980) would be responsible for cotton processing and market-
ing from the time tenants deliver raw seed cotton to the cotton collection
centres in the field, until it has been processed and accepted by buyers.
Saleable outputs are cotton lint, cotton seed, scarto (waste cotton) and
used sacks. All cotton lint is sold through CPC - the GOS's only cotton
marketing agency, and NHAPC receives a "delivered CPC, Port Sudan warehouse
price." Lint is stored in NHAPC warehouses until rail wagons are available.
The facilities to store both are adequate. Cotton seed not retained for
sowing or sale as seed to other schemes, is sold to oil seed mills at a
"delivered" price determined by SOC. Scarto is sold ex-ginnery to a whole
range of buyers. Used sacks are sold to tenants.
5.03      Each year some groundnuts are retained by tenants for seed.  The
remainder are typically sold at auction to private merchants (some 80%), the
SOC, and the New Halfa oil seed mills. The SOC sets a minimum price at which
it will enter the market. By refusing to match or exceed this price the
private merchants can and do remove themselves as effective buyers. Once,
in 1974/75, NHAPC marketed the entire groundnut crop, but the intervention
was not a success. In addition, some groundnuts are sold to or bartered with
unidentified traders - presumably to avoid local taxes, probably at lower
prices, and most likely by tenants in need of cash. The private merchants
buy by weight at the New Halfa auction where tenants deliver a bagged product
usually on trucks. The individual weighing of sacks, supervised by government
officials, creates a bottleneck and the Project would install a weighbridge to
overcome this. Private merchants decorticate, rebag and rail or road haul the



- 41 -
shelled nuts to Khartoum or Port Sudan at their risk and cost. Their delivered
prices are fixed by SOC. The operation appears efficient, free of excessive
profit taking, and adequate to meet the needs of the Project.
5.04       Reliable data on the distribution of wheat produced by the scheme
is limited. Estimates suggest 15 to 25% of production enters the unofficial
market, 40 to 50% goes to the official market (the New Halfa flour mill),
20 to 30% is retained for consumption and about 10% is retained for seed.
The official flour-mill-door price of 1Sd 124/t is consistent with the current
export parity price of wheat of similar quality but the flour mill only pays
ESd 54.41/t. The balance is made up by a Government subsidy. The milling
capacity of the New Halfa flour mill exceeds the present ability of the scheme
to supply. The difference is made up by imports. Storage is limited and at
harvest the flour mill rents houses, rooms and sheds. However, this is not
an overriding constraint, and can be overcome by the flour mill without Project
assistance.
5.05       There is a strong within scheme demand for fodder--mainly for
tenant (nomad) owned livestock. The number of livestock allowed on a per-
manent basis is restricted. Policing is difficult and large numbers do enter
the irrigated area to graze-off harvested or abandoned hawashas. As the area
of irrigated wheat declines this policing will become even more difficult.
Unused land will produce volunteer plant (mainly weeds) growth. Rainfed
sorghum is a possible alternative but it has several diseases common to sugar
and at present GOS is not prepared to endorse its use. Plant growth for
fodder is attractive to tenants (para. 2.34). Consequently, a rainfed fodder
crop has been adopted by the Project as the only immediately available alter-
native to wheat pending the results of the consultant's Phase II studies which
should be available by mid-1980 (para 2.37).
C. Prices
5.06       Cotton and groundnut are Sudan's major source of foreign exchange.
International demand for both is firm. Sudan is a price-taker for the medium
staple variety of cotton produced under the Project and the extra production
can be absorbed in international markets without price effects. In fact
prices for this variety have increased during the last few months and in the
longer term real cotton prices can be expected to continue to rise gradually
for a number of reasons including increases in the price of petroleum based
feedstocks for competing man-made fibres. Wheat and flour are imported.
Local demand from urban areas and the halfawyeen are strong and rising and
should readily absorb anticipated production. All fodder produced should be
entirely consumed within the Project area. However, price data is limited
and the only local source of information comes from the trading (bartering)
of groundnut threshings between tenants.



- 42 -
5.07       The economic analysis is therefore based on export parity prices
for cotton and groundnut. Import parity prices are used for wheat. All of
these have been derived from IBRD forecasts expressed in constant 1980/81
prices but fodder has been valued at a financial farm gate price of bSd 4/t
converted to a border price equivalent.
5.08       The financial analysis uses recent farm gate prices escalated to
1980/81 levels. The resultant 1980/81 financial prices (Project year 1) are
consistent with the relevant export (cotton and groundnut) and import (wheat)
parity prices derived using the IBRD commodity price forecasts in constant
1980/81 values. In all subsequent years the financial prices used reflect
any real changes in the relevant IBRD price series. However, all fodder
produced is valued at iSd 4/t throughout the 20 year life of the Project.

VI. COST RECOVERY AND FINANCIAL IMPACT
A. Cost Recovery
6.01      The concept of loans under the Project combines the value of all
goods, services, and cash that are provided directly to the individual tenant
(para 4.18), with an apportionment of overhead costs and general services
extended by the Corporation (para 4.19). This chapter focusses on the present
content, absolute magnitude, or.igin, and recovery of these loans, and how
these would need to be changed under the Project in order to:
(a) effect full cost recovery - excluding the health components;
(b) ensure the full cost of producing each crop would be charged
against that crop or, in the case of cotton, charged against
revenues generated by that crop;
(c) increase tenant incentive to grow cotton by increasing the
overall tenant's share of cotton revenues by whatever amount
needs to be reallocated in order to ensure cotton revenues
are only used to meet cotton costs;
(d) gear the introduction of whatever increased tenant charges
result to the ability of the average tenant to repay -- which
will be dependent on the rate at which the scheme is brought
back into production and yields can be increased.

Full Cost Recovery
6.02      Under the Project the scope of the existing cost recovery mechanism
would need to be expanded in four areas in order to effect full cost recovery.
First, the unit costings used to value all goods, services and cash loans
extended directly to tenants need to be revised to ensure they fully reflect
their actual cost to the Corporation. The expertise to do this, and derive
new unit costings for all future agriculture practices is provided by the
Project.  Second, the full cost of supplying irrigation water to each crop
according to use would need to be determined and charged.  These would include,
(a) MOI's costs of maintaining and operating the Khashm-el-Girba Dam and all
major, main and minor supply canals, and all drainage channels servicing the
scheme, and (b) all Project costs associated with the initial rehabilitation
of the Abu Ishreens, and the procurement of canal maintenance equipment--
including an appropriate allocation of workshop and fuel storage Project
costs, plus the actual cost to the Corporation of operating the canal main-
tenance machinery. Since the actual costs of the MOI services to NHAPC are
unknown an assurance was obtained at negotiation that these would be deter-
mined and the results reported in the Annual Work Program to be submitted to
the Association no later than May 1, 1982 and promulgated to tenants for the
year ending March 1, 1983. In the meantime, and in the absence of any better
information, these costs would be included at the provisional figure of
ESd 300,000 per annum and assurances to this effect were obtained at negotia-
tions.  Third, a crop charge to recover Project costs that have not already
been recovered through specific charge rates would need-to be introduced.
Such costs would include, motor vehicles, road making and maintenance equipment
(both increased by an appropriate allocation of workshop, and for the latter,
fuel storage, Project costs), road improvements, buildings, telecommunications,
training and technical assistance, and consultancy. Fourth, an additional
crop charge would be required to recover the cash requirements of the Corpora-
tion in the first three Project years i.e. until NHAPC (1980)'s cash inflows
exceed its cash outflows which is estimated to occur in Project year 4.
Reallocation of Overheads
6.03      To ensure all crops bear their full cost of production and cotton
revenues are used exclusively to meet cotton costs means that portion of
the indirect costs which are attributable to crops other than cotton must
be reallocated -- away from cotton towards groundnut, wheat, and fodder crop.
Such costs were previously met from the Corporation's share of cotton revenues.
Based on available records the absolute magnitude of the reallocation required
is estimated at approximately ISd 1.92 million annually or 40% of the total
indirect costs recorded. Under the Project it is proposed that this bSd 1.92
million be reallocated from cotton to groundnut, wheat and fodder crop. In
addition, it is proposed that the cost of all land levelling and deep plowing
(para 3.05) be allocated equally between cotton, groundnut and wheat -- at
present it is charged exclusively to cotton.

Tenant Incentive to Grow Cotton
6.04      The hSd 1.92 million that the Project proposes to reallocate away
from cotton to groundnut, wheat, and fodder crop will appear as an indirect
charge that tenants will have to settle in cash along with all their other
groundnut, wheat, and fodder crop charges. Prior to the reallocation they
would have been met from the Corporation's share of cotton revenues. Thus,
an equal and opposite reallocation is required to avoid disadvantaging tenants
vis-a-vis the Corporation relative to the existing cost-revenue sharing
arrangements. The Project proposes to do this by adding to the overall
tenants' share of cotton receipts whatever absolute amounts are reallocated
under para 6.03. The effect of this would be to increase the tenant's price
for cotton which will continue to be derived by dividing the tenants' share of
cotton revenues by the total number of kantars of seed cotton delivered to the
Corporation. The combined effect of the reallocations and subsequent adding
back will remove the skewed effects of the existing mechanism. Moreover, the
ability of the modifications to effect full cost recovery pro-rata by crop
will ensure all crops bear their full cost of production. However, because
the tenant's price for cotton will continue to be derived by averaging a
portion of all cotton revenues the proposed modifications assist, but stop
short (para 6.11) of fully reflecting the profitability of cotton in tenancy
incomes vis-a-vis groundnut, wheat, and fodder crop. The only way this can be
done is to either abandon the cost-revenue sharing aspects of the mechanism or
devise a more appropriate cost-revenue sharing relationship. Although both of
these approaches are beyond the scope of this Project, they will be examined
within the context of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program Credit Study,
the results of which could form the basis for a revised cost recovery system
for New Half a (para 1 .09).
Introduction of Increased Tenant Charges
6.05      Tenancy cash flows would not be significantly increased by Project
intervention until the crop proceeds from the third cropping season are
realized i.e. in October to April 1982 (fodder crop), January to April 1983,
(groundnut and wheat), and March to June 1984 (cotton). Accordingly, as of
March 1981 and March 1982 the Project proposes to identify as an indirect cost
only the continuation of an existing cost that the Corporation charges for
maintaining the Abu Ishreens. It does, however, propose to reallocate that
portion of the deep plowing and land-levelling costs that were previously
borne exclusively by cotton but these would appear as an additional direct
cost against groundnut and wheat. Both of these modifications would use
existing unit costings and although the total charges to tenants would rise
marginally this would be partially offset by a corresponding increase in the
tenant's share of cotton receipts equal to one-sixth of the scheme-wide cost
of deep plowing and land levelling. All direct costs that would fall due for
payment in the March to June period of Project year 2 (1981/82) and 3 (1982/83)
and relate to cropping seasons I and 2 respectively, would continue to be
based on existing unit costings.

6.06      In and from cropping season 3, however, the value of all direct
and indirect loans would be based on actual costs. The value of the direct
loans supplied in cropping season 3 would fall due for payment in March to
June 1985. The value of the indirect loans for cropping season 3 would fall
due for payment in March 1984. In cropping seasons 3 through 5 indirect
loans would include: the full cost of supplying irrigation water; a crop
charge to recover all Project costs (except the cost of the health components)
not already recovered through the specific unit costings used to value direct
loans; and all reallocations other than deep plowing and land-levelling. Then,
in Project year 6 and after, the cash requirements of the Corporation would
be accumulated and introduced as an additional indirect loan (amortized at
12% per annum over 15 years).  These modifications would increase both total
charges to the average tenant against groundnut, wheat and fodder crop and
increase the tenant's price for cotton.  The overall effect is as summarized
below:

6.07      It was agreed that NHAPC (1980) would recover the cost of all goods,
services and credit provided to tenants in accordance with the principles set
out in Schedule C attached. It was further agreed that NHAPC (1980) would
ensure that the Tenant's Lease Agreement, including an annual credit and
service contract specifying the cost recovery mechanism is entered into and
kept current with each tenant.
B. Financial Impact
Tenancies
6.08      In cropping season 1 (March 1980 - June 1982) and 2 (March 1981 -
June 1983) NHAPC (1980) will only command the resources to prepare about
50% of the land available for production. Of this only about 80% is budgeted
to be brought through to harvest. It is anticipated that these percentages
would be 95% and 80% respectively in cropping season 3 and average 100% and
90% in cropping season 5 and after (Table 3). Hence, during Project imple-
mentation an individual tenancy could be growing no crops at all, or any
combination of cotton, groundnut, wheat and/or fodder crop -- a total of 13
different combinations. The choice will be primarily determined by the way
in which NHAPC (1980) deploys its available resources. This will be largely
beyond the individual tenant's control. In future cropping seasons the stored
water for wheat production and the extent to which tenants want to participate
in fodder crop production as a substitute for wheat adds further variation.
To accommodate this changing land use base a hypothetical "average" tenancy
budget is constructed that reflects the land use projected for the scheme as
a whole in terms of a single three hawasha (15 fd) tenancy growing cotton,
groundnut (portion hand, portion mechanically harvested), wheat, and fodder
crop. The areas of each crop prepared and brought through to harvest in
each cropping season therefore equals the Project Crop Area data of Table 3
divided by 22,000. ,
6.09      Using the yields and prices stated in Chapter V average tenancy
results each cropping season would be as shown in Table 7. However, although
each cropping season spans more than one Project year the tenant sells his
own groundnut, wheat and fodder crop at the times these are harvested (para.
2.24). Hence, the data shown in Table 7 bears little relationship to tenant
liquidity and ability to repay. If restated on a cash flow basis relative to
Project proposals for loan repayments the average tenant's ability to repay
would appear as follows:

6.10      Despite the excess of cash inflows over cash outflows, high provi-
sions for bad debt (50% and 25% respectively) have been budgeted for Project
years 1 and 2. This is because it would take time to establish the TCU, and
ensure the Corporation holds signed current lease agreements for all tenancies.
Once this is done and all 22,000 tenancies are operating under current lease
agreements the provision for bad debt has been reduced. It is assumed this
would be possible by March 1982. Accordingly the need to provide for bad
debts on all loans falling due for repayment in March 1983 and after should be
minimal and have been provided for at 5%.
NHAPC (1980) Cash Flow (Annex I, Table 7)
6.11      Under the Project NHAPC (1980) would first realize an excess of
cash inflows over outflows in Project year 4. This surplus together with one
generated in Project year 5 would total US$97.0 million. Debt servicing would
commence in year 6 so that the total Project Investments (compounded at 9%
annually until year 6) would be repaid over 15 years bearing an annual interest
rate of 9%. Grace periods of principal and interest would be required until
debt servicing commenced. In and after year 6 the excess of cash inflows over
outflows would approximate on average US$55 million annually. The cumulative
excess would total US$327 million over the first ten years. This is a direct
reflection of the cost recovery and revenue sharing mechanism practiced, as
well as Sudan's present dual exchange rate in which cotton revenues in United
States dollar terms are reflected at an exchange rate of 6Sd I to US$2.00
while most outflows are converted at an exchange rate of bSd 1 to US$1.25.
The magnitude of the excess is a clear indication of the extent to which both
the Corporation's share of cotton revenues exceeds its cash requirements and
the extent to which the cost and revenue sharing mechanism and exchange rate
policy falls short of permitting the profitability of cotton to appear in
tenancy earnings. The above figures therefore reflect an interim outcome
before any changes that might be made as a result of, first, the findings of
the cost recovery and tenant charge systems study to be carried out under
the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program Credit, and second, the discussions
between the Government and the IMF on the Country's future exchange rate
policy.

Government's Cash Flow (Annex I, Table 8)
6.12      Government's cash outflow in the with Project situation comprises
its contribution to Project costs, import taxes foregone through the increased
wheat production which the Project would generate, and debt servdice repayments
on borrowings. Government cash inflows are made up of revenues from import
taxes on Project and non-incremental Project related investments, income taxes
on salaries and wages, and debt service receipts from NHAPC (1980). Over the
twenty year life of the Project total cash inflows are estimated at about
US$488 million and outflows at US$57 million giving a surplus of some US$431
million. The cash flow is however negative for the first three years of the
Project to the extent of about US$19 million and a cumulative surplus is only
achieved in year six.
6.13      In the event that the Project was not implemented, it is assumed
that Government would in some way have attempted to continue with the New
Halfa scheme on its present basis. This however would have resulted in
further losses, mainly in respect of continuing operating losses of NHAPC at
the rate of US$3-4 million annually (partly offset by inflows). The with
Project cash flow therefore has to be netted off against the negative cash
flow of the without Project situation. Over the twenty year life of the
Project the surplus is thus increased to some US$462 million and the negative
cash flow over the first three years of the Project's life reduced to US$15
million (US$11 million in year one, US$4 million in year two and zero in
year three). The net effect of Government's cash flow over the five years
of Project's life is estimated to be positive to the extent of US$3 million.
6.14      Government contributions to Project (Annex I, Table 8) would all
be in local currency. However, a further Government contribution of both
foreign and local currency would be required to cover on-going costs of the
scheme that could not be included in the Project costs. The total Government
contributions in (current US$ million) are as follows:

The foreign currency requirements would be for imported farm inputs and
operating cost items. From Project year 2 on these requirements would be
met from cotton proceeds.
VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The proposed Project would raise yields, bring 173,000 fd of cur-
rently uncropped irrigable land into production, create an additional annual
demand for labor of 5.6 million mandays, and generate additional foreign
exchange from the incremental production of cotton and groundnuts. Improved
scheme, water and crop management should ensure more efficient utilization of
the dwindling supply of water available for irrigation. Average tenancy cash
returns would rise from hSd 60 in cropping season 1 to about 3Sd 500 in
cropping season 6--after paying all family and hired labor and repaying all
loans extended by the Corporation. The major primary Project beneficiaries
would be the tenants, the Corporation and the Government. Major secondary
Project beneficiaries would be the labor paid by tenants, the private ground-
nut merchants, the cooperatives and their staff, and the population of New
Halfa. At full development (para 7.06) benefits accumulating to expatriate
consultants would have amounted to US$1.4 million (constant 1980/81 values).
Over the same period it is estimated that the benefits accruing to the
tenants, and the labor paid by tenants, would have accumulated as follows:
---------------Cropping Season---------------
1-6
1                  6           Accumulated
-------US$ Million (Constant 1980/81)--------
Paid farm labor                     1                  9                 35
Tenancy returns                     2                   7                30
Approximately US$5 million of the US$9 million benefit accruing annually to
paid labor at full development would be earned by the 50,000 migrant labor
population -- an average annual per capita cash earning of US$100. The
US$4 million balance would accrue to the 216,000 tenant population and is
additional to the US$7 million tenancy returns. The resultant total of US$11
million tenant benefit implies an average annual per capita cash earning of
about US$51. On average about 0.5 mandays of tenant labor would be required
each day throughout the year, ranging in specific months from about 0.1 to a
peak of 2.0. This should leave sufficient tenant labor for tenants to meet
the demands of their alternative employment opportunities without jeopardizing
the diligence with which the Project assumes they will work their tenancies.
7.02      Benefits.  Expected future yield and production with and without
the Project are discussed in Chapter V along with output prices. The economic
values so derived are in constant 1980/81 border prices and have been lagged
according to the time these would be received by the Project. In addition,
since the Project is assumed to terminate at the end of cropping season 20, in
Project years 21 through 22, loans extended to tenants in the preceeding years
are recovered, together with an estimate of the realizable value of residual
assets. Incremental production costs (in financial prices) for the Project
as a whole have been adjusted according to the times actual outlays would be



- 51 -
incurred then expressed on a Project year basis before being converted to
border prices to derive the economic cash flow. A summary is shown in Annex I,
Table 9.
7.03      Border Prices.  Both the official (US$1 = 3Sd 0.5) and parallel
(US$1 = iSd 0.8) rates of exchange overstate the value of domestic currency
to the country.  To adjust for this all local cost components of all incre-
mental investments were first expressed in United States dollar equivalents
using the parallel exchange rate and then converted to border prices using
a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.7. This SCF equals the parallel rate
divided by the shadow exchange rate of US$1 = bSd 1.15.
7.04      Farm Labor.  The absolute demand for farm labor would rise to
about 9 million man days per year. This is physically available from exist-
ing tenant and migrant labor populations but the supply would be dependent on
the wage rate(s) offered. Currently, the estimated average annual seasonal
market wage rate is about iSd 0.8 and ranges from bSd 0.6 to TSd 1.  The
mobility of the migrant labor force and the availability of off-farm employ-
ment for tenant labor limit extreme seasonal movement and suggests Project
demands for labor would be met provided the Project can pay an average finan-
cial daily wage rate equal to that paid to unskilled labor elsewhere in
Sudan. Therefore, the financial and economic price of labor is identical.
At the time of appraisal this was about ESd 0.8 and under pressure. A finan-
cial rate of bSd 1 is therefore assumed for 1980/81. This converts to an
economic (border price) of US$0.875 (para 7.03).
7.05      Incremental.Investments.  Project intervention is focussed on reha-
bilitating the Corporation which in recent years has lacked the physical and
financial resources to meet its responsibilities to tenants on time and to
standard. The incremental investment required to rectify the lack of physical
resources can be clearly identified and corresponds to all the direct invest-
ments listed in Table 4 except the cash requirement component. The incre-
mental investment needed to correct the lack of financial resources is esti-
mated on the assumption that the Corporation would only be funded in 1980/81
(Project year 1) to a level commensurate with the funding received in the
preceding two years. This should be sufficient to enable the Corporation to
prepare the 167,000 fd (33,400 haws) assumed for 1980/81, and adequate to
allow 132,000 fd (26,400 haws) to be brought through the harvest. On this
basis, the total demand for hired and tenant farm labor should be about the
same in both the year 1 with and without Project situation. All the incre-
mental irrigation costs are embraced in the operating costs of the Corporation
and do not include the fixed cost of the transfer payment to MOI (para 3.36).
7.06      Development Period.  According to the Project implementation schedule,
all 330,000 fd would be cropped in the third cropping season. However, it is
not until cropping season 5 that both the yields and areas brought through to
harvest are assumed to reach full development levels. Thereafter, the only
changes in incremental benefits that would appear, arise from either projected
real changes in commodity prices (Annex 1, Table 6), and/or the gradual substi-
tution of rainfed fodder crop for wheat. The Project would therefore reach
full development in Project year 5 (1984/85).



- 52 -
7.07      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  Production could continue beyond
2,003 (Project year 24) when the availability of stored water for wheat would
have declined to zero (Annex 1, Table 2). Sedimentation (para 2.11), however,
would continue and eventually force a reduction in the areas of cotton and
groundnut it would be possible to grow. There are many alternative courses
of action that could be followed beyond 2,003. However, to avoid speculating
on insufficient data a 20-year Project life has been assumed. Similarly,
within this 20 year Project life, the analysis assumes rainfed fodder crops
would be the sole substitute for wheat despite the expectation that a better
alternative would be indentified (para 2.37). Under the foregoing assumptions,
the resultant cost-benefit streams (Case 1, Annex 1, Table 9) produce an ERR
of 75%. This reflects the existence of sunk costs, the ability to increase
irrigated cropping intensity from 48% to 87%, and more than double physical
output by the end of cropping season 5.
7.08      Risks.  Start-up, debt and cost recovery problems, and an inability
to realize budgeted yields are identified as major risks. Although all may
occur independently, they could be causally linked through, for example,
the inability of Government to meet its incremental and non-incremental
(para 6.14) funding contributions and/or a slower tenant response than anti-
cipated. Aspects of the Project which are specifically geared to minimize
these risks include the use of the PPF, a Project Account, the Annual Wcrk
Program and modified NHAPC (1980) constitution and Tenant's Lease Agreement.
The establishment and maintenance of the TCU -- including recourse to ad
hoc tenant committees and independent sources of professional advice should
under-pin effective debt and cost recovery. In addition, the Project attempts
to solicit the level of tenant participation assumed by gearing all cash
advances for farm labor to the going market wage rate and recomnended levels
of labor input, and linking the introduction of all cost recovery charges
from tenants to the anticipated increase in tenancy cash returns. With these
innovations/modifications the Project could achieve its budgeted objectives,
but its major risks although minimized would not be eliminated. Accordingly
the sensitivity of the ERR was tested. First, (Case 2) by delaying the
realization of budgeted benefits by one year, giving an ERR of 50%. Second,
(Case 3) by reducing benefits by 25% and increasing costs by 25% giving an
ERR of 45%. Third, (Case 4) by delaying benefits by 1 year, redlucing benefits
by 25%, and increasing costs by 25% giving an ERR of 30%. Whilst risks of
this order of magnitude might be expected, they do not destroy the economic
viability of the Project.
VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations the Government gave the following principal
assurances:
(i) NHAPC (1980) would employ an agricultural economist, an
agriculturalist, a water management specialist, and a
financial advisor after consultation with IDA (para. 3.26).



- 53 -

(vi) NHAPC (1980) would keep a comprehensive set of accounts
for the Corporation including a separate set of accounts
for the expenditure and recovery of Project funds, that are
acceptable to the Association. The accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
The accounts, together with the auditor's report, *would be
submitted in En lish to the Association annually no later
than nine months after the end of each financial year.  Its
initial accounts relating to its position at the time it was
established, would be audited and submitted not later than
December 31, 1980 (para. 3.49 (a)).
(vii) NHAPC (1980) would keep separate accounts for the provision
and recovery of seasonal and medium term loans extended to
tenants and cooperatives respectively, and would have them
audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the
Association. The accounts together with the auditor's report
would be submitted in English to the Association annually no
later than three months after the end of the financial year
(para. 3.49 (b)).
(viii) PEWC would be required to keep separate accounts for the
expenditure of Project funds. These separate accounts would
be audited annually .by indepenrdent auditors acceptable to
the Association and copies of the accounts together with the
auditor's report would be submitted in English to the Associa-
tion annually no later than nine months after the end of the
financial year (para. 3.50).

(ix) All pesticides used in cotton production would be subjected
to rigorous field tests for their environmental effect and
control over their importation and use (para. 3.54).
(x) Government would issue separate Corporate Regulations for
NHAPC (1980) including a Tenant's Lease Agreement, an
Annual Work Program and provisions for cost recovery
(para 4.02);

Controller of NHAPC (1980) fall vacant, any subsequent
appointments would be in consultation with the Association
(para. 4.07).
(xiii)  PEWC would have all electro-mechanical equipment presently
installed at the Khashm-el-Girba Dam in good working order
by December 31, 1980 and would have installed the new
3 MW generator by December 31, 1981 (para. 4.11).
(xiv)  PEWC would employ consultants to supervision getting all
the electro-mechnical equipment at the Khashm-el-Girba
Dam in good working order, provide on-the-job training
for PEWC staff, and prepare a detailed maintenance
program for PEWC to follow (para. 4.11).
(xv)  NHAPC (1980) would implement the Project's health components
and the Government would provide the staff required (para.
4.12).
(xvi)  NHAPC (1980) would engage consultants by September 1, 1980
to help establish the TCU and the TCU would be established
and operating by January 31, 1981 (para. 4.24).
(xvii)  NHAPC (1980) would recover the costs of all goods, services
and credit provided to tenants, and ensure that Tenant's

COST RECOVERY SYSTEM
The following principles shall govern the cost Recovery System
under the Project:
(1) All investment costs and expenditures on services on the
tenants shall be recovered in full from the tenants, unless
specifically exempted elsewhere in this Schedule.
(2) The full cost of producing each crop shall be charged against
such crop. The NHAPC (1980) shall, in consultation with the
Association, establish a sound basis for allocating various
costs among the different crops raised in the Project area,
based on accurate unit costing to value all goods, services
and cash loans.
(3) In the case of crops marketed through NHAPC (1980), costs
attributable to each crop shall be deducted by the NHAPC (1980)
from the proceeds of that crop or from the tenants share of
such proceeds; in the event of costs collectible from tenants
exceeding receipts, the difference shall be collected in cash
from the tenant.
(4) In the case of crops directly marketed by tenants, such
tenants shall make payments in cash to NHAPC (1980) to meet
costs recoverable from them for such crop.
(5) The quantum of recovery of cost shall be determined during
the five-year Project execution period on the basis of the
ability of tenants to meet such costs from tenancy cash flow,
and shall be calculated and embodied in the Annual Work
Program. Any costs not recovered shall be capitalized and
recovered during the subsequent years along with interest
at 12% per annum. In the event of circumstances external
to the Project that jeopardize the financial viability of
NHAPC (1980) and/or tenant incentives, NHAPC (1980) shall
request the Borrower to consider providing subventions to it
in order to offset such effects and incorporate such sums in
the Annual Work Program.
(6) The Tenants' Lease Agreement shall specify the rate of cost
recovery from tenants and the dates by which such payments by
tenants should be made, and shall provide remedies to NHAPC
(1980) in the event of default by the tenants.

SCHEDULE C
Page 2
(7) Cases of default shall be referred to the Tenants Credit
Unit. The functions and responsibilities of the Tenants
Credit Unit shall be laid down in Regulations issued by
NHAPC (1980) in accordance with the powers conferred to it
under Section 20 of the Public Corporations Act 1976, and
shall, inter alia, include: (a) review of all cases of
failure by individual tenants to conform with the provisions
of Tenants' Lease Agreement; (b) specific recommendations to
the management of the Corporation on the action to be taken in
each case; and (c) establishment of an efficient debt recovery
mechanism. The recommendations of the Tenants Credit Unit, as
approved by NHAPC (1980), shall be binding on the tenants.
(8) NHAPC (1980) may, with the approval of the Association, waive
collection of costs on items which are not directly production-
related, such as expenditures on health programs and educational
facilities.

1/  Conversion from constant to current for Project Years I through 5 is made using the international rates of inflation.  Thereafter the Project year 5 inflation rate is used.
2/ Tenants debt repayments are shown net of (i) tenants shares of general joint account surplus and (ii) tenants anticipated bad debts.
3/ Includes outflows three months prior to start of fiscal year ending June 30, 1981.
4/ Includes spores.
5/ A portion of the project investment inflows is used for cash requirements - first three project years.  This is not shown as a separate project investment outflow since
it is reflected in the difference between outflows and inflows from operations during those project years.
J The principal amount repaid is the total of project investment inflows compounded at 9% until year 6. The annual repayment is the principal amount amortized at
9% over 15 years.
