VEGETABLE PRODUCTION & MARKETING PROJECT
(Loan 1757-MOR)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion  Report (PCR) for the Morocco Vege-
table Production and Marketing Project, for which Loan 1757-MOR in the
amount of US$58.0 million was extended on November 15, 1979. The original
loan Closing Date was June 30, 1984, but after two extensions the loan was
officially closed on December 31, 1985.   Subsequently the grace period for
the closing of the loan  accounts  was  extended several times.  Final dis-
bursement was made on April 2, 1987, three years after the initially anti-
cipated date. In November 1984, US$14.0 million was cancelled and at the
time of final disbursement the remaining balance of US$7.2 million wa can-
celled; thus total amount disbursed under the project as US$36.8 million.
2.       This PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa
Regional Office based on a review of Bank records and selected interviews
with Bank staff who were associated with the project. No Completion deport
was received from the Borrower.
3.       This PCR was read  by  the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the  Borrower  on March 20, 1989, for coments by
May 1, 1989, but none were received.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
PROJECT COMPMETION REPORT
VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING PROJECT
(Loan 1757-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
During the 1960's and early 1970's Morocco was a principal supplier
of vegetables to the European Economic Community (EEC). However in the
mid-1970's intensified competition from other Mediterranean producers,
increasing restrictions on EEC imports, and weaknesses in Morocco's vegetable
production and marketing operations resulted in a serious decline in the
country's vegetable exports. In order to reverse this decline and to
reestablish Morocco's position in the EEC market, the Government issued a
Development Plan for Winter Vegetables (1978-85), which aimed to modernize and
expand vegetable production during the winter season, as well as to improve
export marketing facilities. Bank assistance was requested for the
!mplementation of the first four years of the Development Plan, which the
Government considered of highest priority.
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were to increase for 'gn
exchange earnings and to generate employment at a relatively low investment
cost. The specific project goals were: (i) to double winter vegetable exports
during the four-year project period, 1979-83; (ii) to diversify the
composition of these exports by reducing the heavy concentration on tomatoes
and by expanding the production and export of other higher value crops; (iii)
to diversify winter vegetable export markets by Aecreasing the dependence on
the French market and expanding exports to other European countries. These
objectives and goals were to be achieved through the installation of
greenhouses on 1,000 ha, improvement of open field production on 8,000 ha,
strengthening of horticultural research and extension institutions, expansion
and modernization of marketing facilities (mainly storage/collection centers,
packing stations, quality control centers, and port storage facilities), and
reforms in the vegetable export marketing system.

mplernentaion Experience
The project appea:ed to have started well, with initial farmer demand
for greenhouses during the first two years exceeding appraisal projections.
The Government's export marketing board, Office de Commercialisation et
d'Exportation (OCE),1' also initiated the anticipated reforms of its export
marketing practices. However, problems which were to significantly affect
projece outcome immediately became apparent. Farmers failed to conform to the
expected cropping patterns; instead of diversifying their production, they
increased their traditiontl reliance on tomatoes. Demand for greenhouses
slowed cunsiderably due to the unusually adverse weather conditions which
began during the first year of the project and continued through Year 4. OCE
decided that further changes in its marketing practices were unnecessary, a
position with which the Bank disagreed. There were serious delays in the
expected improvements in the research/extension system and some of the
anticipated improvements were never implemented. Winter vegetable exports
fell to well below pre-project levels and value of the dirham depreciated
substantially in relation to the US dotlar and European currencies,
contributing to a reduction of Government budgets. As a result, utilization
of loan funds was slowed and there were delays in the implementation of all
project components.
The project scope was changed in April 1983; several modifications
were made, including the funding of a comprehensive study of Morocco's winter
vegetable production and marketing it. hlems and prospects, as well as the
extension of the loan closing date by me year, from June 1984 to June 1985.
Subsequently the closing date was extended for an additional six months, to
December 1985. Project costs totalled approximately US$70.9 million, 55S of
the US$129.6 million expected at appraisal; in dirham terms, total project
costs are estimated at 62% of appraisal projections. The most important
components for which actual costs were significantly below appraisal estimates
iuclude:  (i) greenhouse construction (although the physical target was
exceeded, about 15% of the farmers used non-project financing and some farmers
installed models which were much less expensive than initially anticipated);
(ii) installation of irrigation facilities for both greenhouse and open field
production; (iii) short-term credit (many farmers were able to finance their
own operating costs and the target for support of open f4eld production was
not achieved); (iv) packing and quality control stations (it was decided not
to undertake much of the expected construction and upgrading due to shortfalls
in production and exports, as well as to the availability of private packing
facilities); and (v) construction of seedling greenhouses. However there were
also cost overruns for several project components. The most significant
involved the construction and equipping of extension and storage/collection
centers (it was agreed that the number of facilities financed be increased and
the types of equipment be expanded) and the construction of the port storage
facility.
Results
The project was highly successful in achieving one of its principal
goals, the expansion of greenhouse production-greenhouse area financed by the
project exceeded the target by 24X, although the rate of installation was

marketing and trade regime liberalization program supported by the Bank,
has eliminated OCE export marketing monopoly.

slower than envisaged due to the unfavorable weather conditions dur&.g the
first four years of the project. However there was a considerable shortfall
in the open field component-improvements were supported on onmy about 552 of
the target area envisaged. There was limited success in the achievement of
the other major project goals. During most years of the project winter
vegetable exports remained below pre-project levels and by Year 7, the
completion date of the extended project, only 442 of the appraisal export
target for Year 4 had been attained. The export concentration on tomatoes
increased slightly because the expected expansion in the production and export
of the various other project crops failed to materialize, and the dependence
on the French market increased. At this time, only limited changes were made
in OCE's marketing practices partly because the organization disagreed with
the need for further change and the study which was to resolve this
disagreement was Lot finalized until well after project completion.
The limited success in the achievement of the yield, and crop
diversification goals may be attributed largely to weaknesses in the research
and extension system due to the failure to immediately initiate the planned
research and extension activities at the project's start and to implement this
component as designed. This in turn had a negative impact on the achievement
of the project's marketing objectives. At appraisal it was recognized that
intense, regular supervision would be needed in both '.orticulture and
marketing areas, but during implementation there were sume gaps in the
supervision of both the horticulture and marketing components.
Cost underruns in several major project components and the decision
not to undertake several of the planned activities resulted in
underutilization of the loan funds-actual disbursements were 632 of the
anticipat(.i amount. During the course of the project the Government requested
that US$14.0 million be cancelled and an additional US$7.2 million was
cancelled at the time of final disbursement.
The economic rste of return for the greenhouse component is
reestimated at 312 which, despite production shortfalls, is close to appraisal
expectations for this component due to the unexpectedly high prices received
for project crops in both export and local markets. Because of data
limitations, particularly on the impact of the open field improvements and on
private sector investments in packing houses, the rate of return for the
overall project can only be roughly estimated. Using conservative estimates
for the incremental production resulting from open field improvements and
omitting the packing perations (except for actual project investments in
packing facilities), the rate of return for the overall project is reestimated
at 122, compared to the appraisal estimate of 462. However it is probable
that if data were available on the impact of project-sponsored open field
improvements and on the packing operations (which showed an extremely high
rate of return in the appraisal analysis), the rate of return for the overall
project would be considerably higher.
The prospects for sustainability of benefits from the project's main
category of investment, the greenhouse component, appear very good if
weaknesses in research and extension and in the marketing system can be
4S44e. se



- vii -
corrected. A judgement about the sustainability of benefits from the other
components is not possible because of the inadequate information in the
project files about their performance.
Findino and Lessons
Despite the shortfall in winter vegetable production and exports, it
is reasonable to assume that without the project, both production and exports
would have declined. The greenhouses provided protection against the
urfavorable weather conditions during the early project years and thus helped
to prevent more serious losses than those which actually occurred. Further,
the greenhouses enabled Moroccan producers to achieve much higher yields than
in open field operationa, to adapt the timing of their production to the
increasingly restrictive EEC import calendar during the summer months, and to
achieve higher standards of product quality and homogeneity, thereby halting
the decline in exports which had begun in the mid-1970's.
However the failure to implement the research and extension component
as designed and weaknesses in research and extension support prevented the
project from achieving the degree of success which Bank horticultural
specialists firmly believe could have been possible. The inadequate
monitoring of this component by a norticultural specialist during supervision
and the acceptance of major delays in the execution of key aspects of the
planned research/extension program clearly contributed to limiting the
ultimate success of the project.
The impkementation of various important reforms in the domestic and
export marketing system was delayed by the disagreement which developed over
OCE's marketing practices at an earlier stage of project execution. The
regular use, during supervision, of an experienced marketing specialist could
have sped up these reforms. The Project, however, played indirectly an
important catalytic role in shaping the marketing and export liberalization
program of Government and in eliminating OCE monopoly.
As a follow-up on lessons learnt in this project, the Bank has
recently appraised a Research and Extension Project (FY89) to tackle existing
weaknesses in research and extension in Morocco. Also, in 1988 a sector study
examined the most recent development trends in the subsectors of greenhouse
production, agro-processing, and fruit and vegetable export as part of the
preparation of the National Agricultural Credit Project (FY89) through CNCA,
which is already successfully encouraging the financing of investments in the
expanding private sector in agriculture in Morocco.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING PROJECT
(Loan 1757-MOR)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     During the 1960's and early 1970's Morocco was a major supplier of
winter and summer vegetables, particularly tomatoes and potatoes, to France
and, to a lesser degree, to other EEC countries. Then in the mid-1970's
Moroccan vegetable production and exports declined dramatically, due largely
to a reduction of export produce quality and increasing competition from
Spain, which led to lower producer prices and decreased farmer interest in
vegetable production. The deteriorating situation was exacerbated in 1976
when the EEC, in order to protect its own expanding greenhouse production of
vegetables, extended the annual period of restrictions on vegetable imports
from May to October, thereby sharply reducing Morocco's export possibilities
for the summer crop. The country's producers proved unable to adapt to this
new export calendar, and vegetable exports declined even further (from 1976-79
the decline was approximately 30S).
1.02     In an effort to halt this decline in vegetable exports and to
recapture its former share in the EEC market, in late 1977 the Moroccan
national marketing board for agricultural exports, the Office de
Commercialisation et d'Exportation (OCE), formulated a development plan for
the winter vegetable subsector, /Plan Primeurs'. To be -implemented during
1978-85, the Plan aimed at doubling the value of vegetable exports through:
(1) the provision of technical and financial support to horticulturalists,
whose operations were characterized by low productivity and high export
rejection rates resulting largely from poor cultural practices, infected
soils, and poor selection of varieties; (2) the widespread introduction of
greenhouse production, which until that time was restricted to limited areas
largely devoted to research and demonstration; this technology would enable
producers to intensify production during the winter (November-April) season;
(3) the modernization of packing and grading infrastructure; and (4) the
development of deep-freezing facilities, in order to provide a complement to
exports of fresh produce. In early 1978 the Bank was approached for
assistance in the execution of the Plan, which was considered of highest
priority by the Moroccan Government.
1.03     The project was designed to support the first four years of the Plan
Primeurs development program. It was the first Bank-supported project
focussing on Morocco's horticultural sector, although in 1978 the Bank had
financed a one-year veg :able research program in the southern region of the
country under the Souss Irrigation Project (FY75). Bank staff had also
identified an integrated vegetable production and marketing project for the
Souss/Massa area in 1976, but this project was not developed further,
apparently due to the Government's subsequent decision to develop a broader
national prorSram for horticultural development.

1.04     At the time of the issuance of Plan Primeurs, Morocco-s vegetable
producing areas totalled approximately 142,000 ha of land, of which 120,000 ha
were cultivated during the summer season, and 22,000 ha, during the winter
season. Vegetable producers were generally small (under 10 ha) traditional
farmers who owned their own farms. While the majority of the area in
vegetables was devoted to tomatoes and potatoes, a variety of other crops was
also produced, including green peppers, zucchini, green beans, strawberries,
eggplant, artichokes, asparagus, cucumbers, melons, onions, and hot peppers.
IL PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification and Preparation
2.01             identification and preparatic  ,ere performed by the
FAO/Coope -Iie Program, which conducted five missions to Morocco during
1978. Bansc a.aff participat.d in part of three of these missions, and several
other unrel-ted Bank missions reviewed the progress of project formulation and
reported back to the Bank on the principal issues and problems needing
resolution. Two of the Moroccan government agencies which were expected to
participate in the project, the Ministry of Agriculture (MARA) and OCE,
assisted in project preparation by executing a survey of horticultural farming
operations and an assessment of the country's problems in the production,
packing, and marketing of horticultural crops.
2.02     It was decided early in the preparation process that the project
would include only the zones producing winter vegetables; these zones were
located mainly in the coastal areas between Kenitra (north of Rabat) and Safi,
and in the areas south and east of Agadir, in southern Morocco (see Map). Of
the 22,000 ha under winter vegetables, 9,000 ha were to be included under the
project.
2.03     During the preparation process several issues were raised which
proved to be problematic during project implementation or of considerable
importance to the ultimate outcome of the project. These include the following:
(1)  proiect target for greenhouse installation.  Initially the Government
strongly advocated that the project support the installation of 3,000
ha of greenhouses; however Bank staff and the preparation teams
argued that this would be an overly ambitious target. Ultimately it
was agreed that the target for greenhouse installation be set at
1,000 ha and that the improvements for open field areas would cover
an additional 8,000 ha.
(2) the need for an in-depth study of export marketing requirements and
prospects for winter vegetables, particularly in view of the
increasing competition from Spain and several other Mediterranean
countries. Although Bank staff members and the FAO/CP teams
repeatedly stressed the need for such a study throughout 1978, the
idea was dropped during project appraisal because the Bank was
planning to undertake a comprehensive study of fruit and vegetable
export marketing covering various Middle Eastern and North African
countries, including Morocco.   In the appraisal analysis, the Bank
recommended fundamental changes in OCE's marketing techniques;
although OCE initially agreed to these
4S44e. sc



-3-
changes, later the organization decided that they were unnecessary.
During the early years of the project vegetable exports continued to
decline, and the disagreement persisted between the Bank and OCE. In
order to resolve this dispute, as well as to identify other problems
in Morocco's vegetable production and marketin8 system, in 1983 the
Bank and the Government agreed that an in-depth study focussing only
on the problems and prospects of Morocco's vegetable sector would
indeed be necessary; the study was included in the revised project
and executed during 1984-87.
(3) OCE skepticism concerning projected yield increases. Although the
preparation teams believed their yield projections to be
conservative, OCE felt that, based on the organization's past
experience with local farmers, the projections were overly
optimistic. (The projected yield increases averaged about 50% for all
project crops over the four-year project period). However the Bank
persuaded OCE that the projections were reasonable because of the
improvements expected with the utilization of the new greenhousa and
open field technologies, as well as the strong technical support to
be provided to participating farmers.
(4) competition between OCE and MARA for leadership of the proiect. This
conflict was apparently resolved just before appraisal by a
Government decision that OCE and its affiliate SASMA would be
responsible for the greenhouse component, including extension to
greenhouse   operators, while MARA would direct the open field
component; the national agricultural credit agency, CNCA, would be
responsible for the credit operations.
2.04     The preparation teams calculated that the economic rate of return of
the project would be 22% over ten years and 261 over twenty years.
Proiect Appraos
2.05     The project was appraised in January, 1979 by a team consisting of
two Bank staff members, a marketing consultant, and a consultant agronomist.
There were three principal issues raised and apparently resolved during
appraisal team's mission; these issues are described below.
2.06     First, the mission and the Government agreed on the need to modify
OCE's system for marketing vegetables in France; instead of continuing to rely
on dockside auction sale- at the French ports of entry, the principal market
outlets for less perishable citrus, it was agreed that for vegetables OCE
should gradually shift to pre-arranged contract sales with panels of major
French importer/distributors. The mission emphasized that this more rigorous
system of pre-programming destinations and the quantity and quality of
deliveries had become the predominant marketing mechanism for vegetables in
France. It believed that by adapting to this system, higher produce prices
could be obtained, partly because the system could assure faster produce
delivery through the distribution network, thereby reducing quality losses for
the more perishable vegetables.
2.07     Second, the mission initially opposed the Government's recommendation
that farmers be provided 1001 credit financing for the greenhouses (70% from
4S44*. sc



- 4 -
CNCA loans, 201 from Treasury advances, and 10% from OCE loans). Government
officials felt thaL the rate of introduction of greenhouse technologies would
be severely restricted with less than 1001 financing, since previous attempts
to encourage greenhouse construction had revealed that many farmers,
particularly small holders, were unwilling or unable to self-finance part of
the construction costs because they viewed the technology as extremely costly
and risky. The appraisal team felt that farmers should be required to
contribute 10% of the required financing; subsequently this position was
strongly supported in discussions concerning the project within the Bank. It
was ultimately agreed that the 100% financing formula would be provided only
to selected cooperatives.
2.08     Third, the preparation and appraisal missions had determined that the
locally-constructed greenhouses which OCE had previously used displayed
certain technical deficiencies; considerable effort was made by the
preparation teams to select more effective design specifications for the
project-financed greenhouses. Although the SAR and the loan documents
provided that greenhouses were to have been procured under ICB, on the basis
of mission design specifications in order to facilitate project start-up,
during the first year the Bank accepted to finance greenhouses procured on the
basis of local competitive bidding.
2.09     During the subsequent discussions within the Bank, several Edditional
issues were raised. First. the project's market assumptions were
characterized particularly that Morocco would increase its share of the EEC
early season vegetable market from 25% to 351 during the project as /unduly
optimistic' in light of increasing EEC protectionism and Spanish competition.
The need for more detailed and realistic project risk analysis was also
emphasized. Second, some concern arose over the apparently regressive impact
of the project, since the horticulturalists to be supported by the project
were already significantly wealthier than the average Moroccan farmer or the
Bank's stated /target group' for its agricultural projects. Third, the need
for more elaborate analysis of the main technical problems limiting vegetable
production was stressed, and the ability of the extension component to aid the
more progressive, experienced farmers was questioned. Finally, the estimates
of employment generation by the project, which at first was calculated at
26,000 jobs (at a cost of $3,600 per job) but later was reduced to 16,000 (at
$6,000 each), were both described as overly optimistic. Through a series of
internal memos and discussions it was attempted to persuade the project
designers to consider these views. Although the Bank felt that ultimately
certain of its concerns were sufficiently addressed, a staff member wrote in a
September 1979 memo to the files that after the /particularly long and
involved review process' their concerns about the marketing and equity
aspects, /the key, most troublesome features' of the project, were not
adequately addressed in the final project design.
2.10     An attempt was made to more adequately address the equity issue
during negotiations, when it was agreed that the Treasury advances to cover
20% of greenhouse construction costs would be restricted to /smaller' farmers
(those with 2 ha or less of greenhouses); thus the larger farmers would
receive only the CNCA credits to cover 701 of construction costs. Further,
60% of the Treasury funds would be allocated to farmers with under 0.5 ha of
greenhouses. However some staff still questioned whether these measures were
4S44e .sc



- 5 -
sufficient, since in their view, it was doubtful that a farmer with 2 ha of
greenhouses could be considered /small'.
2.11     During their review of the project before Board presentation, several
Executive Directors expressed satisfaction with the low-cost employment
generation effect of the project, which was viewed by one Executive Director
as /the redeeming feature of the project'. The project's high rate of return,
by this time projected at 462, was also considered a highly attractive
feature. However, another Director expressed concern about the /optimistic'
marketing projections, particularly the assumption that in the face of
increased competition from Spain and Israel, Morocco could Legain its previous
market share during the four years of the project. The project was approved
by the Board on September 11, 1979.
Project Objectives
2.12     The overall objective of the project was to increase the value of
foreign exchange earnings rrom agriculture by approximately 26X (US$85
million) in order to contribute to the reduction of Morocco's balance of
payments deficit. A secondary objective was the generation of employment at a
relatively low investment cost.
2.13       There were three principal goals of the project: (i) to double the
export of Morocco's winter vegetables during the project period, 1979-83; (ii)
to diversify the composition of these exports; the concentration on tomatoes
was to be reduced from 95X of the total volume to 86% (excluding potatoes).
while the export of various other higher value crops, including peppers,
squash, strawberries, green beans, eggplants, and melons, was to increase from
about 62 of the total volume to 142 (an increase of 2262) 1/; and (iii) to
diversify Morocco's vegetable export markets-the project aimed to initiate
efforts to reduce the heavy concentration on the French market by expanding
sales to other European countries.
2.14     The project objectives and goals were to be achieved through three
principal actions, which include: (i) the modernization of the horticultural
sector through the widespread introduction of greenhouse production and the
improvement of open field cultivation through the use of high-yielding hybrid
varieties, the improvement of irrigation facilities and cultural practices,
and the strengthening of horticultural research and extension support; (ii)
the upgrading and expansion of marketing infrastructure; and (iii) the
adaptation of Morocco's export marketing techniques to the changing
circumstances and demands of the European market; the most essential reform
was expected to be the elimination of dockside auction sales for vegetables
and the shift to pre-programmed contract sales to panels of European
importers/distributors.
Project Description
2.15     The project included eight major components: (i) medium- and
long-term credit for the construction of greenhouses on 1,000 ha and the
installation of drip irrigation systems in 500 ha of the greenhouses, as well
as for the provision of irrigation and other equipment for 8,000 ha of open
field vegetable areas; (ii) short-term working capital credit for both
greenhouse and open field producers; (iii) construction and staffing of five
1/ Export targets were calculated in terms of volume rather than value.



- 6 -                 0"4    ' t
extension centers and three research/training centers, as well as improvement
of seven existing extension centers; (iv) construction of 10 ha of greenhouse
nurseries for the production of seedlings by OCE and the cooperatives; (v)
construction of ten cooperative storage centers, twelve cooperative and OCE
packing stations, twelve OCE quality control centers, and a storage facility
at the port of Agadir, as well as upgrading of thirty cooperative packing
stations; (vi) construction and upgrading of 250 km of feeder roads; (vii)
long-term technical assistance (74 months) to support horticultural research
and extension training and short-term assistance (12 months) in marketing,
monitoring, and evaluation; and (viii) a survey of water resources in the
project area, as well as continuous water salinity monitoring.
2.16     Through the expansion of production under greenhouses, it was
expected that producers would achieve not only significantly higher yields
(twice the yields of open field produc5rs), but also consistently higher
produce quality and greater control over the timing of production. It was
anticipated that about half of the greenhouses would be installed in the
southern region near Agadir, about a third between Safi and Casablanca, and
the remainder, north of Casablanca. The cropping pattern under greenhouses
was expected to include 45% tomatoes, 351 green peppers, and on the remaining
201, eggplants, melons, and green beans.
2.17     The component concerning the construction and upgrading of packing
stations was included because it was felt that the existing system of
stations, which was composed largely of small, outdated units belonging to the
cooperatives, was inefficient. Under the project, 25 of these stations were
to be closed, another 30 were to be enlarged and equipped to process a minimum
of 2,500 tons/year, and 10 new stations with a 2,500 ton capacity were to be
built. In addition, OCE planned to construct two stations with a 5,000 ton
capacity each.
2.18     The objective of adapting OCE's marketing techniques to the changing
conditions in the European market was to be achieved largely through highly
intensive project supervision by a marketing specialist who was expected to
participate in each supervision mission. In addition, it was anticipated that
a portion of the short-term consultant assistance provided for the project
might be utilized to assist OCE in defining new markets and executing
strategies to capture these markets.
2.19     Total project costs were estimated at US$129.6 million, of which
US$58.0 million (451) was to be financed by a Bank loan, and the remainder
(US$71.6 million), by CNCA (202), the fa.rmers (171), the Government (131), and
OCE (51). The Bank loan was to cover 861 of the project's foreign exchange
costs; most of these funds were to be on-lent by CNCA for on-farm investments
in greenhouses and equipment, and the remaining funds were to contribute to
the cost of the technical assistance activities, short-term farm production
credit, and the construction of research, extension, &nd marketing
facilities. The project's expected local and foreign exchange costs by
component are presented in Table 1.
2.20     Project works were expected to be implemented over a four year period
(September 1979-August 1983) and Bank funds were to be disbursed over a four
and one-half year period, with the anticipated closing date in June 1984.

UL PROJECT MPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The loan documents were signed on November 15, 1979, two months after
Board approval. Although there were no special conditions for effectiveness
of the loan, a subsequent delay in satisfying the stano*rd conditions resulted
in a postponement of loan effectiveness until April 1' *980, two months later
than initially anticipated.
3.02     Despite this delay, by the date of project effectiveness there were
several indications that project start-up was proceeding well, although there
were also some immediate signs of problems. Most notably, OCE had already
begun to modify its marketing practices, having replaced some of the dockside
auction sales with a panel of French importers/distributors to whom deliveries
were pre-programmed; however OCE was described by some of these distributors
as being /defensively secret about market information' and not fully
responsive to the fundamental changes rapidly occurring in the Frencb market.
In addition, farmers appeared unwilling to conform to the diversified cropping
targets established by the project; the first year acreage targets for
peppers, green beans, and other vegetables were not achieved, and the target
for tomatoes, traditionally the principal crop of most Moroccan
horticulturalists, was significantly exceeded. However, when an unusual frost
in the south resulted in the loss of much of the tomato crop during 1979-80,
the Bank and the Government believed that in the future farmers would realize
the importance of diversifying their cropping patterns in order reduce the
potential impact of unexpected climatic variation. (This belief ultimately
proved to be ill-founded).
Revisions
3.03     Project implementation was severely delayed because of four
consecutive years of unusually adverse weather conditions (1979-83) which
inhibited farmer demand for greenhouse credits and adversely affected
production, causing exports of winter vegetables to fall below pre-project
levels. The decline of exports was also attributed to increasing Spanish
competition in the European markets ana, in the view of the Bank, to OCE's
resistance to further modifications of its marketing practices. The situation
was exacerbated by the depreciation of the dirham in relation to the US dollar
and European currencies and by reduced Government budgets, both of which
resulted in extremely low utilization of loan funds and slow progress in the
construction components.
3.04     In response to Government requests during 1982-3 to modify several
aspects of the project design, the loan agreement was amended in April 1983.
The principal changes included: (i) an increase in the loan disbursement
percentages to cover the full estimated foreign exchange component of the
project; (ii) new and increased expenditures for various support activities
and for farmer inputs, equipment, and credits; (iii) funding for several
agricultural and agro-industrial studies, including the in-depth analysis of
Morocco's winter vegetable production and marketing problems and prospects;
(iv) agreement that short-term credit could be used for the production of
potatoes, which had not been included in the appraisal design because of
4S44..sc

apparently poor market prospects at that time; and (v) an extension of the
closing date by one year, to June 1985, although it was expected that a second
year's extension might subsequently be necessary.
3.05     In February 1985 the closing date was extended for an additional six
months, to December 31, 1985, to permit the financing of a seventh year of
greenhouse construction and the completion of the vegetable production and
marketing study.

3.06     Greenhouse Construction.  The project objective was to achieve 1,000
ha of new greenhouse construction by Project Year 4 (1982-3). During the
first year farmer demand for greenhouses was almost at the projected level
(107 ha versus 120 ha projected, or 89%); preliminary demand for the second
year was actually double the projected level (300 ba ver&js 200 ha
projected). Then, largely due to the extremely adverse weather conditions
during the first year, requests for greenhouse credits for the second year
dropped dramatically, to 109 ha. When the unfavorable weather conditions
continued during the second year and it became clear to some farmers that the
greenhouses were successful in protecting their crops against such conditions,
farmer demand began to accelerate. However the rate of acceleration was not
as great as originally projected, most likely due to many farmers' continuing
fears of undertaking significant new investments during extended periods of
adverse weather conditions. By the end of 1983, the project's original
completion date, 521 ha of greenhouses had been constructed, 521 of the
appraisal target. When the project was extended and weather conditions
normalized, farmer demand intensified considerably; by the end of 1985, the
revised completion date. grefnhouse area reached 1460 ha. Since it is roughly
estimated that 15% of these greenhouses were constructed with non-project
funds, the greenhouse area financed by the project totalled approximately 1241
ha, or 124% of the original project target.
3.07     A comparison of planned versus actual construction of greenhouse area
from 1979-86 is presented in Table 2.

3.08     Installation of Irrigation Equipment.  At appraisal it was
anticipated that 500 ha of greenhouses would be equipped with drip irrigation
systems. However apparently few farmers ultimately installed the systems due
to their high cost and farmer unwillingness to iucur additional debt
obligation beyond the cost of the greenhouses, as well as to the lack of
mobility of the systems, which like the greenhouses needed to be moved
frequently for soil and plant health reasons. By the original closing date,
mid-1984, drip systems had been installed on only 51 ha of greenhouses (107 of
the target), and no further information concerning the sub-ect was reported in
the project files.
3.09     It was also expected that irrigation equipment would be improved or
installed on 4,000 ha of open field vegetable producing areas. However due to
the incomplete records concerning the quantity and types of equipment
purchased by farmers with project credits it is not possible to ascertain the
extent to which this target was achieved.
3.10     Construction of Other Infrastructure.  The project design included
the construction ot 10 ha of greenhouses for seedling production by OCE and
the cooperatives. Ultimately only 5.6 ha were constructed; farmers found that
they themselves could produce seedlings of an equivalent cost and quality, and
thus the additional facilities were unnecessary.
3.11     The construction of the extension, cooperative, and research/training
centers was considerably slower than appraisal projections, due to delays in
allocation of MARA funds, administrative problems in authorizing expenditures,
budgetary constraints which slowed funding for required utilities, and delays
in decisions about the staffing of the centers. Construction of all of the
facilities included in the appraisal design was ultimately completed in 1985;
in addition, the Bank approved the Government's request to build seven
additional extension and cooperative centers in order to more effectively
service farmers in certain geographical areas.
3.12      The expected expansion and upgrading of packing and grading
facilities was sharply curtailed (from 42 to 16) because of pro.tction
shortfalls and the availability of private sector facilities which were being
constructed and improved with non-project funds. OCE had originally planned
to build two 5,000 ton stations, but by 1983 it was decided that such large
facilities would be under-utilized and uneconomical; consequently the
organization decided to rent smaller existing fac.lities rather than to
undertake any new construction. Only six new cooperative stations were
constructed versus the ten originally projected, and approximately ten
stations were upgraded instead of the thirty anticipated at appraisal.
3.13     Of the twelve new quality control stations which OCE had planned to
construct, only one was built, although seven others were upgraded.
3.14     The road and port construction was completed as planned, although
somewhat behind schedule, due to administrative and funding delays.
3.15     Technical Assistance.  The project design included the provision of
three senior expatriate horticulturalists (74 months) to plan and direct
agricultural research and the training of extension agents at the three new
research/training centers. The appraisal report and loan agreement specified
that these personnel would be in place by the end of 1980. However in
4S440. *c



- 12 -
mid-1980 MARA and OCE strongly requested that the positions be filled by
extensioa technicians from their own staffs; the Bank agreed on the condition
that the candidates complete long-term training overseas before assuming their
new positions. By late 1983 the personnel had not yet been selected. After
that date, there is no further information about the issue in the project
files; apparently the issue was not monitored during supervision. As a
result, it is uncertain if long-term training was ever provided for the center
directors.
3.16     Execution of Studies.  One study was included in the original
project, the examination of hydrogeological resources in the project area;
this was successfully executed by 1982.
3.17     In view of project modifications which were expected to result in
unutilized funds, ii 1982-3 the Government requested that project financing be
provided for several additional agricultural and agro-industrial studies
concerning issues of top Government priority. These included background
documents or feasibility studies for possible future projects pertaining to
agricultural research and extension, grain distribution and storage,
floriculture, cold storage and packing, vegetable oil processing, and canning
operations. In addition, funding was requested for an analysis of water
salinity and supply problems in the project area. Provisions for the financing
of these and other as yet unspecified feasibility studies were included in the
1983 loan amendment.
3.18     Several of the studies were subsequently initiated; however one was
eventually cancelled, and there is no record on whether any of the other
studies were completed. Background preparatory work was performed for several
additional studies, but none was ultimately initiated, apparently due to
changes in the priorities of MARA's top management.
3.19     In view of the declining level of winter vegetable exports and the
disagreement between OCE and Bank staff about the need to eliminate dockside
auction sales for vegetables, in 1983 the Government, OCE, and the Bank agreed
that the execution of an independent in-depth analysis of Morocco's vegetable
production and marketing problems and prospects and the effectiveness of
alternative marketing practices should be included in the projet. OCE
initially agreed to participate in the preparation of the terms of reference
(TOR) for the study and to perform a comparative analysis of its experience
with dockside and panel sales as background for the study. However, when it
subsequently became clear that some senior Bank and Government officials
wished to include in the scope of work a feasibility study of pilot private
sector horticultural exporting (and thereby the elimination of OCE's monopoly
role), OCE's interest in the study declined.
3.20     By mid-1984 no progress had been made by MARA and OCE on plans for
the study or the preparation of the TOR; at that time Bank staff and
consultants prepared the draft TOR. The Bank drolped its insistence on the
inclusion of the analysis of pilot private exporting activities and instead
agreed that the study should focus on an objective evaluation of Morocco's
vegetable production and exporting experience. However the execution of the
study was subsequently made a conditionality of the second Industrial and
Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA) loan to Morocco (Loan 2377-MOR), which aimed to
eliminate monopolistic controls over exporting, including those under OCE's
jurisdiction.

3.21     After agreement was reached between Government agencies and the Bank
on the TOR, it was anticipated that the study would be executed during the
latter half of 1984. However there were subv.;-uitial delays in the selection
of contractors, the staffing of the teems, the preparation of the work
program, and the approval of the contract and the budget by the Government.
Further delays were caused by late payments from the Government to the
Moroccan contractor, slow processing of foreign exchange transfer
authorization by the Government, and disagreements over the amount and timing
of payments from the contractor to the European sub-contractor. The draft
report was finally submitted in mid-1986 and, after substantial corrections
and revisions, the final report was completed in mid-l96?.
3.22     Reporting and Auditing.  The project design included the provision of
consultancy services to assist the participating agencies in establishing a
management information system for the project. There is no record of whether
these services were ever provided, but apparently they were not. During
appraisal it was also agreed that CNCA and OCE would submit separate quarterly
progress reports to the National Coordinating Committee and that summaries and
analyses of these reports would be submitted annually to the Government and
the Bank. The annual reports were provided by both agencies during the early
years of the project, but after 1982, the OCE reports were apparently
intermittent. In addition, the Bank requested OCE to submit annual
operational plans, as well as periodic analyses of the effectiveness of their
marketing techniques and other project issues. The annual plans were received
during the first few years of the project, although several of the requested
analyses were never submitted. On several occasions the Bank reiterated the
need for imoroved reporting but apparently no further actions were taken.
OCE's resistance to providing certain requested information may in part be
attributed to the antagonism which developed between OCi and the because of
the Bank's (and in OCE's view, unsubstantiated) criticism of OCE's marketing
practices.
3.23     At appraisal it was agreed that MARA would submit a project
completion report (PCR) within six months after the completion of the
project. No PCR was in fact received by the Bank. The Bank conducted its
last supervision mission in March 1985, nine months before project completion,
and subsequently focussed its attention on the finalization of the vegetable
production and export marketing study. This study was viewed as an essential
component of the PCR, but after the study was final>'-; completed in 1987, it is
unclear whether the Bank reiterated the need for fuLCillment of the PCR.
3.24     Not only were there problems with the quantity and regularity of
project reporting, but improvements could also have been made in the type and
quality of information reported to the Bank by project agencies. While
careful records were kept concerning certain aspects of the project (such as
greenhouse construction, cropping patterns, and exports), for other issues
little information was provided. These include such topics as: (1) project
beneficiaries, particularly whether the credit distribution formulae relating
to farm size classification agreed on at negotiations had been respected; (2)
project employment generation, one of the principal justifications for the
project; (3) farmer utilization of credit intended for equipment purchases
(i.e. no information is provided in Bank files on the drip irrigation
component after 1983; little information was ever provided on the expected
open field improvements); (4) total project costs and the cost of various
components (the last detailed records and forecasts were calculated after the
4544e. sc



- 14 -
October 1983 supervision mission); (5) progress in facilities construction and
improvement after late 1983; (6) greenhouse construction under the project
during the final year (the data in this report was obtained from other
sources). Further, Bank supervision reports include only intermittent data on
crop yields, a critical indicator of progress in several of the project's key
components. Project files do suggest, however, that yield data for a least
the major project crops, as well as information on some of the other topics
noted above, were in fact being gathered by Moroccan agencies during Bank
supervision missions.
3.25     Final Bank reporting on the project would certainly have been more
complete had a completion mission been scheduled; although the last
supervision mission advised that a subsequent mission be conducted early in
1986, no further missions were in fact conducted.
3.26     CNCA's accounts were regularly audited by an international accounting
firm and the audits were submitted on schedule to the Bank. The Bank decided
to waive the requirement that OCE accounts be audited, largely because OCE
ultimately did not use any Bank funds (para.3.37).
3.27     Procurement.  The greenhouses (expected to total $24.5 million or 19%
of project costs) were to have been procured in accordance with ICB. However,
in order to accelerate project start-up, the Bank accepted local procurement
of the greenhouse components during the first project year, 1979-80, despite
the fact that some of the local greenhouse designs had not been considered
acceptable by technicians on the preparation and appraisal teams. Early in
1980 OCE awarded contracts to three local firms. Since the product design of
one of the firms was among those considered not technically acceptable, the
firm agreed to modify its design to conform to project specifications.
Nevertheless, during the second project year, the majority of the project
greenhouses were supplied, without modifications, by this company, which had
been a traditional supplier to OCE. After this experience there were no
further irregularities in the procurement of the greenhouse components.
3.28     Local procurement instead of ICB was used in the awarding of the
contract for the construction of the Agadir port facility. The Bank
questioned this action, requesting that the contract be rebid internationally
unless a valid justification could be provided. Apparently such justification
was ultimately provided, although no further information on the issue is
available in the project files.
3.29     Delays were experienced in the completion of the research and
extension studyand in making payments to the consultants for this study.
3.30     For the vegetable production and marketing study, the Government
insisted that the contract be awarded to a local firm; the Bank agreed on the
condition that a subcontract be awarded to an expatriate firm specialized in
EEC vegetable marketing issues. The contract with the principal contractor
was denominated in dirhams; foreign exchange for the subcontracto,r payments
was to be obtained from the Moroccan Treasury. Throughout the execution of
the study there were delays in requests for payment and foreign exchange by
the contractor, delays in payments and foreign exchange allocations by the
Government, and delays in payment to the subcontractor; these problems were
exacerbated by the deterioration of the value of the dirham versus the
subcontractor's currency. Although the report was finalized in mid-1987, as
4S44,-.c



- 15 -
of July 1988 the dispute over payments to the subcontractor had not yet been
fully resolved.
3.31     Project Costs.  At appraisal total project costs were estimated at
US$129.6 million, including US$29.5 million for physical and price
contingencies. Actual project costs can only be estimated, since the last
detailed cost data for the project covers only the first four years of the
project (through CY 1983) and there is little cost information for the last
two project years. These estimates suggest that actual project costs were
approximately US$70.9 million, or 552 of the amount estimated at appraisal.
In dirham terms, project costs were expected to total DR 518.5 million, while
actual costs are estimated at DH 321 million, or 62% of appraisal estimates.
A comparison of estimated versus actual costs of the principal project
components is provided in Table 3.
3.32     The most significant cost overruns for project components (the
extension facilities and cooperative centers) were due mainly to an increase
in the number of facilities constructed and equipped. There were also
overruns for several components for which there were no major design changes,
including the roads component (41S overrun), the hydrogeological study (452),
and the port storage facility (8X).
3.33     There were several important components for which estimated total
costs were significantly below appraisal estimates. These include:(l)
greenhouse construction (although the physical target was achieved, about 152
of the farmers financed construction through such sources as commercial bank
funding or self-financing; in addition, some farmers installed less expensive
wooden greenhottses, which were approved

were able to finance their own operating costs, and the target for support of
open field production was not achieved); (3) installation of drip irrigation
equipment, as well as other equipment for open field production; (4) the
packing and quality control stations (the number of facilities constructed or
improved was significantly below appraisal estimates); and (5) seedling
greenhouse construction (the area constructed was only half of appraisal
expectations).

one-half year period (September 1979-June 1984). The anticipated disbursement
categories, amounts, and Dercentages are presented in Table 4.
3.35     Under the 1983 Loan Amendment the Bank agreed to increases in the
disbursement percentages for several categories. These changes are also
presented in Table 4.   In addition, the Bank agreed to finance various
supplies, equipment, and consumables for the extension, research/training, and
cooperative centers, as well as a broader range of medium and long term
investments in farm equipment and infrastructure.
3.36     Actual disbursements by semester compared with appraisal estimates
are presented in Table S. As the data indicate, at the original closing date
actual disbursements totalled only US$20.7 million, 36S of appraisal
expectations. After the extension of the project, total disbursements reached
US$36.8 million, 632 of the amount anticipated at appraisal. During the
course of the project, US$14 million was cancelled and an additional US$7.2
million was cancelled after final disbursement.

3.37     Compliance with Covenants.  OCE did not comply with the Project
Agreement covenant which required the organization to furnish its annual
audited financial statements to the Bank. OCE argued repeatedly that since it
had not utilized any Bank funds, the obligation to submit the accounts was no
longer valid (the US$2.8 million allocated for OCE facilities was ultimately
cancelled). The Bank ultimately decided to waive this requirement.
3.38     As noted in para. 3.15, the SAR and loan agreement specified that
three senior horticulturalists would direct the project's research and
training activities; the experts were to assume their positions by late 1980.
However early in the project MARA and OCE obtained Bank agreement that
Moroccan extension technicians could be appointed to these positions instead,
on the condition that they first be sent overseas for long term training. The
last information on the issue in the Bank files indicates that by late 1983
the personnel had not yet been appointed; it is unclear whether the agreement
concerning the overseas training was ever honored.
3.39     There was satisfactory compliance with all other covenants, although
several were modified after Government and Bank agreement.

N. PROJECT I4PACT
Greenhouse Instablation and Utilization
4.01     The project was highly successful in supporting one of its key goals,
the expansion of vegetable production under greenhouses. During the period of
the project, greenhouse area expanded from 131 ha (1978) to 1,460 ha (1985).
Further, the greenhouse area financed by the project, approximately 1,241 ha,
exceeded the project target of 1,000 ha by 24 %. The rate of installation was
admittedly much slower than envisaged at appraisal, but this appears to be due
to the adverse weather conditions during the first four years of the project.
4.02     The fact that during the project period approximately 219 additional
ha of greenhouses devoted to vegetables were constructed with non-project
financing (commercial funds or self-financing) may also be viewed as a
positive, although indirect, outcome of the project. Further, after the
completion of the project, vegetable production under greenhouses continued to
expand; in 1986-7 an additional 46 ha of greenhouses were constructed,
bringing total vegetable area under greenhouses to 1506 ha. In the context of
the technology transfer process, this represents successful and continuing
private sector diffusion of the technology which was demonstrated and proven
with Government and Bank support.
4.03     Another positive but indirect outcome which may be attributed to the
project was the initiation of winter flower production under greenhouses in
the early 1980's. Greenhouse area devoted to flowers expanded from 30 ha in
1982-3 to 145 ha in 1986-7 (9% of total greenhouse area).
4.04     While the project exceeded its target in total greenhouse
installation, the regional distribution of greenhouse construction did not
conform to the pattern envisaged at appraisal. Initially it was expected that
about 53% of the green,uses would be installed in the southern Souss/Massa
area, where green peppers were the predominant crop. However ultimately only
27X were installed in this region, due largely to the following factors: (i)
the strong local prices for peppers vis-a-vis export prices and the lack of
encouragement for greenhouse construction for local market production; and
(ii) the relative lack of research, extension, and marketing support available
for pepper producers compared to the quality and amount of support provided to
tomato producers.
4.05     Despite the success of the greenhouse construction component, much
improvement is apparently still needed to enhance the ability of the operators
to utilize this technology. During the last supervision mission (early 1985)
a Bank horticulturalist observed a number of technical problems in greenhouse
operation, which included mainly greenhouse ventilation and temperature
control, plant and soil disease, fertilization and plant nutrition, irrigation
methods, and soil salinity. He noted that most of these problems had not been
addressed in a systematic manner in the applied research activities and that
extension agents were unable to advise farmers with adequate precision about
these problems. He advocated that intensive training programs be undertaken
for researchers, extension personnel, and farmers, and that the research
stations be better equipped. He concluded that /the potential for improvement
in yields and quality is great, if present technical production problems are
resolved'.

Open Field Production Improvements
4.06     The last data provided on open field producing areas actually
improved indicates that as of mid-1983 support had been provided on
4,000-4,400 ha, or 50-S5% of the project target. Much of this shortfall was
accounted for by the failure to achieve the targets for introduction of the
hybrid varieties; the latest data available in the project files indicates
that as of 1983 the area in hybrid tomatoes totalled 3,165 ha, 652 of the
target of 6,000 ha, while in 1982 the area in hybrid green peppers had reached
only 65 ha, or 13% of the target of 500 ha. During the early project years
this failure was attributed largely to farmers' fear of continuing unfa' orable
weather conditions, but no data or explanations were available for the last
three years of the projeL    There is also very little information on the
impact of the open field improvements in terms of yield or quality
imnrovements or financial results.
Diversification and Expansion of Exports
4.07     A principal objective of the project was to reduce Morocco's export
concentration on tomatoes. The project had no impact in the attainment of
this objective-at the time of project completion, the concentration on
tomatoes had actually increased from 952 to 96% of the total volume of winter
vegetable exports. This is largely due to the fact that the expected
three-fold expansion in the export of various other products, mainly green
peppers, squash, and green beans, failed to materialize, and by the end of the
project exports of these products had fallen to well below pre-project levels.
4.08     One principal factor expected to contribute to the diversification of
exports was the anticipated change in cropping patterns under the new
greenhouses, as well as in open fields. However at project completion there
was a significant divergence between expected and actual patterns; most
notably, tomatoes, which were expected to cover 452 of the area under
greenhouses, actually covered 80X, while the area planted in green peppers
reached only about 10% of total greenhouse area versus the 35S expected at
appraisal. The expected and actual cropping patterns for both greenhouse and
open field crops are presented in Table 6.

4.09     There are several major factors which explain the project's failure
to achieve the expected cropping patterns. First, many farmers had
traditionally specialized in tomato production, and much better technical and
marketing support was provided for tomato producers than for the producers of
other crops; the short-term credit coverage provided by CNCA for tomato
production was also higher than for other crops. Second, tomatoes were much
more profitable than many of the other crops; this was due to such factors as
the higher packing :ind transport costs for the other more perishable products,
the unskilled packing house workers' inability to properly package the new
products (which resulted in product damage and lower prices), and to the
relatively low yields obtained for other crops, which may in part be
attributed to the lack of research and extension support. Third, farmers
resisted diversification because of labor recruitment, training, and
management problems; this was particularly true for the more labor intensive
crops such as green beans. Fourth, increasing soil salinity negatively
affected some of the new crops, particularly green beans; as a result, many
farmers shifted their production to potatoes, which better tolerated the
salinity. Fifth, farmers considered the new crops as highly risky, even under
greenhouse conditions, due to such factors as the unresolved plant disease
problems which affected several of the crops. Most of the above factors were
not clearly understood until the 1987 completion of the vegetable production
and marketing study, and thus corrective measures were not taken during
implementation.
4.10     The export levels achieved during the course of the project fell far
short of appraisal expectations-during most years, exports remained below
pre-project levels; exports in Year 7 exceeded appraisal base year performance
by only 12 and represented only 442-of the appraisal target for Year 4. The
principal reasons for this considerable shortfall are: (i) failure to attain
the expected rate and level of yield increases for all crops; (ii) decline of
open field tomato exports, due partly to producers' inability to achieve the
necessary export quality standards and hence the diversion of these products
to the local market; (iii) failure of even the greenhouse tomato producers to
attain the projected export yields (the output per hectare which is
exported)-by the later project years, 50 tons per ha were exported, although
a rate of 75 tons per ha had been anticipated; (iv) diversion of certain
crops, particularly green peppers and melons, to the local market because of
relatively attractive prices, uncertainty over the prices OCE would obtain,
and quicker cost-recovery offered by the local market (OCE repayments to
producers usually required several months waiting time); and (v) diversion of
much of the green bean crop to local canning factories.
4.11     Although the project fell far short of its export targets, Bank staff
believe that without the project-supported greenhouse production, Moroccan
vegetable exports during the project period would have shown a serious
decline. The greenhouses enabled farmers to achieve significantly higher
yields than those attained in open field production; during the project
greenhouse tomato yields were about twice cpen field tomato yields, while
greenhouse green pepper yields were about three times the open field yields
for green peppers. The greenhouses also enabled producers to adapt their
production schedule to the increasingly restrictive EEC import calendar,
reduced climatic risk, and enabled farmers to achieve the improved levels of
produce quality and homogeneity which were increasingly demanded by the
European market.

4.12     A comparison of export levels and export yields achieved during the
project with appraisal targets is presented in Table 7. Annex 1 provides
information on the yields obtained for the various crops included in the
project.
4.13     The failure of farmers to achieve projected yield levels after
weather conditions normalized may be largely attributable to weaknesses in
research and extension support. However, other important factors which were
not anticipated at appraisal also contributed to the yield shortfalls; these
include: (1) the installation of a significant proportion of greenhouses which
did not meet project technical specifications (in the early project years at
least half of the new greenhouses failed to meet the design specifications);
(2) the failure to install the drip irrigation systems which were anticipated
in half of the greenhouses; by late 1984 these systems were being used on only
72 of total greenhouse area; and (3) the failure to meet the open field
targets for hybrid seed use and the installation of improved irrigation
systems.
4.14     The initiation of winter flower production under greenhouses, which
was most likely stimulated by the project-sponsored expansion of greenhouse
winter vegetable production, enabled flower producers to significantly
increase their yields compared to open field flower yields. Recent data
indicates that operators using unheated greenhouses (91X of the total area)
are achieving yields which are 2222 above those of open field producers, while
farmers using heated greenhouses are reaching yields which are 550% higher.

Further, as a result of the introduction of greenhouse flower production,
Moroccan flower exports have expanded dramatically from 121 tons in 1982-3 to
1005 tons in 1986-?, a 7312 increase.
DiversifLcation of ExpIt Markets
4.15     The project aimed to initiate efforts to reduce Morocco's dependence
on the French and West German markets, which before the project absorbed 952
of winter vegetable exports; although the volume of exports to both countries
was expected to increase, because of significantly increased exports to other
countries the proportion to France and West Germany was to decline. No
precise target was specified. Little progress was made towards this objective
during the project; by 1983-4 these two countries still accounted for 93% of
Morocco's winter vegetable exports. However the concentration on the French
market had increased from 71S (1979-80) to 79% (1983-4), while the volume and
proportion of winter vegetable exports to West Germany showed a significant
decline.
4.16     The appraisal objectives for the diversification of Morocco's winter
tomato export markets were more specific-the dependence on the French market
was to be reduced from 67S to 542 during the four year project period, while
the percentage of winter tomato exports to West Germany was to decrease from
292 of the total to 22X. (However the volume of winter tomatoes to both
countries was to increase by about 502). The project was unsuccessful in the
achievement of these targets; by project year 6 (1984-5) the concentration on
the French market, a natural market for Morocco, had unsurprisingly increased
to 762, while the proportion of winter tomato exports absorbed by West Germany
had decreased to 16% because of the declining volume of sales.
4.17     Annex 2 shows the volume and proportion of Morocco's winter vegetable
exports to each major importing country during the first five years of the
project, while Annex 3 provides the exports by product to France during this
period.
4.18     The increasing concentration on the French market during the project
is largely attributable to OCE's knowledge of and experience with this market,
the organization's lack of active marketing strategies for other countries and
the failure to achieve the expected expansion of exports to these countries.
The Bank did not fully support and encourage OCE in the achievement of the
diversification objective.
EEploynent Generation
4.19     A principal objective of the project and, in the Bank's view, a major
justification was the expected employment generation, estimated at 16,000
jobs. However no information was ever reported by the Bank on this subject;
it is uncertain whether any data was collected by Moroccan agencies.
Nevertheless, it can be assumed that actual employment generation was less
than half of appraisal expectations because of the considerable shortfalls in
production and exports. However without the project, employment would most
likely have declined, like exports, to well below pre-project levels.

Adaptation of OCE's Marketing ?
4.20     An initial project goal was the replacement of dockside auction
sales, which were used by OCE in the French market, by pres-programmed sales to
panels of importers/distributors. In the early project years OCE did
establish a system of panels; however only l0X of the sales of tomatoes, the
principal export product, were channelled through this system. By 1981 OCE
had decided that a complete shift to panel sales was unnecessary, arguing that
its modified system of dockside sales was more effective and profitable. The
Bank opposed this view, but OCE resisted further significant changes in its
marketing techniques. Ultimately the Government, OCE, and the Bank agreed
that the issue should be carefully studied by an independent expert in the
context of a comprehensive analysis of Morocco's vegetable production and
marketing systems. The study, which was finalized well after project
completion, contained numerous useful suggestions concerning ways in which OCE
might improve its marketing methods, including increased pre-programming oL
sales to importers in order to assure greater predictability and reliability
of supply.
4.21     The prospects for sustainability of benefits from the project's main
category of investment, the greenhouse component, appear very good, if
weaknesses in research and extension and in the export marketing system are
corrected. A judgement about the sustainability of benefits from the other
project components is not possible, due to the inadequacy of the information
in the project files about their performance.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01     At appraisal the economic rate of return for the project was
estimated at 462 over twenty years. This estimate was based on the expected
net incremental production under the project. Farmers were to achieve the
projected yields within four years and full development production was to have
been achieved within seven years. All project components were considered
interdependent and necessary for project success; however economic rates of
return were calculated for several separate components, including: (1) the
agricultural component alone, without the investments in packing and quality
control facilities, (402); and (2) the packing and quality control facilities
alone, with benefits based only on the incremental production handled, (752).
5.02     The financial and economic rates of return on typical farm investment
models for the various project crops are as follows:
Open Field Production       Greenhouse Production

5.03     Due to certain data limitations, it is not possible to reestimate the
economic rate of return for the project or its individual components according
to a methodology which is identical to that used at appraisal. Most notably,
there is no data concerning the yield and production impact of the open field
improvements or on the private sector investments in packing stations. There
is also incomplete data on the operating costo and returns to the packing and
quality control stations. Nevertheless, with the data which is availab'e, it
is possible to estimate the rate of return for the greenhouse component in a
relatively precise manner and to roughly estimate the rate of return for the
overall project.
5.04     For the greenhouse component alone, for which there is relatively
complete and accurate data, the reestimated economic rate of return is
approximately 31%. This estimate includes the benefits from the incremental
production from the greenhouses, assuming that they displaced an equivalent
area of open field production. The estimate also includes 50Z of the
investment and maintenance costs of all marketing and storage infrastructure,
100% of research/training costs, 100X of the cost of seedling production, and
50X of extension costs. Half of actual project investments in packing and
quality control facilities are also included, although no operating costs or
benefits frcm these facilities are included (had it been possible to include
these latter items in the calculation, as well as private sector investments
in packing stations, the rate of return would undoubtedly been higher than 312
since the packing and quality control activities showed extremely high rates
of return at appraisal (77-802 for new and improved packing stations and 50%
for the quality control centers)). Further details concerning the assumptions
used in this calculation are provided in Annex 4.
5.05     Despite the yield and production shortfalls during the project the
estimated rate of return for the greenhouse activities are relatively high due
to the unexpectedly high prices received for both export and local market
produce and the extremely conservative price estimates used in the appraisal
projections. Data on the appraisal estimates and the actual prices received
for the principal project crops are included in Annex 5. As the data
indicate, producer prices for export greenhouse tomatoes during the project
averaged 2321 of appraisal expectations; local market prices for tomatoes
averaged 259% of appraisal estimates and local prices for green peppers
averaged 1631 of the anticipated levels. Of the principal crops produced
under the project, only exported green peppers showed prices which were below
appraisal estimates; as a result of the low export prices and the much higher
net prices in the local market, much of the green pepper crop was diverted to
the local market.
5.06     lecause of the lack of data on the impact of open field improvements
financed under the project and on the packing station investments, operating
costs, and benefits, the overall rate of return for the project can only be
roughly estimated. Assuming a 10 increase in the yields of the improved open
field areas, and omitting private sector investments in packing stations as
well as operating costs and benefits for all packing activities, the rate of
return for the overall project is reestimated at 12X. This is most likely a
conservative estimate due to the omission of the highly profitable packing and
quality control activities and to the fact that the yield differential in the
open field areas may well have been considerably higher thar 10%.

6.01     Project design provided that implementation and management
responsibility would be shared by three institutions, MARA, OCE, and CNCA,
with MARA executing overall project leadership. There was some initial
disagreement between MARA and OCE over the appropriate role for each of these
agencies and apparently some dissatisfaction with the Government decision to
assign responsibility for the open field operations to MARA, with OCE
directing the greenhouse component. However ultimately the three institutions
established cooperative relationships and successfully coordinated their
separate but interrelated functions.
6.02     The key weakness in project implementation was the failure to
immediately establish the horticultural research/extension training programs
under the leadership of highly experienced, senior horticulturalists. These
personnel were to play the critical role of evaluating and anticipating farmer
problems with the new technologies and crops, identifying essential researcl
issues, designing and executing appropriate research programs, and equipping
extension agents with the skills to successfully support participating
farmers. When it was agreed that the research/extension programs would be
directed by Moroccan horticulturalists who were to be sent overseas for
long-term training, this training should have been initiated immediately;
further, until the completion of the training, other personnel (short- or
long-term consultants) should have been assigned to start up the
research/extension programs.
6.03     Government budgetary and bureaucratic constraints caused delays in
local currency and foreign exchange allocations for several of the project's
key components, thereby negatively affecting project performance. The
activities most affected were the construction, staffing, and equipping of the
research/extension centers, and the vegetable production and marketing study.
6.04     OCE and CNCA were extremely successful in supporting the installation
of greenhouse facilities on a timely basis. OCE's extension personnel were
also very energetic in their efforts to support greenhouse users, and the
organization showed flexibility and ingenuity in its emergency efforts to aid
farmers in repairing weather damage to the greenhouses before the start of the
1983 crop year.
6.05     The export marketing strategy pursued by OCE, particularly the
increasing concentration on the French market and the lack of diversification
to other expanding and attractive markets, was less than optimal. In
addition, it would have been extremely useful had the vegetable production and
marketing study, which was strongly advocated by the project preparation
teams, been executed at the start of the project.
6.06     Improvements could have been made in the quality and timeliness of
project reporting. It would also have been extremely useful if OCE had
complied with the several Government and Bank requests to analyze its
marketing practices and alternative options.

6.07     The performance of the contractors who executed the project
construction activities was satisfactory. The suppliers responsible for the
delivery of greenhouse and other farm equipment also executed their role in a
timely and satisfactory manner.
6.08     Throughout implementation of project studies disputes arose between
Government and consultants over the timeliness and amount of payments due to
the consultants (para. 3.30).
6.09     The final report of the vegetable production and marketing study was
completed after a one year delay following protracted discussions regarding
the contents fo the draft report.
The akP
6.10     The appraisal analysis has been too optimistic about the rate at
which the greenhouse and open field technologies could be fully mastered by
the large number of small farmers expected to participate in the project,
particularly given the need to precede farmer adoption of the technologies by
the construction of research and extension facilities, agricultural research,
and the training of extension agents. Even if the research and extension
components had been implemeuted as designed, there would presumably have been
a several year time lag before research results would have become available,
agents would have been fully capable of advising farmers, and farmers would
have been convinced by demonstration activities to utilize the costly and
apparently risky new technologies. As a result, the appraisal projections for
crop yields, export volume, and crop diversification do appear to have been
overly optimistic for the four-year project period envisaged at appraisal.
6.11     The appraisal team also decided not to accept the repeated advice of
the preparation teams' and other Bank staff concerning the need for an
in-depth export marketing study at the project's outset. The execution of
such a study at that time could have helped to dispel the growing dispute,
which first developed during the appraisal mission, over OCE's techniques and
could have identified other equally pressing marketing problems which needed
attention during the project. (The study which was ultimately commissionc-d
proved extremely useful in the identification of such problems).
6.12     In project supervision, there appear to have been several
weaknesses. Most notably, there was insufficient focus on farmer production
problems, which strongly affected cropping patterns, yields and expor.i -ilds
and thus were critical to project performance. When the senior
horticulturalists who were to focus on these problems were not hied
(para.3.15), senior consultants saould have been provided to direct the
research and extension component.
6.13     Supervision missions should also have regularly included experienced
horticulturalists to monitor project progress. As an appraisal team member
noted, /We knew at appraisal that the introduction of the highly sophisticated
greenhouse technology would require intense supervision by a specialist. We
45440 SC



- 32 -
expected that a horticulturalist would participate in each supervision
mission'. Instead, during the first five years of the project there was only
one brief visit by a horticulturalist and no apparent Bank follow-up on her
recommendations. When a senior horticulturalist was finally included in a
supervision mission, during the project's last year, he observed numerous
serious technical problems which he felt should have been identified and
addressed early in the course of the project (para.4.05).
6.14     The farm production problems would have become clear at a much
earlier point had there been greater attention to the collection of farm-level
data and the monitoring of farmers' views and activities. For example,
throughout the project it was unclear, at least to Bank supervision dissions,
why the crop diversification efforts were failing. Similarly, available
reports and files contain only intermittent information on the yields achieved
for the various crops included in the project (para. 3.24).
6.15     Greater attention should also have been paid to the operations of the
packing stations and quality control centers. For example, the appraisal
report noted that at both facilities there were extremely high rates of
produce rejection, largely reflecting an inability of farmers to meet required
export standards; the project planned to address this problem, but there was
no mention in the files of further monitoring of the issue. Further, after
the project's completion the vegetable production and marketing study revealed
that there were numerous serious problems in the operations of the facilities,
including most notably the inability of the labor force to grade and pack
according to export standards, as well as resistance to handling the diverse
range of new export products.
6.16     The failure to identify on time and monitor these and other problems
in the crop distribution and marketing system may in part be attributed to the
lack of specialized marketing expertise in the composition of the supervision
teams during the second half of the project. Tha last supervision mission
which included a marketing expert was conducted in mid-1982, three and
one-half years before the project's completion. (A marketing specialist later
advised on the vegetable study, but he was not responsible for any broader
supervision functions.) Although there was disagreement between OCE and the
Bank over the issue of OCE's marketing techniques, more intense marketing
supervision could at least have contributed to greater project success in the
other marketing objectives, particularly the diversification of export markets.
6.17     Information gathering and record keeping on several other issues
could also have been significantly improved (para.3.24).
6.18     The frequency of Bank supervision of the project was satisfactory.
However there was one significant gap in supervision, the 13 month period from
late 1983 to late 1984. Further, the last supervision mission was conducted
in March 1985, nine months before the completion of the project. No
information was gathered on the final outcome of the project and there was no
follow-up concerning the implementation of the numerous recommendations made
by the Bank horticulturalist who participated in the final mission.

6.19     Despite these weaknesses, the Bank displayed considerable flexibility
in its reaction to certain problems encountered during implementation
(particularly procurement issues and the completion of the vegetable
production and marketing study) and in its acceptance of the numerous design
changes requested by the Government.
VII. ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01     The interdependence of system components.  Morocco's vegetable
production and export marketing sector represents a complex system with
numerous distinct yet interdependent components. The overall performance of
the system depends on the satisfactory functioning of each of these elements;
weakness at any key points in the system undermines the strength of the system
as a whole. The project was conceived as an integrated effort to address
problems at each of the most critical stages in the chain from the selection
and provision of inputs through to the packaging and exporting of the crops
produced. Yet the precise nature of the problems at each of these stages was
not well understood before the start of the project, nor were many of these
issues clarified during the course of the project. As a result, many critical
factors affecting Morocco's vegetable export performance were largely ignored;
instead attention was focussed mainly on a few key elements in the system,
such as greenhouse installation and export marketing techniques. Despite the
clear success of the project in the greenhouse installation component, the
failure to adequately address other critical components prevented the project
from achieving the overall degree of success which was clearly possible, even
in the highly competitive and increasingly restrictive export environment.
7.02     Technical support for technology transfer.  The widespread
introduction of complex new technologies, such as the greenhouses, the hybrid
varieties and the new crops, clearly implies the need for comprehensive
technical support and training for the users of these technologies. Although
farmer training and extension support were provided for in the project design,
some Bank staff questioned the adequacy of the provisions and whether the
existing extension services would be able to immediately provide the quality
of support necessary for the successful utilization of the new technologies.
The initial expectation that these technologies could be fully mastered so
quickly proved to be overly optimistic, although the lack of experienced
technical guidance and sustained technical supervision for the research and
training activities also clearly contributed to the shortfalls in both the
greenhouse and open field operations.
7.03     The phasing of technical assistance.  The project demonstrates that
particularly in operations involving the introduction of complex new
technologies, it is highly desirable that any necessary technical assistance
be provided at the start of the operations. This is essential not only to
minimize user risk with the technologies, but also to maximize potential
project impact. The Bank's decision to accept substantial delays in the
hiring and training of the research/training directors contributed to limiting
the ultimate success of the project. In addition, it would have been
extremely useful had the vegetable production and marketing study been
executed at the start of the project; the study identified important issues
and problems which had not previously been understood and thus were not
addressed by the project.
4544e. sC



- 34 -
7.04     The technical composition of supervision teams.  The limited success
in achieving some of the project's objectives is in part attributable to
relative weaknesses in the staffing of Bank supervision, particularly the
absence of appropriate technical expertise in the supervision teams. Most
notable was the difficulty to provide continuous technical supervision by an
experienced horticulturalist-during the first five years of the project only
one supervision team included a horticulturalist.   In addition, the intensity
of supervision of the marketing activities should also have been much greater;
the last mission which included a specialist to monitor progress in the
attainment of the marketing objectives was conducted in mid-1982, three and
one-half years before the project's completion. After the disagreement over
the issue of dockside and panel sales intensified in 1982-3, it was decided to
await the results of the vegetable production and marketing study to resolve
the dispute. This gave a good reason of OEC not to address other weaknesses
in Morocco's domestic and export marketing system.
7.05     Management and marketing assistance.  The export objectives of the
project-to significantly increase export volume, to alter the mix of export
products, and to develop new markets-required a fundamental alteration of
OCE's operations; however no explicit, sustained assistance was provided to
assist the organization in accomplishing the management changes implied by
these objectives. More continuous support by a marketing advisor, as well as
short-term training for OCE's staff, could have been useful in the early
stages of the project. Advice and training would have been particularly
useful in the identification of new markets and market niches, the
determination of the varietal and other requirements of these markets, and in
design and execution of strategies to penetrate these markets. The
information eventually provided in the vegetable production and marketing
study addressed many of these issues and, had it been available earlier in the
project, management and marketing advisory assistance and training could have
been useful to OCE. The Project, however, played indirectly an important
catalytic role in shaping the marketing and export liberalization program of
Government and in eliminating OCE monopoly.
7.06          Follow-up on lessons learnt.  As a follow-up on lessons learnt
in this project, the Bank has recently appraised a Research and Extension
Project (FY89) to tackle existing weaknesses in research and extension in
Morocco. Also, in 1988 a sector study examined the most recent development
trends in the subsectors of greenhouse production, agro-processing, and fruit
and vegetable export as part of the preparation of the National Agricultural
Credit Project (FY89) through CNCA, which is already successfully encouraging
the financing of investments in the expanding private sector in agriculture in
Morocco.

ANNEX 4
Reestimation of the Economic Rate of Return
Greenhouse Component
The great majority of crops produced under greenhouses were tomatoes
and green peppers; only very small amounts of other crops were produced under
the project. In addition, relatively complete data are available on the costs
and benefits of tomato and green pepper production during the project years,
whereas only limited information is available concerning the other crops.
Therefore, the economic analysis of the greenhnuse component is based on the
actual area planted in tomatoes, with the residual assumed to have been
planted in green peppers.
Economic costs and benefits are based on the incremental production
from greenhouses, assuming that greenhouse area displaced an equivalent area
of open field production.
Economie Costs: The following costs are included: (1) actual
project investments in greenhouses, as well as an estimate of additional
private sector investments, which were thought to account for 15% of total
greenhouse area; (2) periodic replacement costs for the greenhouses; (3)
annual production costs of the both the project-financed and privately
constructed greenhouses; (4) 1002 of the cost of research/training and of
seedling production, even though these components serviced both greenhouse
operators and, to a lesser extent, open field producers; (5) 50% investments
and operating costs of the port storage facilities and roads; (6) 50X of
project investments in packing stations and quality control centers (no
estimates were included for private sector investments in packing stations or
the operating costs of the packing stations and quality control stations); and
(7) 502 of extension costs; and (8) 20S of medium-term on-farm investments.
Economic Benefits: For local market produce sales, average local
market prices were used for both greenhouse and open field produce; no data
were available on the probable premiums earned in the local market for
greenhouse produce and thus no premiums were assumed. No benefits were
included for the packing and quality control stations; this results in a
conservative estimate of the economic rate of return since at appraisal the
activities of the packing stations were expected to be the component with the
highest rate of return (751).
Overall Project
As in the analysis of the greenhouse component, the analysis of the
overall project is based on the actual area planted in in tomatoes with the
residual assumed to be planted in green peppers. Only project investments in
packing and quality control stations are included; no private sector
investments in packing stations or operating costs or benefits for these
4S44 .SC

facilities are estimated. Had it been possible to include the economic costs
and benefits of the packing and quality control stations in the analysis, the
rate of return for the overall project would most likely have been
considerably higher than 12X.
Due to the lack of data concerning the yield impact of the open field
improvements made, it was necessary to estimate this impact; improved open
field areas were assumed to show a 10% yield differential over the average
yields for all open field areas.
For both the greenhouse and overall project analyses, the economic
conversion factors used were those calculated at appraisal. Inflation was
assumed to be 82 throughout the 20-year period covered by the analyses (in the
late 1970's and early 1980's inflation was higher than 8X; it then dropped to
2.52 and is projected at about 62 during the late 1980's and 1990's).
