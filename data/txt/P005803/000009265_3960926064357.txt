MEMORANDlM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR THE SANA'A - HODEIDAH ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the YAR for SDR 14.0 million (US$18.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance a highway rehabilitation and technical
*           assistance project.  The project would be cofinanced by the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AF) for SDR 18.7 million (US$24.0 million
equivalent) and by the OPEC Fund for SDR 3.4 million (US$4.4 million
equivalent).
2.       Background.  The modernization of the transport system in YAR started
in the 1960s. During the 1962-72 period, only minor progress was achieved.
In 1962, the road system consisted of only one asphalted road (Sana'a -
Hodeidah; 226 km) and about 6,000 km of mostly primitive tracks. Port
facilities were limited to three small berths at Hodeidah only accessible to
8,000 dwt ships and to some lighterage facilities at Mocha. There was no air
service. However, since 1972 there has been significant development in the
sector. The Highway Authority (HA) and the Ports and Marine Affairs
Corporation (PMAC), were established in 1972 under the chairmanship of the
Minister of Public Works. Local Councils for Cooperative Development (LCCDs)
were consolidated in 1973 to serve the development of rural communities.
YEMENIA, the national airline, was created in 1974. Three consecutive
development programs 1973-76, 1977-81 and 1982-86, supported by significant
external aid, provided major expansion in the transport sector. IDA credits
financed one port and six highway projects for a total of US$66.0 million.
Achievements have been impressive. In 1986, the total length of the main road
network reached 3,600 km of which 2,600 were paved and there were 30,000 km of
local roads suitable for four-wheel drive vehicles. The port of Hodeidah can
now handle 25,000 dwt ships and has six berths with adequate storage
facilities and a second container berth is under construction. Mocha has two
alongside berths and sufficient storage facilities. Three international
airports at Sana'a, Hodeidah and Taiz are open to traffic. Important
institutional achievements have also been reached. The HA and PMAC are now
efficient organizations with financing, design, construction and maintenance
departments - staffed with qualified Yemeni supported by expatriate experts.
Management and operation of the road and port subsectors are satisfactory.
The role and efficiency of LCCDs have been strengthened through the
establishment of a central coordination agency. YEMENIA is a profitable
company operating a comprehensive domestic r.etwork and some international
routes. Public investment in transport has averaged 22Z of total public
investment over the last 10 years, an adequate figure considering the state of
development of YAR and its difficult topography. However, during the last
three years (1983-1986), the decline in oil prices, a 502 reduction in foreign
aid and a 602 diminution in workers' remittances entailed a 26Z cut in public
investment. The recent (1984/85) discovery of oil resources would only
relieve partially some of these economic pressures, and consequently the
Government transport sector strategy under the Third Five-Year Plan (1987-91)
stresses the importance of a policy which would: (i) preserve and enhance the
efficiency of existing facilities through rehabilitation and maintenance;
(ii) reduce construction costs through the progressive involvement of the
private domestic contracting industry in civil works; and (iii) secure
adequate and equitable revenues from the users of transport infrastructure and
services. IDA supports the Government's strategy in the Transport Sector.



-2-
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The primary objective of the proposed project is
to assist the Government in its rehabilitation/improvement program of the main
road network. This would help to preserve valuable capital investmeats
necessary for the exploitation of economic resources, to avoid high costs of
complete road reconstruction and to reduce vehicle operating expenses. Other
objectives ire to: (i) develop the capability of the private domestic
contracting industry; (ii) encourage reforms in transport institutions; (iii)
support recessary changes in fuel pricing policy and vehicle taxation through
an appropriate participation of the heavy vehicle users in the cost of wear
and tear to the network; (iv) protect road infrastructure through adequate
allocation of funds. to support a systematic maintenance program; and (v)
assist in attracting and coordinating external financing.
4.       Project Description.  To achieve these objectives, the project would
include: (i) road works which consist of the rehabilitation and strengthening
of the Sana'a - Hodeidah road, linking the capital Sana'a with Hodeidah the
main port, and the reconstruction of flood-damaged sections and bridges of the
Sana'a-Marib, Taiz-Al Mafraq and Hodeidah-Harad roads; (ii) technical
assistance (a) for supervision of the Sana'a - Hodeidah road works; (b) to the
private domestic construction industry to strengthen its civil works
implementation capability and improve its efficiency; and (c) for the
preparation of future projects and of an action plan addressing transport
sector policy and institutional issues; and (iii) provision for road
maintenance equipment. The HA would be the executing agency. A three and
one-half year project implementation period is envisaged. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$57.0 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$43.9 million or 772, of which US$18.0 million (SDR
14.0 million equivalent) or 322 would be financed under the proposed IDA
credit. The Sana'a - Hodeidah road works will be carried out under four
self-contained contracts and IDA would finance one contract for the road
section between Sana'a and Mafhaq. Other contracts would be financed by the
AF and OPEC Fund. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the YAR are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map covering the project areas is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.6678-YAR dated September 22, 1987,
is being circulated separately.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA transport sector strategy in the
YAR, as recently defined in the Highway Master Plan of April 1986, focusses on
the development of infrastructure to support productive economic sectors, and
addresses institutional and policy issues, such as manpower development,
institutional build-up and infrastructure conservation. Throughout its seven
previous projects in the transport sector, IDA has emphasized the importance
of subjecting expenditure proposals to economic analysis, of allocating
adequate resources to maintenance, of providing a firm revenue base for
transport expenditures and of improving planning and monitoring techniques.
This has led to substantial progress on some important issues, particularly on
the allocation of funds for and improvement of road maintenance operations, on
the passing and enforcement of axle-load control legislation, on the
establishment of regular accounting and audit practices and on the
introduction of formal project appraisal. The proposed project is in line
with such a strategy as it will assist in rationalizing transport
expenditures, improving sector efficiency, reducing transport costs and future
highway reconstruction needs, developing private domestic construction
capability, addressing fuel pricing issues and reforming road user charges.
The continuation of IDA involvement through resource transfer and advice is
important for the effective continuation and expansion of this strategy.



- 3 -
6.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following actions:
(i) the employment of consultants to supervise Sana'a - Hodeidah road works,
as a condition of effectiveness; (ii) the employment of three experts by
March 31, 1988 to assist the domestic construction industry; (iii) a 52 annual
real increase in the routine and recurrent road maintenance budgets for the
years 1987-91; (iv) the preparation of terms of reference, staffing and
equipment plan for an expanded Planning Department in the HA by December 31,
1987;-(v)-an annual review, with IDA in September of eac.. year, of progress in
the sector and proposals for investments, maintenance and policy issues;
(vi) a review of the fuel pricing mechanism to be completed by December 31,
1988 and the results discussed with IDA upon completion; (vii) the submission
by December 31, 1988 of proposals for heavy vehicle licence fee restructuring
by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works; and (viii) the scope of the
studies to be carried out under the technical assistance component. The
signing by the Government of Loan Agreements with the AF and OPEC Fund is also
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed project.
7.       Justification.  The project would rehabilitate and improve the trunk
road link between the capital Sana'a and the main port Hodeidah, thus avoiding
future high reconstruction costs, and reducing current progressive increases
in road maintenance. Vehicle operating cost savings would be generated by the
reduction of wear and tear of spare parts and tyres as a result of reduction
in surface roughness. Passenger time-savings and reduction in road accidents
are also expected. The repair of the roads and bridges heavily damaged during
the May 1987 flood will reestablish normal traffic with the Marib area and
avoid consequently the paralysis of the Safir oil refinery. Parallel to the
physical improvement of services provided by HA, the project will also promote
institutional, financial and administrative restructuring of the sector. The
introduction of new fuel pricing mechanism, the development of a road user
taxation system based on the damaging effect of vehicles on the road, and the
proposed technical as'sistance and training compqnents, would improve
Government capability to plan, finance and monitor sector development. The
improvement of the efficiency and implementation capacity of the domestic road
construction industry would generate additional employment apd improve
financial and economic returns. The overall project economic rate of return
is estimated at 29X.
8.       Risks.  The project is not subject to any unusual risk.  However,
allowance has been made for possible delays in the implementation of the civil
works component. All the four sections of the Sana'a-Hodeidah road are
economically viable and works can be carried out independently on each. Since
it is an integral part of the Government's strategy, the implementation of the
proposed institutional strengthening within the project time frame would not
be an issue. The project's technical assistance component will also help to
minimize project risks.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

a/ The status of projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IOA-financed projects in execution. which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
tV Beginning with Credit 1067-YAR in 1980, credit amounts have been denominated in
Special Drawing Rights (SORs) and the US$ figures in the 0IDA Credit Amountw column
are the US$ equivalents of SORs at the time of negotiations. The US$ amounts in the
Undisbursed' column are the USS equivalents of the undisbursed SOR balance at the
US$/SOR exchange rate of March 31. 1987. Consequently. due to the steady decline in
the US$/SOR exchange rate since 1984 those credits which have disbursed relatively
little of the credit indicate undisbursed US$ equivalents in excess of the IDA credit
amount. At the current US$/SOR exchange rate the "Total of IDA credit amounts and
"Total now held by IDAO would be US$502 million and US$499.4 million respectively.
