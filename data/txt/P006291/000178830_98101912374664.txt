I. THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM
A.   General
1.01      Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world, about the size
of Europe or the continental United States, and distances in it are enormous;
it has over 7,400 km of coastline on the Atlantic, and Belem is more than
4,000 km from Porto Alegre by road'as is Rio de Janeiro from Rio Branco, in
westernmost Acre, by air. In addition to these distances, routes to the
interior must cross the eastern ranges, which often have no easy natural
passes. Behind these ranges, nearly all rivers flow inland to join either
the Amazon or the Plate systems. The seasons are generally severe, with
flooding of rivers and tributaries in the wet season and drought in the
dry season. Initial settlement of the country was mainly along the seashore,
and development of the transportation network fanned out from the major ports.
Only recently has heavier emphasis been placed on the integration of hinter-
land regions, particularly by road; a basic highway network was completed
and largely paved during the last decade. From 1965 to 1970, about 10,000 km
of federal (interstate) highways were built yearly, and a further 5,000 km
were paved; from 1970 to 1975, the pace of new roadworks and paving slowed but
still remained high. Since 1975, however, development of new roads has almost
stopped, and paving has been reduced considerably.
1.02      The Brazilian economy has become highly dependent upon the avail-
ability of highways to bring products to ports and to distribute imports to
their inland destinations. This dependency is reflected in the high share of
traffic moved by road (Table 1.1). In the early 1950's, roads accounted for
about 55% of total freight and about 65% of passenger movements; by 1966,
these shares had risen to almost 70% of freight and 90% of passenger transport.
From 1966 to 1976, the highways' share of freight movements remained relatively
constant, but their share of passenger transport rose to over 95%. The rail-
ways' share of freight traffic increased also, from 15% in 1966 to close to 20%
in 1975. Coastal and inland navigation, which in 1966 moved almost as much as
the railways, decreased to just slightly over 10% of freight traffic in 1975.
Air transport has held a constant share (about 2%) of the passenger traffic
during the last decade.
1.03      Total domestic passenger and freight traffic has been growing in the
last decade (1966-1976) at slightly higher rates than GDP, i.e., about 12% and
10% respectively vis-a-vis 8.5% for GDP. Passenger movements since 1966 have
grown most in the aviation (14% p.a.) and the highway (13%) modes, but have
decreased in the railways at an annual rate of almost 3%. For the same period,
freight traffic, measured in ton-km, has also grown most in aviation (21% p.a.),
although this mode still represents a very small proportion of the total.
Rail freight has had the next biggest growth (13%); highway freight has grown
at just over 10%, while coastal and inland navigation freight has increased at
only 6% p.a.
B.   Highways
1.04      Road transport and highways are dealt with in detail in Chapters
II and III respectively and are therefore omitted from this general review
of the transport system.

C.   Railways
1.05      Since 1854, and mostly between 1870 and 1920, a total of about
39,000 km of rail was built. Some lines have been abandoned, and, by 1976,
about 29,500 km were still operating. Almost all the lines first built served
export trades, linking main ports with production areas. They were mostly
short lines, privately owned and independent from one another. The more
extensive lines were developed in the Sao Paulo region in particular to haul
coffee; these expanded farther into the south along the east coast. More than
80% of the lines now operated are in the south and southeast. This concentra-
tion is unlikely to change in the future since most new construction projects
are geared to the strengthening of the principal transport corridors, especially
those channeling exports.
1.06      Most of the railways have now been nationalized - the majority
under the administration of Rede Ferroviaria Federal (RFFSA) and a few under
the Ferrovia Paulista (FEPASA) owned by the Sao Paulo state government.
There are six independent companies remaining in the country, only one
of which is of significant size, the Estrada de Ferro Vitoria-Minas (EFVM),
which carries iron ore to the port of Tubarao for the Government-owned Cia
Vale do Rio Doce. The two Government-operated rail systems have been running
large deficits in the past. They are subsidized by the Federal and State
Governments, which also support their re-equipping and modernization programs.
These programs concentrate on renovation, electrification and improvement of
rail beds to increase transit capacity.
1.07      Total freight transported by rail in 1976 was 63 billion ton-km.
Of this, 44% was carried on public lines and the rest, mainly iron ore, on
private lines. The EFVM line alone carried over 66 million tons (35 billion
ton-km), mostly iron ore. RFFSA carried 23.4 billion ton-km, or 37% of the
total rail freight traffic, and FEPASA carried under 5 billion ton-km, or
about 7% of the total.
1.08      The Bank has made loans to both RFFSA and FEPASA.  The first loan
to RFFSA was made in 1971 (786-BR) for facilities related to the transport of
iron ore. A second loan in 1975 (1074-BR) helped to finance part of RFFSA's
five-year investment plan. The first loan to FEPASA was made in 1975 (1171-BR)
to help finance part of its multi-year investment plan. There have been
noticeable improvements in operations and general administration since the
Bank's first involvement with the railways. However, the operating deficits of
both railways, although reduced in recent years, are still quite large. The
main problem stems from an inadequate tariff policy, particularly for freight,
and continued provision of uneconomic services such as long-distance and
suburban passenger services and services in the northeast.
1.09      On December 6, 1977, the Conselho Interministerial de Precos (CIP)
decided to deregulate all freight tariffs, thereby removing one major obstacle
to financial soundness. On the question of uneconomic services, the Bank has
consistently maintained that where, for public service reasons, the railways
are not permitted to raise tariffs or to abandon services, they should receive



- 3 -
a specific subsidy for providing such services without, however, relaxing
minimum efficiency standards for operation and administration. Both the
Federal Government and the State Government of Sao Paulo have accepted this
concept, and implementation is expected to start in 1978.
D.   Inland Waterways and Cabotage
1.10      One of the earliest major transport developments in the country was
the founding of the Amazon River Shipping Company in 1852; it later became the
Amazon River Steam Navigation Company and operated a large number of craft
and vessels (it has subsequently been taken over by the Government-controlled
Servicio de Navegacao da Amazonia). Gradually, however, land routes have
replaced inland waterways, particularly in the south, and although there
remain about 40,000 km of navigable rivers in Brazil, they carry a relatively
small share of the traffic.
1.11      In contrast, coastal shipping takes a fairly important place in
the transport sector. Although its share of the market has been decreasing
over the last decade, it is over 32 billion ton-km, still a sizable 11% of the
market. Coastal traffic is carried by several companies regulated by the
Superintendencia Nacional de Marinha Mercante (SUNAMAM), an arm of the Ministry
of Transport. The Brazilian merchant fleet is quite large, and well over half
its tonnage has been constructed in Brazilian shipyards. The Government
pursues a policy of increasing the fleet's share of both the cabotage and the
international market and is consequently investing heavily in specialized
facilities and vessels.
E.   Ports
1.12      There are 38 important deep-water ports in Brazil in addition to
a large number of specialized bulk-facility terminals spotted along the coast.
The three largest general cargo ports are Rio de Janeiro, Santos (near Sao
Paulo) and Porto Alegre; they handled about 18%, 9% and 5% respectively of
total port traffic in 1975. However, Tubarao, Sao Sebastiao and Rio Grande
have shown the fastest rates of increase in volume moved in the last few
years. Total port traffic was about 190 million tons in 1975, of which dry
bulk cargo, bulk liquids and general cargo constituted 51%, 41% and 8% respec-
tively. Traffic is mostly foreign trade (over 80%) and has been growing at
a rate of about 18% per year since 1970.
1.13      Administration of Brazilian ports was recently reorganized along
the lines recommended by management consultants partially financed by Bank
Loan 756-BR. The old Department of Ports and Navigable Waters (DNPVN) was
replaced by a public corporation, the Empresa de Portos do Brasil S.A.
(PORTOBRAS, Law No. 6222 of July 10, 1975). This new organization permits
increased operational flexibility and some relief from the rather rigid
regulations on pay scales, recruitment and the creation of new positions
that constrained the old department. PORTOBRAS has two main functions: to
be a holding company for the country's ports and to allocate investment



-4-
funds made available through the Port Improvement Tax and other Government
sources. PORTOBRAS has turned seven ports into mixed economy companies and
provided them with management assistance to improve their operations and their
financial situation.
F.   Aviation
1.14      Four major airlines dominate Brazilian skies:  Varig, the largest
in South America, Vasp, Cruzeiro do Sul and TransBrasil. Among them, they
own about 100 multi-engine jet aircraft and operate over 190,000 domestic
route-km. There are also countless smaller airlines and air-taxi services
with a total fleet of over 5,500 aircraft serving smaller localities through-
out the country and providing special services such as aerophotography.
1.15      The four major airlines operate internal flights to all state
capitals, supply shuttle service between Rio and Sao Paulo and between Rio
and Belo Horizonte and Brasilia, and also handle some of Brazil's international
traffic. In 1976, they moved about 1.5 million passengers on international
services and about 7.2 million on domestic services. International traffic
moved by Brazilian airlines represents only about 20% of the total number of
international passengers who use Brazilian airports (excluding transit
passengers). The busiest airports are in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Galeao
and Congonhas respectively); each of them handled more than 3 million passengers
last year. Air freight is the fastest growing modal flow in the country; over
700 million ton-km was moved on domestic routes alone in 1976, most of it
originating in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
G.   Organization and Coordination
1.16      The Brazilian transport sector (except aviation) is under the
authority of the Ministry of Transport (Chart 1.1), which controls its opera-
tion through:
(a) two autonomous agencies, called "autarchies:" DNER, which
controls the highway system and road transport, and
SUNAMAM, which controls inland and coastal shipping; and
(b)  four public enterprises:  PORTOBRAS, which runs the country's
ports; RFFSA, which runs most of the railways; EBTU, which
is a holding company for urban transport investments; and
GEIPOT, which is a transportation consulting company providing
support services and advice on request and under contract.
The "autarchies" are specialized agencies endowed with administrative autonomy
and supported by earmarked taxes. Public enterprises are mixed economy
companies with limited liability subject to Brazilian private law. 1/ They
have their own by-laws and regulations and are intended to be self-supporting.
The Ministry of Transport functions as a coordinating body which frames the
1/   At least 51% of the shares are Government-owned.



-5-
activities of its autarchies and enterprises within the Government's overall
transportation policy and appoints their key officers, but is not involved in
executive activities. Civil aviation is controlled by the Ministry of Avia-
tion, essentially a military body, which has delegated ground and in-flight
infrastructure facilities to the Empresa Brasileira de Infraestructura Aero-
portuaria (INFRAERO), also a public enterprise.
1.17      The Ministry of Transport's coordination with the rest of the
federal structure and budgetary adjustments among the operational agencies
are managed by its Secretary General through two secretariats. The Program-
ming and Planning Secretariat coordinates the yearly and multi-year budgets
of all the agencies in the sector and submits a document called "partial
proposals" to the Ministry of Planning and the rest of the Government.
The Transport Coordination Secretariat monitors execution of the approved
budgets. Most states have a Transport Secretariat which reports directly to
the state governor and coordinates the activities of the modal agencies.
State highway departments (DERs) have functions similar to those of DNER for
state roads.
H.   Investments and Planning
1.18      Development of the national transportation network has absorbed a
considerable proportion of the country's total investment. From 1970 to 1975,
transport investment has consistently accounted for about 25% of gross fixed
national capital formation -- which is comparatively high and reflects the
size of the country and its expanding frontiers. In 1975, Cr$ 63.8 billion
(about US$7,800 million) was invested in the transportation sector; about 69%
went to road transport, 13% to rail transport, 8% to ports and marine transport,
7% to air transport and 3% to pipelines and terminals (Table 1.2). Since 1974,
transport planning policy has been, to a certain degree, a corollary of the
Government's policy to reduce dependency on imported oil and to alleviate
the impact of high prices of petroleum products. This policy has led to a
higher emphasis on rail and water transport, to large increases in taxes on
petroleum products and other measures to save fuel, such as limiting opening
hours of gasoline stations, mixing alcohol with gasoline and reducing speed
limits. Transport planning and investment have also been affected by the
measures adopted to restrain public expenditures. Increasing proportions of
taxes previously earmarked for use by transport agencies have been transferred
to the National Development Fund controlled by the Ministry of Planning. Since
late 1976, ceilings have been set by the Ministry of Planning on the investment
budget of public agencies. The spending ceilings and the decreased reliance on
earmarked tax revenues have strengthened Government control over the investment
expenditures of the various transport agencies. Centralized financial control
has proven effective in containing expenditures and redirecting policies, but
it has provided a precarious framework for investment planning.
1.19      The Ministry of Transport has two advisory groups for the formulation
of transportation policies: the National Transportation Council (CNT) and
GEIPOT. CNT was created in 1961, and reorganized in 1969, to provide the
economic development and national security framework of transportation policy.
However, it meets rather infrequently and has not played any active role in



- 6 -
policy matters. GEIPOT was originally established in 1965 as the counter-
part executive agency for the! preparation of the National Transport Survey
(Annex 1). After completion of the Survey, GEIPOT was intended to become the
main advisory body of the Ministry of Transport on matters of coordination and
policy. However, because its institutional relationship to the other transport
"autarchies" and enterprises was not clearly defined, it experienced difficulties
in fulfilling its functions, especially in the field of modal coordination.
GEIPOT was reorganized in 1972 and turned into a public enterprise under the
Ministry. This new status allowed the institution to escape the rather rigid
public sector personnel and salary policies.
1.20      Although its present status is one of consulting company, GEIPOT has
emerged, over the last two years, as the main de facto advisory body of the
Ministry of Transport on matters of policy and planning, both directly and
through a newly formed Transport Planning Commission made up of the Planning
Directors of all modal agencies. GEIPOT is the technical secretariat of the
new Commission. GEIPOT's re-emergence is a direct consequence of the high
caliber of its key staff. It is presently preparing short-and long-term plans
in support of the activities of the new Transport Planning Commission. These
plans, which would lead to thLe formulation of a National Transport Plan for
Brazil, are expected to be ready by the end of 1978, in time for consideration
by the new Government to be installed in 1979. GEIPOT would therefore be in a
position to initiate the process of policy formulation on a well-documented
basis very early in the new administration's term. The Government has indi-
cated that it would offer the Bank an opportunity to review and comment on the
plans and studies being prepared by GEIPOT. This would be achieved through
periodic consultations between the Bank and GEIPOT on transport planning and
coordination.
II. THE ROAD TRANSPORT INDUSTRY
A.   General
2.01      Transport flows reflect the regional distribution of economic activi-
ties and recent increases in production, particularly of soybean and grains in
the south and manufactured products in the southeast and center regions. Soy-
bean production is expected to reach 12 to 13 million tons by 1978; it has
grown 40 times since 1964, and Brazil is now, following the United States, the
second largest soybean exporter in the world. While most Latin American coun-
tries have been lagging in production of basic grains, Brazilian output has
more than doubled since the 1.960s after vast new areas were opened to agricul-
ture, particularly in west Parana. The seasonal flows of soybeans and grains
from the southwest to consumer areas in the north and to ports (Paranagua, Rio
Grande) absorb a substantial share of the road transport capacity and affect
the supply of services throughout the country. Another major contributor to
the growth of demand has been the promotion of steel production. The steel
industry should produce about. 15 million tons by 1980. Finally, the supply of
manufactured consumer goods from the Sao Paulo industrial area in the southeast
originates a traffic flow to consumers in the north, most of which moves by
truck in spite of the enormous distance:  3,000 to 4,000 km to Belem and Manaus.



- 7-
B. The Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
2.02       The development of a domestic automobile industry in the 1950s and
1960s has been a key factor in the industrialization of Brazil. There are
about 6.1 million motor vehicles in the country, of which 79% are passenger
cars and small buses, 18% are trucks, and the rest are buses and other types
of road vehicles. The fleet grew at an average annual rate of 15% from 1971
to 1975 (Table 2.1); most noticeable was the sharp increase in medium and
heavy trucks in 1974. Although statistics on the composition of the fleet are
generally unreliable, official figures show that 41% of the trucks are light,
48% are medium and heavy trucks, and 11% are very heavy trucks and tractor-
trailer combinations.
2.03       There has been a significant change in the composition of the
truck fleet since 1971. While medium and heavy trucks decreased from 67% to
41% of the fleet, the number of light trucks increased from 31% to 41%, and
very heavy trucks and tractor-trailer units increased from 1% to 11%. This
is noteworthy because both the so-called light trucks, which have one rear
axle, and the heavy trailer combinations are liable to cause significant
damage to pavements and bridges respectively if loaded above the legal limits
(para 2.17 and Chapter VIII).
2.04       Since 1970, annual traffic growth on federal roads has been very
high in all states, averaging over 15% for the country as a whole (Table 2.2).
Of all regions, the center western region (Mato Grosso in particular) has had
the greatest traffic growth on its roads, over 25% per year since 1970.  The
northeast follows with a growth rate of over 15% p.a., and the southeast and
south (Minas Gerais and all the states south of it) had traffic growths of
over 13% per annum. The average composition of traffic flows in Brazil is
about 45% automobiles, 5% buses and 50% trucks. The high traffic levels,
together with the comparatively large proportion of heavy vehicles, especially
over federal highways, make Brazil's highway rehabilitation and maintenance
problem a matter of vital importance to the economy.
C.   Operations and Organization of the Industry
2.05       Road transport is the domain of private enterprise and has shown,
over the last 20 years, a remarkable dynamism and responsiveness in the
face of rapid increases and shifts in demand. Entry to the industry is free,
and, to date, its activities have remained almost unregulated. In fact,
road transport has been one of the major fields of opportunity for the small
scale entrepreneur. Individual truckers -- "carreteiros" -- who contract
their services directly to shippers or to larger transport companies, account
for about 75% of the trucks in service. Trucking is also performed either by
corporations exclusively engaged in transportation or by companies hauling on
their own account. Corporate trucking firms are of all sizes, but usually
subcontract carreteiros under a variety of arrangements. A 1975 census showed
that the fleet was distributed as follows:
No. of Freight Vehicles                  %
Individual truckers                389,007                         75
Transport companies                 50,444                         10
Trucks on own account               81,497                         15
520,948                        100



-8-
The same census showed that about 4,500 freight and about 280 passenger
transport companies operated in Brazil. About 60% of organized trucking
companies are concentrated in the southern states (Rio Grande do Sul and Sao
Paulo especially), and 95% of them have emerged from individual truckers,
demonstrating the entrepreneurial character of the industry.
2.06      A study of the industry commissioned by DNER and carried out by
consultants EULER S.A. (Brazil) between 1974 and 1976 analyzed the operation
of the industry and showed the fields of specialization of the individual
truckers and companies; Table 2.3 provides several indicators on their opera-
tions. Generally, individual, truckers operate longer runs and achieve load
factors of only 59% on the average; they usually operate on contract to
brokers or companies. Corporate trucking averages 67% load factor and accepts
cargo for all points in the country, but performs only the shorter hauls (up
to 400 km) with its own vehicles. Longer hauls are normally subcontracted to
carreteiros, either directly or through a broker. This applies to all cargo
except special commodities such as household goods, liquid bulk, dangerous
articles and new cars. Companies have a dominant share of the transport of
manufactured products, for which quality of service and the added security
offered by a firm are important. Transport brokers play an important role
because of the high percentage of bulk cargo moved by road and the widespread
subcontracting. For example, in 1975, individual operators moved 90% of the
three billion ton-km of grain (rice, soya and wheat) transported by road in
Rio Grande do Sul and Parana, and brokers were instrumental in subcontracting
50% of this. Brokers are reported to make high profits, and the Government
has considered regulating their role. The relatively low average load factor
for the individual trucker (59%) suggests that improvement in overall efficiency
could be obtained by better marketing. The search for cargo through vast
metropolitan areas is a time-consuming and wasteful process for carreteiros;
freight transport terminals would be one of the ways to improve the situation.
2.07      Transport of passengers is shared by about 2,600 companies, of which
about 280 serve interstate routes. It is regulated by DNER's Road Transport
Directorate, which has enforced better standards of service en route and at
terminals. In rural areas, however, facilities are still quite rudimentary.
Passenger terminals have been a matter of priority in Brazil since the early
days; most cities have modern functional facilities within or outside the
metropolitan areas. DNER is planning measures to improve services for longer
trips through sparsely populated areas. This involves the establishment of
intermediate resting stations or "rodoportos." The availability of low cost
and relatively rapid bus transport has been an important factor in large scale
population movements from the rural areas to the cities and from the northeast
to the industrial south.
2.08      The road transport industry is not strongly organized, which is to
be expected in view of the absence of regulations and the large number of
independent operators. In most states, trucking companies are grouped
into associations. State associations are grouped at the national level
in the National Trucking Association (NTC). 1/ The 400 largest trucking
i/ Associacao Nacional das Empresas de Transportes Rodoviario de Carga (NTC).



-9-
companies in the country also hold direct membership in NTC.  Many indi-
vidual truckers hold membership in the National Confederation of Truckers,
which is basically a labor union.  NTC is the main source of information
regarding the industry, and it has assumed the role of representing the
industry vis-a-vis the Government, particularly, on the administration of the
tariff system or "tabela."
D.   Tariffs and Costs
2.09      NTC maintains rate tables (tabela) which are indicative of the
maximum rates for specified hauls. NTC negotiates periodic revision of these
rates with the Inter-Ministerial Price Control Council (CIP). Since the
industry is highly competitive and entry is free, rates are not consistently
applied, and cargo moves at substantial discounts negotiated between shippers
and truckers. Individual truckers frequently operate at rates well below the
tabela, especially on return loads. Their costs are kept down by the absence
of overhead and, most importantly, by their personal dedication and willing-
ness to work long hours and sustain the hardship involved in long distance
trips.
2.10      Average financial vehicle operating costs summarized from data
collected by NTC are given in Table 2.4 for the typical vehicles of 12,
14 and 26 tons. The table shows average industry cost of Cr$ 0.72 per
ton/km (about USU5) as of August 1977. As a result of lower wages, minimum
maintenance, absence of overhead, lack of social security payments and lower
loading and unloading costs, individual truckers operate at costs about
30% below those of the large companies. Comparison with similar estimates
prepared in 1971 shows that road transport costs increased less rapidly than
other industrial costs, reflecting the efficiency of the industry, techno-
logical improvements, and the expansion and improvement of the network. A
recent study undertaken by IDB to assess the impact of a paving project on
prices of agricultural products shows that the effect on prices was at least
equal to the anticipated reduction in vehicle operating costs.
E.   Government Role
2.11      Government intervention in the operation of road freight transport
has been minimum. Periodic efforts by the Government to establish regulation
over key aspects of trucking, in particular entry and route assignment, have
not so far succeeded. In October 1972, the Bank called the Government's
attention to the possible adverse consequences of regulation. An important
element in support of the drive for more regulation has been the desire of
larger companies to curb competition from the carreteiros. The working
conditions of company-employed drivers have been one of the elements at the
center of discussions concerning the need for regulations. Since the oil
crisis, the Government has sought ways to increase the overall efficiency of
the industry, to develop cheaper intermodal alternatives - especially on
long-hauls - and to control overloading. In 1974, DNER established a separate
Road Transport Directorate to monitor the industry and to foster Government
objectives. In 1974, DNER commissioned consultants (EULER) to evaluate the
industry as a whole and to recommend actions to be taken concerning regulation,



- 10 -
freight terminals and intermodal alternatives. Prospects for action on these
issues are reviewed below, together with the question of overloading, which is
the single most important problem affecting the industry in relation to road
administration and maintenance.
2.12      In summary, the trucking industry has met the increasing demand
flexibly and efficiently under conditions of free competition. However, the
Government's concern for the improved overall efficiency of the transport
system, especially its use of petroleum products, may lead to a larger
measure of intervention. A more active role by the federal and state
governments would be helpful in improving marketing and developing inter-
modal services; however, al: the same time, the strong entrepreneurial character
of the industry should be preserved.
F.   Current Issues and Prospects
(i) Regulation
2.13      One of the objectives of the EULER study was to review the need for
regulation of freight trucking. The consultant prepared a draft law which was
the basis for a proposal submitted by DNER for Government approval in 1976,
but the Government has not yet acted upon DNER's proposal. The proposed law,
which has the support of the organized section of the industry, would empower
the Government to control the following aspects of the industry through
supplementary regulations: (a) a registry of transport operators and related
qualifications (both companies and individuals); (b) route and commodity
assignments and limitations; (c) tariffs; (d) brokers' functions; and (e) the
role of freight transport terminals. In July 1976, following a review of the
industry in two states, Rio Grande do Sul and Parana, the Bank cautioned the
Government against restrictions which might interfere with supply and demand,
but recommended implementation of that part of the proposed law dealing with
brokers' functions and terminals. The role played by brokers, and the lack of
freight terminals and bulk storage facilities were identified by Bank staff as
important problems facing the industry. The Bank should continue to monitor
Government intentions in these areas, including regulations.
(ii)  Freight Terminals
2.14      While the EULER study confirmed that the industry had been able to
meet increasing demands, it also identified several measures which would in-
crease the overall efficiency of the system. In particular, it recommended
the development of freight terminals in larger metropolitan areas. Presently,
there is only one public freight terminal in operation - a terminal in Uruguaiana
(Rio Grande do Sul) built in December 1971 to facilitate international movements
between Brazil and Argentina. Total traffic through it in 1976 amounted to about
500,000 tons, about double the flow anticipated at the time of construction.
2.15      Complementary to its study of the Road Transport Industry, EULER
was retained by DNER to study freight terminals. The study, completed in
1976, reviewed present experience on road freight terminals in France, Italy,
Japan and the USA, and examined cities where terminals may be a matter of



- 11 -
priority in Brazil:  Belem, Fortaleza, Recife, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Curitiba, and Porto Alegre were considered in that category.
DNER indicated its willingness to support the preparation of feasibility
studies for terminals in these cities with a portion of the proceeds of the
ISTR tax, and it issued guidelines for the execution of the studies. Several
states have already initiated preparation of freight terminal studies along
the DNER guidelines. In its contact with the Government concerning the
preparation of these projects, Bank staff has stressed the need to carry out
economic evaluation, including market surveys, and to maintain flexible
institutional arrangements to ensure participation of the industry.
(iii) Intermodal Services
2.16      The opening of trunk roads to the north (Belem-Brasilia, Manaus-Porto
Velho-Cuiaba) has been instrumental in switching flows from coastal navigation
to road transport. During 1976, Manaus received over 50 trucks daily from the
Sao Paulo region (distance over 4,000 km) while coastal navigation companies,
which had a captive market, experienced a decrease in the volume hauled.
Users are apparentLy willing to pay up to 100% more than they would for
shipping to benefit from the flexibility of road transport. Since 1974, the
Government has favored the development of coastal shipping, especially inter-
modal roll-on/roll-off services, but, in spite of the potentially large
savings, services have not gone beyond the experimental stage. Lack of
support from organized trucking and the inadequacy of port regulations have
been major obstacles. Roll-on/roll-off as an alternative to the 4,000 km trip
by truck would offer substantial economic benefits; it would (a) effect large
economies of fuel; (b) rationalize distribution of trucking capacity between
regions; and (c) in the long run, alleviate the need for investments in
strengthening and rehabilitating trunk roads linking the north and the south.
In its contacts with the Government on the development of intermodal services,
Bank staff has stressed the need to review port regulations and to keep
institutional arrangements flexible to ensure the participation of the truckers
who have first access to the cargo.
(iv) Enforcement of Weight and Dimensions Regulations
2.17      Brazil has had adequate regulations on vehicle weight and dimensions
since 1966; the maximum allowed loads are 10 tons for single axles, 17 tons
for tandem axles and 25 tons for triple axles. Enforcement, however, has been
lax. Scattered sampling carried out by DNER suggests that overloading is
widespread. This is to be expected in view of the evolution of the truck
fleet (para 2.03) and the competitive pressure under which the industry
operates. The mounting requirements for strengthening and rehabilitation of
roads built over the last 30 years has, however, alerted federal and state
authorities to the necessity of checking overloading. DNER has undertaken to
install a comprehensive system of 127 weighing stations which would allow
efficient enforcement on the federal network. Phase I of the program is
supported by the ongoing Fifth Highway Project. Phase II would be included
under the proposed project (Chapter VIII). State authorities are also taking
measures to ensure enforcement on state roads, and the proposed project would
also support installation of weigh bridges in the state of Parana. During
negotiations, the Federal Government and the Government of the State of



- 12 -
Parana confirmed that exist:ing weight regulations 1/ would be enforced on all
federal highways and on state highways in Parana respectively.
III. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Network
3.01      Brazil has over 1.4 million km of roads; of these, about 5% are
federal highways, 11% are state highways and 84% are municipal roads and
tracks. The network has been growing at an average rate of about 4% annually,
with the most rapid growth in the federal system, which has expanded almost
27% since 1971 (Tables 3.1 and 3.2). The federal system has about 70,000 km
of highways, of which 42,000 km are paved and 28,000 km are unpaved. These
highways are the backbone of the interstate network of Brazil and run from
Amapa and Roraima in the north to Rio Grande do Sul in the south (Map IBRD
13205). Complementary to the federal network, there are 160,000 km of state
highways and roads, of which about 40,000 km are paved and 120,000 km are
unpaved.
3.02      The federal and state highway systems, the main supports of the
country's economic activity, have been built mostly over the last 30 years
since 1946, when the National Highways Fund was created. In the last few
years, however, preoccupation of the Brazilian authorities has shifted from
construction to maintenance and rehabilitation. This is due not only to the
age of the network but also to the fact that, in many regions, traffic and
loads have increased well beyond expectations at the time the roads were
built. The rapid growth of the Brazilian economy is now showing its effect
on road conditions.
3.03      Development of the highway networks has not been uniform.  There
are regions with a relatively low density of roads, partly a consequence
of Brazil's colonization process and generally coinciding with low population
densities in the hinterland (Table 3.3). The highest concentration of paved
highways is in the south and southeast, especially in the states of Minas
Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro, which contain
over 60% of them. In the rest of the country, just a few states stand out
with large paved networks: Bahia, Ceara and Pernambuco in the northeast and
Goias in the center west.
B.   Highway Administration
3.04      Responsibility for the administration of the Brazilian highway system
is split by jurisdiction. The federal government takes care of the federal
network, the state governments of the state networks and the municipalities
of their own. At times, however, the lines dividing jurisdictions are blurred,
and many agreements have been entered into for the execution of certain
1/   Article 4 of the "Codigo Nacional de Transito" (Law No. 5.108 of
September 21, 1966) and Decreto-Lei No. 117 of January 31, 1967.



- 13 -
functions of highway administration on one another's roads. The delegation of
the maintenance of federal roads to the states is just one of such agreements.
3.05      The federal network is administered by DNER, an "autarchy" under the
Ministry of Transport (para 1.16). DNER was created in 1937 and last reorga-
nized in 1974 as shown in Chart 3.1. Construction and the maintenance of
federal highways are the responsibility of the Directorates of Works and
Maintenance respectively. The Planning Directorate programs and coordinates
project preparation, including engineering. The Transit Directorate monitors
and supervises the operation of the system; it runs the federal highway police
and enforces axle weight regulations. The Road Transport Directorate is
responsible for licensing vehicles, as well as passenger and freight operators,
and for implementing regulations on road transport. Three Directorates --
Personnel, Administration and the Comptroller -- take care of DNER's admin-
istrative and financial aspects. The Instituto de Pesquisas Rodoviarias
(IPR), which has the rank of a Directorate, is responsible for road research
and training (para 3.32). DNER operates in each state through its Federal
Highway District (DRF). The District Engineer is a direct representative of
the Director General of DNER and has similar functions in his jurisdiction.
Each DRF is further broken down into Residencies, which are mainly operational
units taking care of road construction and maintenance.
3.06      DNER has over 1,400 senior staff (about 880 engineers); of these,
70% are stationed in the DRFs, 26% at headquarters and 4% with IPR. The
engineers are generally capable and experienced; at headquarters, the largest
number work for the Planning Directorate (78), followed by the Directorates of
Works and Maintenance, which have 38 each. There are 45 economists at DNER
(3% of senior staff), 26 of whom work at headquarters, mainly with the Planning
Directorate, and 18 with the DRFs; there is only one permanent economist with
IPR. DNER also employs accountants, procurement specialists, administrators
and other professionals. Most of them are well qualified and have been with
DNER for a number of years despite the comparatively low salaries paid in the
civil service. DNER has a large and often excessive work force of field
laborers utilized mainly for maintenance activities. Efforts are made to keep
this force from increasing because DNER has been a ready recipient for
workers displaced from reorganized public enterprises and agencies. The
federal highway police has about 6,500 fully trained members; a further 2,000
are expected to be trained by the end of 1978.
3.07      State networks are administered by the State Highway Departments
(DERs), which are organized mostly along lines similar to those of DNER.
The DERs usually report to State Secretariats of Transport, which, in turn,
are responsible to state governors. The structure of a typical state highway
department (Parana) is shown in Chart 3.2. State highway departments are more
operationally oriented than DNER; their field units are the districts (or, at
times, residencies), which are mostly responsible for maintenance.
3.08      The State Highway Department of Parana (DER-PR), as most state
highway departments, is reasonably well staffed, and its senior personnel are
generally experienced and capable. In June 1977, DER-PR had about 6,300
employees; 80% are operational staff (mainly maintenance personnel) and 20%
are managerial, professional and administrative staff generally stationed at
headquarters in Curitiba, the state capital.



- 14 -
C.   Highway Planning
3.09      Both strategic planning and operational programming for highways are
entrusted to DNER. Decisions concerning highway planning are shared among
DNER, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Planning, the Office of the
President and Congress.  The central highway planning unit is DNER's Planning
Directorate. Its five Divisions carry out all steps of project preparation and
highway planning. The basic highway planning instruments are, in order of com-
prehensiveness and time span, the National Transport Plan, the Highway Master
Plans, the Special Expressways Program and DNER's annual and three-year invest-
ment programs. Highway plarLning is subordinated to other federal programs
such as the federal Government's Goals and Action Plan, the National Develop-
ment Plan and special regional plans such as PIN, PROVALE, POLONORDESTE, etc.
3.10      Programming of highway expenditures is subject to annual review.
The Planning Directorate prepares the annual and three-year programs which are
submitted for the decision (alterations and changes) of the Director General
and, eventually, the Minister of Transport. DNER's modified investment pro-
gram is then integrated into the so-called partial proposals which each
Ministry, through its Planning and Programming Secretariats, submits to the
Ministry of Planning's Undersecretariat of Budget and Finance. This unit, in
turn, analyzes the partial proposals, modifies them and makes them compatible
for all Ministries and federal institutions. If necessary, the partial
proposals are submitted to t:he Economic and Social Planning Institute to
verify their consistency wit:h the National Development Plan. The annual and
three-year rollover investment programs finally arrived at by the Ministry of
Planning are then submitted to the Office of the President and, in turn,
through it to Congress.
3.11      The above process is repeated every year and has frequently led
to substantial changes in investment programs in recent years as the Govern-
ment adapts its policies to changing priorities. Despite its shortcomings,
the use of this process has allowed, in the last few years, better coordination
of highway planning with the primary objectives of the Government economic
policies and has provided increased control over spending. The present system
would, however, have to be adapted to reflect the fact that DNER's role is
shifting from direct initial:ive and execution toward coordination between the
federal Government and state and municipal authorities. A ministerial and
internal review of DNER's functions, procedures, organization and constitution
is being carried out. Although no timeframe has been set for actions, it is
likely that the advent of a new administration in 1979 may bring about changes
in the planning and administration of highways in the country.
3.12      The principal insl:rument of coordination among federal, state and
municipal highway activities is the annual distribution of the earmarked
National Highway Fund (NHF). DNER administers the NHF and calculates and
distributes the portions to each state and municipality on the basis of
indicators such as area, population, kilometrage of roads, gasoline con-
sumption, etc. When parceling out the funds, DNER exercises some measure
of control on their use, and particularly reviews commitments undertaken by
the states and municipalities on the basis of these revenues. It also reviews
the consistency of funding with the state or municipality's proposed invest-
ment programs.



- 15 -
D.   Road User Charges and Highway Financing
3.13      Road users pay taxes when (a) purchasing a vehicle by paying the
Industrial Products Tax (Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados, IPI);
(b) registering the vehicle by paying the motor vehicle license tax (Taxa
Rodoviaria Unica, TRU); (c) using the vehicle by paying the petroleum tax for
fuel and oils (Imposto Unico sobre Lubrificantes e Combustiveis Liquidos e
Gasosos, IULCLG); (d) maintaining the vehicle by paying the IPI for spare
parts, tires and other materials; (e) paying tolls on specific roads or
bridges (Pedagio); and (f) paying the tax on road transport levied on truckers
and bus companies (Imposto sobre Transporte Rodoviario de Passageiros e Carga,
ISTR). Users also pay import duties on motor vehicles and spare parts. A
substantial portion of the IULCLG, the TRU and the ISTR is earmarked for use
by the federal, state and municipal governments in the highway sector; speci-
fied percentages of their proceeds are automatically turned over to DNER for
its own use and for redistribution to the states and municipalities. Partial
information available concerning fiscal receipts suggests that, until 1975,
total federal highway expenditures were roughly 5 to 25% above revenues from
major road user taxes; in 1976, these revenues exceeded highway expenditures
by roughly 10%, reflecting increases in the fuel tax. Research into specific
aspects of road user charges, agreed by the Government to be carried out as
part of, but not financed by, the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR) is
currently being undertaken by GEIPOT.
3.14      The main source of financing for highway activities is the fuel
tax. In 1974-1975, revenue from this tax remained stagnant, as the Government
absorbed, through tax rate reductions, some of the rise in petroleum prices.
Beginning in 1975, the Government followed an aggressive and strong pricing
policy aimed at inhibiting fuel consumption to relieve the country of the
heavy balance-of-payments effect of petroleum imports. Successive increases
in the fuel tax contributed to raising the retail price of gasoline from
about US$0.98 per gallon in 1975 to about US$1.60 per gallon in 1977. For
diesel fuel, prices increased from about US$0.55 to US$0.87 per gallon in
the same period. The expected reduction in consumption occurred (Table 3.4);
at the same time, revenues generated by the fuel tax were more than doubled in
real terms in 1976. This trend slowed, however, in 1977, as the Government
slowed the increase in fuel taxes to help reduce inflationary pressures.
3.15      Only part of the windfall from the greatly increased petroleum tax
proceeds is being channeled back to the highway sector, the remainder being
redirected to other sectors through the National Development Fund created in
1975 to increase flexibility in public sector investment planning. Allocation
of fuel tax proceeds to the highway sector through the NHF decreased from 77%
in 1970 to about 54% in 1977. A similar trend is taking place in the percent-
age allocation of revenues from the motor vehicle license tax (TRU) and the
tax on road transport (ISTR). Because of the considerable increase in the
total to be apportioned, however, the absolute level of tax revenues earmarked
for highway spending in 1977 was about 40% higher than in 1975 in real terms.
The highway sector in recent years has also received increasing amounts of
appropriations from the Federal Government's general budget, and complemented
its resources with significant amounts of borrowing. As a result, total
allocations from federal sources for highways (including earmarked taxes, bud-
getary allocations and borrowing) more or less doubled in real value over the



- 16 -
six-year period 1972-1977, reaching about US$2.9 million equivalent in 1977.
Within the highway sector, there has also been some reallocation of resources.
The states and municipalities did not suffer any reduction in their percentage
share or ihe petroleum tax proceeds; DNER did.  The full benefit from the 1976
windfall was thus passed on to the states and municipalities, which had their
finances considerably strengthened.
3.16      DNER's own resources (net of transfers, Table 3.5) which grew sub-
stantially in the early 1970s, have recently been growing more slowly and will
continue to do so in the next: few years. Partly because of this, and in
compliance with Government policy, a notable shift is occurring in DNER's
priorities and spending pattetrns; whereas until 1975, the Government's priority
was the expansion of the network, rehabilitation and maintenance programs have
now become predominant. Construction and paving, which used to be about 53%
of expenditures in the years 1972 to 1974, decreased to 46% in 1975, 41% in
1976 and is expected to amount to no more than 14% of total expenditures from
1978 to 1980. Rehabilitation and maintenance, in contrast, has grown from an
average 11% of DNER's expenditures between 1972 and 1974 to an estimated 20%
in 1977, and is expected to continue rising to about 44% by 1980. Under
present policies, construction and paving would be curtailed considerably over
the next few years.
3.17      An analysis of current projections of sources of finance (Table 3.5)
and expenditures (Table 3.6) of DNER through 1980 shows that funding of
DNER's proposed investment program is dependent upon its ability to increase
its internal and external borrowing significantly above the levels of the
period 1972-1977. Transfers from the National Development Fund are also as-
sumed to continue to increase. As indicated in the projections, DNER's slower
growth would affect mostly new construction. Resources for rehabilitation and
maintenance would be increased to the programmed levels indicated in Table 3.6.
During negotiations, DNER presented a Rehabilitation Program for the period
1978-1983, with details for the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and
Parana. During negotiations, DNER confirmed that, over the project implemen-
tation period, it would exchange views annually with the Bank on its budgetary
proposals and the related finiancial plan in order, in particular, to review
the adequacy of its programs in the fields of maintenance (para 3.27) and
rehabilitation (para 3.28).
E.   Highway Engineering
3.18      DNER's Planning Directorate is responsible for the technical prep-
aration of highway projects. Because of limited in-house design capacity,
consulting services, provided mostly by Brazilian consulting firms, are used
extensively. DNER's 21 DRFs supervise consultants' work directly under guide-
lines provided by headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. Modern design standards
and methods were incorporated into DNER's manuals as an outcome of the 1965-
1970 Brazil Transport Survey. However, as pointed out in the PCR for the
Second Highway Project (Annex 1), too little emphasis has been placed on
in-depth geotechnical studies, especially in mountainous terrain. Consultants
are now being given more time for these studies. Otherwise, the standard of
engineering in Brazil is very good.



- 17 -
3.19      For state highways, the engineering is also done mainly by consul-
tants, and, although states have their own road classifications, design practices
generally follow DNER's manuals. Many states are also physically and finan-
cially assisting municipalities with the design and construction of municipal
roads. This assistance is provided either through the state DERs or through
special agencies under the state's Transport Secretariats. ConsuLtants are
normally engaged to undertake engineering design of municipal roads.
3.20      The recent upsurge in requirements to strengthen or rehabilitate
paved highways in Brazil has caught DNER unprepared with regard to pavement
overlay designs for which norms specifically developed for Brazilian
conditions do not exist. Consultants have adapted methodologies evolved in
other countries, often with disparate results. In mid-1976, the Planning
Directorate engaged consultants (PACS, Brazil) to assist in coordinating
the design of the rehabilitation works in the Fifth Highway Project and to
provide reasonably uniform design criteria. DNER recognizes, however, that
high priority should be given to the development of design norms for pavement
strengthening and rehabilitation suitable to Brazilian conditions. DNER's
Road Research Institute (IPR) has set up a working group to prepare provisional
guidelines for asphalt overlay designs to be used while detailed norms are
defined. The proposed project would include a comprehensive research program
in this field (Chapter IX).
F.   Highway Construction
3.21      The Brazilian construction industry is highly competitive; there are
numerous well organized and experienced local contracting firms. In the Fifth
Highway Project, over 50 firms were prequalified for road works ranging between
US$5.0 and US$28.0 million; eight to 20 bids were received for each of the
18 road construction lots.
3.22      Quality control and supervision of works have improved considerably
during this decade. Site supervision of civil works is usually carried out
by consultants and is closely monitored by DNER's local DRF. At headquarters
in Rio de Janeiro, DNER's Works Directorate is responsible for supervising
and coordinating highway construction contracts, while the Maintenance
Directorate is responsible for highway overlay and rehabilitation contracts.
All contracts under previous Bank-financed highway projects have been admin-
istered by the Works Directorate, which, over the years, has developed an
efficient system to coordinate project execution, with the assistance of
consultants (INGEROUTE, France).
G.   Highway Maintenance and Rehabilitation
(i) General
3.23      DNER's maintenance organization is generally inadequate.  The
field residencies have old and insufficient equipment, and administrative
costs are high. In recent years, significant expansion of the federal highway
network has further strained the capacity of the maintenance organization.
Contracted maintenance has increased significantly over the past two years
and now covers about 28% of the federal network. Only paved roads are main-
tained under contract; the work is performed well but annual costs are



- 18 -
US$3,000-US$4,000 per km, which is high, even allowing for minor improvement
works usually included in the contracts. In the frontier northern and western
regions, many roads are being built and maintained by the Army because, in
these regions, neither DN]ER nor the states have adequate maintenance organiza-
tions. DNER presently maintains, by force account, about 23% of the federal
highway system.
3.24      State highways and roads are maintained by the respective state
DER, which usually provid,es a satisfactory service. Municipal roads,
which make up the majority of the country's network, are maintained by the
municipalities. However, municipalities have few funds, and maintenance is
generally negligible; many roads become impassable during rainy periods.
State governments are becoming more aware of the problems, and some are
providing assistance for improving and maintaining these roads.
(ii) Maintenance Delegation
3.25      In 1971, DNER embarked on a policy of gradually delegating mainte-
nance of federal highways to the DERs in order to avoid duplication and,
consequently, higher cost of maintenance activities. After an initial thrust,
the delegation program has barely kept pace with the expansion of the federal
highway system, as shown by the status at the end of 1974 and the end of 1976:
Maintained by States    Delegated       Maintained by DNER         Total

/a   Under delegation program.
/b   Roads not included in the delegation program.  They are located along
designated federal routes but have not been officially incorporated into
the federal system. Thus, their maintenance does not qualify for federal
funding.
3.26      After several years of limited success with delegating the mainte-
nance of federal highways to states, 1/ it has become clear that all state
DERs (except Sao Paulo) require considerable strengthening before the dele-
gation program can be significantly expanded. To assist in this objective,
the Fifth Highway Project included programs to strengthen the DERs of Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul (Annex 1). The strengthening of DER-PR's
1/   In 1976, 16 states were maintaining delegated federal highways (Table 3.7).



- 19 -
(Parana) highway maintenance directorate is included in the proposed
project (Chapter VII). A large proportion of the roads to be delegated in
these states require rehabilitation, and DNER has undertaken to prepare a
program for carrying out the necessary rehabilitation before delegation of
the maintenance takes place. Some of these works would be included in the
proposed project.
3.27      Maintenance of delegated highways is paid by DNER to the states on
the basis of unit prices calculated according to theoretical formulas more
suited for costing road construction. Most states consider that the formulas
do not reflect real costs adequately. One of the tasks being undertaken by
consultants to DNER (Roy Jorgensen Inc., USA) under the Fifth Highway Project
(Annex 1) is to determine suitable cost accounting and payment procedures.
These are expected to be established by the end of 1978. Development of
methodologies for determining adequate maintenance levels for highways dele-
gated to the states and for realistic funding of the maintenance activities is
essential to the success of the delegation program. During negotiations, the
Government confirmad that DNER would (a) pursue the maintenance delegation
program and (b) dEvelop and adopt, from May 1, 1979, suitable methods for
determining adequate maintenance levels, cost accounting and related funding
procedures for maintaining federal highways, taking into account the ongoing
study.
(iii) Rehabilitation
3.28      Modern engineering design and construction practices were established
in the early 1970's. However, roads built before that time, and a few after,
are failing because of pavement fatigue and obsolescence due to design charac-
teristics insufficient for present traffic volumes and loads. Traffic growth
has been staggering (para 2.04) and usually well above projections. Over-
loading of trucks and lack of timely pavement strengthening have accelerated
pavement deterioration. The Government recognizes the problem, and the Second
National Development Plan, 1975-1979, places a heavy emphasis on highway
maintenance and rehabilitation. Preliminary estimates suggest that DNER
should undertake an average of 3,000 km of pavement strengthening or rehabil-
itation per year. Rehabilitation would absorb a growing share of DNER funds
(para 3.17). During negotiations, the Government confirmed that DNER would
carry out necessary strengthening and rehabilitation of federal highways and
that DNER would, over the project implementation period, exchange views with
the Bank annually on its annual and pluriannual rehabilitation programs.
3.29      DNER's initial focus on rehabilitation of federal highways has been
in states containing the oldest highways and which carry heavy commercial and
industrial traffic, such as Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Minas Gerais. The
state of Sao Paulo, which is also a major traffic generator, has a well
organized highway department and finances nearly all rehabilitation and
maintenance of federal highways in the state. These four states contain about
45% of the paved federal network and generate about 80% of the commercial and
industrial traffic in the country. DNER is undertaking a condition inventory
of all federal highways in the country (para 6.09) and, under the proposed
project, would strengthen its capacity to program and engineer pavement
overlays and rehabilitation (paras 6.11 and 6.12).



- 20 -
3.30      Execution of rehabilitation, overlaying and resealing of federal
highways is administered by the Maintenance Directorate, which has less
experience with contract control than the Works Directorate (para 3.22) and
which is having to coordinate an expanding program. Most of the senior
engineers, however, have come from the Works Directorate and are fully
acquainted with supervision techniques as developed with INGEROUTE. These
techniques are now being adopted by the Maintenance Directorate.
H.   The Road Research Institute - IPR
3.31      The Road Research Institute (T.,stituto de Pesquisas Rodoviaria - IPR)
was created in 1957, under the National Research Council.  In 1972, it was
transferred to DNER, wheret it is now one of the nine Directorates. IPR is
responsible for all aspects of techno-scientific studies and research, for
training and conference activities, and for information and documentation in
road engineering and economics. It currently has three divisions: Research,
Training and Conferences, and the Techno-Scientific Documentation Division;
each of these divisions has two subdivisions as shown in Chart 3.3.
3.32       IPR's objectives are set out in the Second National Development Plan
and the Basic Plan for Scientific and Technological Development. Current
research accordingly includes studies on soil stabilization, flexible pavement
design, soil mechanics, lateritic soils for pavements, experimental pavements,
highway maintenance, road inventories, equipment cost and productivity, highway
capacity, highway -conomic.s and highway safety. The study on flexible pave-
ment design is of particular relevance to the proposed project; it has tried
to relate performance of existing pavements to structural composition and
surface conditions of roads in various regions of Brazil in order to evaluate
the suitability of DNER's present pavement design method. The study has
covered 37 road sections in four states and is near completion.
3.33      Since its transfer to DNER, IPR has taken on the task of training
personnel. The training program has been developed in conjunction with
existing training institutions in Brazil, but also includes in-house training.
It runs both specialization and refresher courses, at higher and middle levels,
which range from multi-year studies toward Masters or Doctoral degrees to
specialized study courses of a few days' duration. In the near future, all of
IPR's functions will be transferred to the new Centro Rodoviario outside Rio
de Janeiro, which has office and laboratry facilities and also a circular
test track for pavements. IPR's present staff is 184, of which 37 are profes-
sionals, mostly engineers.
3.34      IPR's budget for 1977 was Cr$ 50.2 million (US$3.3 million), of
which Cr$ 13.2 million covered current expenditures and Cr$ 37 million
covered capital expenditures. The proposed 1978 budget is Cr$ 83.7 million
(US$5.5 million), with Cr'j 26.1 million and Cr$ 57.6 million for current
and capital expenditures respectively.
3.35      By far, the largest proportion of IPR's research is done by consul-
tants. To change this would involve an increase in facilities and staff
and, above all, a change of attitude in senior staff to become executors
rather than administrators of research. Its research program, which presently



- 21 -
is a loose assembly of research items, needs long-term perspectives and
structure. IPR, in its present status, does not properly fulfill its intended
functions, and the Ministry of Transport is presently studying ways to form a
Transport Research Institute, which would incorporate other modes of transport
as well as highways. Overall, IPR's research activities require reviewing to
make them more responsive to practical operational needs. This would be
tackled under the proposed project (Chapter IX).
IV. PAST AND ONGOING BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
4.01      Except for an early highway maintenance loan to the State of Rio de
Janeiro in 1953 (Loan 75-BR, US$3 million), the Bank's continuous and active
interest in the Brazilian transport sector dates back to 1964 when an economic
mission recommended a comprehensive National Transport Survey. Since then,
the Bank has made loans totaling US$772 million for five highway projects, a
secondary and feeder roads project, a port project and three railway projects.
The Brazil Transport Survey was carried out in two phases over the period 1965
to 1970. Phase I, supported by a Bank technical assistance grant of US$1.5
million, covered highway transport in four states, railways, coastal shipping
and many ports and was completed in 1970. Phase II covered highway transport
in 14 states; it was supported by USAID (US$1 million) and UNDP (US$1.4
million) grants, with the Bank as Executing Agency. The Survey laid out the
basis for the rapid Pxpansion of the primary road network and helped shape the
institutions necessary to support it.
4.02      Bank lending for highways started in 1968; the five loans totaling
US$376 million have supported the construction and improvement of about 5,500
km of federal and state roads, paving of 5,700 km, and the preparation of final
engineering design for more than 8,000 km. The first four highway projects
have been completed. All four involved construction and improvements for
priority highways included in the Master Plan that evolved from the Transport
Survey. Since 1969, the Bank has also provided technical assistance to DNER
in the area of planning and construction supervision and has helped to strengthen
highway maintenance operations at the federal and state levels.
4.03      In line with the changing priorities in the highways sector discussed
in preceding chapters, the focus of Bank projects, as reflected in both the Fifth
and the proposed projects, shifted toward road maintenance and rehabilitation.
The Bank is also participating as Executing Agency for UNDP in a comprehensive
program of research into the relation between road conditions and vehicle
operating costs, which should set the basis for improved design and maintenance
of highways. Increased emphasis on direct support to rural development led to
Bank involvement in a Secondary and Feeder Roads Project (US$55 million) and
a number of rural development projects. A summary of completed and ongoing
projects is given in Annex 1 which reflects, inter alia, the findings of PPA
Reports No. 1026 (February 12, 1976) and No. 1644 (June 21, 1977) covering the
First and Second Highway Projects respectively.
4.04      The Bank contribution to road development in Brazil covers the full
spectrum of road investments from construction of federal highways to better-
ment of rural roads in remote developing areas. The proposed project would



- 22 -
continue to support the maintenance delegation program and would foster
highway research into pavement design and overlays. Projects under way
and in preparation address the main problems confronting Brazil in the highway
subsector, i.e., to meet rapidly increasing maintenance and rehabilitation
requirements and to bring vast pockets of rural poverty into the mainstream of
the economy.
V. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A.   Objectives and General Description
5.01      As outlined in the Second National Development Plan (1975-1979), the
Government's policy is to protect past investments in the federal highway net-
work by: (a) rehabilitating roads in poor condition; (b) improving maintenance
of state and federal highways; (c) reducing the damaging effects of the over-
loading of trucks; and (d) providing a concentrated effort in applied research
to develop pavement design norms applicable to Brazilian conditions.
5.02      The proposed project would support these objectives through four
separate but interrelated programs:
I.   Highway Rehabilitation Program
Civil works and engineering for rehabilitation of paved federal
highways, and development of a pavement management system for
planning, programming and engineering of pavement resealing,
strengthening and rehabilitation. To this end, the project
would include:
(a) civil works by contractors for rehabilitation of about
1,509 km of federal highways;
(b) consulting services for supervision of civil works;
and
(c) consulting services for detailed engineering for
rehabilitation of about 3,000 km of federal highways.
II.   Highway Maintenance Delegation Program
Restructuring and strengthening the road maintenance organization
and functions of the Maintenance Directorate of Parana's State
Highway Department (DER-PR) in order to provide an efficient orga-
nization capable of maintaining all state and federal highways in
Parana. To this end, the project would include:
(a) construction of regional centers and expansion and modern-
ization of field districts to be carried out by contractors;



- 23 -
(b) about 740 units of plant, equipment and vehicles for road
maintenance and for the state traffic police's safety
campaign;
(c) equipment for offices, laboratories, workshops and stores;
(d) civil works and installation of about 27 weigh bridges
and about 53 traffic control posts along state highways
to be carried out by contractors; and
(e)  technical assistance to DER-PR for project implementation
and for training of maintenance personnel.
III.   Weighing Station Program (Phase II)
Construction and installation of about 32 weighing stations needed
to complete the program begun under the Fifth Highway Project to
provide a basic coverage of vehicle weight control over Brazil's
federal highway system. To this end, the project would include:
(a) civil works, to be carried out by contractors;
(b) supply and installation of weighing equipment; and
(c) maintenance of equipment and training of DNER station
operators to be carried out by the equipment supplier.
IV.   Highway Research Program
Extension of the ongoing UNDP-GEIPOT/DNER research study on the
interrelationship between transport costs, highway design and
maintenance standards, and implementation of a new program under
DNER's Road Research Institute (IPR) for review and development
of criteria and norms for pavement evaluation and design under
Brazilian conditions, in order to determine timing, structural
types and thicknesses for asphalt pavement strengthening. To
this end, the project would include:
(a) consulting services to assist IPR in carrying out the research;
(b) advisory services to GEIPOT and DNER by international experts
and overseas training for Brazilian researchers; and
(c) testing equipment to support IPR's research program.
5.03      Implementation of the project is expected to take about four years
(1978-1982). A detailed description, economic evaluation and specific covenants
concerning each program in the project are given in subsequent chapters.
B.   Cost Estimates
5.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$312.0 million
equivalent, of which US$114.0 million (about 37%), representing the estimated



- 24 -
foreign exchange component, would be financed by the Bank. Of the remaining
project costs, US$18.0 million equivalent would be financed by the State Gov-
ernment of Parana and US$180.0 million equivalent by the Federal Government.
A summary of project costs is given on the following page; base costs are
estimated at June 1978 prices.
5.05      The Highway Rehabilitation Program (Chapter VI) takes up about 80%
of the project costs. Reha'bilitation cost estimates are based on detailed
engineering prepared by seven Brazilian consultants and reviewed by DNER's
Planning Directorate with the assistance of consultants PACS (Brazil). The
relatively high average construction cost per km, US$117,500 equivalent,
reflects the large amount of pavement strengthening required to support
present and forecast traffic. Supervision cost estimates are based on past
experience in Brazil and amount to about 7% of construction costs.
5.06      The cost of the Highway Maintenance Delegation Program (Chapter VII)
is based on estimates prepared by Parana's State Highway Department (DER-PR)
and reflects detailed analyses of requirements for buildings and various types
of equipment and vehicles. Consulting services required to assist DER-PR
reorganize and train personnel are estimated at US$2.5 million, which is 10%
of the program. A total of about 250 man-months of local and foreign profes-
sionals would be required over a four-year period (average cost per man-month:
foreign US$6,500; Brazilian US$5,500).
5.07      The cost of Phase II of the Weighing Station Program (Chapter VIII)
is based on detailed engineering for civil works and detailed cost analysis
for supply and installation of weighing equipment, prepared by consultants
(PROTOS/Brazil), for stations under Phase I of the program (Fifth Highway
Project). Equipment maintenance over two years and training of DNER's oper-
ators would be provided by the weighing equipment suppliers.
5.08      The costs of the Highway Research Program (Chapter IX), comprising
an extension to the ongoing GEIPOT/DNER study and IPR's pavement design study,
are based on detailed work programs and related budget. Technical assistance
would be provided by consulting firms and individual specialists. A total of
about 450 man-months of local and foreign professionals would be required over
a three-and-a-half-year period (average cost per man-month: foreign US$5,000;
Brazilian US$4,500).
5.09      A contingency of 10% has been added to the costs of all civil works
and construction supervision to allow for increases in quantities. It is
expected that designs for road rehabilitation would need some modifications
because of further pavement deterioration in the period between the site
investigations and actual construction. The same contingency is also justified
for weighing stations because average costs have been used. A quantity contin-
gency of 5% was used for all other items. The provision for future price
increases (expressed in dolLars) has been calculated separately for all items
following the most recent Bank guidelines, which are generally applicable
to Brazil. The total price contingency amounts to about 14% of the base cost,
the bulk of which relates to the Highway Rehabilitation Program.

- 26 -
5.10      Estimates of the foreign exchange component for civil works are
based on an analysis of major construction costs (fuel, asphalt, equipment,
spare parts, labor and overheads). It was assumed that all works would be
awarded to local contractors, as has been the case since the early 1970s.
Presently, Brazil is a net importer of steel, asphalt and crude oil, but
cement is produced and fuel refined locally; most construction equipment is
manufactured or assembled in the country. However, locally produced goods,
raw materials and manufacturing processes have significant foreign exchange
components. Rehabilitation and other civil works in the proposed project
are equipment-intensive and require substantial quantities of asphalt and
cement. The foreign exchange component averages about 37%. Construction
supervision, engineering design and IPR's pavement research study would
probably be carried out by local consultants. The estimated foreign exchange
component for these services averages 24%. Consulting services for the High-
way Maintenance Delegation Program would be provided by local and foreign
firms with a foreign exchange component of about 40%. Most of the equipment,
vehicles and plant for the maintenance program is expected to be produced
locally, and a foreign exchange component of 50% has been estimated. The
supply, installation and maintenance of weighing equipment would have a
foreign exchange component of about 37%. This takes into account the fact
that some equipment components would have to be imported. Specialized testing
equipment for the Researclh Program would have to be imported and has a 100%
foreign exchange component.
C.   Financing and Disbursement
5.11      The proposed Bank loan of US$114.0 million would finance about 37%
of project expenditure corresponding to the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent. Government contribution to the cost of the rehabilitation, weight
control and IPR's research components would be made through the DNER budget
and the extension of the GEIPOT/DNER study through the budget of the Secretaria
de Planejamento (SEPLAN).  The Government has confirmed that it would provide
sufficient funds for these purposes. The local ,cost of the Maintenance
Delegation Program would be met by the State of Parana through the budget of
DER-PR.  The State Government has confirmed that sufficient funds would be
made available for this purpose. Additional commitments have been obtained
from the State and FederaL Governments concerning: (a) funding by DER-PR of
expenditures for maintenance of state roads (para 7.12); (b) funding by DNER
of expenditures for maintenance of delegated federal highways and strength-
ening and rehabilitation of federal highways (paras 3.17, 6.11 and 7.14).
5.12      The loan would be made to the Federal Government.  As was done with
previous highway projects, DNER would administer a revolving fund for payments
to contractors, suppliers and consultants and for reimbursement of eligible
project expenditures incurred by DER-PR. The revolving fund would be replen-
ished with contributions of the Federal and State Governments. During nego-
tiations, the Government confirmed that DNER would establish a revolving fund
with an initial deposit of US$2.0 million equivalent in a special account at a
suitable Brazilian bank. Establishment of the revolving fund would be a
condition for loan effectiveness. The Government further confirmed that DNER
would make regular deposit:s in the revolving fund as are required to ensure
that, on the first day of each month, there would be available sufficient funds



- 27 -
to cover project costs during the forthcoming month, in accordance with work
and equipment procurement schedules. The experience with the revolving funds
for the four earlier projects has been satisfactory.
5.13      Disbursements of the Bank loan (Table 5.1) would be made against
full documentation as follows:
(a)  Highway Rehabilitation Program - 36% of total expenditures
for civil works and consulting services for supervision and
engineering;
(b)  Highway Maintenance Delegation Program - 40% of total
expenditures for civil works, equipment, vehicles and
technical assistance;
(c)  Weighing Station Program - 36% of total expenditures for
civil works and 100% of foreign expenditures for supply and
installation of weighing equipment; and
(d)  Highway Research Program - 36% of total expenditures for con-
sulting services to IPR; 100% of foreign expenditures for
foreign advisory services to IPR and GEIPOT; and 100% of
foreign expenditures for overseas training and for equipment.
D.   Execution
5.14      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of the following
agencies:
(a)  Highway Rehabilitation Program - DNER through its Maintenance
Directorate for the civil works and supervision, its Planning
Directorate for the detailed engineering, and both of the
above Directorates for development of a pavement management
system for federal highways;
(b)  Highway Maintenance Delegation Program - DER-PR, principally
through its Maintenance Directorate in accordance with the
Subsidiary Agreement with DNER (para 5.15);
(c)  Weighing Station Program - DNER through its Transit Directorate;
and
(d)  Highway Research Program - DNER through IPR for its pavement
design study and GEIPOT for extension of its ongoing study.
The project implementation schedule covering all project items and indicating
Bank involvement is shown in Chart 5.1.
5.15      Execution of the Highway Maintenance Delegation Program in
Parana would be in accordance with documents prepared by DER-PR "Programa
de Financiamento para Manutencao da Rede Estadual e Federal pelo DER-PR,
Documento I" dated December 1976 and "Documento II" dated March 1978. The
respective responsibilities of DNER and DER-PR for the implementation of



- 28 -
the Program and the relate!d financial obligations would be defined in a
Subsidiary Agreement between DNER and DER-PR. The scope and content of the
Subsidiary Agreement were reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Final
approval of the Subsidiary Agreement is a condition for disbursement of the
Highway Maintenance Delegation Program.
E.   Procurement
(i) Highway Rehabilitation Program
5.16      Construction contracts for reh-b-ilitation works would be procured by
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Bidding
would be in two batches of 12 and 15 lots, about six months apart. Rehabilitation
contracts are expected to range between US$3.0 million and US$11.0 million.
Supervision of the rehabilitation works as well as detailed engineering for
rehabilitation of further highways would be carried out by consultants under
conditions acceptable to the Bank and in line with similar arrangements under
previous highway projects.
(ii) Highway Maintenance Delegation Program
5.17      Equipment, vehicles, plant and specialized instrumentation (scales,
radio and radar units) for weight and traffic control would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Provi-
sion of about one-year's supply of spars parts -muld be included with purchases
where desirable.
5.18      Contracts less than US$1.0 million equivalent for construction of
regional centers and expansion and modernization of district offices, work-
shops, stores and laboratories, and for weigh bridges and traffic control posts
along state highways would be procured following procedures which are in
accordance with Bank Guidelines and allow for adequate competition. Bids would
be advertised locally since the contracts would be too small and scattered to
attract foreign firms not already established in Brazil. Because of the large
number of small contracts expected, the Bank would review and approve ex-ante
standard procurement documents, but awards would be reviewed on an ex-post
basis. Work contracted under this procedure would not aggregate more than
US$8.0 million. When the above limits are exceeded, procurement would be
carried out by international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.
5.19      Contracts less than US$500,000 equivalent for supply and installation
of tools and equipment for regional and district offices, workshops, stores and
laboratories would be procured following procedures which are in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Bids would be advertised locally since these contracts
would be too small to attract foreign firms not already represented in Brazil.
Because of the large number of purchases expected, the Bank would review and
approve ex-ante standard procurement documents, but awards would be reviewed
on an ex-post basis. Purchases contracted under this procedure would not aggre-
gate more than US$3.0 million. When the above limits are exceeded, procurement
would be carried out by initernational competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Guidelines.



- 29 -
5.20      For all ex-post awards, the Bank would retain the right to exclude
from financing any contracts not awarded according to Bank Guidelines and to
cancel the respective amount from the loan.
(iii) Weighing Station Program
5.21      Civil work contracts, expected to range between US$2.0 million and
US$4.0 million, and the weighing equipment contract (about US$2.6 million)
would be procured by international competitive bidding, in accordance with
Bank Guidelines, following arrangements similar to the ones adopted in the
Fifth Highway Project.
(iv) Highway Research Program
5.22      Practically all testing equipment is of a specialized proprietary
nature, and would be procured directly from the suppliers or their represen-
tatives in Brazil (estimated value about US$120,000). Procedures for engaging
consulting services are covered in the relevant chapter for each program.
F.   Project Impact
5.23      The project would deal only with existing roads and would therefore
not be the cause of significant alteration to the environment. The project
would have a considerable impact on highway safety. First, travel on deterio-
rated pavements is hazardous, especially when traffic is dense: the rehabilita-
tion component would therefore contribute to safer driving conditions on
heavily trafficked federal highways. Second, the maintenance program for the
state of Parana includes a specific component to support and amplify the safety
campaign initiated by the state. This campaign has already brought a signifi-
cant reduction in the number of accidents and related casualties.
5.24      The rehabilitation and other civil work components would provide
employment in 1979 and 1980 to more than 4,000 persons: engineers, technicians
and workers employed by contractors and consultants. Pavement strengthening
and rehabilitation consist primarily of laying asphalt mixes under closely
controlled conditions. Such works require complex specialized machinery and
offer a relatively limited scope of employment of unskilled laborers. The
expansion of the maintenance capacity of the DER-PR and the establishment of
regional centers would create about 2,000 new permanent positions (engineers,
technicians, administrative and clerical, mechanics and operators), nearly all
of them located outside Curitiba, the state capital.
G.   Economic Assessment
5.25      Detailed economic analyses have been carried out for each of the
major components of the project: the Highway Rehabilitation Program, the
Highway Maintenance Delegation Program and the Weighing Station Program
(Phase II). The three programs account for about 97% of base project costs.
5.26      In carrying out the economic assessment, adjustments have been made,
insofar as practicable, to avoid the influence of taxes and subsidies and
to account for the comparative undervaluation of the local currency vis-a-vis
the US dollar (Table 5.2). The value, net of taxes, was estimated for vehicles



- 30 -
and their tires, and for fuels and lubricants (Table 5.3). A "shadow" exchange
rate 30% above the official rate was used. The shadow rate was estimated
to reflect import deposits, export taxes and quantitative distortions. However,
no similar attempt was made at shadow pricing labor costs of the project. The
Rehabilitation Program would, by nature of work, be capital intensive. Imple-
mentation of the Maintenance Program would demand skilled rather than unskilled
human resources, the shadow price of which is probably negligibly different
from its market price. Implementation of the project would demand almost no
expropriation of land and, therefore, no shadow price has been used for it.
5.27      Benefits of the proposed project would accrue to the economy at
large in the form of savings in, or avoided increases of, vehicle operating
costs and savings in and/or avoided maintenance costs. Rising user costs
would eventually affect prices of internally consumed goods, further funneling
inflationary pressures, and of exports, on which the economy is vitally depen-
dent for its future growth. Saved or avoided maintenance costs would accrue
to the Government. The largest impact of executing the proposed project would
be first felt by the road transport industry because user savings are by far
the most important benefit of the project. Competitiveness of the industry
(Chapter II) would ensure that, in the long run, project benefits would be
passed on to the rest of the economy, thereby ensuring a broad distribution of
the benefits. The income distribution effect of the project, however, is
estimated to be limited because of the nature of the project and the economic
sector which it affects.
5.28      The evaluation of each of the programs in the project is presented
in subsequent chapters. Eased on these evaluations, an average weighted
economic rate of return has been estimated for the project as a whole. The
full project has an estimated return of 60%; it is therefore well justified
and suitable for Bank financing.
H.   Project Risk
5.29      Cost estimates for rehabilitation work are based on detailed
engineering, and the weighing station program is the continuation of a program
already under way. DNER's technical capacity as well as the level of com-
petence of the road engineering and contracting industries have been demon-
strated under previous and. ongoing highway projects. The arrangements for
supervision are adequate and reflect good experience with similar arrange-
ments established under previous projects. Therefore, the physical implemen-
tation of the project presents no special risk. The Federal Government,
through the Ministry of Planning, has confirmed that sufficient counterpart
funds would be made available to DNER and GEIPOT.
5.30      Installation of modern and efficient weighing stations is a condition
necessary for enforcement of vehicle weight regulations. It is, however, not
sufficient in itself. The stations have to be properly manned and maintained,
and non-complying trucks have to be stopped (unloaded and sanctioned in accor-
dance with the law). The DNER enforcement program has been thoroughly thought
out, and DNER and the states have the experience and the police forces necessary
to make good use of the stations. The Government is firmly committed to the
program and has undertaken a vast publicity campaign to develop public aware-
ness and to inform the trucking industry.  While past efforts toward strict



- 31 -
enforcement of weight regulations in Brazil have achieved limited success, the
detailed preparation and the broad support behind the present enforcement
program give reasonable expectation of success. The impact of the program
would be closely monitored.
5.31      As mentioned in Chapter  III and Annex 1, ongoing maintenance
delegation programs have suffered delay, due mainly to shortfalls in funds and
the backlog of rehabilitation, would be remedied under the proposed project.
Particular attention was given during project preparation to linking the
schedule for the delegation of maintenance of federal highways with the
elimination of the rehabilitation backlog in the state of Parana. The insti-
tutional and financial capacity of DER-PR to take up increased responsibilities
under the delegation program was assessed, and specific measures to strengthen
its staff have been agreed. The State Government has also confirmed its
willingness to meet the financial implications of the program, which were
clearly analyzed. While recognizing the inherent difficulties attached to all
efforts directed toward road maintenance, the present program does not present
unacceptable risks.
VI. THE HIGHWAY REHABILITATION PROGRAM
A.  Preparation
6.01      The Highway Rehabilitation Program has two main objectives:
(a) to support high priority rehabilitation of federal highways,
especially in the states of Minas Gerais, Parana and Rio Grande
do Sul; and
(b) to develop a pavement management system for systematic planning,
programming and engineering of pavement resealing, strengthening
and rehabilitation.
6.02      Detailed engineering for rehabilitating about 1,800 km of federal
highways was carried out under the Fifth Highway Project over the period
1976-1977 by 12 Brazilian consulting firms. DNER retained consultants
PACS (Brazil) to coordinate the studies, to provide overall technical
direction and to carry out economic analyses. From these studies, 1,509 km
were selected (13 roads) to be included in the proposed project, of which
800 km are located in Minas Gerais, 210 km in Mato Grosso, 200 km in Rio
Grande do Sul, 144 km in Goias and the remaining 155 km in the northeastern
states of Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte. The selection took into consider-
ation economic factors, priority for roads in states participating in the
Maintenance Delegation Program and a concern for spending a reasonable propor-
tion of project proceeds in the lesser developed areas.
B.   Rehabilitation Works
6.03      A description of the 13 roads to be rehabiliated is given in Annex 2.
They are generally trunk roads supporting a high proportion of commercial and
industrial traffic. They were constructed between seven and 20 years ago and,



- 32 -
while their geometric characteristics would provide adequate capacity for at
least the next ten years, the pavements have become insufficient to support
their traffic. The bulk of the work consists of strengthening existing
pavements, without any widening, by constructing high quality base courses
(waterbound macadam, or cement or asphalt stabilized) and an asphalt concrete
wearing course.  In addition to pavement strengthening, the works include
installation of proper drainage, where lacking, and provision of climbing
lanes for heavy vehicles on steep grades with significant traffic. Traffic
"black spots" such as narrow bridges, tight curves with poor sight distance,
and intersections would be eliminated or improved. In all cases, least cost
solutions were adopted. Overall, almost 80% of the costs go into pavement
works.
6.04      The 13 roads have been divided into 27 construction lots  to be
contracted in two batches, about six months apart: the first contains 12 lots
(631.2 km) and the second 15 lots (877.6 km).  Contract periods range from
10 to 30 months depending on the size and the complexity of the contract.
Table 6.1 gives a breakdown of costs for each lot and the estimated construc-
tion periods. The procurement schedule was reviewed and agreed during
negotiations.
6.05      The consultants who carried out detailed engineering also prepared
special specifications for each construction lot. General specifications are
based on DNER's standard practices which have been adopted for previous Bank-
financed projects; In previous projects, DNER insorperated into the contracts
the Conditions of Contract (International) prepared by the International
Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) - May 1967 Edition. However,
inconsistencies were left between different parts of the contract documents.
Consequently, DNER has now prepared uniform conditions of contract which would
be used for future Bank-financed civil works in the highway sector that are
subject to international competitive bidding.
6.06      Rehabilitation contracts under the proposed project would come under
the Maintenance Directorate, which has had limited experience with project control.
Its division responsible for rehabilitation works has only four engineers in
the group which coordinates contracts. This group would have to be strength-
ened. A minimum of six experienced engineers, each overseeing a geographical
region, would be necessary to provide effective coordination of DNER's increas-
ing portfolio of rehabilitation contracts.  The supervui,cion t-chniqites developed
with the assistance of INGEROUTE (para 3.22) would be adopted by the Maintenance
Directorate. Furthermore, DNER has retained consultants to advise the coordi-
nating group on technical issues, particularly pavement design changes, which
are expected to occur frequently due to the two-to-three-year interval between
site investigations and project construction. During negotiations, the
Government confirmed that, throughout the project period, DNER's Maintenance
Directorate would employ at least six experienced engineers to supervise the
rehabilitation contracts.  Staffing of these six positions would be a condition
of disbursement for the Rehabilitation Program.
6.07      DNER would retain consultants to carry out works supervision under
arrangements similar to those adopted in previous highway projects. Prior
to mid-1977, the consulting firm responsible for detailed engineering of



- 33 -
a particular highway project also supervised the construction. This practice
has now been discontinued; consultants for supervision would be selected
on the basis of technical and financial proposals. The change in procedure is
expected to produce more rigorous supervision and greater control over the
cost of these services. The procedures for selecting consultants for super-
vision as well as their terms of reference were reviewed and agreed during
negotiations.
C.   Detailed Engineering
6.08      The proposed project includes preparation of detailed engineering
for about 3,000 km of roads requiring rehabilitation in the near future; the
majority of these would be federal highways in states participating, or likely
to participate, in the Maintenance Delegation Program. The DRFs in Minas
Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Bahia prepared preliminary condition
surveys of the federal highways in their states; on the basis of these surveys
and preliminary estimates of economic returns, DNER's Maintenance and Planning
Directorates selected a first group of 22 roads, totaling 1,710 km, for engineer-
ing (Table 6.2).
6.09      A second group of roads, totaling about 1,300 km, would be selected
from a priority list determined by means of a detailed condition inventory of
the paved federal network. DNER, with the assistance of consultants, is pres-
ently undertaking this inventory, which should be completed by the end of
February 1979. The data collected would bz incorporated into DNER's computer-
ized inventory and would be analyzed with the help of the Highway Design and
Maintenance (HDM) Model. From the inventory and the model, DNER would deter-
mine priorities and future budgetary requirements for resealing, strengthening
and rehabilitation of paved federal highways. During negotiations, DNER
agreed to select, by June 30, 1979, and after consultation with the Bank, the
second group of federal highways to be engineered under the project. Such
determination would be based on the above inventory and would give priority to
projects supporting planned or ongoing maintenance delegation programs.
6.10      The detailed engineering would be carried out by consultants.  Terms
of reference would be similar to those used in the Fifth Highway Project with
modifications based on the experience gained. PACS would continue as coordi-
nator and technical advisor to DNER's Planning Directorate and would also
carry out economic analyses as under the Fifth Highway Project.  Its services,
which are not financed under the project, are important in providing reasonably
uniform design criteria. The continuation of consulting services to DNER's
Planning Directorate for coordination of detailed engineering for rehabilita-
tion projects was agreed during negotiations.
D.   Planning, Programming and Engineering Procedures
6.11      The project would assist DNER in improving planning and programming
techniques for resealing, strengthening and rehabilitation of paved roads
through development of a pavement management system. Inadequate ad hoc program-
ming has led to excessive patching and eventually to pavement deterioration.
DNER has prepared preliminary six-year programs (1978-1983) for overlays and
rehabilitation of federal highways in the three states (Minas Gerais, Rio
Grande do Sul and Parana) participatina in the Maintenance Delegation Program.



- 34 -
These preliminary six-year programs and the related financial requirements
were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
6.12      The condition inventory of paved federal highways and its incorpora-
tion into DNER's computerized inventory and the HDM model should be updated
periodically. From the data, DNER would, over the project period, develop a
pavement management system which would include roll-over pluriannual programs
for pavement overlays ancl rehabilitation of federal highways. During negotia-
tions, the Government confirmed that DNER would (a) adopt, by December 31,
1979, adequate organization arrangements and procedures for developing and
implementing a pavement management system for federal highways including
organizational arrangement and procedures for planning, programming and
engineering of resealing,, strengthening and rehabilitation; and (b) thereafter
exchange views annually with the Bank on its annual and pluriannual programs
for such works.
E.   Economic Assessment
(i) General
6.13      The economic analysis of the 13 road sections to be rehabilitated
was carried out by means of the Bank's HDM Model 1/. For analytical purposes,
the roads were defined as shown in Table 6.3, where each road was divided into
sections with different geomorphological conditions. These sections do not
necessarily coincide with the construction lots.
(ii) Costs
6.14      It was assumed that, in both the "with" and "without" project cases,
a comparable level of routine, and the same type of periodic, maintenance
would be carried out, i.e., the same activities would be performed at similar
frequencies. However, because rehabilitation improves the condition of the
roads, the amount of maintenance required "with" and "without" the project,
which is also a function of the pavement condition, is substantially different.
Significant savings in maintenance costs are realized in the "with" project
case. For all sections, only the least cost technically viable alternative
was considered. PACS' analyses indicated that, given present and expected
future traffic levels, this alternative was the strengthening of pavements
to extend their lives for ten years (Table 6.4). Only minor improvements,
mainly on safety grounds, were accepted in the design of the rehabilitation
works (para 6.03). The analysis is therefore confined to ascertaining whether
the least cost alternative returns rate higher than the opportunity cost of
capital for Brazil, which has been estimated at 11%.
(iii) Traffic
6.15      Traffic volumes on the roads to be rehabilitated were estimated by
means of surveys carried out by the consultants who prepared the engineering
designs and were checked by DNER and PACS during project preparation. The
1/   DNER sent an engineer to Washington to assist Bank staff with HDM Model
analyses of the Rehabilitation and Maintenance Programs.



- 35 -
latest available estimate was for 1975; this was updated to year 1 of the
analysis (1979) by assuming that traffic continued to grow at the same rate as
in the past. Table 6.5 shows the respective traffic, its distribution by
vehicle type and growth rate for each of the roads to be rehabilitated.
6.16      No generated traffic was considered because the project roads have
well established traffic and serve already developed corridors. All roads
to be rehabilitated are trunk, interstate highways on which traffic growth
is determined mostly by the overall growth of the economy rather than the
price elasticity of the goods transported. Estimating the additional growth
of the economy that implementation of the program would generate is clearly
beyond the scope of transport analysis only and has therefore been omitted.
Inasmuch as it may occur, however, it would merely add benefits and therefore
increase the rate of return for the Program.
(iv) Benefits
6.17      Benefits due to the rehabilitation were assumed to occur on account
of reduced maintanance expenditures and reduced vehicle operating costs in
the "with" project vis-a-vis the "without" project situation. Table 6.6
shows the total undiscounted maintenance expenditures for the 10-year life of
the rehabilitation projects in both cases; as mentioned, substantial savings
are realized, on average about 66% of expenses that would be incurred were the
project not implemented.
6.18      Vehicle operating costs for each road were estimated on the basis
of the information in Table 5.3 for both the "with" and "without" project.
Table 6.7 compares the costs in the first year after rehabilitation for each
vehicle type. On average, about 20% of vehicle operating costs is saved by
carrying out the proposed rehabilitations.
6.19      In aggregate, for the whole program, 95% of benefits are due to
reduced user costs and 5% to reduced maintenance costs.
(v) Economic Assessment
6.20      Table 6.8 summarizes the economic criteria used to assess the
feasibility of the proposed rehabilitations. These criteria show the highly
beneficial effects of implementing the program. All rehabilitations yield
substantially higher returns than the opportunity cost of capital, only one
has a rate of return below 40% and three have rates above 100%. The proposed
program, with an economic cost of about US$185 million equivalent (1977 values),
is estimated to yield a net present value of over US$550 million equivalent
(1977 values) in its estimated ten-year life.
VII. THE HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE DELEGATION PROGRAM
IN THE STATE OF PARANA
A.   Background
7.01      Parana has about 3,400 km of federal highways, of which 80% or about
2,700 km are paved. Maintenance of federal highways by DER-PR commenced in



- 36 -
1971 when 1,070 km were delegated. By 1977, maintenance of 1,580 km had been
delegated to DER-PR with costs refunded by DNER 1/ and a further 1,200 km were
being maintained by DNER through force account or by contract (Table 3.7).
DER-PR has 18 districts which are responsible for maintenance of all state
highways and the delegated federal highways (Map IBRD 13206); the district
engineer presently reports directly to DER-PR's headquarters at Curitiba.
7.02      The state highway network has remained fairly constant over the
past ten years and, in 1976, covered about 10,300 km. Paved roads, however,
have almost tripled over this period and are now about 30% (3,000 km) of the
state network. The change of character of the network is accelerating; a
further 1,000 km were paved in 1977, and, in August 1977, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) approved two loans to Parana, totaling US$55.0 million,
to help construct and pave a further 1,200 km.
7.03      Parana has about 110,000 km of municipal roads, nearly all earth.
Since mid-1975, DER-PR has been providing assistance to the municipalities for
construction and upgrading of municipal roads, through a program called
PROSAFRAS, by the provision of construction materials and fuel. At the end
of 1976, about 11,000 km of roadworks had been included in the program, of
which 7,400 km were completed. The districts also provide ad hoc assistance
for maintaining municipal roads, mainly through lending of graders.
7.04      The effect of the swing from unpaved to paved roads over the past
few years has required considerable re-equipping of the districts and reorien-
tation of routine maintenance activities. Since 1974, DER-PR has purchased
about US$18.0 million of maintenance equipment and vehicles; consequently,
the fleet is up to date and generally in good condition. Also, DER-PR has
recently improved its maintenance organization and now has the basic structure
with which to take on maintenance of the remaining undelegated federal highways.
7.05      In 1977, DER-PR proposed to the State Government a reorganization
of the Maintenance Directorate. The principal change would be the creation
of five regional centers, each of which would coordinate maintenance and train-
ing activities of three to five districts and be responsible for programming
and executing periodic maintenance and rehabilitation and for major equipment
repairs. The proposed reorganization would decentralize decision-making and
should improve overall maintenance efficiency and cost effectiveness. During
negotiations, the State Governmpnt cnnfirmned that the proposed reorganization
would be implemented starting January 1, 1979. Final approval of the reor-
ganization by State authorities would be a condition of disbursement for
the Maintenance Program.
7.06      The state has also been active in supporting a traffic safety campaign
which commenced in 1974. Highway policing of state networks throughout Brazil
is provided by a special corps which is responsible to the state Governor
through the state's Secretariat of Public Security.  Parana has one of the
best trained highway police forces in the country, and the results of the
1/   An additional 660 km of "unofficial" federal highways are also being
maintained by DER-PR, without cost refunds by DNER. Procedures to
normalize the status of these roads are under way.



- 37 -
traffic safety campaign have been encouraging. At the end of 1977, Parana had
about 500 trained highway police, 1/ and two training programs for about 200
more candidates are to be carried out in 1978. Between 1970 and 1973, the
number of accidents on Parana's state highways increased from about 2,000 to
4,000; however, since the start of the campaign, the number has remained
constant, notwithstanding annual traffic increases of about 12%. DER-PR
provides all vehicles, equipment and installations for the highway police.
The proposed project would assist in expanding and modernizing these facilities
which, at present, are inadequate for effective control.
B.   The Program in Parana
7.07      The program would enable DER-PR to improve maintenance and traffic
control on the state highway network and to receive the delegation of main-
tenance for all federal highways within a period of five years. The proposed
project would assist DER-PR in:
(a)  creating five new regional centers at Curitiba, Londrina, Ponta
Grossa, Maringa and Cascavel; expanding, modernizing and equipping
offices, workshops and stores in the existing 18 districts;
(b)  purchasing vehicles, equipment and plant;
(c)  installing and equipping weighing stations and traffic control posts
along state highways; and
(d)  providing DER-PR with technical and managerial assistance to carry
out the program and to set up a permanent training system.
Table 7.1 gives an annual breakdown in costs based on DER-PR's estimates
updated to June 1978 prices. The total cost estimate (excluding contingencies)
amounts to about US$26.0 million. The project items have been designed on the
basis of detailed assessment of requirements and are described in the "Programa
de Financiamento para Manutencao da Rede Estadual e Federal pelo DER-PR"
(para 5.15), which would be used as a guide during project execution.
7.08      DER-PR has drawn up a provisional list of maintenance equipment,
plant and vehicles (Table 7.2) to be procured over the period 1978-1981. Cost
of equipment is estimated at US$14.1  illins ."ich iS about 55% of the
program; the greater part would be for equipping the new regional centers and
expanding the fleet for the transport of materials and personnel.
7.09      The proposed project would also include supply and installation of
about 27 weigh bridges and equipping of about 53 traffic control posts. These
requirements have been drawn up by DER-PR together with the state highway
police and are designed to provide basic coverage of the state network.
DER-PR has engaged consultants (own funds) to advise on the types and loca-
tions of the weigh bridges which would depend on traffic volume and seasonal
peaks. The state system would also have to be integrated with the 13 weighing
stations that DNER is about to install along federal highways in Parana under
1/   DNER has a further 500 police patrolli-na the federal network in Parana.



- 38 -
the Fifth Highway Project. The number of traffic control posts has been
based on one per 100 km of roads with 2,000 vpd. All posts would contain
radio communications, and each would operate two traffic control vehicles
equipped with radio and radar.
7.10      The proposed project would provide technical assistance for planning,
supervision and control of raaintenance operations, coupled with a training
program which would help DER-PR set up permanent training units at headquarters
and in each of the regional centers. The technical assistance would be carried
out by local and foreign consultants; at least three foreign experts would be
required to provide know-how in areas where local expertise is lacking, such as
maintenance programming, costing and training. The main effort would be con-
centrated in the first 30 months of the project with top level advisory services
continuing over a four-year period. The terms of reference for technical assis-
tance prepared by DER-PR and DNER were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
A special emphasis has been placed on the training aspect, and Bank staff pro-
posed procedures both for implementing short-term programs for training the
considerable number of new maintenance staff required, and for setting up and
running continuing programs.
7.11      DER-PR's Maintenance Directorate would be required to assign seven
full-time professionals to carry out training programs. These professionals
would form a permanent training group; five of them would become training
officers, one in each of the new regional centers to be created as part of
DER-PR's reorganization. At least six other full-time professionals would
also be required to accompany the consultants during the the project. During
negotiations, the State Government agreed on the number and qualifications of
local and foreign consultants and professionals to be assigned by DER-PR to
the Highway Maintenance Delegation Program. The registration of the consul-
tants' contract with the Central Bank of Brazil, if legally required, and
DER-PR's compliance with the agreed staffing plan, would be conditions for
disbursement for the Maintenance Program.
C.   Recurrent Expenditures
7.12      Since 1974, budget allocations in Parana have been adequate for
routine maintenance and equipment renewal; also since then, an increasing
amount has been allocated annually for periodic maintenance. DER-PR's mainte-
nance expenditures in 1976 amounted to about US$20.0 million (excluding
periodic maintenance - reseals, etc.). The figure is expected to remain
constant, in real terms, which is satisfactory. In 1976, about US$2.0 million
was allocated to periodic maintenance, and the programmed expenditures for
reseals and overlays in 1977 and 1978 are US$6.5 million and US$14.0 million
respectively. This indicates a welcome shift in maintenance policy toward
timely periodic maintenance, which would be further emphasized under the
project. During negotiations, the State Government confirmed that DER-PR
would be allocated sufficieni: funds for routine and periodic maintenance
during the project period 1978-1982; the amount of such allocations would be
reviewed annually with the Bank.
D.   Commitments by DNER
7.13      The schedule for delegation of maintenance of federal highways to
DER-PR over the project period 1978-1982 (Chart 7.1) and the related mutual



- 39 -
obligation of DNER and DER-PR would be the object of a Subsidiary Agreement
(para 5.15). During negotiations, the schedule for delegation of maintenance
of federal highways to DER-PR was confirmed.
7.14      Of the 2,700 km of paved federal highways in Parana, 1,640 km
require strengthening or rehabilitation; maintenance of 710 km of these has
already been delegated. DNER's objective is to delegate, in the future, only
highways in good condition and to catch up on the rehabilitation backlog.
DNER would carry out, concurrently with the delegation program, a seven-year
rehabilitation program (1978-1984) for federal highways in Parana. This
program is now being defined on the basis of a preliminary survey (para 6.11).
Some of the roads would be engineered under the proposed project. During
negotiations, DNER confirmed that federal highways in Parana would be rehabil-
itated, as required, to permit delegation of maintenance to DER-PR in accor-
dance with the agreed schedule given in Chart 7.1.
E.   Economic Assessment
(i) General
7.15      The project would build up DER-PR's maintenance capacity to enable
it to face the increasing requirements of its own network and to take on all
federal highways. The project would lead to adoption of improved maintenance
policies based on a better knowledge of cost of various operations and their
effect on road conditions. Since the present performance of DER-PR in this
task is relatively adequate, the project is expected to effect only a small
improvement in cost effectiveness of maintenance of state roads. The main
savings on maintenance costs would be realized on roads which are presently
being maintained by DNER on force account or by contract. One of the major
impacts of the program would come through better programming of periodic
maintenance and pavement strengthening, which would reduce wasteful patching
and keep pavement surfaces in far better condition, thus lowering vehicle
operation costs.
7.16      To assess the economic return of the Highway Maintenance Delegation
Program in the state of Parana, a combination of the HDM Model and the tradi-
tional return analysis model (CBPACK) were used. The HDM Model was utilized
in its simplest form to estimate the total cost of transport, including
maintenance costs and user costs, for Parana's total network in both the
existing conditions ("without" project case) and those that would be made
possible by the implementation of the project ("with" project case). CBPACK
was then used to compare the total benefits of the "with" over the "without"
project case with the investment costs required to carry out the program.
Because of simplifications adopted in using the HDM Model, no attempt was made
at determining which maintenance policy would be optimum for Parana; the
analysis was constrained to assessing whether the best estimate of the actions
made possible by the program was justified, i.e., whether the additional
resources required to carry out the program (both investment costs and addi-
tional recurrent maintenance costs) yield rates higher than the opportunity
cost of capital (11%). The analysis shows clearly that improvements beyond
the best estimate are possible and would yield substantial returns. Since,
however, these improvements are mainly based on the absorption of improved
technology and better planning and programming, it was found preferable to



- 40 -
define the best estimate without taking them into account. Inasmuch as
Brazilians have proven in the past to be highly capable of absorbing new
techniques and of being able to put into practice in a short time new methods
of planning and programming, the estimated return on the proposed program may
be considered a minimum.
(ii) Analysis Network
7.17      For purposes of the analysis, Parana's federal and state networks
were divided into 13 well specified and characterized links, two to identify
earth roads, three for graveL roads, two for surface-treated roads and six
for roads paved with asphalt concrete (Table 7.3). For each of these links,
there is a detailed description of geometric characteristics and pavement
type, 1/ as well as details on terrain, subgrade strength and climatic condi-
tions. These characteristics, together with the annual maintenance applied,
the traffic and its growth rate, determine the degree of deterioration of the
road and, consequently, the cost of operating the vehicles on the roads in
their particular year-to-year condition.
(iii) Maintenance Activities, Unit Costs and Frequency
7.18      For analytical purposes, maintenance of both paved and unpaved roads
is divided into four activities for unpaved roads and five for paved roads,
each with its unit cost (Table 5.2). Table 7.4 describes the frequency in the
execution of these activities in the "without" project case, and Table 7.5 in
the "with" project case. The first-is based on available data, observation
and experience in Parana, and the second on the best estimate of the changes
that would be effected by the program. In general, as mentioned before, no
attempt has been made to assess the impact of improved technology and better
planning and programming; therefore, most of the proposed project's impact is
in reducing unit costs of routine maintenance activities. No increases in
productivity have been assumed to occur, except for grading, spot regraveling,
patching and surface dressing.
7.19      The "cost adjustment factors" indicated in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 are
factors applied to the unit costs given in Table 5.2 for each maintenance
activity. These factors vary, depending on whether the maintenance is performed
by DER-PR, by DNER force account or by contract. The factors were determined
from data provided by DER-PR and DRF in Parana. DER-PR has lower unit mainte-
nance costs than DNER and contractors; this is especially pronounced for labor
intensive activities such as pot-hole patching, culvert and drain cleaning,
vegetation control and shoulder repairs. Presently, average annual mainte-
nance costs per km 2/ are: (a) DER-PR, about US$1,600 for unpaved roads
and US$2,500 for paved roads; (b) DRF in Parana, about US$1,800 for unpaved
roads and US$2,750 for paved roads; and (c) contractors in Parana, about
US$3,500 for paved roads. ImLplementation of the program, with DER-PR becoming
responsible for all maintenance, is expected to reduce costs to about 10%
1/   Consideration was also given to Parana's program for paving earth and
gravel roads (para 7.02).
2/   Excluding overlays and rehabilitation.



- 41 -
below DER-PR's present level. No reduction in costs for overlays and rehabil-
itation are expected since these works are nearly always contracted out, and
this arrangement would probably continue except for short stretches which
DER-PR intends to undertake by force account.
(iv) Traffic
7.20      Each of the links defined above has a level of traffic associated
with it, as shown in Table 7.6; in many instances, roads were broken up into
sections to reflect their different traffic volumes and attached to the link
type that reflected that volume. A rate of growth of 11.9% was used for the
traffic of the state of Parana. This is the weighted average growth for the
state during the period 1970-1976, as shown in Table 2.2.
(v) Benefits
7.21      Benefits from implementing the Highway Maintenance Delegation Program
are assumed to occur on account of decreased maintenance costs, chiefly for
paved roads, and avoided vehicle operating cost increases. Table 7.7 shows
both economic maintenance and user costs in the "without" and "with" project
cases. In general, total costs of carrying out the maintenance of unpaved
roads are higher in the "with" project case. This is due to the increased
volume of maintenance activity, which is then reflected by the better condition
of the roads and the consequent saving in user costs. In contrast, total
costs of maintaining paved roads, including the federal roads delegated to the
state, can be expected to be substantially lower than at present. This is due
to the comparatively high cost of DNER's presently contracted maintenance.
Since, simultaneously, an improvement in the condition of paved state roads
can be expected, the net outcome is a significant saving in user costs on all
state roads. This condition is borne out in Table 7.7 where positive user
savings are shown for both paved and unpaved roads. In aggregate, 35% of
benefits are due to maintenance cost savings and 65% to user cost savings.
(vi) Economic Return
7.22      Table 7.8 summarizes the economic costs and benefits of implement-
ing the proposed program and shows the calculation of the economic criteria
used to assess its economic feasibility. The best estimate of the economic
rate of return 1/ of the Program is 17.8%, and it is expected to yield, in its
assumed ten-year life, a net present value of about US$5 million equivalent
(1977 values), discounted at the opportunity cost of capital (11%).
VIII. WEIGHING STATION PROGRAM (PHASE II)
A.   Background and Preparation
8.01      The requirement  for strengthening and rehabilitating federal
roads has brought about an acute awareness of the need to check vehicle
overloading. Improving enforcement of weight control regulations has been,
1/   Defined as indicated in paragraph 7.16.



- 42 -
since 1975, an essential function of the Government's highway policy. Brazil
has adequate regulations limiting vehicle weights and dimensions (para 2.17),
but the support and infrastructure necessary for enforcement have been lacking.
Phase I of a program to install weighing stations on federal highways to
provide a basic coverage of the system was included under the ongoing Fifth
Highway Project (Annex 1). The first phase of the program provided for
installation of 95 weighing stations; locations and costs were based on DNER's
preliminary estimates.
8.02      During 1975 and 1976, DNER funded a study by consultants (PROTOS,
Brazil) to identify more precisely weight control requirements and to determine
the most suitable locations and type of weighing equipment for Brazilian con-
ditions. PROTOS demonstrated that, for heavily trafficked highways, stationary
weighing of trucks was not practical and, after reviewing worldwide develop-
ments, demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of weighing vehicles in
motion. Consequently, DNER decided, with the Bank's concurrence, to modify
the program and build more elaborate stations than originally planned. The
study revealed that 127 new weighing stations would be required to provide a
basic coverage of the federal highway system. The 95 stations in the Fifth
Highway Project making up Phas,e I of the program are located in nine southern
and central states. The remaining 32 stations to be installed in ten northern
states (Table 8.1) constitute Phase II of the program.
8.03      Installation of the weighing stations in Phase I is expected to
commence in 1978. Phase II would not commence until the system has been
tested and put into operation, which should be by early 1979. During nego-
tiations, locations of the weighing stations in Phase II were confirmed.
B.   The Weighing Stations
8.04      Weight control regulations rightly stipulate that overloaded
vehicles may not proceed on their journey. This requires provision for off-
the-road areas on which excess loads would be transferred to other vehicles.
The cost of civil works for each station is consequently high and amounts to
about 85% of the station's overall cost. Each station would not only carry
out automatic weighing of heavy vehicles, but would eventually be used as
highway police posts to check cargo, registration, vehicle roadworthiness
and permits. The weighing operation is entirely automatic, and computerized
printouts would register vehicle dimensions, axle configurations, loads
and any fines due to overloading. Only a vehicle's registration number
and owner/driver details would be recorded manually. The system has been
designed to reduce misuse to a minimum. Operating and maintenance costs of
a weighing-in-motion station are about 20% less than for a static-weighing
station because of lower staffing requirements.
8.05      Civil works are expected to commence in mid-1979; each contract
would contain three to six stations, depending on geographic location. Super-
vision would be carried out by consultants and funded by DNER, similar to
arrangements in Phase I. DNER's Works Directorate would provide overall con-
struction coordination. The equipment supplier would install the first
station and demonstrate, over a one-month period, that the equipment functions
according to specifications before being given the go-ahead for installation
of the remaining stations. Each station would be maintained by the equipment



- 43 -
supplier under a six-month warranty. After this period, the contract would
cover equipment maintenance for two years. The supplier would also train DNER
personnel in the operation and maintenance of the equipment. In order to
provide continual maintenance of the equipment, the supplier would be required
to set up local representation.
C.   Operation and Enforcement
8.06      DNER's Transit Directorate would be responsible for manning and
operating the stations. DNER's highway police, also under the authority of
this Directorate, would be responsible for enforcement. These arrangements
have been in effect for the few existing stations and are adequate. DNER
plans to operate each station 24 hours per day. About 40 persons are expected
to be allotted to each station. The annual maintenance and running cost per
station was estimated by PROTOS to be about US$400,000 equivalent, but DNER
would endeavor to reduce this cost by efficient utilization of operating
staff.  During negotiations, the Government agreed that, at all times, suffi-
cient resources, including staff and funds, would be allocated to operate and
maintain the vehicle weight control system. Also, the Government confirmed
that a monitoring system, acceptable to the Bank, providing for periodic
review of the staffing, the operating cost and the effectiveness of the weight
enforcement program, would be initiated within one year after installation of
the stations.
D.   Economic Assessment
8.07      The economic return of the weighing station program was assessed by
evaluating the impact of vehicle weight control on the annual overlay require-
ments for the federal highway system. The analysis evaluates the reduction in
pavement damage achieved by reducing truck overloading. Accumulated damage
for a given pavement is reflected by the total number of standard axles
carried over the years. 1/ Under the ideal situation of no overloading, a
typical heavily trafficked road, i.e., one carrying more than 1,000 vpd,
would require a 75-mm overlay every 10 years. The comparison between the
"without" project case, and the "with" project case was made by analyzing
the effects of the reduction in number of equivalent standard axles passing
over the highways due to a reduction in overloading. The timing of overlays
in the "without" and "with" cases was determined by comparing each of these
situations with the ideal situation. No account was taken of the effect of
weight control on the economies of moving cargo, i.e., benefits or disbenefits
of restricting loads.
8.08      The average distribution of truck traffic on Brazilian highways and
the average distribution of vehicle loadings, based on the PROTOS' analyses,
are as follows:
1/   Based on coefficients given in DNER's Norms for Design of Flexible
Pavements.



- 44 -
Traffic
38%   light trucks up to 10 tons
41%   medium trucks 10 to 15 tons
14%   heavy 15 to 22 tons
7%   very heavy trucks over 22 tons, and
Loadings
40%   empty                         10%   overloaded up to 10% above limit
20%   half legal limit               3%   overloaded 10 to 20% above limit
10%   three-quarters limit           2%   overloaded 20 to 30% above limit
10%   at legal limit
2%   overloaded 30 to 40% above limit
2%   overloaded 40 to 50% above limit
1%   overloaded over 50% above limit
From analyzing the above traffic and load distribution, it was determined that
the weight control program wou:Ld have a significant effect on the timing of
overlays only for roads with traffic above 1,000 ADT. Under present loading
conditions, a 75-mm overlay would be required every five years. Since imple-
mentation of the program was assumed not to eliminate overloading completely
but to avoid all overloads 10% or more above the legal limits (Table 8.2), the
ideal ten-year overlay cycle is not reached, but only a nine-year cycle.
8.09      Costs of implementing the program have been estimated on the basis
of experience gained during development of the first phase under the Fifth
Highway Project (para 8.02). Operating costs of the stations were estimated
in detail by PROTOS on the basis of the staff and policing necessary for each
station. Annual economic operating costs average 50% of economic capital
investment costs in each station and include, per shift, one stationmaster,
four operators, three policemen and two support personnel, as well as provi-
sion for maintenance of the equipment (40% of the equipment cost per year) and
allowance for administration (estimated to be 40% of capital costs per year).
8.10      Economic benefits of the program arise from avoided overlay costs
due to longer pavement life. Economic investment and operating costs were
estimated by PROTOS and are shown in Table 8.3. The program is estimated to
have a 29% rate of return and, in its estimated ten-year life, it would
generate a net present value of about US$18 million equivalent (1977 values)
at a discount rate equal to the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Brazil (11%).
IX. HIGHWAY RESEARCH PROGRAM
A.   Rationale and Objectives
9.01      DNER's current pavement design norms date back to 1966.  They are
based on experiments and research developed in other countries and need to
be adapted in several respects to reflect Brazilian conditions. The current
norms are applicable to design of new flexible pavements rather than to
strengthening and rehabilitating existing ones, which has become an important
problem for DNER. Over the past few years, DNER's Road Research Institute



- 45 -
(IPR) has undertaken field studies on deflections and performance of existing
pavements in relation to subgrade support, climatic conditions and accumulated
traffic in various regions of Brazil. Analysis of the data, which has proceeded
rather slowly because of IPR's limited capacity, would be carried out system-
atically under the proposed project.
9.02      The ongoing UNDP-financed GEIPOT/DNER Study (Annex 1) includes a
substantial element for pavement performance research and for evaluation of
various maintenance and overlay strategies. The study would also develop a
much more complete understanding of interrelationships between vehicle
operating cost and pavement conditions characterized by measurements of
specific variables of roughness, deflection and skid resistance, etc.
Once completed, this study would develop a new conceptual framework permitting
evaluation of pavement design and maintenance in relation to total transport
costs. The Highway Research Program would re-examine the problem of pavement
evaluation and design in this new framework.
9.03      The Highway Research Program has two main components:
(a) development of improved methods, better adapted to Brazilian
conditions, for pavement evaluation and design to be carried
out through IPR; and
(b) extension of the ongoing GEIPOT/DNER Study on the inter-
relationships between highway design, maintenance and vehicle
operating costs.
A secondary but important objective of the program would be to strengthen
the organization, planning and execution of road research in Brazil: first
through IPR, and later within the future institutional framework for trans-
portation research (para 3.35).
B.   IPR's Pavement Research Study
9.04      The purpose of IPR's Pavement Research Study, as set out in Terms of
Reference currently under discussion with DNER, is to:
(a) develop evaluation criteria for pavement performance;
(b) establish criteria for deciding on periodic maintenance and pavement
strengthening strategies (reseal, overlay, or rehabilitation) and
establish a rational basis for economic assessment of maintenance
policies (both in terms of priorities and timing of maintenance
actions); and
(c) evaluate and improve DNER's existing pavement design norms,
determine and verify the best method of calculating pavement
strengthening and develop design norms for overlays.
9.05      IPR's Study would have two phases.  Phase I would be a desk study,
which would not involve primary field data collection. It would encompass:
(a) a review of the existing literature on pavement evaluation and overlay
design methods; (b) identification of one or more overlay design methods



- 46 -
which seem most appropriate to Brazil; (c) verification of such methods in
light of field data existing in Brazil; and (d) completion of the analyses
of field data (para. 9.01) in order to evaluate and modify DNER's existing
pavement design norms. This phase would be carried out over about 12 months,
starting end-1978, and would result in the presentation of interim overlay
design methods and in updated design norms for new pavements. These would
form the basis for determining details of the second phase. The terms of
reference for Phase I were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
9.06      Phase II (two-and-a-half years, 1980-1982) would, through field
experiments and analyses, verify and improve the design methods developed in
Phase I in order to have, at the end of the study, a comprehensive and well
tested methodology for pavement evaluation and design under Brazilian condi-
tions. Auxiliary objectives to this end would include determination of:
(a) seasonal and long-term variations in resilient deflection;
(b) the effect of temperature on the measured resilient deflection;
(c) deflection reduction through overlays and other strengthening
measures; and
(d)  the use of various types of instruments for measuring resilient
deflection.
Under Phase II, experimental road sections 1/ would be observed in three
typical climatic regions of Brazil and would cover different surface and base
types, various traffic ranges, and different maintenance levels. The dependent
variables to be monitored include pavement damage (cracking, potholes, rutting),
road roughness, skid resistaLnce and deflection under load). The types of
periodic maintenance actions to be tested would range from slurry seals and
surface dressings to overlays and full rehabilitation.
9.07      As illustrated in Chart 9.1, the mobilization of personnel, acquisi-
tion of equipment and the setup of support services should be achieved during
Phase I. All experimental sections should be constructed by the end of 1980.
Initial testing of these sections should essentially be completed within the
same time period. Monitoring of test section performance and data analysis
would continue to the end of the program through 1982. The outline terms
of reference for Phase II were discussed and agreed during negotiations;
detailed terms of reference for Phase II, acceptable to the Bank, would be
developed at the end of Phase I.
C.   The GEIPOT/DNER Study
9.08      The GEIPOT/DNER Study started in September 1975 and employs a team
of about 150 persons, ten of whom are expatriates provided through Texas
Research and Development Foundation (USA).  It has a wide range of equipment,
facilities and workshops, mainly in Brasilia, and carries out: (a) test
1/   Some are already laid under the GEIPOT/DNER study, and others would be
laid along sections to be rehabilitated under the proposed project.



- 47 -
measurements of speed, fuel consumption, and speed/flow relationships;
(b) long-term survey of vehicle operating costs; (c) study of road deteriora-
tion; and (d) adaptation and testing of a management decision model. The
study is progressing well, but a one-year extension beyond the present closing
date of November 30, 1978 is required. Delays have been suffered in computer
analyses; also, certain facets of the Study have proved to be more complicated
than originally envisaged. The Study is producing data at a high rate and of
a very high quality, representing a major advancement, particularly in rational
evaluation of vehicle operating costs for different road characteristics and
conditions. The funds provided under the loan would be applied to finance
extension of existing contracts for advisory services.
9.09      Research into pavement evaluation and performance under the GEIPOT/
DNER Study has already been under way for two years. IPR's Study would gain
a considerable advantage by continuing the observations and data collection
on the road sections under investigation. The conclusion of the extended
GEIPOT/DNER Study should coincide with the start of Phase II of the IPR Study.
It is important, therefore, that the efforts are coordinated and that expertise
and equipment used for the former Study are passed on to the latter. This
would strengthen the IPR research effort and would provide an important
institution-building impact. During negotiations, the Government confirmed
that DNER would by April 30, 1980, after completion of Phase I and annually
thereafter during Phase II, consult with the Bank on the results of the
research and the incorporation of the recommendations into DNER's design
norms and manuals.

ANNEX I
BRAZIL
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Past and Ongoing Bank Assistance to the Highway Sector
A. Highway Projects Completed
1.        The First Highway Project (Loan 567-BR, US$26 million, October
1968) was instrumental in setting the framework for Bank involvement in the
Brazilian transport sector as a whole. Together with this loan, the Bank
reached agreement with the Government on a Plan of Action which included,
among other things, the reorganization of DNER, the revision of road user
charges, the reduction of railway deficits and the improvement of port admin-
istration. The project included detailed engineering, construction, paving,
and supervision of seven road sections totaling 429 km in four states. The
project was successfully completed in September 1972, about a year later than
expected. The delay was mainly due to design changes and problems with
earthworks. Despite cost overruns in some sections, the total project cost
was lower than expected. The audit rates of return for the roads were,
except for one road, equal to or higher than the appraisal estimates, and
ranged from 14 to 40% (PPA Report No. 1026 dated February 12, 1976).
2.        The Second Highway Project (Loan 676-BR, US$100 million, May 1970)
included construction and paving of 2,136 km of roads, detailed engineering
of 2,369 km, and feasibility studies of 3,256 km. The project also provided
technical assistance to strengthen the planning and supervisory capability
of DNER. Some problems were encountered during construction, and delays
occurred, mainly due to abnormally high rains, difficult terrain, and changes
in design because of deficiencies in detailed engineering and, in some in-
stances, due to recontracting following failure of the initial contractors.
As a result, the project was not completed until August 1976, two years behind
the original schedule.  The final cost of civil works was about 6% above the
appraisal estimates. Despite the cost overruns and delays, the project can be
considered a success. The quality of construction work was generally satis-
factory, and the audit rate of return was higher than the appraisal forecast
(36 as against 27%), mainly because of much higher than anticipated traffic
growth. This was the first major road project carried out entirely by
Brazilian firms under strict specifications and quality controls agreed with
the Bank. The benefits of the experience gained by the Brazilian construction
industry and DNER during the execution of the project were considerable, as
demonstrated in the performance of followup projects (PPA Report No. 1644,
dated June 21, 1977, based on the PCR dated October 27, 1976).

ANNEX 1
3.        Feasibility and engineering studies included under the Second
Highway Project formed the basis for the Third and Fourth Highway Projects
(Loans 813-BR, US$89 million, April 1972; and 854-BR, US$51 million, August
1972). The Third and Fourth Highway Projects included construction of 1,849
km, paving of 681 km of roads, and related supervision. Civil works in both
projects faced the same problems encountered during the Second Project.
Completion of both projects, initially scheduled for 1976, extended until the
end of 1977. Underestimation of physical quantities and acceleration of
inflation in 1973 and 1974 caused substantial cost overruns, 7% in the case of
the Third Project and 34% tnder the Fourth. The information on the rate of
return of the projects is still incomplete but suggests that returns are
considerably above appraisal estimates. The experience gained from these two
projects served to emphasiz;e further the importance of detailed engineering,
especially in-depth geotechnical studies in difficult terrain. A joint PCR
for the two projects is scheduled to be issued in June 1978.
B.   The Fifth Highway Project
4.        The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1075-BR, US$110 million, January 1975)
set the basis for Bank involvement in road maintenance, rehabilitation and
strengthening. The project includes:
(a)  construction and upgrading of 612 km of federal highways;
(b) highway maintenance programs in the States of Minas Gerais
and Rio Grande do Sul and technical assistance to DNER to
improve maintenance planning;
(c)  Phase I of the Wei.ghing Station Program on federal highways
(95 stations); and
(d) feasibility studies and detailed engineering for road
construction, upgrading and rehabilitation.
The project is proceeding well although, because of delays in starting the
maintenance program, completion will probably slip by about one year to the
end of 1980. Cost overruns for civil works and installation of weighing
stations have required reduction of the 40% disbursement rate to 20% and 30%
respectively.
(i) Road Construction
5.        The five roads included in the project are divided into 21 con-
struction contracts. By October 31, 1977, over 60% of the works had been
completed; the Corinto-Pirapora Highway (BR-496) was inaugurated in June 1977.
Bids higher than appraisal estimates and physical overruns, especially on
Bingen-Juiz de Fora Highway (BR-040) which passes through mountainous terrain,
have increased the estimated completion cost by about 35%. Progress is
generally on schedule, and all contracts should be completed by early 1980.

(ii) Maintenance Delegation Programs to Rio Grande do Sul and
Minas Gerais
6.        The Maintenance Delegation Program commenced in the states of
Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais in September 1976, about one year behind
schedule because of delays in contracting consultants. Three consulting
groups have been engaged for the program: INGEROUTE (France)/ENECON (Brazil)
in Rio Grande do Sul, INGEROUTE/ESPA (Brazil) in Minas Gerais and Roy Jorgensen
Associates, Inc. (USA), with two experts advising DNER's Maintenance Directorate.
The consultants to the states have commenced the reorganization in pilot
maintenance districts and are establishing and testing improved methods for
programming, execution and costing of routine and periodic maintenance.
Training programs are being initiated in both states. Two lots of equipment
have been procured for Minas Gerais; Rio Grande do Sul has recently acquired
equipment financed by an IDB loan and plans further acquisition under the Bank
project in 1978. Field offices for new districts and residences are being
built in both states.
7.        The delegation of maintenance of federal highways to the state DERs
has not proceeded according to schedule. The two main reasons for the slippage
are: (a) the DERs are not yet strengthened enough to take on maintenance of
more roads; this is particularly so in Rio Grande do Sul; and (b) many of the
roads still to be delegated, and some already delegated, require rehabilitation
before effective maintenance can be carried out. According to a condition
inventory carried out in late 1977, about 3,330 km (45% of paved network) in
Minas Gerais and 1,430 km (32% of paved network) in Rio Grande do Sul require
rehabilitation. DNER recognizes that progress of the delegation program
depends on stepped-up rehabilitation, but, in 1977, only 325 km in Minas Gerais
and 395 km in Rio Grande do Sul were under contract. Further rehabilitation
and strengthening are included in the proposed project: 800 km in Minas
Gerais and 200 km in Rio Grande do Sul. Revised schedules for delegation in
the two states, together with the accompanying rehabilitation program, includ-
ing funding requirements, were prepared by DNER and reviewed at negotiations.
Delegation of maintenance of all federal highways in the two states should be
completed in 1983 in Rio Grande do Sul and 1984 in Minas Gerais.
8.        The advisory group set up in DNER to coordinate the Maintenance
Delegation Program and to establish agreed procedures to define, measure and
cost maintenance activities is now functioning effectively. A pilot area
to test and demonstrate these procedures has been set up in the state of
Pernambuco, and results should be available by the end of 1978 (para 3.27).
(iii) Weighing Station Program (Phase 1)
9.        Originally 95 weighing stations with simple civil works and static
scales were considered sufficient to control vehicle loading adequately
over the federal highway network. DNER's Transit Directorate, assisted by
consultants PROTOS (Brazil), carried out an extensive study to determine
the type of weighing equipment most suitable for Brazilian conditions and
the location of stations to provide a basic coverage of the network. The



- 94 -
ANNEX 1
study revealed that 127 new stations would be required and that the most
efficient system would be installation of dynamic scales which weigh vehicles
in motion. The expanded Weighing Station Program was reviewed and accepted by
the Bank (Chapter VIII). The estimated cost of installing the first 95 weighing
stations, which would make up Phase I of the Program, has increased consider-
ably, mainly because of more extensive civil works required for separate ramps
and unloading areas for overloaded vehicles. DNER has called for bids for
construction and installation of the first 73 stations in the south and
southeastern regions. Installation of all the 95 stations is expected to be
completed by the end of 1979. Phase II of the Weighing Station Program would
be included under the proposed project.
C.   The UNDP-GEIPOT/DNER Highway Design and Maintenance Study
10.       The recognition of the importance of sound engineering and mainte-
nance, for both paved and unpaved roads, and the rudimentary nature of current
knowledge concerning the interrelationship between maintenance activities,
surface condition, geometry and vehicle operating costs, led the Government
and the Bank to launch a comprehensive research program similar to a smaller
scale program undertaken in Kenya 1/. This Research on the Interrelationship
between Costs of Highway Construction, Maintenance and Utilization with a total
cost of more than US$8 million, is being financed by UNDP 2/ (US$2.4 million)
with the Bank as Executing Agency, and by the Government. Local funding and
Government coordination is provided through the Secretaria de Planejamento
(SEPLAN). The Government Executing Agency is GEIPOT, with personnel support
from DNER and the DERs of Minas Gerais, Goias and the Federal District. The
Texas Research and Developiment Foundation (USA) provides technical assistance
and logistic support for specialized equipment. The 40-month research program
started in September 1975 and is now progressing well. A one-year extension
would be included in the proposed project (Chapter IX).
11.       The long-range olbjective of the study is to assist the Government in
minimizing the total cost of highway transportation. The immediate objective
is to develop the interrelationships between the three components affecting
road transport costs, namely construction, maintenance and road user costs.
The results of the study are expected to be most useful to highway planners and
designers, both in Brazil and in the world at large, and, through the further
development of computer models incorporating the appropriate relationships>
would provide an effective tool for the evaluation of highway design and
maintenance policies.

D.   The Secondary and Feeder Road Project
12.       The Secondary and Feeder Road Project (Loan 1207-BR, US$55 million,
March 1976) represents an innovative approach to the problem of channeling
Bank support toward improvement of secondary and rural roads, which, in Brazil,
are the responsibility of states and municipalities. The project is, in fact,
a line of credit extended to Brazil's National Development Bank, BNDE, to
finance part of subloans extended by BNDE to DER's or to ad hoc municipal
consortia to finance secondary, feeder and penetration roads in support of
agricultural production. The beneficiaries provide 40.1% of the project
cost; DNER, which participates in the technical review and administration
of the program, contributes 13.5% on a grant basis; and BNDE and the Bank
finance 23.2% each. The subprojects are prepared and evaluated in accordance
with agreed and well publicized criteria embodied in a manual. The project
has been slow to start. Beneficiaries took time to familiarize themselves
with the procedures and to establish their working relationships with BNDE/DNER.
Three subprojects have been approved covering a total of about 1,700 km for a
total cost of about US$55 million (Bank participation about US$12.5 million).
A number of other subprojects are under preparation. The loan would require
extension for at least two years beyond the anticipated closing date of the
end of 1981.
E.   Road Components of Agricultural Projects
13.       The Bank's growing portfolio of agricultural settlement and rural
development projects includes two projects with a road component. The Alto
Turi Land Settlement Project (Loan 853-BR, US$12.6 million, July 1972, of
which US$3.6 million for road component) provides for construction of 386 km
of penetration roads, 70% of which are now completed. The Ceara Rural
Development Project (Loan 1488-BR, November 1977, US$17 million, of which
US$1.9 million for roads) includes the betterments of about 37 km of tertiary
and rural roads.  The Paraiba Rural Development Project (Loan          -BR, March
1978, US$24 million, of which about US$5 million for roads) includes improve-
ment of some 322 km of municipal and state roads. Two other similar projects
with substantial rural road components are under preparation.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Highway Rehabilitation Program
Description of Highways for Rehabilitation
A.   BR-101/RN:  Parnamirim-Border RN/PB (Lot 40 - 72.8 km)
1.        The road passes mainly through undulating terrain where the
principal activity is cane sugar growing. Most of the traffic is long
distance, originating or ending at Natal (12 km north of Parnamirim), the
capital of Rio Grande do Norte. The road was paved in 1965 with a double
treated surface and has since received only light resealings. The works
chiefly include strengthening the existing 7.2 m wide pavement with 5 cm of
asphalt concrete overlay, sealing the 2.4 m wide shoulders, building several
short stretches of climbing lanes (totaling about 5,000 m) for the 1,800 vpd 1/
traffic, which is made up of about 40% trucks, and providing guardrails in
accident-prone stretches.
B.   BR-101/PB:  Border RN/P?B-Junction BR-230, near Joao Pessoa
(Lot 41 - 80.8 km)
2.        This road is the southern extension of Lot 40 and passes through
flat to undulating coastal terrain supporting a predominance of sugar cane
growing. Joao Possoa, the capital of Paraiba, is situated about 20 km along
BR 230 to the east of the BR-101/BR-230 junction. The road was paved in 1965
with a 7.0 m wide double surface treatment and 2.2 m wide unpaved shoulders.
A light resealing was applied in 1972. Two valleys intersect the road align-
ment where gradients reach 6-7%. About 7,000 m of climbing lanes are required
for the 2,000 vpd traffic, of which about 40% are trucks.  Also, alignment
improvements would be made in two high-accident stretches and four low-cost
at-grade intersections built. The works include pavement strengthening with
mainly 5 cm of asphalt concrete overlay, sealing of shoulders and provision
of guard rails where needed.
C.   BR-267/MT:  Border SP/MT-Km 209.8 (Lots 43.1 - 104.5 km; 43.2 - 106.0 km)
3.        This road is the principal connection between Campo Grande (the
future capital of the proposed new state of Mato Grosso do Sul) and Sao
Paulo. The alignment is generally flat to slightly rolling and passes
through lightly vegetated terrain. The road was paved in 1967 with 7.2 m
wide asphalt concrete surface and 2.5 m wide shoulders. No reseals have

ANNEX 2
been applied, but the traffic lane in the direction of Sao Paulo, which bears
the heavy loads, is reaching failure. The works are predominantly pavement
strengthening with 5 cm of asphalt concrete and shoulder sealing to support
the 2,800 vpd, of which about 56% are trucks.
D.   BR-153/GO:  Anapolis-Ceres (Lot 47.1 - 52.0 km)
4.        This road is situated in Goias on the Brasilia-Belem highway and
passes through the grazing lands of the central plateau, consisting of
rolling and hilly terrain. The road was paved in 1975 with a 7.0 m wide
double surface treatment and a maximum of 2.5 m wide unpaved shoulders.
Several short stretches have received asphalt concrete strengthening. The
long distance traffic carries diverse cargo, and local traffic is pre-
dominantly related to the livestock farming of the area. The works
principally include pavement strengthening topped by a 3.5 cm asphalt
concrete wearing course and sealing of the shoulders. About 8,000 m of
climbing lanes are required for the 2,600 vpd traffic, of which about
43% are trucks.
E.   BR-153/GO:  Goiania-Border MG/GO (Lots 48.1 - 52.5 km; 48.2 - 39.7 km)
5.        This road is situated in the southern part of Goias on the trunk
highway linking the north and south of Brazil. The road starts 69 km south
of Goiania and passes through the undulating and hilly grazing lands of the
central plateau which separates the Amazon and Plate river basins. The
road was paved in 1958 with a 7.0 m wide double surface treatment and
generally 2.0 m wide unpaved shoulders. The pavement has received intensive
patching and, in places, has been overlaid with asphalt concrete. Consider-
able pavement strengthening and drainage improvements are required as well
as about 9,000 m of climbing lanes for the 2,900 vpd traffic, of which about
46% are trucks. A new 55 m bridge over the Ribeirao Formiga river would be
built. The goods transported along the road are of similar nature to those
along Lot 47.1.
F.   BR-040/MG:  Sete Lagoas-Belo Horizonte (Lots 49.1 - 25.5 km;
49.2 - 34.5 km)
6.        This road runs north from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas
Gerais, through rolling and mountainous terrain. The area traversed has
high industrial activity, being important in cement and lime production.
The road was asphalt concrete paved to 7.0 m width in 1970 (the first 8 km
is four-lane highway) and carries about 6,200 vpd (about 12,000 on the
four lane section), of which 45% are trucks. The pavement is in poor
condition, notwithstanding the concentrated maintenance activities, and
requires complete rehabilitation and strengthening with an average of
22 cm of asphalt base and 4 cm of asphalt concrete surfacing. The
2.5 m wide shoulders would be surface dressed. About 23,800 meters of
climbing lanes would be built and seven at-grade intersections improved.

ANNEX 2
G.   BR-040/MG:  Border GO/MG-Rio Taquara Bridge (Lots 50.1 - 81.8 km;
50.2 - 94.6 km)
7.        This road constitutes part of the Belo Horizonte-Brasilia road.
Double surface treatment paving (7.0 m wide) was completed in 1959. Since
then, the road has been resealed and part has been overlaid with asphalt
concrete. The road passes through rolling to hilly terrain of the central
plateau, which is used predominantly for livestock farming. The works include
pavement rehabilitation or substantial strengthening over nearly all the road
length and the building of 28,800 meters of climbing lanes for the 1,650 vpd
(about 40% trucks) traffic. Eighteen simple atgrade intersections would also
be improved and the 2.5 m wide shoulders surface dressed.
H.   BR-050/MG:  Km 464-Km 488 between Uberlandia and Uberaba (Lot 51 - 24.0 km)
8.        This road passes through flat to undulating terrain and is part of
the main trunk highway north from Sao Paulo to Brasilia. The road carries
almost 3,000 vpd, of which 50% are trucks transporting mainly long-distance
commercial and industrial products and livestock and rice from the surrounding
localities. The road was paved with 7.0 m wide asphalt concrete in 1962;
about 50% needs considerable strengthening with an asphalt base; a 4-cm asphalt
concrete surfacing would be applied over its entire length. The 2.5 m wide
shoulders would be surface dressed.
I.   BR-135/MG:  Sete Lagoas--Corinto (Lots 52.1 - 56.5 km; 52.5 - 41.1 km;
52.3 - 3 bridges
9.        This road passes through flat and undulating terrain traversing
an area having a predominance! of livestock farming. The road was paved in
1959 with 7.0 m wide double surface treatment, but shoulders are often narrow.
The greater part of the road has been resealed. The pavement would be
strengthened by construction of a new base and surfaced with 3 cm of asphalt
concrete to support the 1,700 vpd, of which about 50% are trucks; 11,400 m
of climbing lanes would be provided, as well as improvements of seven
at-grade intersections. The shoulders would be widened where necessary
and surface treated.
J.   BR-262/MG:  Betim-Junction BR-354 (Lots 53.1 - 34.1 km; 53.2 - 56.3 km;
53.3 - 62.9 km; 53.4 - 66.7 km)
10.       This road commences at the industrial district of Betim (20 km
west of Belo Horizonte) and passes through undulating and mountainous terrain
which supports a predominance of livestock and grain crop farming. The road
was paved in 1957 with 7.0 m wide double surface treatment and, since then,
has received only little periodic maintenance. The pavement would be
strengthened by construction of a new asphalt base overlaid by 5 cm of
asphalt concrete to support the 2,800 vpd, of which about 42% are trucks;



- 99 -
ANNEX 2
39,000 meters of climbing lanes would also be required as well as improve-
ments of ten at-grade intersections. The 2.5 m wide shoulders would be
surface dressed.
K.   BR-262/MG: Junction BR 354-Uberaba (Lots 54.1 - 75.4 km; 54.2 - 71.0 km;
54.3 - 73.7 km
11.       This road is a continuation of the above and passes through
undulating to flat terrain of the phosphate rich Mineral Triangle area
(fertilizer production). The road was paved in 1969 with 7.2 m wide
double surface treatment and has since received a thin overlay. The
pavement would be strengthened by constructing an asphalt base overlaid
with 4 cm of asphalt concrete to support the 1,300 vpd (40% trucks) traffic.
The 2.5 m wide shoulders would be surface treated.
L.   BR-116/RS: Sao Marcos-Vacaria (Lots 56.1 - 31.4 km; 56.2 - 46.0 km)
12.       This road crosses two regions at about 800 m above sea level, one
rolling-to-hilly and the other mountainous (Serra das Antas). The region
is sub-tropical and generally forested, with intensive agriculture on plateau
areas. The road was paved in 1962 with 7.0 m wide asphalt concrete and
variable shoulders up to 2.5 m wide. The road crosses Rio das Antas; the
approaches have grades up to 6% and are devoid of shoulders. The road is
the main link between Rio Grande do Sul and the rest of the country, carry-
ing important commercial and industrial traffic. The pavement would be
strengthened by providing an asphalt base course overlaid by 5 cm of asphait
concrete to support the 2,200 vpd, of which 50% are trucks. The shoulders
would be widened where practical and surface treated.
M.   BR-290/RS:  Junction BR-116 to Junction BR-153 (Lots 57.1 - 38.3 km;
57.2 - 42.5 kmn; 57.3 - 42.2 kmn)
13.       This road is the main link from Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio
Grande do Sul, to Uruguay and Argentina, passing through predominantly
rolling terrain. The region's resources are varied: agricultural activities
cover mainly rice, soya and wheat growing and livestock farming; and indus-
trial activities range from timber and limestone extraction to leather
works. To support the 4,150 vpd (nearly 50% trucks) traffic, the pavement
would be strengthened by constructing either an asphaltic or waterbound
base course overlaid by 4 cm of asphalt concrete. The 2.5 m wide shoulders
would be surface dressed. Eight at-grade intersections would be improved
and one bridge reconstructed.
