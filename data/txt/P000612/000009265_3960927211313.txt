MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI
FOR A
GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Djibouti for SDR 7.1 million (US$9.2
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA t?rms with 40 years maturity and help support the
development of geothermal resources in Djibouti. The project would be
cofinanced by an Italian grant of US$ 22.0 million equivalent, and by a
joint grant from OPEC/UNDP of US$1.4 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Djibouti's energy sector is marked by its
overwhelming dependence on imported fuel oils (87 percent) to meet the
national energy balance. In the absence of hydropower, the Government is
pursuing a policy of research for alternative energy (solar and wind energy
in addition to geothermal sources) and actively promotes energy
conservation methods. Geothermal and solar energy are Djibouti's only
significant energy resources. So far, they remain largely untapped. A
national energy plan was completed in late 1987.
3.       The main sector institutions are public.  ISERST carries out
research on energy issues with foreign technical assistance and EdD (the
power utility) generates electricity using diesel thermal plants fueled
with imported oil. Current power tariffs, which were last adjusted when
oil prices were relatively high, reflect production costs except for modest
subsidies in remote areas. Because of their link to oil prices, power
tariffs are high. This has been one of the factors discouraging industries
from coming to Djibouti in spite of the country's strategic location,
transport and banking facilities, and freely convertible currency.
4.       IDA's involvement in Djibouti's energy sector started in 1984.
The Geothermal Exploration Project, co-financed with other donors, led to
the discovery of one of Africa's most powerful geothermal sources in the
Assal region. The findings under the project (which closed on June 30,
1988) have confirmed that the proven steam sources are sufficient to
generate electrical power on an initially modest but economical basis.
This least cost solution of the power plant requires, however, that the
steam resources be developed as soon as possible and in any case before the
economic life of the traditional diesel generators comes to an end.
5.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  IDA's country strategy aims at
improving the exploitation of Djibouti's main assets and at helping the
Government identify a viable long-term development strategy, within which
IDA and other donors can provide assistance to help diversify the economy.
Geothf-mal energy, one of the country's few natural resources, is therefore
a su- able sector in which to pursue such a strategy. IDA's involvement is
justified for three main reasons: (i) the experience gained under the
exploration project would help assure satisfactory project implementation;



(ii) IDA financing of upstream activities (drilling and steam production)
is necessary to develop the downstream activities (power gene:ation bad
distribution) eligible for the Italian grant financing; and (iii) IDA
involvement would contribute to improve management of electricity demand
and to introduce an adequate tariff structure, reflecting the lower cost of
electricity generation.
6.       Project  Objectives.  The main objective is to help reduce
Djibouti's dependence on imported fuel oils through the further development
of its geothermal resources, in line with the least cost power development
plan. Other objectives are to assure an appropriate tariff structure in
view of the expected decreases of the production price of electricity, and
to strengthen the operating division of EdD responsible for geothermal
production, especially through staff training.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project would include the
following components:
(i) completion of development of the first section of the Assal Geothermal
Steam Field. This includes drilling of four development wells in addition
to the two existing ones to provide for additional steam yield to drive two
5MW and one 1 MW well-head generating units;
(ii) construction of the required steam gathering system. Both of these
components would be implemented between 1990 and 1991. These components
will also rrovide support for management and supervision as well as
technical assistance for geological surveys and studies, including (a) a
'scaling" study to insure that the generating equipment is designed in a
way which takes full account of the specific nature of the corrosion
effects 1/ linked to the salinity of the brine; and (b) a study to spell
out issues which might arise from the potential settlement of nomads around
the drilling site;
(iii) installation of two 5 MW back-pressure well-head generators
(including all related equipment and controls) and a 1 MW well-head unit
for the desalination plant, training, camp and demonstration purposes.
Geothermal electricity would supply approximately 35 percent of the
country's base load. Construction would begin in mid-1990 so as to
commission the 5 MW units in 1991, when current diesel generating units
will have to be replaced. The 1 MW unit would also be installed in 1990;
(iv) construction of a single circuit 132 kV transmission line of 100 km
from the well-field substation to the main power station in the capital, to
be implemented in 1990/91; and
(v) provision of technical assistance for institution-building, mainly
financing the foreign expenditures component of EdD's training program.
1/ To take corrosion effects into account, the project's economic and
financial evaluation includes the most conservative assumptions for
determining the cost of generating the steam based energy.
