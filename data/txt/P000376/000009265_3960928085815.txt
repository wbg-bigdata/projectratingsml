MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND TRAINING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cameroon for US$21.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years
maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable
interest rate, and would help finance a national agricultural extension and
training project. The project would be cofinanced by bilateral donors
still to be determined.
2.        Backaround.  Agricultural potential in Cameroon is central to
the renewal of economic growth. In recent years the economy has suffered a
decline in world market prices of its principal commodities. The relative
contribution of agriculture, including livestock and forestry, to
Cameroon's GDP decreased from 40t in the 1960s to about 20? in 1984/85 with
the development of oil production. Nonetheless, agriculture provides
employment to 752 of the population, generates 25? of export receipts, and
contributes about 152 to 202 of state revenues. With the recent slump in
world oil prices and depletion of domestic oil reserves anticipated in the
19909, agriculture will again be propelled to the forefront of the economy.
The rich ecological diversity of Cameroon provides an important potential
for increasing both food and export crop production. Production increases
are the key to renewed agricultural growth.  The Government's Structural
Adjustment Program is addressing a number of issues which have heretofore
constrained agricultural growth, emphasizing both price and non-price
incentives.
3.        Agricultural extension programs have been ongoing in Cameroon
since the 1960., financed by numerous donors, many as components of rural
and/or area development projects. Problems and shortcomings in
agricultural extension and training were recognized by the Government in
the 19709 in a diagnosis carried out as a preparatory exercise for the
Fifth Agriculture Development Plan (1981-1986). The problems include the
high aggregate cost of the different extension systems, leading to
fragmentation of services which results in duplication of extension efforts
and confusion to farmers, lack of consistent training and supervision, and
technological messages transferred to farmers which are often irrelevant or
inappropriate. Recommendations for corrective actions included in this
Plan were not implemented because of insufficient preparation and
difficulty in translating intentions into actions. Consequently, the
concept of a national agricultural extension and training strategy was
introduced. At Government request, USAID and the Bank jointly sponsored an
FAO/CP mission for a National Agricultural Extension and Training Project
for which an Interim Report was issued on August 7, 1987. The Bank was
requested by the Government to prepare a national agricultural extension
project based on the findings of the FAOICP report. However, due to the
lack of extension policy and the uncertainties surrounding the
institutional features of extension, the Ministry of Agriculture proposed



.2 -
that pilot scheme test some of the recomendations of the PAO/CP
Identification Report prior to launching a national project.
4.        The pilot phase* which introduced the Training and Visit (T&V)
system of extension, has been under implementation in four ecologically
distinct areas of the country since 1988. In addition, existing extension
services in Cameroon have been revIewed to determine their relevance to a
national program. Since 1982, the Northwest MIDENO rural development
agency financed by IFAD, the federal Republic of Germany and the EEC has
operated a successful extension service following a modified T&V system as
a component of its area development project. Under MIDENO, one authority
coordinates all extension In the Province, virtually eliminating
duplication of effort. However, the absence of a systematic national
coordination program explains the lack Qf adoption of the MIDENO extension
model elsewhere In the country. Under the pilot program, MIDENO's
experience has begun to spread through the extensive field extension
training provided in the Northwest for extension staff from other areas of
the country. The pilot phase succeeded in testing a number of new
initiatives and resolving implementation issuess (a) creating action-
oriented provincial and technical committees to coordinate extension with
other development activitiess (b) organizing provincial orientation and
training seminars for extension staff and their supervisors; (c) training
extension staff fortnightlys (d) deploying staff effectively; (e)
establishing field adoption plotst and (f) creating a mechanism for flow of
funds to the Provinces.
S.        Proie_t Obiective.  The project would aim to assist the
Government in implementing a national agricultural extension strategy. The
short to medium-term objective would be the introduction of a unified
extension system in certain areas of the country, which would include the
rationalization of existing overlapping provincial extension services and
the establishment of a national T&V system. The priority objective is to
increase farmer productivlty by establishing operational systems for
managing the extension services and by providing training tc facilitate
improved delivery of the services. Special attention would be given to
meeting the needs of women farmers under the project. By integrating
extension services to Incorporate food crops as well as cash crops, women
farmers would be more likely to receive extension advice. The project's
aims would be achieved through* (a) enhancing the Implementing agencies'
capacity to plan, manage, monitor and evaluate a national agricultural
extension and training programs (b) ensuring adequate transfer and
diffusion of production techniques through the expansion of a time-bound
management and training system for front-line extension agents; (c)
supporting the above actions through a major training program to develop
local capacity for designing, managing and implementing extension
operations; (d) improving the relevance of production techniques through
Increased verification trials and improved research-extension linkagest and
te) increasing the availability of Improved seed.
6.        Proiect Description.  An institutional management support
program at the natlonal and provincial levels would strengthen the capacity
to plan, manage, monitor and evaluate a national agricultural extension and
training program. A central mechanism would be established to standardize
the T&v extension methodology and training provided to all extension



-3
services staff to ensure the transfer and diffusion of production
techniques. An improved adaptive on-farm research network, complementing
the ongoing National Agricultural Research Project (Ln. 2766 CM), would be
carried out by Testing and Liaison Units which, working closely with the
extension service, would field test the adaptability and acceptability of
varieties and technologies to provide more realistic recommendations to
farmers, thus establishing permanent links between research and extension.
The successful introduction of certain crops (e.g., new export crops,
fruits and vegetables) and other new technologies will demand more
*        sophisticated extension messages and a knowledge of market availability,
which will be addressed by the research establishment. The extension
program would address: (a) smallholders who represent 902 of all farmers,
*        and within the smallholder group the special needs of women farmers, by
selecting women and women's groups as contact farmers (about 302 of contact
farmers will be women); and (b) larger farmers, the traditional recipients
of extension advice, who produce export crops. Seed multiplication
activities would be supported and a publications program would assist in
disseminating extension advice. The proposed project would finance civil
works, transport, equipment, technical assistance, incremental staff and
incremental operating costs.
7.        Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  Cameroon's economic growth will
continue to depend heavily on agriculture. The proposed project is central
to the Bank's sector strategy and is one cornerstone of the agriculture
component of Cameroon's Structural Adjustment Program, supported by a Bank
loan (Ln.3089-CH.) approved by the Board in june 1989. Investment in a
reorganized, streamlined extension service is essential to long-term
agricultural and economic growth, since it will be the major vehicle for
transmitting improved agricultural knowledge to farmers. The project is
integral to the Government's strategy of food security, enhanced export
earnings, and employment generation. A number of donors continue to follow
a crop, or area development approach. The Bank would play a catalytic role
in transforming progressively the existing system into a streamlined,
minimum cost approach. The project would complement the National
Agricultural Research Project (Ln.2567-GM) by strengthening
researchlextension linkages. It would also complement the recently
approved Livestock Sector Development Project (Ln.3110-CM) through
integration of livestock and crop extension in areas of the country where
dual farming systems exist.
8.        Actions Agreed.  Agreement has been reached with the Government
as follows: (a) maintenance of a National Coordinator within the Extension
Service, and maintenance of support staff to coordinate national extension
activities; (b) agreement between MINAGRI and MINEPIA on a program for
training extension staff to provide advice on both crop and livestock
production; Ic) agreement between MINAGRI and IRA on annual work plans for
research, seed production and seed certification activities; td) agreements
between MINAGRI and cooperating parastatals on agricultural extension and
training; Ce) preparation of agreed annual work plans and budgets; and (f)
establishment of, and operating procedures for special accounts.
9.        Benefits and Risks.  The project would help increase
agricultural productivity, thereby contributing to food security and
increased exports. In the near term, improved cultivation techniques would



result in increased yields. Smallholders and women represent about 90t of
farmers in Cameroon. Women are the chief producers of food crops for home
consumption and the market. The project would improve women's access to
extension services and raise their agricultural productivity. The
principal project beneficiaries would be about 700,000 (602) of small farm
households. Benefits accruing to families would vary depending on the crop
and region of the country, but results of the pilot project indicato that
farmers frequently obtain yield increases in excess of 50*, not only in
well developed farming areas, but also in areas characterized by low level,
yields and basic farming knowledge. The use of small adoption plots by
farmers minimises the financial risk at the farm level. Public
expenditures for agricultural services would be reduced as duplication
would be eliminated. In the medium-term, savings are estimated to be about
US$5.5 million annually, well in excess of the proposed project recurrent
cost estimate of US$3.3 million per annum. The project is consistent with
the parastatal reform program being implemented under the Structural
Adjustment Program. The main risk foreseen is the possibility of farmers'
low adoption rate of extension advice, due to lack of timely availability
of inputs, credit or adequate marketing channels. With USAID assistance,
in 1987, the Government introduced privatization of fertilizer distribution
as a first step to alleviating input constraints. The Government is
proposing to establish a new agricultural credit institution with
assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany. A proposed rural
cooperative credit program is included in the Bank's development strategy,
aimed at sobilizing rurai savings as a source of credit for. smallholders.
Under the Structural Adjustment Project, a rational pricing policy is being
introduced. A Food Security Program (FY91) is also proposed in the Bank's
lending program for Cameroon which will address marketing issues.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
