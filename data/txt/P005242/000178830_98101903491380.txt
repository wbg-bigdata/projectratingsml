SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT RiOJECT
S U 14 M A R Y
The Government of Jordan has requested an IDA credit to enable
the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) to finance part of the second
stage of its 'Lending program. The proposed credit of US$3 million would
supplement ACC's own resources to permit lending for the Project of US$5
million over a four-year period. The program is within the framewJork of
the Seven-Year Development Plan 1964-1970, and aims at the improvement of
Jordan's limited land and water resources and their development for fruit
and vegetable production.
ii.       In December 1963, IDA extended a first Credit of US$3 million
([DA Credit 44-JO) to the Government of Jordan to support the first stage
of the lending program. Progress of the Project was satisfactory and
there was a ready response frcm farmers to the opportunities afforded in
the four main areas of lending, i.e. farm water supply, livestock develop-
ment, farm mechanization, and land reclamation. The Credit was fully
disbursed by April 1966, and since then ACC has continued the program
initiated under the IDA Credit, at a reduced level with a short-term
advance from U.S.AID and its own resources, which are inadequate for
meeting the demand for credit.
iii.      As with the first Credit, the Project would include land recla-
mation and improvement, farm water supply development, and farm mechani-
zation, but there would be greater concentration on tree crop and vineyard
establishment and on-farm development within Government irrigation schemes.
iv.       The total Project cost would be US$6 million.  In addition to
the IDA Credit of US$3 million, ACC would provide US$2 million and the
farmers themselves the remaining US$1 million. The Project is techni-
cally sound and economicaIly justified. Estimated benefits both to farmers
and the national economy are substantial. The Project is suitable for
an IDA credit of US$3 million.

SECCbID AGRICUITUIiL CIMEDIT PROJECT
1 .  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Jordan has applied for a second IDA credit
to enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) to continue its lend-
ing program within the framework of its Seven-Year Development Plan 1964-
1970. The Government's request for a credit of US$5.8 million to help
finance ACC lending program over a four-year period was scaled donvn to
US$3 million.  The credit of US$3 million would supplement ACCts resources
to permit a lending program of US$5 million over a four-year period.
1.02      In December 1963, IDA extended a first Credit of US$3 million
(IDA Credit 44-JO) to the Government of Jordan to support the first phase
of its lending program. The progress of the Project was satisfactory; the
Credit was fully disbursed in April 1966, slightly before the closing date
of June 30, 1966. Since then, ACC has been able to continue the lending
operations initiated under the IDA Credit, from its own resources and with
a short-term advance from U.S.AID; but its resources, which are now
restricted to collections, are inadequate for meeting the demand for
credit.
1 03      This report is based on information prepared by the Government
of Jordan and on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Jordan
in September-October 1966, composed of Ilessrs. P.A. Courbois and H. von
Oppenfeld.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Jordan has recently revised its Seven-Year Development Plan 1964-
1970. The Government's major goal is to reduce the deficit in the external
balance of trade and the dependence upon external budget support. The
agricultural sector is expected to contribute significantly to the attain-
ment of this goal, and substantial investments are planned to increase the
agricultural output.
2,02      Jordants GDP expanded rapidly by 10 per cent per annum from 1959
to 1964. Aided by two good harvests during this period, the growth rate
in agriculture (17 per cent per annum) was even higher.  Exports of agri-
cultural products also increased by about 17 per cent per annum on the
average. They constitute 55 per cent of total exports. In 1964, agricul-
ture represented 25 per cent of GDP and accounted for 35 per cent of the
0.5 million labor force. Wages of unskilled laborers have risen in the
last few years to a level ranging from JD 0.4 to 0.7 per day (US$1 .15 to



US$2.00). Although Jordan has little registered unemployment, there is
scope for additional employent of family labor and of -the predominantly
rural refugee population through the agricultural development which would
be generated by the proposed Project.
B. Land and Water Resource Development
2.03      Jordan has a land area of 9.7 million ha and supports a popula-
tion of about two million. Eighty-seven per cent of the land area receives
less than 200 mm annual rainfall and is unsuitable for cultivation except
in small areas where irrigation is feasible, Although not more than
60,000 ha, or less than one per cent, was irrigated in 1963, this area
accounted for about 30 per cent of agricultural production.
2.04      Surveys of water resources indicate that an additional area of
about 160,000 ha can be irrigated. Uater development is being planned
and supervised by the 1iatural Resources Authority (formerly the Central
1Jater Authority), with the assistance of internationally recognized con-
sultant firrns 17
2.05      New farm units of not less than 30 dunums (three hectares) have
been established in large government irrigation schermes from newly reclaimed
lands and from larger farms divided under a land reform program. With
intensive fruit and vegetable production these farm units are viable.
Formier oimers of larger farms subject to the land reform program have been
permitted to retain units up to 200 dunums (20 ha) of irrigated land.
2.06      ilinor irrigation works, involving mainly groundwater development
and well construction, have been carried out by progressive farmers vino
frequently sell surplus mater to other farmers. Well construction is sub-
ject to licensing and supervision by the Hatural Resources Authority.  This
development has been encouraged by loans under the first IDA Credit.
C.  Agricultural Services
2.07      The Iinistry of Agriculture has been weak and provided little
assistance to farmers borrowing under the first IDA Credit. ACC itself
filled the gap, however, by improving and expanding technical services to
its borrowers. In recent years the Government of Jordan has significantly
improved agricultural research and education, and steps have now been
taken to strengthen the agricultural extensiorn services. These measures,
allied to the continued provision of technical services by ACC and the
industry and skill of commercial farmers, will be adequate for the success-
ful operation of the proposed Project,

- 3 -
2,08      Considerable progress has been made in tackling the problems of
marketing of agricultural produce. A marketing bureau has been set up to
carry out research on markets and related problems of processing, storage
and transportation and to promote the development of marketing facilities.
In line wiith recommendations of a Government/UNDP market research team,
the Government has established two farm marketing centers, with facilities
for produce weighing, grading and shipping. The city market of Arman has
been relocated and reorganized to improve the efficiency of wholesale
distribution, Steps have also been taken to improve packaging, tr&nsport
and quality control in order to increase exports of fresh fruit and vege-
tables to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
2.09      Prospects for growth of internal demand are good, and exports
of fruit and vegetables have grown at an annual rate of 16 per cent over
the past five years. Tomatoes, melons and citrus are the chief export
conmodities.
D. ACC_s Progress and Experience Under First IDA Credit
2.10      The first IDA Credit became effective in April 1964 and wias
disbursed by April 1966 (ACC vas the executing agency).  The US$3 million
Credit assisted ACC in making development loans to farmers under a USU4.5
million loan program. These development loans have enabled farmers to
reclaim land not previously cultivated and to intensify production through
water supply development and mechanization.  Investment wJas concentrated
on four purposes Which accounted for 82 per cent of the lending program:
(i) farm vater supply, (ii) livestock development, (iii} farm mechaniza-
tion, and (iv) land reclamation. Farmers' response to the program reflects
entrepreneurship and wrillingness to modernize their operations, particularly
in producing quality fruit and vegetables.
2.11      Signif'icant improvements have been achieved in ACC's technical
competence and administrative organization. The technical staff has
benefitted from overseas training and from U,S,AID technical assistance.
Loan approval, up to s-pecified limits, has been delegated to branch
offices. Accounting and statistics have been greatly strengthened. IIech-
anization of the accounting system is being undertaken and should further
improve the efficiency of loan administration. A substantial recent
increase in salary levels is expected to help ACC recruit and retain
qualified technicians. However, in-service training is still inadequate,
particularly in the techniques of assisting borrowers in the preparation
of farm plans and in methods of loan appraisal (para 4.02).
2.12      ACC took important steps to improve its financial position.  In
1963, it discontinued its short-term credit operations, leaving this
function to the Central Cooperative Union (CCU) and to the cooperatives.
In 1964 the rate of interest on medium- and long-term loans to farmers
was raised on IDA's request from four to five and a fourth per cent. This
rate would be raised to six per cent; it would still be below those of
commercial banks which range from seven and a half to nine per cent per



- 4 -
annum for short-term operations /para 3.08(i)70 Ileasures have been taken
to improve loan collections, but the Corporation has not yet applied penalty
charges for loans in arrears. The Government refrained from granting
moratoria affecting repayment of ACCts loans. As a result of these measures
and of government support, ACC's lending operations have been profitable.
A net increase of JD 1.3 million has been realized in the loan portfolio
from 1963 to 1966.
2.13      ACC's use of funds has not been fully satisfactory in the past.
Large cash balances have been deposited in commercial banks where high
returns could be obtained, instead of being lent to farmers. These bal-
ances have now been drawn down and assurances by ACC were obtained during
negotiations that this situation would not recur (para 3,13).
2,14      The CCU provides short-term  credit to farmers through coopera-
tives from its own resources and ACCG's advances, During 1965 and the first
half of 1966, CCU had to reduce its lendings pending reorganization and
collection of arrears.
E. ACC's Overall Credit Program
2.15      The Corporation's total lending program at the time of appraisal
was JD 8 million for the 1967-1970 period. This was considered too ambi-
tious by IDA on the grounds of ACCts inadequate staffing for loan appraisal
and the danger of excessive farmer indebtedness. During appraisal ACC
agreed to reduce this lending program to JD 5.4 million (US$15 million)
over the four-year period. The proposed IDA financed Project
would be a part of this four-year program as show-n below.

2.16      From the total program IDA has selected for the proposed Project
those subprojects which have the highest priority and require fairly large
amounts (para 3Q02). The rather longer average terms of investment involved
for these subprojects would probably have led to some reluctance on ACC's
part to give these investments first call on its resources. Other subprojeots,



- 5 -
while forming a legitimate part of ACC's portfolio, wJere not felt by IDA
to have the same priority., or were subject to special factors. Examples
of these are: the financing of draft animals, local cattle and sheep;
storage and processing facilities which had not reached a stage of prep-
aration required for appraisal by the mission; and poultry, where demand
is difficult to predict and any lending program would require constant
reassessment, and where amounts are likely to be small. ACC will go ahead
with the financing of these items from its own resources, but they will
remain outside the scope of the Project with the possible exception of
storage and processing facilities if adequate justifications for their
inclusion are eventually submitted to IDA. The total investment over a
four-year period for subprojects outside of the proposed Project wiould
aggregate to JD 3 million (US$8.4 million).
2.17      The balance of ACC's lending program outside the Project wOuld
take the form of a contribution during the four-year period of about JD 0.6-
million (US$1,7 million) to CCU's revolving fund for the extension of short-
term credit.  This fund wjould provide among others the complementary work-
ing capital to farmers obtaining development loans from ACC.
3. THE PflO0IECT
A. Detailed Features
3.01      The proposed Project would be part of the second phase of ACC's
on-farm investment program. The IDA credit of JD 1.08 million (US$3 mil-
lion) would supplement ACC's resources for the extension of about JD 1.8
million (US$5 million) in loans to farmers for priority investment fields
in 1967 and 1968. The estimated 3,000 to 4,O00 farmers who would receive
loans would contribute the remaining JD 0.36 million (US$1 million) to the
financing of the total project cost aggregating JD 2.16 million (US$6 mil-
lion) (see paras 3.03 and 3.05).
3.02      Priority investments to be financed would be (i) land reclamation
and improvement, (ii) farm water supply, (iii) tree crop and vineyard
establishment, (iv) farm machinery, and (v) on-farm development in govern-
ment irrigation schemes. The investments would thus improve Jordan's
limited land and water resources and develop fruit and vegetable production.
iAost of the demand for loans is expected to occur in the northwestern part
of Jordan, in the uplands and the Jordan Valley (see map).

3.04      Costs have been estimated conservatively on the basis of prices
and wages prevailing during the appraisal, with a contingency allowance of
about 10 per cent. Except for farm machinery, the farmers' contribution
would primarily consist of labor. Because of possible changes in demand
and in economic conditions, an amount equivalent to 15 per cent has been
left unallocated to permit adjustments and, if necessary, for financing
technical services (para 4.02). The estimated foreign exchange component
of JD 0.88 million is about 41 per cent of the total project cost or 82
per cent of the proposed IDA credit.
C. Proposed Financing
3.05      The estimated project cost of JD 2.16 million (US$6 million)
would be met from the following sources:
L Technical services have not been specifically included since it is
expected that they would be financed from other sources. Should this
financing not be available, the foreign exchange cost of these services
would be met from the unallocated portion of the IDA Credit.

3.06      Farmers would contribute on the average about 17 per cent to the
project cost, primarily in the form of hired or family labor. The contri-
bution of settlers within government irrigation projects, whose capital
resources are small, could be as low as 10 per cent. A higher contribution
would discourage farmers from investing or would force them to borrowr from
other sources at excessive cost.
3.07      The balance of project costs (83 per cent) would be provided as
loans from ACC., of which 60 per cent would be finarnced from the IDA credit
while the remaining 40 per cent would be financed from ACCts omn resources.
D. Lending Policies and Procedures
3.08      ACC is an agricultural credit institution making medium- and
long-term loans to farmers for development purposes. Operations under the
Project wiould be carried out under the general policies and procedures as
outlined below and elaborated in Annex 1. The major changes are with
respect to interest rates, terms of lending and the basis for loan appraisal.
i) Interest , Rates
For new loans the Corporation would raise interest rates to
individual borrowers from the present annual rates of 5-1/4
per cent to 6 per cent and charge penalty rates of at least
one per cent on loans in default, Increase of interest rates
rould narrow the gap between ACCrs current interest charges
and those of commercial banks (para 2.12).  Wlith respect to
the IDA credit, the Government would be the borrower and would
make the proceeds of the credit available to ACC for 20 years,
including 10 years of grace. ACC would pay Government a rate
of 3-1/4 per cent as in the first IDA Credit. This would pro-
vide a margin of 2-3/4 per cent which wiould be adequate to
cover administrative expenses and risks. The interest rate
would be reviewed from time to time and necessary changes vould
be agreed upon between the Corporation and IDA. The Government
would bear the exchange risk for repayment to IDA.



ii)  Terms  f4endml
Terms of lending to farmers within the ranges indicated below
w,ould be determined on the basis of the projected financial
returns in each case. Terms and grace periods for loans for
land reclamation, water supply and tree crop establishment
would be longer, while terms for loans for light tractors
would be shorter than under the fi-rst Credit. Terms and grace
periods would be shorter where the land is to be used primarily
for vegetable production, intermediate for grape and tree fruit
and longest for olive grove development.

Light tractors (below 50 hp)                up to 5          -
iii)  Basis for Loan Appraisal
Under the Corporation's lending rules and procedures, separate
appraisals are often made for loans to the same farmer for land
reclamation, water supply development and tree crop establish-
ment. Assurances have been provided by ACC that all of these
would be combined into one farm plan for each farm and would be
appraised together. This method of appraisal would permit the
formulation of more realistic repayment plan for the farmer
than the present system.
For pump irrigation schemes involving loans exceeding JD 5,000
ACC would require a satisfactory feasibility report and pumping
plant specifications would be prepared in a manner acceptable
to the Natural 11ater Aesources Authority.  Costs of technical
studies would be included in the investment costs and could be
financed under the Project.
3.09      As under the first IDA Credit, loan decisions based on the tech-
nicians' appraisal reports would be made by committees at the branch, dis-
trict, or head office level for loans up to JD 2,500 and by the Board of
Directors for loans above that amount. Loans to individual farmers or -
for single schemes financed under the Project and exceeding in the aggre-
gate JD 20,000 would require IDA approval. The committees would approve
or disapprove the application on the basis of creditworthiness of the



- 9 -
pros'oective borrower, but could lnot change the amount of loan recommended
by the techlical staff, since a reduction would not permit the farmer to
complete the investments to be carried out under the farm plan.
3.10      ACC would give emphasis to the economic and financial returns
to be expected from each farm plan, but would continue to have regard
for loan security. Loan security wiould be a first mortgage, with excep-
tions authorized in ACCts rules and procedures. With respect to tractors
or other heavy equipment, titles wiould be registered and a commitment
would be obtained from the farmer not to sell, transfer to assign the
equipment until his loan is repaid.
3.11      Loans to farmers would be disbursed in tranches upon documentary
evidence of expenditure incurred or on the basis of inspection by ACC of
the progress made in carrying out the farm plan. In the case of agricul-
tural machinery, ACC would make payments directly to dealers.
3.12      ACC would further strengthen its staff of loan collectors and
would pursue a rigorous policy of collections.  It would contact borrowers
immediately when loans become overdue, enforce a penalty interest rate on
defaulting borrowiers and foreclose >hen necessary to recover loans in
arrears. The Government would support ACC in this policy, especially by
the enforcement of collections through administratiive channels as provided
for under ACC's constituting law and would continue to refrain from insti-
tuting moratoria affecting the repayment of ACC's loans (para 2.12). During
negotiations assurances were obtained concerning these points,
3.13      Due to a pressing demand, ACC is expected to have its resources
fully utilized for loans and should, without compromising its standards of
loan appraisal, keep only small cash reserves for contingencies which should
not exceed about JD 50,000 over and above the amounts currently required
for disbursements on loans approved, such amount being projected not to
exceed about JD 300,000 at any time.  During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that ACC would invest the balance of its resources in lending
operations (para 2,13).
3.14      Assurances were also obtained that ACC would arrange for regu-
lar auditing of the accounts by accountants acceptable to IDA.
E. Disbursement
3.15      Disbursements from IDA would be made on the basis of 60 per cent
of loans paid out by ACC for farm development purposes (para 3.07). Docu-
mentation would consist of a statement of ACC's expenditures for loans,
supported whenever possible by the local supplier's invoice. The IDA par-
ticipation cannot be related directly to the foreign exchange component of
the Project.  Imported goods, if any, will be purchased locally by the
farmers, and the origin of such goods will not be identifiable except for
agricultural machinery and for the major equipment used in wrater supply
development. Any disbursements for technical assistance approved by IDA
would be on the basis of their foreign exchange cost (para 4.02).

4.  ORGAI4TIZATION AS  11ANAG_.3iNT
A. Project Administration
4.01      ACC has the responsibility for administering Jordants agricultural
credit program wzithin the Seven-Year Development Plan, which is under the
control of the Jordan Development Board. It would administer the proposed
IDA credit within its overall credit program. Assurances were obtained
that IDA wnould be consulted about any changes in the laws and regulations
governing ACC and on future appointments to the offices of the Chairman
and the Deputy General lVhnager. The present office holders are highly
regarded and manage the Corporation on a sound basis.
4.02      Details on ACC's present organization and financial conditions
are given in Annex 1 . ACC is benefitirg from U.S.AID assistance given in
accounting, statistics and credit procedures. There is clear need for
continuation of such assistance and for additional assistance in the field
of farm planning and production economics. During negotiations, assurances



- 11 -
were obtained that ACC would male all efforts necessary to secure, within
six months after signing, the services of a farm economics expert with
qualifications satisfactory to IDA for a period of one and a half to two
years. He would train and supervise ACC's personnel concerned with the
preparation of farm development plans and loan appraisals. From its staff
ACC would assign on a full-time basis two persons trained in farm economics
(one each in the development areas east and west of the Jordan PRiver), who
would assist the farm economics expert in training branch technicians and
loan officers in the preparation of farm plans and in methods of loan
appraisal. In the event that ACC does not succeed in securing a qualified
farm economics expert through U.S.AID or other technical assistance programs,
ACC would finance the respective foreign exchange cost from the unallocated
portion of the IDA credit (para 3.03). (This would constitute less than
10 per cent of the unallocated portion.)
4.03      In addition to further training of its own technical staff, ACC
would increasingly work in liaison with the Natural Resources Authority
and the Ilinistry of Agriculture, particularly in its extension and veter-
inary services and marketing organization. The Agricultural Engineering
and Irrigation Section of the IIinistry of Agriculture would continue to
be responsible for on-farm development within the ±ast Ghor and other
government irrigation schemes, and would encourage increased use of custom
services by private contractors to expedite the operations.
B, Procuremen-t
4.Q4      Goods required for farm development would be procured locally
through normal commercial channels. Competition for imported and local
goods is assured, and there are no restrictions on imports of goods under
the Project (except of those produced in Israel). IWell drilling and pump
installations for private irrigation systems would be performed by local
firms lhich are reasonably competent in this field. IJith respect to ser-
vice and repair of farm machinery, facilities exist in major centers.
Additional repair shops are being established in rural locations. The
scale of contracts and services to be procured under the Project would
not attract foreign contractors.
5. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION1
5.01      Benefits from the Project would materialize to participating
farmers, to the ACC and to Jordan's economy. Quick benefits would accrue
from increased production of vegetables; benefits from new vineyards would
materialize within three to five years; from stone fruit, citrus and olive
groves after a period of five to seven years.
5.02      Through investment in land and water, tree crops and vineyard
development, participating farmers would modernize and increase fruit and
vegetable production.  The financial rate of return on the full investment



- 12 -
cost would range from 17 per cent in olive grove developiaent to 60 per cent
in the development of blue-grape vineyards. The expected financial returns
which would commence writhin the time periods indicated in 5.01 above would
enaole the borrowers to repay their loans from ACC within five to twelve
years.
5.03      The proposed Project would enable ACC to continue the lending
program initiated under the first IDA Credit.  ACC wjould benefit through
upgrading of its technical staff and through further improvements in its
institutional strength. The further improvements in loan appraisal, admin-
istration and collection will lead to increased recoveries and to a con-
sequent strengthening of ACC's financial position.
5.04      Jordan's comparative advantage is greater in the intensive pro-
duction of fruits and vegetables where yield, quality and financial returns
are higher, than in the production of cereals or other staples w-here Jordan's
average yields are below those of neighboring countries. The output of
fruits and vegetables, which accounts for over half of Jordan's agricultural
production, will further increase through the investment contemplated under
this credit. After about 12 years the proposed investment wiould generate
incremental annual outputs of fruits and vegetables of approximately 95,000
tons, iath an estimated value at farm prices of JD 2.8 million.  About one
fourth of this could be exported, which would add JD 680,000 or US$2 million
to Jordan's export revenues. Assuming that the resources would be allocated
to subprojects as estimated in Annex 2, tables 1 and 2, the return to the
econony would be over 30 per cent.
6.  CONCLUSTONS AIE@ . CXOIWNDATIONS
6.o0      The Project is a part of the second stage of an agricultural
credit program directed principally at the expansion and improvement of
Jordan's productive land and w-ater supplies, with concurrent development
for fruit and vegetable production. The demand for investment capital in
such development is great. Participating farmers would realize satisfactoxy
results.
6.02      The Project is sound and suitable for the proposed US$3 million
credit. The Government would be the borrower and would make the proceeds
of the credit available to ACC whiclh in turn would make medium- and long-
term loans to farmers. ACC is capable of administering the credit.
6.03      During negotiations, assurances satisfactonry to IDA were obtained
that:
a) the Government would:
i)  refrain from instituting moratoria that would delay
repayment of loans made by ACC and would support ACC
in a strict policy on loan collections (para 3.12);



- 13 -
ii) consult IDA about future changes in the laws governing
the ACC (para 4.01);
iii) consult IDA on future appointments of the General
Ianager (Chairman) and the Deputy I7anager of ACC (para
4.01);
b)  the Agricultural Credit Corporation would:
i) contribute from its own resources to the CCU's revolv-
ing fund an amount adequate for the extension of the
necessary short-term credit required by farmers
receiving development loans *i.ho cannot obtain such
credit from other sources on reasonable terms (para 2.17);
ii) carry out the purposes of the credit through making
available for lending to farmers the necessary funds
averaging 83 per cent of the cost of approved farm
development plans (para 3.07);
iii)  raise interest rates to borrowers from the present
annual rate of five and a fourth per cent to six per
cent and charge penalty rates of at least one per cent
on loans in default /para 3.08(i)7, increase its staff
of collectors and foreclose iSen necessary (para 3.12);
iv) appraise loan applications and determine repayment
schedules on the basis of projected financial returns,
by means of a farm development plan /para 3.08(iii)/;
v) require a feasibility report and specifications accept-
able to the Natural ilesources Authority for pump irri-
gation schemes involving loans in excess of JD 5,000
para 3.08(iii)/;
vi) obtain prior IDA approval for loans to any individual
farmer or for any single scheme exceeding JD 20,COO
in the aggregate (para 3.09);
vii) have its financial resources fully utilized for loans
and would, without compromising its standards of loan
appraisal, keep only small cash reserves for contingen-
cies wshich should not exceed about JD 50,000 over and
above the amounts currently required for disbursements
on loans approved, such amounts being presently estimated
to be about JD 300,000 (para 3,13);
viii) arrange for an annual audit of the accounts by account-
ants acceptable to IDA (para 3.14);



- 14 -
ix) make all efforts necessary to secure, within six months
after signing, the services of a qualified farm produc-
tion economics expert satisfactory to IDA who, wzith the
assistance of two farm economists from ACC's staff,
would train and supervise ACCts field technicians in
the preparation of farm plans and in methods of loan
appraisal (para 4.02).

ANNEX I
AGRICULTURAL CREDEr PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT CORPORATION
1.        The Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) was established in
1960 with an authorized capital of JD 7 million (US$19.6 million). The
assets of its predecessor credit institutions, mostly balances due on
loans made by these institutions, are the major contribution to the paid-
in capital which amounted to about JD4.3 million (US$12 million) at
September 30, 1966. The objective of the Corporation is to extend loans
for productive agricultural purposes.
Organization
2.        The Corporation is controlled by a Board of Governors, consisting
of a Chairman, four Government members representing respectively the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Lands
and Surveys and the National Development Board; and four non-Government
members. The Chairman is appointed by the Council of Ministers subject
to the Kingts approval.  He recommends to    the Council of Ministers the
appointment of the non-GDvernment members.  At present these are leading
farmers from the major agricultural regions of Jordan.
3.        The Board has full authority to administer the Corporation and
determine its policies. Coordination with Government policies is assured
through representation on the Board from the Ministries of Finance and
Agriculture and particularly the National Development Board. The Corpora-
tion has its own salary scales and terms of service; the staff does not
have civil service status; salaries are slightly higher than in the civil
service.
4.        The Corporation's head office is in Amman in new premises, built
two years ago. It is organized into the following sections: Administrative,
Accounting, Credit, Execution and Supervision, Statistics and Research.
There are twelve branches and two sub-branches operating in the main centers
of the country.
5.        The Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive.  He is assisted
by a Deputy General Manager who like him is appointed by the Council of
Ministers with the approval of the King. The present officeholders are
highly regarded and run the Corporation on a sound basis.
6.        The Corporation's staff numbers about 209, (about 100 in the
head office and 109 in the branches) as against an establishment of 235.
The staff is still inadequate both in number and professional experience to
administer the existing loan portfolio and to carry out a greatly expanded
program of lending operations.  ACC has not-been ahle to recruit sufficient
qualified personnel or to actively pursue in-service training. A number
of staff members are being trained abroad, but this type of training takes
a long time and risks of losing trainees are high. The recent increase in
salary levels should, however, enable ACC to recruit and retain better qua>
ified staff.



APNEX 1
Page 2
7.        The administrative orgExiization, and especially accounting and
statistics, have been considerably improved since the first IDA Credit was
made.  The mechanization of the accounting system has been undertaken under
the guidance of a US. AID expert.  Two other U.S.  AID experts are assisting
ACC with its statistics and lending procedures, respectively. Auditing is
carried out by the Government's Audit Department; one employee is permanently
assigned to the Corporation for this purpose.
Loan Characteristics and Procedures
8.        Maximum terms of medium and long-term loans as fixed by regulations
are 10 and 20 years, respectively. Terms of loans made actually range from
about five years for purchases of tractors, farm machinery and livestock to
no more than 15 years for irrigation projects. Periods of grace up to four
years are given for investments where returns will not be realized for
several years as in tree plantations. The Corporation discontinued short-term
credit operations in 1963, leaving them to the Central Co-operatives Union
and cooperatives.
9.        A real estate mortgage is required as security for a loan.
Guarantors are accepted when the borrower is not a landowner or does not
have clear title to his land, but in such cases, loans must not exceed JD 500.
Loans cannot exceed 60 per cent of the Corporation's valuation of the land
offered as security. Because of insufficient resources ACC had in the past
established various ceilings according to loan types. These were lifted
after ACC received the first IDA Credit.
10.       In 1964 the rate of interest on loans for farmers was raised from
4 to 54 per cent per annum at the suggestion of IDA.  This rate is still
below the rates of commercial banks which range from 71- per cent to the legal
maximum of 9 per cent per annum for short-term operations. The Corporation
has not yet applied a penalty rave or other charges for loaxLs in arrears.
11.       Loan applications are received by the branches or head office
directly from farmers. The practice of lending on the basis of farm plans
has been developed but still is not general. The appraisal of the collateral
offered as security and cost estimates of the Project are still of primary
concern to ACC rather than the appraisal of returns. Decisions are made by
technical loan committees, including farmers' representatives appointed by
the Board.  Branch Committees may decide on loans up to JD 50O (USA,400); the
Central Loan Committee decides on loans up to JD 5,000 (US$14,000); loans
over JD 2,950 are referred to the Board.
12.       Loan disbursements are made by tranches after checks by inspectors,
or on documentary evidence of progress of investments or purchase of goods.
Payments for farm machinery purchases are usually made by ACC directly to
the dealers.
13.       ACC now makes loans to the CCU at a rate of 2 per cent per annum
against 1 per cent per annum before the IDA Credit was granted. CCU in



ANNEX 1
Page 3
turn lends to member cooperatives at 4 per cent and these relend to their
members at 7 and 8 per cent. After a long experience of poor repayment by
farmers, CCU has reduced its operations considerably over the last three
years, and has been able to redeem a portion of its advances received from
ACC. CCU has been reorganized and now has better control over its operations.
ACC is also represented on its Board.
Lending Operations
14.       Table 1 shows the Corporation's lending operations by years from
its inception to September 30, 1966 and the amount of the loan portfolio
at the end of each period. The overall average of lending per year since
the lending program under the IDA Credit started has been about 2,100 loans
for a total of about JD 1.1 million per annum (average JD 520 per loan
(US$1,460)). Loan collections have averaged about JD 670,000 per year. The
net increase of the portfolio during the period has been about JD1.3 million.
15.       The record of investments over recent years supported by ACC loans
expressed in physical terms is impressive. Some examples are given below:

On-farm development within East
Ghor Irrigation Project                   343               103,000
Total          3,983             1,607,000
Total related investments made by farmers are estimated at about JD 2
million.
17.       The average rate of loan collections over the last three-year
period has been reasonably good for loans made by ACC since inception and
excellent for loans under the IDA Credit, although the experience regarding
loans under the IDA Credit is short and therefore not conclusive. Repay-
ments on loans inherited from other institutions have been poor, but better
than expected. Collections were favored in 1963/64 and 1964/65 by good
crops; they dropped considerably in 1966 because of an unusually bad crop
season. The average collection rate of about 50/60 per cent per annum can
be maintained only if ACC pursues a rigorous policy on collection. This
low rate is reasonable in Jordan due to the recurrence of bad crop years,
the still significant portfolio of old loans and ACC's policy of not
granting extension of maturities. The former Government policy of moratoria
on loan payments has tended to slow down repayment. Also the uncertain
political situation has added to this problem.
Loan Portfolio
18.       Details of the loan portfolio as at December 31, 1966 are given
in Table 2. As at December 31, 1966, ACC's loan portfolio included
approxinatelyr 56,0o0  loans for an arnount of JD 6 million (average of
about JD 100 per loan). About JD 326,000 are doubtful loans taken over
from predecessor institutions. The related collections accrue to the paid-
in capital.  The great number of loans makes the portfolio difficult to
handle. Over the last three years, ACC has been able to reduce the number
of loans by about 10,000 through collections and some consolidations.
Financial Situation
19.       Condensed balance sheets at March 31, 1963-1966 and December 31,
1966 and profit and loss accounts of the Corporation are given in Tables 3

1965/66 .....oeoot 84Y430
1966 (nine months)... 28,119
Only interest payments received are taken into account, and heavy fluctua-
tions in net profits relfect changes in collection rates related to the
success or failure of aops. Over the period profits have averaged about
2 per cent of the average capital employed; gross income has been about
4.2 per cent and administrative expenses 2.2 per cent. lJith the strength-
ening and better payment of its staff, ACC1s administrative expenses have
increased. They are still, however, extremely modest; and their rate of
increase has been less than the increase in income. ACC's profitability
wiould be better if collection of interest wiere improved.
20.       ACC's overall financial situation has improved markedly since
the lending program under the IDA Credit was started.  Major improvements
include: a significant increase of the paid-in capital and surplus account
which was credited iath all the profit, increase in loanable resources by
the amount of the IDA Credit., reduction by about 50 per cent of doubtful
loans and significant reduction of loans inherited from predecessor
institutions. From September 30, 1963 which is the beginning of the first
IDA Project, the proportion of old loans has dropped from 47 per cent of
the loan portfolio to about 24 per cent at December 31, 1966. Wthile ACCIs
financial situation is satisfactory at present, the possibility of a dete-
rioration at a later stage is always present because of the impact which
Jordan's unstable political situation appears to have on repayinents of
loans.

ANNEX 2
JORDAN - AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
DETAILS OF THE LENDING PROGRAM
Basis for Loan Appraisal
1.       The first three investment categories, land reclamation and
improvement, development and improvement of farm 'water supplies and estab-
lishment of tree crop plantations do not constitute separate investment
purposes. They are in fact complementary and dependent upon each other.
In most areas, for example, land reclamation precedes stone fruit, citrus,
olive grove and vineyard development. In others, the farmer will not
proceed with land reclamation and tree crop planting unless he has succeeded
in developing an assured -water supply. Under the proposed Credit, all
these development costs would, whenever possible, be incorporated in one
farm plan and -would be projected in conjunction with the financial returns
by means of a cash flow statement.
2.       In like manner, on-farm development in Government irrigation
schemes would be projected in conjunction with the financial returns from
citrus and/or vegetable production. On the basis of a farm plan, minor
investments in draft animals, equipment and farm buildings would be
included as components of such loans. The farm plan would also show the
extent of financial assistance which the borrower is receiving from other
sources such as the land reclamation scheme financed under the World Food
Program or the USAID grant for land levelling. The entire investment
would be appraised in terms of the projected financial returns.
3.       Farm machinery would remain a separate investment category.  Loan
appraisal would rest on adequate utilization on the borrower's own farm
and on the need for custom services which he would render.
ACC's Operations outside the IDA Credit
4.       Two investment categories of the first Credit, livestock produc-
tion and farm building and storage facilities, would not be included under
the proposed second IDA Credit. Loans for livestock, mainly for dairy
farms under the first Credit were discontinued because sufficient develop-
ment has already taken place considering present feed supply and milk
marketing conditions. Financing of poultry, particularly for hatcheries
and egg production, will be required, but not on a large scale. Prepara-
tion for storage and processing facilities had not yet reached the stage
considered adequate by the appraisal mission. The mission considers
these investments essential for Jordan's economy, but ranks them second
in priority.  They may ever.tually be considered for financing under the
credit if adequate justifications are provided.
Land Reclamation and Improvement -- JD 300,COO
5.       Land clearing as practiced in Jordan. involves high cost per unit
area and would hardly be economical in many countries. It is conditioned



ANNEX 2
Page 2
by the extreme shortage of arable land, and is made possible particularly in
areas where rainfall or irrigation permits production of high va3ue crops.
6.        The physical process, mainly in West Bank locations (west of the
Jordan River), may involve blasting and piling of rocks in stone walls,
terracing and subsoiling. The work is either done by hand labor, particularly
in areas where labor costs are not excessive or where women perform part of
the task at daily wages not exceeding JD .250, or with mechanical drilling,
blasting and bulldozing. Land development has averaged approximately JD 15
per dunum, but has been substantially higher in some cases.
7.        Concerned about the high cost of land reclamation and terracing,
particularly in Wlest Bank areas near Hebron, the mission obtained detailed
input-output data and found that farmers were using advanced horticultuxral
and marketing techniques. Yields and financial returns from vegetables,
stone fruit and grapes enable farmers to repay development loans within a
period of about 10 years (see Annex 3, Tables 1-6). Since the first IDA
Credit became effective, the area reclaimed with ACC financing has ranged
from an annual rate of about 1,400 to 4L,CoO dunrum. The four-y-ear investment
target under the Project aims at the reclamation of 16,000 to 20,000 dunums
in total at an average cost of JD 15 to JD 20 per dunum.
8.        To give further encouragement to this program, the Government has
appointed a committee consisting of the Undersecretary of Agriculture, the
Director of Extension and the Chairman of ACC which organizes and judges
contests and awards prizes for land reclamation.
Development of Farm Water Resources -- JD 340,000
9.        Eighty per cent of Jordan's land area receives less than 220 mm
of annual rainfall. Farm water resource development has high priority.
Loans for this purpose have comprised nearly 20 per cent of ACCts loan
volume since 1960. Investment in major irrigation works has been financed
from other sources.
10.       Specifically, ACC has been financing small dams and reservoirs,
wells with pumps, pipes, engines and power house, and concrete lining of
water channels. ACC loans for these purposes were JD 128,000 for the year
ending September 1966 and even higher in the two preceding years. Before
farmers are eligible for ACC financing of pump irrigation systems, they
must assume the risk of finding water. They receive no credit until they
have found good and sufficient water.
11.       The Credit program has been most effective in West Bank areas,
in the Ghor Nimrin on the East Bank and in the desert area near Wadi
Dhuleil.  When water is struck, land reclamation, as described above,
starts simultaneously with the construction of the water supply system. In
the same year vegetables, or fruit trees intercropped with vegetables, are
planted. Development cost per dunum is high but high returns warrant loan
repayment within 10 to 12 years. Entrepreneurs installing larger pump units
sell water to neighboring farmers. In other cases, sevreral farmers pool
their resources and share the investment cost of the pump scheme. The
investors form a group which sells water to its members and also to outsiders.

12.      Remarkable as the accomplishments of enterprising farmers, with
the assiswance of ACC loans, may be, there are at least two serious con-
straints. One is the limitation of usable groundwater resources. In
certain 1-1est Bank areas, there has been some evidence of overpumping. This
rill remain a problem until the groundwater will eventually be recharged
iw.ith wzater from the reservoirs built on the tributaries of the Jordan River.
Avare of the danger of overpumping, the Government has subjected pump
sclemes to license and inspection by the Natural ilesources Authority, which
agency is responsible for all water development projects.
13.       The other constraint lies in the lack of experience in designing
and operating major pump schemes. Jordan has capable and experienced
engineers but in the opinion of the mission, ACC has failed to utilize them
for these works. Farmers have often used crude designs even for costly
pump schemes. The mission recormends that for purmp schemes costing more
than JD 3,000 ACC should require a satisfactory feasibility study before
granting the appropriate loan. ilith this provision the lack of engineer-
ing knowzledge should no longer be a constraint.
l4.       Taking into account ground water limitations as well as past
achievements, the mission's conservative forecast of lending would facilitate
water supply development for approximately 9,000 dunum, at an average cost
of JD 36 per dunun. ACC is capable of executing a program of this size.
Tree Crop Development -- JD 400,000
15.       There is a great potential for a variety of stone fruit and
vineyards, particularly in locations west of the Jordan River where rainfall
is adequate without irrigation. In these areas, orchards and vineyards are
generally developed as a corrollary to land reclamation.
16.       Citrus development in most locations requires prior land and
water development. Diversification through the establishment of blocks
with different orange varieties, "monthly" and "annual" lemons, grapefruit,
and tangarines help farmers to minimize the effect of 3easonal price and
income fluctuations. Intercropping with vegetables and with grapes provides
early returns from orchards and olive groves which require a long gestation
period.  The range of practices and combinations is so great that the
examples (Annex 3, Table 1-6) may not be representative of a large number
of existing farms.
17.       Farmers have ample choice and adequate supplies of planting
materials from private and Government nurseries.  They apply modern
horticultural and marketing techniques.  Some fruit growers' cooperatives
compete with private marketing firms in providing essential marketing
services. The produce market in Amman has been re-located and reorganized.
Government and UN experts carry out experimental work to improve marketing
efficiency and to develop domestic and export markets.



ANNEX 2
Page. S
18.       Olive grove development is carried out in many locations.  Annual
returns from olives tend to be lower and less reliable than returns from
other tree crops. The cash flow statement (Anmex 3, Table 6) brings out the
danger of excessive cost for land development which would not be compensated
by commensurate returns from olives. ACC should not approve loans to olive
growers whose land reclamation cost exceeds about JD 15 per dunum. Returns
from olives have been conservatively estimated at 15 Kg/tree, they could be
increased substantially by use of high yielding plant material and improved
management.
On-Farm Development -- JD 280 000
19.       On-farm development involves the re-design of farm lay-out, con-
struction of farm head ditches, stone removal and land levelling. At the
farmer's request these services are being performed, with ACC financing, by
the Agricultural and Irrigation Engineering Services Division of the
Ministry of Agriculture. The Division has experienced technicians, levell-
ing equipment and does good work. The rate of development could be increased
if more private contractors were encouraged to execute the operations under
guidance and supervision of the Division.
2o.       The need for on-farm development exists in one major and in three
minor irrigation schemes. The National Water Resources Authority is
responsible for the construction of the water shortage and distribution system
and for operation and maintenance.
21.       The major scheme is the East Ghor Irrigation Project, the first
stage of a phased program for development in the Jordan Valley. For the
cropping season 1967, water will be supplied for irrigating 117,000 dunum
on some 3400 farm units. Most units will have 30 or 50 dunum of irrigated
land. Farmers who owned larger areas prior to construction of the irrigation
scheme, are permitted to operate larger farms up to 200 dunum.
22.       Farmers receive technical services from Government research and
extension centers located in the Project area. USAID has financed the
design and construction phase for on-farm development and provides backstopp-
ing for the essential Government services. The Project area has some of
Jordan's most fertile soils. Through land reclamation they become highly
productive for growing vegetables and bananas. It is served by a network
of feeder roads and by a major road to Amman.
23.       Design and construction of three minor irrigation schemes is
being financed by the UK Govermment. Construction of two minor schemes with
earth dams and main canals on Wadi Shu'aib and Wadi Kafrein began in September
1966 and is to be completed within two years. The reservoirs will have a
total storage capacity of 11.7 mcm. They will provide water for 23000 dunum
of newly irrigated land and supplementary water to areas now receiving
inadequate water supplies from other sources.



ANNEX 2
Page'e
24.       Wadi DhuLleil, the third minor scheme, likewise receiving financial
and technical assistance from the UK Government, involves the development of
ground water in a desert area about 40 km northeast of Amman. The scheme is
programmed in three stages, each of which is to irrigate 10,000 dunum.
Private growers have pioneered in this development and have established
technical feasibility and profitable vegetable production on irrigated desert
soils in large scale operations. The Government aims to establish the
feasibility and the economics of operating small farm units. Construction
under this scheme is not yet sufficiently advanced to permit financing of
on-farm development under the proposed second IDA Credit.
25.       On-farm development within the first two minor schemes could be
financed by ACC under the proposed second IDA Credit in a similar manner as
in the East Ghor Scheme, provided that construction will proceed on schedule.
Farm Mechanization -- JD 520,0OO
26.       Except for normal port handling charges, there are at present no
significant levies on importation of farm machinery in Jordan. Major
tractor and implement companies have sales and service agencies in Jordan
and competition among them is keen. Mechanization has progressed rapidly,
as indicated below, and the demand for tractors is strong.

27.                 In the year ending September 30, 1966, ACC's loan volume
for mechanization increased further to about JD 236,000 and more than 100
tractor purchases were financed. In view of Jordan's small land base, at
the national and at the farm unit level, and in view of the rapid pace of
mechanization in recent years, mechanization assumes a lower priority during
the proposed second Credit than it had during the first IDA Credit. The
investment target of JD 520,000 would permit financing tractor purchases at
annual rates of about 70 tractor units and other additional equipment.
28.                Farmers spend approximately JD 1 on trailers, combines
and stationary threshers for every JD 2 they spend on tractor purchases.
Tractors in greatest demand are in the light to medium weight class, ranging
from 30 to 65 hp. Tractor owners whose farms are too small for the capacity
of their equipment perform custom services for other farmers. ACC organizes
tractor field days and training courses in close cooperation with the
equipment comr,panies.
