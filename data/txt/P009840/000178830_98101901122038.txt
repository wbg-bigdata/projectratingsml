INDIA
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting and Transport Sector
1.01      India's 3.3 million square kilometers present a wide range of
topography and climate. It includes parts of the Himalayan mountain range,
the Indo-Cangetic plain, and the Deccan plateau of peninsular India. The
total population is about 750 million (mid-1984 estimate) with 24% living in
urban areas and the remainder dispersed in over one-half million small vil-
lages located throughout the country. The Indian economy is dominated by
agriculture, which employs more than two-thirds of the labor force and
provides about 33% of GDP, but also has a large industrial sector, which
accounts for 26% of GDP. Economic growth has averaged about 3.6% per annum
since 1950/51. Annual per capita income stands at US$260 and has been rising
by about 1.4% per year in the period between 1950 and 1980. GDP growth
during the 1980s has averaged about 5.0% p.a., substantially higher than the
long-term average.
1.02      India's vastness has shaped its transportation system, which is
both extensive and diversified, comprising about 61,000 route kum of rail
lines, 1.5 million kms of roads, 10 major ports and 178 intermediate or minor
ports, 14 major airports (6 of which handle international flights), 2,570 kms
of pipelines, and limited inland waterways and coastal shipping. The system
provides a satisfactory level of service in many respects, but there remains
considerable potential for reducing transport costs and improving the quality
of services. In addition, a large proportion of the transportation
infrastructure in all modes needs to be renewed or upgraded to meet future
transport requirements more efficiently. Finally, it has little resilience
to deal with unforeseen changes in the pattern of transport demand or to deal
with the peaks and valleys in the total demand for transport. This
phenomenon was particularly marked in the late 1970s when transport bot-
tlenecks appeared due to a decline in operational efficiency of railways and
ports, coupled with substantial increases in traffic and sudden shifts in the
pattern of demand. One of the most important changes was the cessation of
foodgrain imports into the country. Before this occurred, the foodgrain
requirements in the north were met mostly from imports through the southern
ports. Now all the deficit areas, including the south, are supplied from
surplus northern states, therefore reversing the direction of traffic, chang-
ing its volume, and also affecting the movement of fertilizers.
1.03      Rail and road are the dominant modes of transport with railways
providing trunk services for bulk movement and road transport providing long
distance service for other commodities as well as taking up most of the



-2-
feeder and distribution activities. Since it is estimated that rail and road
carry about 95% of total domestic passenger and freight movement, the role of
other modes is relatively insignificant. Nonetheless, these other modes (air
transport, pipelines, coastal shipping, and inland waterways) provide impor-
tant specialized services, and each has a role to play because of the size oE
the country and its geographical features. Consequently, the Government of
India (GOI) is undertaking projects for expanding coastal shipping of coal
and pipelines for transport of crude oil, gas, and petroleum products.
1.04      The Indian Railways (IR) is the world's second largest railway
system under one management. IR is the nation's Largest undertaking with an
investment of Rs 88.8 billion, a route kilometrage of 61,385 and 1.6 million
employees as of March 1983. Freight traffic has increased steadily since
1950/51, growing at an average rate of 3.1% per annum in terms of total
tonnage and 4.5% in terms of ton kilometers. In 1981/82 freight traffic in
IR was 174 billion ton-kms, Passenger traffic has also shown sustained
growth, particularly suburban traffic which grew at a sustained rate of 5.4%
for passengers and 6.3% for passenger-kilometers between 1950/51 and 1981/82.
Passenger and freight traffic by rail is expected to continue to grow during
the 1980s. In order to meet forecast levels of transport demand, IR will
have to continue its current emphasis on modernization of assets and manage-
ment practices aimed at increasing operational efficiency.
1.05      The railways have traditionally been the main mode of motorized
transport in India. In the early 1950s the railways were so dominant that
their share in motorized land transport was estimated at 90% of total ton-kins
and 74% of total passenger-kms, the balance being carried by road transport.
Over the following three decades, freight and passenger transport using the
road system increased and, consequently, the share of freight and passenger
kilometers moved by rail is estimated to have gradually declined. Since
traffic in both rail and roads has grown, this increased share of road tran-
sport is not a mere gradual substitution of railways by roads as in many
other countries, but rather has resulted from greater specialization in the
services provided by each mode. Also, this increase in the share of road
transport is consistent with trends observed in other countries, which indi-
cale a strong correlation between economic development and increases in the
relative importance of road transport in freight and passenger movement. GOI
has recognized the important role of road transport in the economy and conse-
quently is strengthening highway planning and providing more resources to the
subsector. The roads subsector is analyzed in detail in Chapter II.
1.06      The ten major ports serviced 9,315 and 6,639 vessels, carrying an
aggregate of 88 and 69 million tons of cargo in 1981/82 and 1982/83, respec-
tively. The lower traffic volume in 1982/83 reflected the impact of the
world's recession and decreased trade. The principal cargoes handled at the
major ports include crude oil and petroleum products, iron ore, fertilizers
(including raw materials), coal, and containerized and break-bulk general
cargo. Since the mid-1970s India's foreign trade has been marked by a rapid



-3-
growth of containerized traffic. Within a short period of six years between
1975/76 and 1981/82, the volume of container cargo increased manifold at
Bombay, Cochin, and Calcutta despite draft limitations and inadequate shore
facilities to handle containers at these ports. GOI is undertaking changes
in the maritime transport system, including transformation of port terminal
facilities to accomplish high-speed cargo handling and the development of
inter-modal networks for onward movement of containers to and from inland
destinations. These changes are necessary in order to improve handling of
import-export traffic while avoiding congestion in the major ports.
B. Transport Administration, Planning and Coordination
1.07      Transport responsibility in India is shared between Government and
the private sector. The private sector controls the trucking industry, a
small portion of the shipping industry, and about 40% of non-urban passenger
road transport. Government entities own the railways, state road transport
undertakings, the ports, the major shipping companies, and all the institu-
tions involved in civil aviation, as well as responsibilities for the con-
struction and maintenance of all roads. Some of the responsibilities concern
only the Central Government while others are shared with the States.
1.08      Transport is under the jurisdiction of various ministries: roads,
ports and shipping are under the Ministry of Shipping and Transport (MOST);
railways are under the Ministry of Railways; civil aviation under the Minis-
try of Tourism and Civil Aviation; and pipelines under the Ministry of
Petroleum. In addition, the Planning Commission is in charge of overall
transport investment planning in close cooperation with Central Ministries
and the State Governments; and transport coordination is undertaken within
the context of the following institutional framework: (a) Cabinet Committee
on Transport and Tourism; (b) Secretaries' Committee on Transport, Tourism
and Aviation; (c) Transport Development Council and Inland Water Transport
Board; and (d) Interstate Transport Committee, which regulates interstate
road transport.
1.09      This organizational setup has resulted in insufficient coordination
within the transport sector. The lack of coordination of many important
elements of transport policy such as pricing, effective utilization of avail-
able transport capacity at the operational level, and others which fall
outside the purview of the Planning Commission, has constrained transport
planning and coordination in India. The adequacy of transport planning has
also been affected by insufficient data on transport flows and costs, which
makes investment analysis difficult, and by inadequate staffing in the
various agencies involved, particularly at the State level. This lack of an
integrated policy framework for the sector and of an organizational setup to
develop and enforce it has been a matter of concern and of frequent exchanges
of views between the OI and the Bank Group for several years, and specific
improvements will be addressed in the proposed project (see para 1.11).



-4-
1.10      In 1978 GOI created the National Transport Policy Committee (NTPC),
a special study group to analyze the transport sector and provide policy
recommendations to improve its efficiency. The NTPC, with the assistance of
UNDP experts, carried out a study which was presented to GOI in 1980. The
study's suggestions and recommendations are basically sound and will provide
a framework for better development of the country's transport sector. GOI
approved most of the NTPC recommendations in a cabinet resolution of March
1982. Some of the recommendations have already been implemented by GOI in
each subsector, but especially those with intermodal implications such as
price coordination, traffic allocation, regulations, etc. have received
little attention mainly because of the absence of a GOI body in charge of
intermodal coordination. This matter is addressed in the proposed project
(see para 1.11). The Bank is now focussing its transport sector work in
India on defining, together with GOI, an adequate implementation program and
monitoring system for the main NTPC recommendations which have not yet been
implemented (see Annex H). At negotiations, GOI presented to the Bank
detailed information concerning progress so far achieved in implementing the
NTPC recommendations and its immediate plans for continuing the process.
1.11      One important NTPC recommendation is the establishment of a Tran-
sport Coordination Committee (TCC), charged with the task of improving coor-
dination between the different modes of the sector and, within a common
framework, dealing with all aspects of transport policy, including invest-
ment, pricing, and regulation. The TCC would be an inter-disciplinary group
set up in the Planning Commission. It would be staffed with officials from
the Planning Commission and from the various subsectoral agencies. In addi-
tion, the TCC would examine the major transport issues identified by NTPC and
still to be implemented, and would be the executive body in charge of their
implementation. In the context of the preparation of this project, the Bank
and GOI agreed that prompt establishment of TCC was of utmost importance, and
during negotiations, Terms of Reference (see Annex E) for TCC were discussed
and agreed. It was also agreed that GOI, in consultation with the Bank,
should establish and adequately staff TCC by September 30, 1985, and provi-
sions will be made for GOI/Bank discussions on all aspects concerning TCC's
operations.
C. Transport Investment
Allocation of Public Funds for Transport in Indian Development Plans
1.12      Transport investment represents an important part of total invest-
ment in India, due to the crucial role that transportation plays in overall
economic development and to the high construction cost, the relatively long
lead time and substantial life expectancy of transport infrastructure invest-
ments. However, the share of transport investment in total public investment
has declined over the last thirty years as shown in the following table:

/a Planned Investment.
Source: World Bank estimates on the basis of Development Plans.
Transport expenditures in the first three plans made up over 22% of total
investment, declining to about 15% in the next two plans, to just over 14% in
the Fifth Plan and to 12.4% in the Sixth Plan. This trend can only be
explained by the need in earlier years to concentrate on basic infrastructure
and by higher priorities being placed on other sectors in later years. Data
on annual average actual expenditures in the transport sector in 1970/71
prices also show that during the first three plans, transport investment
experienced rapid growth, particularly in railways. This was followed by a
long period of contraction (1966-1978) with levels of investment substan-
tially lower than the previous peak during the Third Plan. Analysis of
subsectoral shares show that the contraction in the 1966-1978 period was
limited to railway investment while the other subsectors continued to
experience real investment growth albeit at a lower pace than in previous
years. The situation improved somewhat during the Sixth Plan, but investment
levels in the sector are still insufficient to provide adequate quality of
service. Past inadequate transport investment has resulted in: (a) lack of
adequate railway capacity to carry coal, which had to be moved less effi-
ciently by road transport; (b) constraints in port capacity due to obsolete
equipment and outdated management practices; (c) overcrowding of passenger
trains; (d) poor condition of the national highway system, about one-third



-6-
of which is still single lane and not suitable for carrying present traffic
volumes; (e)  inadequate network of rural roads with about 35% ot villages
not connected by all-weather roads; and (f) insufficient maintenance funding
across the sector.

Soturcec  World Bank estima,es on the basis of Development Plans
Bet ween 1951/52 and 1968/69 about 60% of the public sector plan outlay on
transport went to railways, rising to about 66% during the 1956-1966 period.
Subsequently? the share of railways in the sector's public investment dropped
to about 40%. The snare of roads ranged between 34% and 40% of the sector's
outlays in most Plan periods, except during the second and third Plans when
it only accounted for 22 and 24 percent, respectively. Public road passenger
transport, which had received a share of 1.4% in the Third Plan, accounts for
almiost 10% in the Sixth Plan. The relative balance of investment funds
between rail and roads has changed in line with the rapidly expanding role of
road transport. The development of major and minor ports accounted for only
3% of the sector's outlay in the Second Plan, but its share rose to almost
11% in the Fourth and Fifth Plan. The large port investment allocations
during the period 1969-78 reflect an expansion program on the east coast
which is substantially completed. Port development was planned at about 6%
of expenditures in the Sixth Plan, though its actual share is likely to
increase further due to investment in the new Nhava Sheva Port, which was not
originally included in the Plan.
1.14      The allocation of investment funds to each subsector is made by the
Planning Commission on the basis of projected transport demand and available
capacity in each mode and taking into account recommendations from the
relevant agencies and departments. Variations in the allocation of funds

obviously reflect availability of resources and the relative priorities in
the Plans as well as the need to solve immediate problems faced by a
particular mode of transport. Nonetheless, in light of the rapid growth in
road transport and of deficiencies in the road network (see para 2.21),
particularly in the national highways system, there is a need to step up the
allocation of resources to the subsector significantly.
Transport Investment During the Sixth Plan (1980-85)
1.15      The official long-term policy objectives for the transport sector
in India are to: (a) remove major transport bottlenecks; (b) increase
capacity; (c) conserve energy; (d) improve transport coordination;
(e) complete ongoing works; (f) maximize asset utilization; (g) evolve a
national transport pricing policy; and (h) give special attentiorn to tran-
sport needs of remote areas. These objectives are very broad and their
achievement clearly goes beyond any single Five-Year Plan. The Sixth Plan
emphasized the following aspects:  (a) modernization and rehabilitation of
railway assets to increase efficiency; (b) addition to the container handling
capacity of major ports; (c) continuation of rural roads construction
program, and (d) removal oL deficiencies in the national highways system and
upgrading some selected stretches of other roads. The proposed project aims
to remove different types of deficiencies in the national highway system,
through physical as well as institutional improvements. A careful selection
of stretches was carried out with the intention of preparing a package of
projects comprising a wide variety of conditions commonly found in the
country.

Expenditure in constant rupees during 1980/81-1983/84 amounted to only 60% of
the Plan's original allocation to the sector.  Progress in implementation
varied greatly among subsectors.  The railways has been able to achieve the
highest percentage of planned outlay (73%) due to the Government's recogni-
tion of its crucial role in the economy and of its pressing needs for funds
to rehabilitate and modernize assets neglected in previous years.  The roads
subsector has been less successful in maintaining the real value of its
initial plan allocation with national highways spending only 59% of its
initial allocation.  This shortfall, coupled with instufficient expenditure on
maintenance is regrettable and should be revised in the light of evidence
pointing to the rapid growth in road transport. Low expenditure in national
highways is due to insufficient availability of funds under the various
annual budgets rather than to lack of absorptive capacity in the subsector or
inadequate project implementation.
1.17       In the first four years of the Plan, real investment in ports,
lighthouses, and shipping achieved only 47% of the target for 1980-85, partly
as a result of funding constraints, delays in project implementation, and
insufficient demand growth in the case of shipping during the first two years
of the Plan. This situation improved significantly in the latter years, and
the implementation of the ports' investment program is now progressing satis-
factorily.
Medium-term Investment Priorities
1518      Due to past shortages of capital and maintenance funds, India's
transport system is faced with deficiencies in all modes, the removal of
which would require massive expenditure increases which are clearly beyond
the country's available resources. Thus, transport planners will continue to
confront hard choices in the medium term with respect to the allocation of
funds between subsectors. Given limited resources, the thrust of the
medium-term investment program should be an enhancement of capacity through
greater operational efficiency of assets by means of investment in key areas
such as rehabilitation and maintenance of assets and completion of ongoing
projects with high economic returns in all subsectors, modernization of
assets, strengthening the information system for railways, modernization of
cargo handling facilities at ports, upgrading of various stretches of the
national highway network to relieve congestion and increased allocations for
road maintenance.
D. Transport Pricing and Taxation
1.19      General policy in India is tending toward the pricing of transport
services as closely to economic cost as possible, which when fully imple-
mented would permit a more efficient utilization of assets, higher cost
recovery, and better allocation of resources. However, due to socio-economic
pressures, some specific services such as movement of urban passengers by
rail and road, haulage of coal, foodgrains, and fertilizers by rail, and



-9-
provision of some port services considered of social interest are being
subsidized. Apart from pressures to justify subsidies, economic cost-based
pricing has also been difficult to implement because it has to be based on
very detailed cost information.
1.20      Transport pricing in India, particularly for railway services, has
shown significant improvement in recent years as a result of the partial
implementation of various recommendations of the NTPC and of the Rail Tariff
Enquiry Committee. Nevertheless, there is scope for further improvements,
particularly in pricing public road passenger transport and railway passenger
services.  The establishment of the TCC (see para 1.11) wilL be an important
step toward improving transport pricing.  Road user charges will have to be
reviewed to ensure that they reflect appropriately the costs of developing
and maintaining the road system to a suitable degree. As part of this
project (see para 3.11) the COI will carry out a study entitled "Road Vehicle
Fleet and Road User Charges."
E. Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.21      The Bank's involvement in India's transport sector dates back to
1949 and has resulted in eight loans and ten credits for Indian Railways
totalling over US$1.8 billion, four loans and two credits to the ports and
shipping subsectors (five port projects and one shipping project) totalling
US$410 million, and two lending operations in the roads subsector (one rural
roads project and one highway project) totalling US$95 million.
1.22      While Bank's invoolvement with IR has been almost continuous since
1949, lending to the ports and road subsectors was discontinued between 1962
and 1980 mainly due to GOI's preference for local competitive bidding. This
situation has changed with the approval of the Nhava Sheva Port Project in
1984. The proposed project would be the Bank's first operation in the
national highways system since 1962 and, meanwhile, a rural roads project in
Gujarat with ICB elements has been appraised.
1.23      The objectives underlying the Bank Group's past assistance in the
sector have been to assist in rehabilitation and modernization of infrastruc-
ture and in improving operating efficiency, maintenance, administration, and
planning. Through the Bank's continuous participation in railways, many of
the objectives in that subsector have been accomplished.
1.24      Since the involvement in other subsectors has been more limited,
accomplishments in terms of improvements in the policy framework has been
less important but by no means insignificant.  In the case of ports, the main
objectives are the introduction of modern technology, in terms of both design
concepts and equipment, for the efficient handling of cargo, improvement in
port operations and management through staff training programs, and better
integration with other modes of transport through hinterland development.

(at the Central and State levels), strengthening the local construction
industry, introducing new concepts in road and vehicle design and project
evaluation, and enhancing the quality of staff through training.
II. THE ROADS SECTOR
A.  The Network
2.01      Roads in India are divided into three categories on a functional
basis: (a) the primary system consisting of national highways; (b) the
secondary system consisting of state highways and major district roads, and
(c) the tertiary system, namely the rural roads consisting of other district
roads and village roads. In addition, there are so-called project roads,
administered by various technical departments, as well as urban roads.
National highways are under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, which
meets the entire expenditure of construction, maintenance, and improvement.
All other roads are essentially the responsibility of state authorities,
although construction and maintenance of district and village roads are
generally delegated to local bodies and rural communities in the States.
2.02      The national highways are the main highways in the country connect-
ing major ports, adjoining countries, and linking States' capitals and
include strategic roads required for national security. The State highways
are the main trunk roads of the States (other than national highways) con-
necting important cities and districts with national highways or highways
of adjacent States. District roads traverse each district, serve areas of
production and markets, and connect districts with highways or railways.
Village roads connect villages and groups of villages to the nearest district
road, main highway, or railway. The road length in India by categories for
1980/81 is shown below.

-11-
2.03      The road network length has experienced an almost four-fold expan-
sion since 1950/51. The road length increased from 0.4 million kms in
1950/51 to 1.5 million in 1980/81, growing at an average annual rate of 4.5%.
The growth of surfaced roads was 5.1% per annum during the same period. The
fast growth in the network has been achieved because of the emphasis given to
linking villages with main highways or railways. Under the Minimum Needs
Program (MNP) the Government fixed the following targets by 1990 for develop-
ment of rural roads: (a) all villages with a population of 1,500 and above
should be served by all-weather roads; and (b) 50% of the villages with a
population of 1,000-1,500 are to be connected by all weather roads. This
program is being adequately implemented and at the present time, 70% of all
villages with a population of 1,500 or more and 49% of all villages with a
population of 1,000-1,500 are served by all weather roads. This policy is
well conceived, since about 75% of India's population is rural. India's
density of roads, which stood at 0.46 km. per sq. km. in 1980/81, compares
favorably with densities in other less-developed countries. Nonetheless, due
to the fact that India has a high population density scattered throughout the
country, road transport requirements are considerable and call for further
expansion and strengthening of the road network.
B. Road Transportation Demand
2.04      A uniform set of consistent road freight traffic figures is not
available. Various committees or working groups, which have studied road
transport, have provided their own traffic estimates and figures vary con-
siderably. The lack of an adequate database on freight traffic is due to the
following factors: (a) the road freight transport industry mostly comprises
single-owner operators of trucks who do not keep records and are generally
reluctant to provide information; (b) information available on the number of
commercial vehicles using the road system is not reliable; and
(c) information on motor vehicle registration is not up to date. Freight
traffic is estimated by two methods: the first method uses data on truck
population multiplied by an assumed annual utilization and average pay load
to arrive at total ton-kms moved; the second method uses information on
diesel and petrol consumption in the road subsector and applies coefficients,
which indicate the number of ton-kms that can be achieved with one liter of
diesel or petrol to obtain total ton-kms. These coefficients are based on
the results of the "Road User Cost Study" (RUCS) undertaken by MOST in 1982
and sponsored by the World Bank. Neither of these methods is fully satisfac-
tory because they do not take into consideration fluctuations in the general
level of economic activity, which can affect transport demand significantly
or cause changes in vehicle utilization and/or load factors.
2.05      The following table shows the most recent estimates of road freight
traffic:

1980/81                133.9                       87.5
/a These figures are based on the application of recent results
of RUCS, undertaken by MOST to fuel consumption statistics
provided by the Ministry of Petroleum.
/b These figures are obtained by estimating the truck population
and applying an assumed annual utilization (in kms) and an
average pay load (in tons).
The estimates of the Working Group on Roads for the Seventh Plan are about
45% higher than the NTPC estimates. The annual compounded growth rate for
the data of the working group is 5.4% while that for NTPC is 3.6%. These
growth rates are higher than growth rates experienced by railway freight
traffic during the same period (2.1%) and provide supporting evidence to the
claim that an increasing share of total traffic in India is being moved on
the roads. This would be especially true of the national highway system
where, because of the distances involved, the rail/road competition is more
likely to occur (see para 2.07).
2.06      Data on passenger traffic carried by road transport is more reli-
able since nearly 60% of the public transport services are operated by public
sector undertakings and data on tickets sold, schedule of buses, load fac-
tors, and others are available. Passenger movements on the road network
(including buses, cars, and other motorized vehicles) are estimated at 480
billion passenger km. in 1980/81, with a growth rate of about 6% per annum.
2.07      Traffic growth on the national highway system is higher than on
the total road network. Census data analysis has shown that traffic on the
national highways has been growing rapidly over the past five years
(1979-1984), with growth rates varying between 8% and 20% annually.



-13-
2.08      Traffic on Indian roads comprises both fast and slow-moving
vehicles with virtually no segregation of the two, except on a few cases.
The presence of such a traffic mix increases vehicle operating costs because
it reduces traffic speeds and constrains its flow, it increases the number
and severity of road accidents, it increases wear and tear on vehicles, and
causes higher consumption of fuel and lubricants. Mixed traffic aLso reduces
road capacity and thus necessitates earlier expansion works. Another dis-
tinctive feature of traffic on Indian roads is the large proportion (about
70%) of trucks in total motorized traffic. The present traffic mix on Indian
highways, the high proportion of trucks coupled with significant volumes of
slow moving traffic, are the main factors causing road congestion and early
saturation of capacity.
2.09      Adequate information on traffic carried by road transport is essen-
tial to plan the development of the road network, to estimate the require-
ments of fuel oil for the sector, and to plan for the manufacture of road
vehicles. MOST is aware of current deficiencies in gathering and processing
transport demand data and is implementing steps to improve the database. For
example, it is currently starting the computerization of data on traffic
counts that have been made periodically during the past 20 years in more than
500 counting stations throughout the national road network. Highway planning
improvements to be implemented in the context )f this project (see para 2.17)
will include a review by MOST and the Bank of current methodologies usdci in
estimating aggregate road transport demand aimed at streamlining the process
and improving the database. MOST is about to start relevant surveys
throughout the country and to undertake further traffic counts to complement
the information.
C. Motor Vehicle Fleet and Industry
2.10      Motor vehicle registration statistics in India indicate that there
are at present 4.1 million registered vehicles, 11% of which are trucks, 3.1%
buses, and 24% cars.  The fleet has grown at 10.0% per annum since 1973 with
trucks growing at 5.1%, cars at 3.9%, and buses at 4.9%. Two and three
wheelers have been the fastest growing segment of the fleet (14.1% per
annum). The table below shows total registered motor vehicles in India:

tions from over a hundred foreign manufacturers, until recently most basic
designs and technology were acquired 20 to 40 years ago. Production of major
types of vehicles is shown in the following table.

2.12      Since 1982 India has undertaken a major program of updating vehicle
technology to increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles and to meet a growing,
unmet demand for reasonably priced vehicles of acceptable quality. For that
purpose, GOI has authorized technical and financial collaborations with
foreign automotive firms, especially from Japan. GOI also has licensed
substantial capacity additions to enable manufacturers of all types of
vehicles to modernize and expand. As a result, competition at all levels is
expected to be strong, which should serve as a potent catalyst for Indian
vehicle industry to improve productivity and quality.
2.13      With 90,000 units produced in 1982, India was the twelfth largest
producer of commercial vehicles in the world and the third largest in Asia
after Japan and Australia. Half of Indian commercial vehicles are trucks in
the medium to heavy range (above 3 metric tons payload) with the bulk of the
production in the medium duty range (7-1/2 to 8-1/2 metric tons) and with an
insignificant number of heavy units. Two manufacturers account for the major
share of truck production: Tata Engineering (70%) and Ashok Leyland (20%).
Both companies have improved chassis and engine designs over the years, but
the insulated domestic market conditions, which prevailed until recentLy, in
India did not require the same levels of technical achievements as in western
markets and Japan. Along with the new Japanese entries in light commercial
vehicle manufacturing by Nissan, Toyota, and Suzuki, Government recently
approved the collaboration of Isuzu with Hindustan Motors Ltd., India's third
largest manufactturer of medium and heavy commercial vehicles.  These moves
should improve the quaLity and mix of the vehicle fleet.
2.14      The Bank is supportive of current Government policies designed to
encourage modernization and expansion of the automotive fleet, but considers
that further efforts may be required with the objective of defining the
optimum mix for the country. Therefore, in the context of this project, the
Government will undertake a study of the Road Vehicle Fleet and Road User
Charges (refer to Annex D for more details.)
D. Highway Planning
2.15      The Roads Wing of MOST is primarily responsible for roads and
highway planning in India. The Roads Wing is directly responsible for plan-
ning the development of the national highway system while its role is a more
advisory one in the case of State highways and other minor roads.  The Roads
Wing performs everyday planning of the national highway system, assists the
Planning Commission in the preparation of its Annual and Five-Year Plans, and
in addition prepares long-term road development plans. The Roads Wing is
currently preparing the perspective road development plan extending to the
year 2001. The draft "Road Development Plan for India 1981-2001" was pub-
lished in April 1984 and has been distributed to various Government agencies
for comments. This is a road master plan which establishes national invest-
ment priorities in the subsector.  A perspective road development plan, known
as the Nagpur Plan, was first prepared by the Chief Engineers of the States



-16-
in 1943. In 1961 the "Bombay Plan" was prepared to set guidelines for road
development in India through the year 1981. Thus, the current road develop-
ment plan will be the third of its kind in India.
2.16      Highway planning in India, although improving, is still at an earLy
stage due to: (a) lack of an adequate database; (b) inadequate planning
techniques; (c) slow introduction of modern equipment for monitoring road
conditions and usage; and (d) lack of staff adequately trained in economic
analysis. MOST is committed to improving highway planning and has already
undertaken various important steps, including: (a) computerizing traffic
data; (b) contracting the preparation of a computerized management informa-
tion system to be located in the Roads Wing and which will facilitate the
task of administering the nationa' highway system; (c) assigning the CentraL
Road Research Institute (C.R,R.I.) the task of carrying out an inventory of
the conditions of the nationai highway system using modern vehicle-mounted
instruments (the work which started in August 1984 is expected to be com-
pleted in one year); (d) preparing a computer program to provide economic
evaluations of highway investments; (e) preparing a manual for highway plan-
ning to be used in the field; and (f) retaining consultants to prepare four
regional transport modelling studies to be used in the assessment of future
transport demand on the trunk route system of each region. Some of these
improvements resulted from the discussions bet-ween MOST officials and Bank
staff during project preparation and during preparation of RUCS.
2.17      Although some highway planning improvements have already been
achieved, the planning function needs to be institutionalized. Therefore,
at negotiations, GOI confirmed that the Highway Planning Group (HPG) has been
constituted within the Roads Wing of MOST, and it has been provided Terms of
Reference and an Organization Chart (see Annex F) acceptable to the Bank.
Also, GOI indicated that the methodology for economic evaluation of road
investment program that is being used and developed in MOST is now being
recommended to all State Public Works Departments for use by them in evaluat-
ing all state road investments, including those national highway investments
that must be submitted to MOST for approval. The training component of the
proposed project, which includes courses in highway planning and economic
analysis of projects, will also contribute to an improvement in this area.
E. Road Safety
2e18      The standard of road safety on Indian roads is poor and has
deteriorated st:eadily. In 1980 there were 147,651 accidents which caused
24,095 deaths and injured 113,670 people. Road safety was recently reviewed
by the Government Committee on Planning Road Safety, which analyzed the
causes contributing to the high accident rate and issued a report in March
1983 which included various measures to improve the situation. Some of the
major recommendations pertain to driver training and licensing, stricter
enforcement of traffic regulations, adoption of engineering-related measures
to improve the condition of the roads, and periodic inspection of vehicles.



-17-
Pilot schemes are already commencing in some 45 posts to institute such
innovations as highway patrols, first-aid facilities, driver training
schools, and the proposed project will provide material support to these
efforts (see para 3.10).
F. Training
2.19      A large number of Engineering Colleges and Institutes in India
provide the road sector with qualified engineering graduates.  The schoois
offer a good overall engineering education but curricula do not lay stress on
computer training, highway planning, and economic anaLysis of projects.
Graduate courses are also being offered on various aspects of highway and
traffic engineering.
2.20      The GOI has recently set up a Highway Training Institute at
Chandigarh to train highway engineers from the whole country. This institute
will provide foundation training courses for fresh entrants and will also
conduct refresher ccurses for in-service engineers of the Roads Wing and
State Agencies. In addition to receiving education in domestic institutions,
highways engineers also receive training abroad. In the past, many highway
engineers working in Central and State agencies have benefitted from foreign
training through UNDP sponsored programs. The Bank has been asked to include
a technical assistance component under the project to cover a portion of
highway subsector training requirements and laboratory equipment duLring the
period 1985-1990 (see para 3.12).
C. The National Highways System
Network
2.21      The national highways constitute the primary network of the country
with about 32,000 km of road length (2.1%) and an estimated 30% of total road
traffic. The network has expanded slowly adding only about 10,000 km in the
period 1950-1980. The system is operating under difficulty since there are
many deficiencies such as missing road links and bridges, substandard pave-
ments, over-congested sections, single lane roads, and weak and narrow
bridges and culverts. In addition, maintenance funds have been limited.
During the formulation of the 1980-85 Plan, an exercise was undertaken to
identify the deficiencies in the national highway system. It revealed that:
(a) almost the entire length of the system is deficient in pavement thick-
ness; (b) about 7,000 km (over one-fifth of the system) are still single lane
and need to be widened; (c) about 220 major bridges, over 2,000 minor
bridges, 240 by-passes, and innumerable culverts need to be constructed;
(d) about 2,000 kms of heavily trafficked sections must be widened to four
lanes; and (e) about 2,400 kms declared as national highways since 1980 need
to be upgraded to national highway standards. Correction of these deficien-
cies is estimated to cost Rs 45 biLlion in 1983/84 prices. Such a large
investment can obviously be made only over a long period. Accordingly, in
the preparation of the Road Development Plan for 1981-2001, MOST has
estimated that a large proportion of capital works' expenditures during the
Seventh and Eighth Plans must be allocated for these purposes.



-18-
2.22       The national highways network is designed for standard single axle
load of 18,000 lbs. or 8.16 tons. This design standard was appropriate in
the past when the rear axle load of the conventional two-axled rigid body
trucks was generally limited to 8.2 tons. However, due to changes in vehicle.
technology and design which tacitly encouraged overloadirg, rear axle loads
in India are now substantially higher than 8.2 tons. Axle-load spectrum
studies done by MOST have recorded axle-loads up to 20 tons. The legal axLe
load limit until recently was 8.2 tons with a permitted overload of 25%.  GOI
h as revised the regulations and the new axle load limits are: (a) 6 tons for
single axle with two tires; (b) 10.2 tons for single axle with four tires;
and (c) 18 tons for tandem axle with eight tires.
2.23       Road pavements are now being designed on the basis of the number of
repetitions of the equivalent standard axle over the design life of the
pavement. This procedure takes account of the actual spectrum of axle loads
which are converted to numbers of standard axles. The pavements of the roads
to be constructed/rehabilitated under the proposed project were designed in
this manner.
kAdminist rat ion
2,24       National highways are a "Union" subject under the Constitution, and
their developmnent and maintenance are the responsibility of GOI as laid down
in the National Highways Act of 1956. Thereby the Roads Wing of MOST, whose
organization is shown in Chart 1, is responsible for the construction and
maintenance of the national highways in the entire country. The actual
execution of construction and maintenance work is done by the various State
and Central Public Works Departments (PWD) and the Border Road Development
Board, on an agency basis. Most of the administrative work is also done by
the State agencies. The States are paid agency charges which amount to about
9% of the cost of the work. The engineers in the Roads Wing examine the
projects prepared by the executive agencies and recommend their sanction by
the Government. The Roads Wing also coordinates matters pertaining to
research, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of standards and specifica-
tions. Road works are normally executed through local contractors although a
portion is done on force account by the respective PWDs.
2.25       In February 1982 GOI set up a "Committee on Agency System for
National Highways" with the objective of reviewing the procedures and opera-
tions by which MOST devolves its responsibilities for national roads to the
States. The Committee issued its report in 1983, identifying some major
shortcomings in project preparation and management, notably:
ka) inadequate site investigations and surveys in some projects,
resulting in incorrect design assumptions;



-19-
(b) ill-defined issues concerning land acquisition, leading to
unforeseen delays in implementation;
(c) lengthy, and apparently needless delays in bid evaluation
and contract award;
(d) delays in release of project funding;
(e) delays in project reporting, allowing problems to persist
unnecessarily;
(f) contractors without sufficient resources to execute works
efficiently; and
(g) delays in procuring materials.
Not all projects have suffered the problems detailed above, but enough
instances of each have occurred to be worthy of comment.
2.26     The Roads Wing of MOST has already acted to correct these
shortcomings. Concrete evidence of their efforts lies in the preparation
of the proposed project. MOST has ensured that all the reasonable alterna-
tives for each of the main components have been thoroughly explored.
Detailed site investigations have been made supporting each alternative so
that economic analyses are based on well-founded costs. Land acquisition
procedures have been simplified by a recently amended (September 1984) BilL
(Act No. 68 of 1984). Problems associated with weak contractors and with bid
evaluations should be minimized by rigorous prequalification of contractors,
whereby only those of demonstrable capability and resources would be invited
to tender. The Roads Wing's actions to improve the other deficiencies noted
are dealt with more appropriately in other relevant sections of this report-
Financing
2.27      Capital and maintenance expenditures for the national highways
system are financed in full by the Central Government. Annual allocations
for capital expenditures are budgeted, taking into consideration the relevant
Five-Year Plan. Maintenance funds are also decided on an annual basis and,
being a non-plan expenditure, are subjected to a larger extent to overall
resource constraints (see para 2.30). With fixed establishments of labor
which must be paid, reduction in road maintenance allocations bear heavily on
the purchase of materials, without which labor is unable to work effectively.
Thus the effect of budget cuts may be quite disproportionate to their mag-
nitude. Improvements in highway planning contemplated in the project will
go a long way toward prioritizing investments and striking a balance in the
allocation of resources between capital and maintenance of assets.



-20-
2.28       The table below shows annual actual expenditures on capital works
and maintenance on national highways between 1970/71 and 1982/83. The

GOI is aware that past levels of expenditures in the national highways system
have been inadequate to allow for its appropriate expansion, making good its
deficiencies or for adequate maintenance. The Seventh Plan (1985-1990) is
expected to increase significantly the allocation of funds for national
highways. Also, new sources of revenue are being investigated and, specifi-
cally, the Government is studying the implications of establishing a toll
system in the country, a system that only exists today, and to a limited
extent, on major bridges. This is a matter which will be addressed in the
project (see para 3.11). It is worth noting that maintenance expenditures in
reaL terms increased, with respect to the previous year, by 11% in 1981-82
and by 19% in 1982-83.
2.29       Additional funding for national highways during the Seventh Plan is
essential for the proper development of the national network and for the
implementation of the proposed project. During negotiations, GOI informed the
Bank that official amounts allocated in the Seventh Plan were not available,
but GOI is aware of the sector needs and this should be reflected in the
Plan. Also, it was agreed that GOI will determine future national highway
investment allocations based on plans to be prepared by the Highway Planning
Group (see para 2.17) to adequately develop the national highway system in
India. Furthermore, provisions should be made to enable the Bank to review
from time to time future allocations. Tables 1 and 2 in Annex A provide
information on major ongoing road and bridge works in the national highway
system which show that although some of the works currently under execution



-21-
are sizeable, various components of the proposed project are significantly
larger. This is a positive recognition by GOI of the growing importance of
the road subsector and the pressing needs to upgrade and modernize road
construction in the country.
Maintenance
2.30      For years, past funds for road maintenance in India have been
allocated in accordance with norms developed by a technical group of MOST in
1968 and updated every year in accordance with the inflationary impact on
labor and materials. To develop the norms, the effect of traffic volume,
rainfall intensity, and local cost of materials were taken into account. For
national highways the norms in 1984 amounted to about 27,000 Rs per km for a
double lane road, which is considered to be a reasonable average amount to
cover both routine and periodic maintenance. In practice, however, the
norm-based funding has been qualified by the availability of resources, and
the actual allocations have been inadequate to properly maintain the national
highway system. The table below shows in million Rs the extent of the short-
fall year by year.
Amount required as         Actual                 Percentage

2.31      Now MOST is initiating procedures whereby funds will be allocated
according to need and, to this end, is arranging for condition surveys of all
national roads which are based on measurements of road surface roughness,
normally a good indicator of pavement condition.  With modern equipment such
as electronic "bump integrators", which are towed behind the test vehicles,
condition surveys can be carried out rapidly, and once the State organiza-
tions are suitably equipped, surveys will be done annually, which coupled
with visual inspection, will provide MOST with a powerful tool for monitoring
the condition of its investment on a common data base. In addition, MOST is
sponsoring through CRRI, a Highway Design and Maintenance Study, to provide a
model relating maintenance needs to such variables as pavement specifications
and age, traffic loads, and climatic conditions of the area. The results of
this study should help materially in providing more rational grounds for
allocating road maintenance funds and complement the condition surveys
referred to above.



-22-
2.32      The issue of funds to cover emergency repairs (generally arising
from flooding) was even more arbitrary, as it was done as a flat 12-1/2% of
'"norml" allocation irrespective of the severity of damage. Now emergency
funds are separated from the maintenance allocations and are issued according
to need. Another progressive step being considered is to include road main-
tenance funding as a specific item in the Seventh Plan (until now it has been
a non-Plan activity). This change in status would put maintenance on an
equal footing with investment funding and would imply the same level of
monitoring and supervision that construction activities financed from the
Plan are assured.
2.33      The Bank is actively supporting MOST's efforts to improve its
effectiveness in maintaining the national road network by providing funding
for the purchase of the latest equipment to assist in measuring road condi-
tion (see para 3.09). The initial surveys should be completed in the six
project states by early 1987. During negotiations, COI confirmed that the
Government's objectives with respect to road maintenance funding continue to
be the provision of adequate maintenance funding, as of high priority, and
also that it would move from the present norms-based allocation of main-
tenance funds to the needs-based allocation system for the national highways
network by the completion date of the project. Every endeavor would be made
to generate sufficient funds to meet maintenance needs, including,
inter-alia, actions as a result of recommendations of the Road User Charges
and Vehicle Fleet Modernization Studies. These studies would be completed by
December 31, 1987 and, at that time the results and action plans would be
discussed with the Bank.
Engineering
2.34      Although retaining a supervisory and monitoring role, the Roads
Wing delegates the engineering and design of national highway projects to the
States' PWDs. In most cases, they carry out the needed studies and designs
in-house, but consultants are also often retained for the purpose. Bank
experience with the preparatory work for this proposed project is that the
engineering and design works have been carried out competently and in good
time. Geometric design standards in use throughout India are those prepared
and published as IRC:73-1980 by the Indian Roads Congress, a forum where
representatives of all the State's PWDs meet for discussion. These standards
are satisfactory (Annex I). Pavement design is based on the number of
repetitions of a standard 18,000 lb. (8,200 kg) axle loading to be sustained
over the design life selected and is formulated in line with procedures
similar to those of the UK Transport and Road Research Laboratory's Road Note
No. 31. Structures are designed in accordance with IRC:6-1966 "Standard
Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges." Both the foregoing
design procedures and loading specifications are acceptable and are in line
with procedures in common use elsewhere.



--23-
Construction
2.35       Road and bridge works in India are normally executed by contract.
Dealing with a country of many large rivers, the contractors engaged in
bridge construction are highly developed and capable of handling large
projects, some in the order of US$100 million. Most are private firms, but
some are enterprises of State Governments. Many have been successful in
securing contracts for major bridge works outside India. Normally, contrac-
tors bidding for bridge works are allowed to submit their own alternative
designs. In these situations many of the Larger contractors retain struc-
tural consultants of international repute who prepare designs in line with
the contractor's specialized construction techniques. In this way costs can
be minimized and yet India has the advantage of innovation and the latest
technology.
2.36       For road works there is not the same scale of contract size, most
projects being parcelled out in small lots. As a result, although there are
many small- to medium-size firms, larger enterprises have not developed
within India. Some large firms, however, operate successfully abroad. It is
expected that the larger contracts (about US$10 M) and contract packages
(about US$30 M) proposed under this project will encourage recourse to modern
methods of road construction entailing better equipment and management
policies and an exposure to competition from abroad. Government's annual
investment in roadworks is of the order of US$1 billion, which is being met
by the local industry.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Genesis and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.01       In late 1982, GOI, through the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA)
of the Ministry of Finance, formalized its interest in getting Bank Group
financing for a highway project in India, under the terms normally applied by
the Bank to this type of lending operations. The project, which is seen as
the first in a series in the subsector, will address key institutional con-
straints both in the Central Covernment (specifically in MOST) and in six
states; namely, Gujarat, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar
Pradesh. The key institution-building issues are the establishment of an
inter-modal planning and coordination capacity, the strengthening of a high-
way planning and construction capability, the introduction of modern highway
design and economic evaluation techniques both at the Central and State
Government levels, and the modernization of the road transport industry.



-24-
B. Sectoral Background
3.02      GOI and the Bank have a common long-run objective in the transport
sector - the need to liberalize it by means of deregulation, competition,
pricing, and users' freedom of modal choice so that resources can be allo-
cated most effectively. Without doubt, this is the most important message
conveyed by the NTPC report (see para 1.10), which, after its acceptance and
approval by GOI in March 1982, is considered to be official policy in this
matter. At the same time, this stated long-run objective is in line with the
Bank's policies in transport. The means by which the Bank may achieve these
policy objectives should be through a sequence of projects in each major
subsector: railways, ports, and highways. Each project should, inter alia,
address selected intra- as well as inter-modal issues.
3.03      Over the Last two decades, the Bank Group's participation in the
transport sector has been almost exclusively confined to the railway and port
subsectors (see para 1.21). The basic objectives underlying the Bank Group's
strategy in those subsectors have been to help in modernizing the infrastruc-
ture and the operating conditions, as well as in improving planning, pricing,
efficiency, maintenance, administration, and implementation capability in
each subsector. At the same time, the Bank Group's participation in the
highway subsector has been almost nil, which hampered, to a certain extent,
the effectiveness of Bank's intervention in some inter-modal issues, the
resolution of which is crucial to achieve the stated long-run objective.
3.04      With the proposed project, the Bank will now be actively involved
in all the major transport subsectors. Thus, there will now be an oppor-
tunity to focus more fully on those inter-modal issues. In highways, the
Bank should pursue a similar line of action to that followed in the other
transport subsectors; namely, to help in modernizing infrastructure, equip-
ment, and operating conditions, and in improving planning, pricing,
efficiency, maintenance, administration, and implementation capability.
3.05      This proposed highway project seeks to achieve some key examples of
modernizing infrastructure and improvements in operating conditions, highway
planning, pricing, and implementation capability. Moreover. to strengthen
our inter-modal dialogue with GOI, the proposed project includes the creation
of an inter-modal cell, TCC, within the Planning Commission, responsible for
facilitating and monitoring improvements in the transport sector, with the
purpose of achieving the long-run objectives in the transport sector,
described in para 3.02.
C. Objectives of the Proposed Project
3.06      During project preparation extensive discussions were held between
GOI and the Bank concerning the project objectives, and it was mutually
agreed that the main objectives of the project are:



-25-
(a) to foster institutional development by:
(i) introducing within MOST modern aspects of highway design with
particular relevance to India in controlled access toLl roads,
traffic segregation, road safety, and control of ribbon
developments;
(ii) strengthening the use of economic evaluation techniques for
the selection and ranking of road investment proposals;
(iii)  improving inter-modal coordination by supporting the estab-
lishment of a group within the Planning Commission, TCC, which
would deal with matters concerning general transport policy in
India;
(iv) through appropriate analyses, quantifying the significance
of the highway subsector in the economy by assessing the
economic benefits foregone by underinvestment (both capital
and recurrent) in infrastructure;
(v)  through studies to evaluate to what extent, consistent with
the capabilities of the road system, modern, heavier. more
fuel-efficient vehicles should be encouraged to ply the road
system of India, and to determine what legislative, fiscal,
and administrative changes are needed to support the most
appropriate solution for the country;
(vi) in the particular context of the Gujarat subproject, but with
the possibility of a wider application of the methodology, to
determine the level and collection system of tolls which
should be levied such that an unduly large portion of through
traffic is not diverted to the alternative toll-free facility
or to other means of transportation;
(vii)  through studies to establish an appropriate road-user charge
system from the viewpoints of economic efficiency, equity,
revenue generation, energy conservation, and administrative
simplicity in revenue collection;
(b) to develop further the capabilities of local contractors by their
exposure to foreign competition through the application of ICB
procurement, and to strict quality control of construction proce-
dures;
(c) to remove present traffic congestion through the construc-
tion/rehabilitation of selected links of the national highway
network; and



-26-
(d) to evaluate applicability in States of different administrative and
operational characteristics (see Annex B) of different alternatives
of engineering and operating conditions (expressway, by-pass,
systems for traffic segregation, toll systems).
3.D7      The foregoing project objectives seek to fulfill some of the high-
way longer-term objectives described in para 3.04 and 3.05 as follows:
1. modernizing infrastructure: (a)(i), (c), and (d);
2.  modernizing operating conditions: (a)(i), (v), (vi), and (d);
3.  highway planning: (a)(ii) and (iv);
4.  pricing: (a)(vii);
5.  implementation capability: (b); and
6.  intermodal coordination: (a)(iii).
The selected longer-term objectives are considered to be of utmost importance
for an adequate development of the highway system in India and were chosen
because they require a substantial number of innovative ideas which, although
not new to Indian professionals, might be difficult to apply in India without
the catalytic support of an international organization such as the Bank.
MOST officials share this view and consider that the Bank's intervention in
these matters is essential to achieve satisfactory results. Moreover, the
institution building aspects supported by the project would prepare the
ground to tackle in future projects objectives such as the preparation of a
road master plan for construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of the
network, improvement in the road administration, and in the overall
efficiency of the system.
D. Description
3.08      The project comprises (see Map Nos. IBRD 18769R and 18770R):
(a) construction/rehabilitation of the following sections of national
highways, which were selected not only by reason of their high
priority in the national plan, but also because each subproject
comprises a solution to a particular problem representative of
conditions found in many of India's roads:
(i) in the State of Gujarat, the construction of a new
dual-carriageway expressway of about 92 km, linking the cities
of Ahmedabad and Vadodara, in the main Delhi-Bombay corridor
of NH8;



-27-
(ii)  in the State of West Bengal, a new 65 km two-lane road, with
at-grade intersections and service roads, linking the centers
of Dankuni (about 20 km from Calcutta) and Palsit, in the main
Calcutta-Delhi corridor of NH2;
(iii)  in the State of Punjab, the provision of an additional
two-lane carriageway and the strengthening of the existing
two-lane carriageway of NHl for about 121 km between Sirhand
and Jullundur;
(iv)  in the State of Haryana, the provision of an additional
two-lane carriageway and the strengthening of the existing
two-lane carriageway of NHl for about 80 km between Murthal
and Karnal;
(v)  in the State of Tamil Nadu, the provision of an additional
two-lane carriageway and the strengthening of the existing
two-lane carriageway of NH45 for about 40 km between km 27
and 67 from Madras city toward Dindigul, and from 67 km to
160, the strengthening of the existing two-lane carriageway
and the provision of strengthened, paved shoulders 2.5 m wide
with an additional 0.5 m gravel support to accommodate
slow-moving traffic; and
(vi)  in the State of Uttar Pradesh on NH2, a 30 km two-lane bypass
of the city of Varanasi, including a major bridge over the
Ganges River;
(b) the procurement of specialized imported equipment to assist MOST
and the participating States in monitoring road condition and
usage, to facilitate bridge inspections and to provide equipment
for vehicle testing stations;
(c) technical assistance and training for professionals in
central/state highway organizations to keep them current with
modern practices developed abroad; and
(d) studies by both consultants and GOI research groups to establish:
(i) the desirable extent and direction of modernization of India's
vehicle fleet; and
(ii) desirable levels of road user charges.
Given the innovative character in India of some of the proposed physical
improvements, their operational management (traffic segregation, toll system,
prevention of ribbon development, controlled access) was discussed and agreed
at negotiations. More information concerning sections referred to in (a)
above can be found in Annex C. Items (b) through (d) are covered in the
following paragraphs.



-28-
Equipment
3.09      In line with MOST's intentions to rationalize budget allocations
for road maintenance and to apportion funds according to need, an objective
means of determining road condition is an urgent requirement. Using road
roughness as a surrogate for condition, or for need of repair, MOST has
decided on the use of roughness measuring devices or "bump integrators" as a
rapid means of classifying roads into different levels of budget requirement.
Consequently, such electronic devices not manufactured in India will be
purchased under the project. Further, to assist MOST with more detailed
evaluation of pavements and structures for research, planning, and design
purposes, some specific items of equipment, not available in India, are
provided for under the project. These items are detailed in Annex L and
would, in the first instance, be under the control of the CRRI. Other items
will be purchased to promote road safety (para 3.10 below).
3.10      As mentioned earlier (see para 2.18), GOI commissioned the prepara-
tion of a report dealing with road safety. This report was comprehensive in
scope and identified the main problem areas where deficiencies were placing
road users at hazard. One facet of MOST's strategy stemming from the report
is to ensure that vehicles using the network are in road-worthy condition.
As a means of achieving this objective, MOST intends equipping testing sta-
tions to check the condition of trucks, buses and cars, and equipment needed
Lor some of the testing stations in the project states, but presently
unavailable in India, will be purchased under the project.  Facilities for
driver training will also be provided.  However, this is the tip of the
Iceberg and, while MOST is also setting up highway patrols and first aid
posts, they are also now preparing action plans to implement the other main
report recommendations (see para 3.25).
Studies
3.11      With the purpose of establishing an adequate framework to support
technological and operational improvements to the vehicle fleet, the proposed
project provides for two studies: (a) vehicle fleet modernization, which aims
to evaluate to what extent, consistent with the capabilities of the road
system, larger, heavier, and more fuel-efficient vehicles than the two-axle
vehicles predominantly in use now, should be permitted to use the interurban
roads in India and to determine the desirable legislative, fiscal, and
administrative changes needed to promote their use, and to recoup from them
the economic cost which their use of the road network incurs; and (b)
improvements to the road user charge system, with the objective of determin-
ing whether the taxation system could better reconcile the multiple aims of
economic efficiency, equity, revenue generation, energy conservation, and
administrative simplicity in revenue collection. In this connection, this



-29-
study should ensure that the form in which taxes are specified and the
administrative mechanisms by which they are collected do not materially
misdirect the decisions of transport users and Government agencies in the
allocation of scarce resources. This study will specifically analyze the
overall consequences of establishing a toll system in the country. Terms of
reference for both studies are shown in Annex D. At negotiations, the terms
of reference, timing, and conditions for the implementation of the studies
were discussed and agreed. Also, that the Vehicle Fleet Modernization Study
will be finished by December 31, 1986 and the Road User Charges study by
December 31, 1987, and that the results will be provided to the Bank for
comments.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.12      GOI has a demonstrable commitment to the continuing training of
its professional personnel (paras 2.19 and 2.20). In addition to "in-house"
training schemes provided at Chandigarh, over past years the UNDP has funded
courses abroad for MOST staff. However, GOI has asked the Bank's assistance
in funding a comprehensive five-year (1985-90) program of courses and study
visits with overseas highway administrations, universities, etc. for MOST
professionals. This exposure is designed to bring the Indian engineer into
direct contact with modern developments in highway administrations, design,
construction, supervision, and maintenance. Details of the program are
provided in Annex M, and during negotiations it was discussed and agreed.
Engineering
3.13      Final engineering of the project alternatives defined by the
feasibility studies was carried out, in most cases, by consultants appointed
by the State Governments acting as executing agents for MOST, Roads Wing. In
only a few cases did the States Works Department prepare the final designs
themselves. In all cases the work has been prepared with competence. The
design standards to which the subprojects will be built are detailed in
Annex I and are satisfactory. In the case of the controlled access freeway
in Gujarat, the Bank arranged for a consultant from the California Department
of Transportation, who is an expert in the design and construction of such
facilities, to visit MOST in Delhi and the design group in Gujarat to discuss
their detailed proposals in the light of the extensive experience gained in
the State of California. As a result, a valuable contribution to the design
of this subproject has been made.

3,15       For all the civil works components, construction cost estimates are
based on quantities from the final engineering designs coupled with March
1985 unit rates derived from cost factor inputs and from recent and current
construction contracts. The cost estimate for the bridge at Varanasi is
derived from the costs of the many similar structures built elsewhere in
India, escalated to March 1985 prices.
3.16       The costs of equipment are based on current manufacturers' prices
including c.i.f. charges. The estimates of training courses are based on
information obtained from the UNDP, which has previously financed similar
assistance to India. Cost estimates of consulting services are based on the
man-months needed and the rates applicable at end-1984.



-31-
3.17      Price escalation of the foreign exchange and Local components has
been calculated, based on Bank's estimates, as follows:
Fiscal Year:                   1986    1987    1988    1989    1990
Local Escalation  (%)          8.5      8.5      8.5     8.5      8.5
Foreign Escalation (%)         9.0      9        9       7.5      6.0
A 10% physical contingency has been included to allow for unforeseen
increases in quantities.
3.18      The direct and indirect foreign exchange component of the civil
works element of the project has been estimated at 31%, based on the assump-
tions that India remains a net importer of cement, steel, bitumen, and oil
products and that some of the more complex works may be executed by foreign
contractors. During loan negotiations, the project cost estimates were dis-
cussed and agreed with the Government.
Financing
3.19      The Borrower would be the Government of India.  The proposed
financing plan is summarized as follows (for further information, see
Annex K):
 -----------(Us$   '000)

Foreign                     124,048.2          -         124,048.2
Local (excl. taxes)          75,990.0      200,038.2    276,028.2

Total Project               200,038.2      224,748.2    424,786.4
The proposed Bank loan of US$200.0 m would finance about 50% of total project
costs net of taxes, which would cover all the project's foreign costs and 25%
of local costs. Government of India would meet the balance of project costs
(US$224.8 m). It should be noted from a comparison of Annex B, Table 6 with
Annex K, Table 1 that almost without exception the total investments made
annually by each of the participating states is less than the annual invest-
ment that implementation of this project would require - a strong indicator
of India's resolve to modernize the subsector. During loan negotiations, GOI
agreed to furnish the local funding for the project promptly as needed.
Land Acquisition
3.20      GOI has power clearly defined by statute (revised in October 1984)
to expropriate land needed for roads.  In the case of unimproved land,



-32-
authority to enter can be given with minimal delay. When improvements are
involved, procedures can take longer but, in general, authority to enter on
the land is given, even if the amount of compensation to be paid has not been
decided.  Land acquisition is not seen to be a factor which could delay
project implementation. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with
GOI on their proposed timing for acquired possession of the lands needed for
the project roads such that construction works would not be impeded.  Also,
it was agreed that no withdrawal will be made in respect of individual con-
tracts of the proposed project unless the State concerned shall have taken
possession of the land required for purposes of carrying out that individuaL
contract.
Procurement
3.21      Procurement arrangements for the project components are illustrated
in Annex K, Table 2 and is summarized below:

NOTE:  Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank.
3.22      Civil works contracts will be awarded after international competi-
tive bidding among prequalified contractors in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement." Individual contracts will, as far as is prac-
ticable, be in the order of US$10 million, and minimum packages of three
contiguous contracts will be tendered simultaneously so that both local and
foreign contractors may be encouraged to compete. Contractors may bid on one
or more contracts up to the limit of their prequalification, and awards wiLl
be made after an evaluation which demonstrates the arrangement of contracts
most advantageous to Government. However, to take account of some contracts
which cannot reasonably be grouped with others, provision is made for their
procurement on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in



-33-
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. They could amount to
about 5-6% only of the value of the civil works component. During nego-
tiations, the size and grouping of contracts in each subproject was discussed
and agreed. Some of the specialized equipment needed to monitor road condi-
tions will be purchased directly from the single known manufac-
turers/suppliers, while the equipment needed for the vehicle testing stations
and for bridge inspections will be procured by ICB.
3.23      All contracts for civil works, consultant services, and equipment
financed by the Bank would be subject to prior review by the Bank before
award. A domestic preference of 7 1/2% for domestic contractors would be
given in respect of civil works contracts, and for procurement of equipment
a domestic preference of 15%, or the import duty, whichever is Less, would be
applied to bids of local manufacturers in bid evaluation.
Project Execution and Supervision
3.24      MOST would have overall responsibility for project implementation
(see Chart 2) although execution would, as is normal practice, be delegated
to each State's roads organization on an agency basis. Each participating
state would arrange for the formation of a supervisory unit for which the
establishment of personnel - engineers, technicians, and support staff -
equipment, laboratory facilities, vehicles, etc. is determined throughout the
country in accordance with the magnitude of the works. In addition to the
supervision and quality control exercised over construction operations by the
group constituted as described, GOI, quite independently, has a further check
on quality of work through a Vigilance Committee, which carries out spot
checks on major works to ensure that standards are being impartially main-
tained. Nevertheless, as this will be the first project in national highways
for nearly 25 years, and some of the subprojects are quite innovative and to
some extent experimental in their application, a more intensive supervision
presence from MOST in New Delhi would be desirable. During negotiations,
arrangements made in each state concerning organization, equipment, and
available staff from State/MOST for project supervision were discussed and
agreed. Also, MOST is prepared to retain the services of specialist consult-
ants (about 60 man-months) to assist if needed in executing the more novel
aspects of some of the subprojects and in the carrying out of the studies.
3.25      The Road User Charges Study will be undertaken by GOI in conformity
with terms of reference agreed between GOI and the Bank (Annex D). The Road
Safety Program, based on an already completed study by GOI, will Ecomprise
action plans prepared by MOST, which will be sent for Bank's comments and
suggestions by December 31, 1985.



-34-
Disbursement
3.26       Disbursements from the proceeds of the loan would be made on the
following basis:
- 46% of total expenditures (net of taxes) for civil works;
- 100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost) for equipment; and
- 100% of foreign costs for training and consultant services
During negotiations, a schedule of estimated disbursements (Annex N) was
discussed and agreed. In summary it is as follows:
Fiscal Year:               1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992
Cumulative Disb. US$106   8.0   39.4   96.8  148.0  168.9  189.8  200.0
The average period of disbursement for projects in India is about seven
years, upon which the above profile is based.  However, discounting the
Bank's first loan in highways, which was made almost twenty five years ago,
this project is the first in the subsector in recent times. Unfortunately,
there are no projects in the package for which the disbursement profile has
been prepared with which a comparison can be drawn. Therefore, given that
preparation work has been thorough, the procurement timetable is in hand and
being followed, and that international contractors are expected to bring
fresh expertise and a cash-consciousness to complete contracts in good time,
a disbursement period of five years is felt to be attainable.
Accounts
3.27       India has long established procedures for financial control, which
are well known to the Bank. Project audit is carried out under the supervi-
sion of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, who reports to Parlia-
ment through the Public Accounts Committee. During loan negotiations, GOI
agreed to keep separate accounts for the project and to submit financial
reports to the Bank not later than six months after the close of each year of
project implementation.
Environmental Impact
3.28      The civil works proposed under the project may impinge adversely
on the environment during the construction phase - interruptions to traffic,
congestion, noise, and dust will undoubtedly result. However, the completed
works will have a positive impact in that smooth road surfaces, improved
ca?acity will result in shorter journey times, less congestion and noise, and
a general enhancement of the environment.



-35-
Project Reporting
3.29      MOST will be responsible for preparing quarterly progress reports
on the proposed project and on the operation and management of its
facilities. The reports shall indicate progress made and problems
encountered during the quarter under review, steps taken or proposed to be
taken to remedy these problems, and proposed future programs of activities.
About six months after physical completion of the project, MOST should
present to the Bank a Project Completion Report including its cost, general
characteristics of its execution, and the accomplishment of the purposes of
the proposed project. During negotiations, agreement was reached concerning
the format and content of the reports.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      Road transport plays an important role in the economy of India
(para 1.05). The proposed project aims at relieving congestion and prevent-
ing further deterioration of vital sections of the national highway system,
which in its entirety although representing only about 2.1% of the total road
network length in the country, carries an estimated 30% of the total road
traffic. Currently, the proposed project components represent serious con-
straints to achieving efficient operations on the national system, with
subsequent unjustified increases in transport costs.
4.02      Most of the quantified benefits will accrue in terms of reduction
in vehicle operating costs, passenger travel time, and road maintenance
costs. When the projects are implemented, significant savings will result in
fuel consumption, tire wear, vehicle maintenance and depreciation, and time-
and road maintenance-related costs. Also, in some cases future road recon-
struction costs will be delayed. In addition, the proposed project is
expected to yield significant institutional benefits in terms of improved
inter-modal coordination, highway planning, and execution capacity, improve-
ment in road safety, modernization of the road and road industry subsectors,
improved road work quality, and further development of domestic road contrac-
tor capabilities.
4.03      The proposed project will provide direct benefit to all road users
in terms of reduced transport costs. In the case of transportation of goods,
practically 100% of trucks are privately owned and run by a large number of
small transport companies, and there is an adequate number of trucks to
satisfy the demand. Therefore, the market is highly competitive, and thus
it is expected that the benefits of the project, which initially accrue
practically in their entirety to road users, will be passed on to the economy



-36-
in general. In those cases where road users are carriers on their own
account, reduced transport and time-related costs will also be passed on to
the economy in terms of reduced production and distribution costs and, there-
fore, prices in the market place. For passenger transport, because rates are
currently fixed by Government, the vehicle operating cost savings will accrue
at first to the bus owners, both public and private. However, in the long
run, lower and middle income groups should benefit when rate increases might
be deferred because of reductions in transport cost. Passenger time savings
will obviously accrue immediately to them.
B. Economic Evaluation
4.04      The state and characteristics of the existing sections which are to
be improved are described in Annex C, and Table 1 in Annex C shows the traf-
fic volumes as of 1984 and indicates the estimated annual traffic growth
rates. The sources of traffic data were: (a) special traffic counts carried
out as part of project preparation; (b) routine traffic counts, which are
taken every six months; (c) results of some permanent count stations; and
(d) origin-destination surveys, in cases where another alignment was studied
as an alternative of the existing road. Each section has been subdivided
into links with reasonably constant traffic volumes, which are also presented
in Annex G, Table 1. For the purpose of the economic analysis, those links
were further subdivided, where necessary, to take into account differences in
terrain, geometric characteristics, and engineering conditions.
4.05      The annual traffic growth rates are based in order of importance on:
(a) results of regression analysis between truck (which represents
70-80% of traffic voLume in all sections) and GDP annual growth
rates in the last decade for each of the six states covered by the
proposed project;
(b) estimates of future economic development in each state and in the
influence zone of the analyzed section; and
(c) recent trends in traffic volumes.
The projected traffic volumes for all sections included in the proposed
project represent the expected growth of normal traffic. Therefore, the
rates of return, estimated conservatively, do not incorporate the benefits
that would result from traffic generation effects of the proposed project.
4.06      The resulting annual traffic growth rates vary from 8% to 14% up
to 1990, tapering to 7% to 10% thereafter. The higher rates until 1990
reflect the recent changes in GOI policies (para 1.05) to favor the develop-
ment of all modes of transport, a climate in which road transport development
is being given a substantial thrust. In the 1980's, it is expected that
Indian Railways will increasingly become a bulk carrier with a growing volume



-37-
of common goods being carried by road. Subsequently, it has conservatively
been assumed that at the end of the decade, road traffic growth would stabi-
lize, as a result of a general maturation of the influence zone of each
project, and the achievement of an adequate split between road and rail
traffic.
4.07      Economic evaluation has been undertaken separately for the main
subcomponents, which comprise six national highway improvements in six dif-
ferent states. No separate economic evaluation has been carried out for the
other subcomponents (research and vehicle testing equipment, training, and
consultant services), all of which amount to 2% of total project costs.
However, these costs were included without quantifying their benefits in the
calculation of ERR for the entire project.
4.08      The economic capital and maintenance costs of each section have
been obtained by deducting from the financial costs aLl relevant taxes,
duties, and price contingencies. Also, inputs for vehicle operating costs
are exclusive of taxes and duties. Moreover, certain materials and labor
components have been shadow priced. For example, the economic cost of
unskilled labor was assumed to be about 50% of wage rates based on an assess-
ment of marginal productivity in alternate employment. Under the foregoing
assumptions, the economic costs for each section are about 80% of the cor-
responding financial cost without price contingency.
4.09      For the valuation of passenger travel time savings, no distinction
was made between business and non-business trips, assuming that any sort of
time saving will be valued at 1/4 x average hourly wage rate. Given the
situation of unemployment or under-employment in the country, it was conser-
vatively considered that time saved could not be as productive as working
time, even for business trips. Benefits due to reduction in accident costs,
increased comfort, convenience, and safety have not been quantified.
4.10      The proposed project works were selected among several alternative
solutions developed in response to specific transport problems posed by the
present condition of the existing roads. These were: construction of a new
expressway or bypass, construction of a new at-grade road, widening an exist-
ing road to four lanes, construction of auxiliary lanes to remove slow moving
vehicles from the main artery, widening and strengthening shoulders to 3 m
(2.5 m paved and 0.5 m unpaved) to carry slow moving vehicles, pavement
strengthening. For each project section the most economical alternative in
terms of total transportation cost (capital, maintenance, and vehicle operat-
ing costs) has been selected, using the Bank's HDM model, and is presented in
Annex G, Tables 2 to 5.
4.11      In all sections, the corridor is served by the two main modes: road
and rail. In determining the economic viability of the proposed project
works, the rational allocation of future traffic between road and rail
facilities has been analyzed with due regard to their present and future



-38-
service characteristics, capacity and total distribution costs. It was found
that the possibility of some diversion of cargo from road to rail is likely
only in the Section NH8: Ahmedabad-Vadodara, and its effect is analyzed as a
sensitivity case (see Annex C, Table 6, Case IX).
4.12       In summary, based on assumptions and estimates described above and
on the results indicated in Annex C, the following table shows that the best
alternatives for each section are:
ERR (%)
S. No.    State                Recommended Alternative             Incremental 1/ Absolu:e 21
1    Gujarat          4 Lane expressway                               16             21
2    West Bengal    2 Lane at-grade road in new alignment             25             25
3    Punjab           widening to 4 lanes                             26             26

1/ ERR with respect to the previously accepted alternative in a
sequence of increasing investments.
2/ ERR with respect to the do-nothing alternative.
All project components show high ERRs and therefore the proposed project is
well justified. Details of the economic analysis can be found in Annex C
and in the Project File.
C. Overall Evaluation
4.13       The project's overall ERR is 26%, including the cost of components
not separately evaluated. A sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase
in capital costs of 20%, a decrease in vehicle operating costs of 20%, and a
combination of a 10% increase in costs and 10% decrease in vehicle operating
costs would have a similar effect on ERR, which will drop to about 23% in the
three cases.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
4.14      Table 6 in Annex C presents the absolute ERRs for several sen-
sitivity cases analyzed, representing cases where there could conceivably
exist some uncertainties with respect to the assumed values for the base
case. For example: (a) in solutions comprising the construction of a
facility on a new alignment, traffic diversion from the existing road to the
new alignment might pose some uncertainties. This could be the case in



-39-
Cujarat, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh and has been analyzed in Sensitivity
Cases VI and VII. The relative reduction in the volume of diverted traffic
has been assumed to be substantially higher in Uttar Pradesh because of the
attraction which the city of Varanasi, an important economic and religious
center, might exert even on through traffic; (b) Case IX considers the pos-
sibility of diversion of cargo in Gujarat from road to railways, which as
indicated in para 4.11 is the only case where this type of diversion was
found to have some degree of likelihood; (c) Case X considers the possibility
of an increase of one year in the construction period for Cujarat and Uttar
Pradesh, the two projects where land acquisition is not complete, which
consequently might cause some delays; and (d) Case V analyzes the consequen-
ces of changing the percentages of annual completion rates given by MOST, in
accordance with an assumed typical S-shape work progress. The remaining
sensitivity cases are explained in the table, and the overall conclusion is
that even under unfavorable assumptions, there is little risk that the ERRs
for any of the project components would fall to unacceptable levels.
E. Risk Analysis
4.15       All project components involve proven technology, and therefore
technical risks connected with the project are minimal. The Bank has not had
any operation in this sector for more than twenty years, and therefore, there
is no experience concerning the capacity of GOI to implement the project
properly and in time. Experience in other transport subsectors, however, has
been good, so it is reasonable to assume that the implementation risks will
be small, if any. The operation of some of the proposed improvements, such
as expressway, bypass, traffic segregators, could have a certain degree of
risk, given the lack of experience in India in the utilization of those
systems. However, the training element of the project and the proposed
intense supervision of civil works and studies, will substantially reduce
those risks.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI on the fol-
lowing matters:
(a)  terms of reference for TCC, which will be established and ade-
quately staffed by September 30, 1985 (para 1.11);
(b)  terms of reference and organization chart for the already con-
stituted Highway Planning Group in MOST (para 2.17);
(c)  future planned national highway investment allocations will be
based on plans to be prepared by the Highway Planning Group
(para 2.29);

(L) arrangements made in each state for project supervision
(para 3.24);
(*)  provisions for utilizing consultants (about 60 man-months) to
assist, if needed, in executing the more novel aspects of the
project and studies (para 3.24);
(n)  action plans to be prepared by MOST on implementation of the main
recommendations of the study on road safety will be sent to the

5.02      Based on the agreements reached on the foregoing, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$200.0 million
equivalent>.

Annex B
INDIA
NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
States Annex
This annex contains information on the six states which will
receive financial assistance from the Bank under the National Highways
Project. The states are Gujarat, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu,
and Uttar Pradesh. For all states, socio-economical and geographical infor-
mation is presented, as well as a description of their transport sectors and
roads and highways administrations. Finally, the influence area of each
proposed subproject is described. Statistical tables on the states are
presented at the end of the annex.
Gujarat
State Background
1.        The State of Gujarat, located in the northwestern part of India, is
the seventh largest of the 20 Indian states, and its population of 34 million
is the tenth largest. The most important economic activities are agriculture
and industry, which accounted for 32% and 20.5% of the State's domestic
product, respectively, in 1981/82. Gujarat stands out as one of the most
industrialized Indian states. One result of this industrialization has been
a relatively high per capita income. Gujarat's per capita income in 1981/82
stood at Rs 2,192 substantially higher than the all-India level of Rs 1,595.
The most important industries in Gujarat are cotton textiles, vegetable oils,
dairy products, chemicals (including fertilizers) matches, cement, and metal
manufacturing.
2.        Another important result of Gujarat's economic development is its
rapid urbanization. Gujarat is the third most urbanized State in India with
31% of its population living in cities compared with 24% for all-India.
About 57% of the State's urban population dwell in a "corridor region"
stretching south from Ahmedabad towards Bombay, which contains the State's
three largest cities: Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Surat. The proposed sub-
project is located in this corridor.
3.        As elsewhere in the country, agriculture is the most important and
one of the less productive economic activities in the State. It provides
employment to 68% of the working population and yet its share in the State's
income is only 32%. Compared with the national average, the agricultural
productivity per acre, as well as per engaged person, is low. The main



-44-
Annex B
Page 2 of 20
agricultural products are: groundnuts (produces about 30% of national
production) and cotton (24% of national production). Other important crops
are foodgrains and potatoes.
Transport Sector
4.        Gujarat has a fairly developed transport network comprised of
railways, roads, ports, and airports. The railway system, 5,633 km. long
within the State borders, is operated by Western Railways. This system has
the three gauges: broad, meter, and narrow. Railway route length per square
kms. and per capita is significantly higher than all-India averages, indicat-
ing that the State's railway system is relatively more extensive and
developed. Salt, cotton, cloth, cement, oil, oilcake, and oilseeds, sugar,
and iron and steel are the major items transported by rail.
5.        Gujarat also has an extensive road network, although not as rela-
tively developed as railways. The State has 58,100 kms of roads, 70% of
which are surfaced and 2.5% are national highways. The road length per sq.
km. and per capita is below the all-India average. The national highways
system in the State has 1,424 kms.--a large proportion of which is in NH 8
which links New Delhi and Bombay. The quality of Gujarat's national highway
system is high relative to the country as a whole: in 1981 only 17.8% of the
NH length in the State had a width below standard double lane, compared with
42.5% at the national level. Gujarat has a relatively large registration of
motor vehicles (458,504 in 1980) second only to Maharashtra's. The number of
vehicles per 100 persons, which stood at 1.3 in 1980, is also substantially
higher to the all-India figure of 0.6.
6.        The State's port system is also quite developed.  A series of
ports, including one major deep-sea port at Kandla, thread along the 1600 km.
coastline extending along the Arabian Sea. In 1981/82 Kandla handled 9.5
million tons of cargo, about 11% of total cargo handled by major ports in
India. Major products handled are petroleum, iron and steel, machinery, and
chemicals (including fertilizers).
Roads and Highway Administration
7.        Public works in Gujarat, including roads and national highways, are
the responsibility of the Building and Communication Department which is
headed by a secretary. B&C is responsible for construction and maintenance
of all public roads and buildings including those administered by Panchayats.
There are five Chief Engineers responsible for: (a) National Highways; (b)
State works; (c) Panchayat works; (d) Inspection Quality Control; and (e)
Arbitration. The State is divided into various circles which are headed by
Superintending Engineers responsible for administering the works under their
charge. Each Superintending Engineer is in charge of about four or five
divisions, each headed by an Executive Engineer who is ultimately responsible
for the works. He is assisted by a Deputy and by Assistant engineers.

Research Institutes
8.        The Cujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI), located at
Vadodara, is the main institution in the State performing testing and inves-
tigations. It is headed by a Director of Chief Engineer rank. In addition
to laboratory work the institute also has a separate cell for traffic
engineering. There are also regional laboratories in various district towns
in charge of on-site testing which perform tests during work execution. They
are important for quality control.
Quality Control Organization
9.        As indicated before, there is a separate organization for quality
control headed by a Chief Engineer and assisted by four E.E. posted at
different places in the State for more effective supervision of works and by
additional lower level engineers.
Influence Area of the Subproject
10.       The subproject involves the construction of a new dual-carriageway
expressway of about 92 km linking the cities of Ahmedabad and Vadodara in the
main Delhi-Bombay corridor of NH 8. NH 8 is one of the main transport cor-
ridors in the country and carries considerable interstate, overseas
import-export traffic, as well as serving the industrialized State of
Cujarat. The present 102 km road linking the cities of Ahmedabad and
Vadodara has a two-lane carriageway, widened for about 10 kms at each end
to four lanes. From a strength point of view, its present condition warrants
major rehabilitation, but at least a doubling of the carriageway is needed to
cater for growing traffic demand. However, pressure of land development
along the present road and the need to accommodate increasing volumes of
local traffic thereon has dictated a new alignment to handle the considerable
volumes of long-distance through traffic.
West Bengal
State Background
1.        Situated in the Northeastern part of India, West Bengal covers an
area of 89,000 sq. kms. (approximately 3% of India's land area) and contains
a population of about 54.6 million (8% of India's total population). West
Bengal is the second most densely populated State in India after Kerala. In
1981 its population density was 614 persons per sq. km., compared with 220
for all India. About 13 million (or 24% of the State's population) live in
urban areas, including Calcutta, the State capital and largest metropolis in
India with a population approaching 10 million. The State's NDP grew at 2.6%
per annum in the 1970s, lower than the all-India average (3.6% per annum),
and its per capita income (Rs 1,595 in 1981/82) is lower than the national



-47-
Annex B
Page 5 of 20
average (Rs 1,758). The main natural resources of West Bengal are its Large
coal reserves and its soil of superior fertility, which is more suitable for
growing a larger variety of crops than the average soil found in India.
2.         The main economic activity is agriculture, which accounts for about
31% of the State income and 60% of its total employment. Holdings are small
(50% are less than 0.5 ha) and severely fragmented (averaging 8 fragments per
owner). About 40% of the farmers are share croppers. Major crops are jute
(41 million tons), potatoes (21.4 million tons), foodgrains (5.9 milLion
tons), and mustard.  Yield per hectare for foodgrains and potatoes are above
average all-India yields, while those for jute and mustard approximate the
national average. Faced with severe population pressure, the State Govern-
ment is trying to increase agricultural productivity by: (a) increasing the
availability of quality seed; (b) increasing the level of fertilizer use;
(c) developing rainfed areas; and (d) streamlining the agricultural extension
program.
3.         Industry accounts for about 16% of West Bengal's income and
provides employment to about 11% of its population. The main industrial
activity in West Bengal is the processing of jute into textiles. West Bengal
accounts for 86% of total jute textile production in India. West Bengal is
also an important producer of cotton yarn and fabrics, steel, paper and paper
board, and pig iron, West Bengal ranks sixth among Indian states in terms of
per capita value added by factory manufacturing. Industry has grown much
slower than the all-India average, therefore, West Bengal fell from being the
second most industrialized State in the Union during the 1960s to its current
sixth place. The major reasons for this sluggish performance were:
(a) industrial disputes caused by a largely unionized labor; (b) social and
political instability; and (c) deterioration in infrastructure facilities and
services in Calcutta, the largest city and most important industrial center
of the State which reduced investors' interest.
Transport Sector
4.         Transport facilities per area in West Bengal are significantly
higher than national figures: roads length per 100 sq. km. is 64.6 compared
with 45.7, and railway route length per area is 2.2 times the national
average. In transport facilities per population, however, West Bengal ranks
below the national average. This occurs because of the substantially high
population density of the State. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
facilities of transport in West Bengal are about average relative to other
Indian states. Total road length in the State is 56,800 kms (as of 1981),
44.5% of which is surfaced. The annual growth rate in road length in the
1960/61-1979/80 period was 4.7%, below the all-India rate of 5.9%.  The
national highways system accounts for 2.8% of the roads and only 12.5% of it
has a width below standard double lane. In addition to road and railway
facilities, the State has one major port at Calcutta-Haldia which handled 9.7
million tons of cargo in 1981-82 (about 11.2% of the total cargo handled by
all major ports in the country).

Roads and Highways Administration
5.        The West Bengal Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for
roads and highways administration in the State, along with other public
works. The two Roads Directorates are responsible for all roads, one for
State highways and the other for national highways, each headed by a Chief
Engineer. The administrative units of the directorate are the Circle, each
headed by a Superintending Engineer (S.E.) responsible for the administration
and control of road works. The S.E. is in charge of inspecting the status
of the various works within his circle and to ensure that they are managed
efficiently. The executive units of the directorate are the divisions which
are headed by Executive Engineers (E.E.), responsible to the S.E. for the
execution and management of all works within their divisions. The E.E. is
the officer ultimately responsibLe for work execution. He is responsible for
seeing that proper measures are taken to preserve public assets
appropriately. The accounting functions are also performed at the divisional
level under the supervision of the E.E. The divisions are divided into
sub-divisions, each in charge of Assistant Engineers and staffed by
sub-assistant engineers and work-assistants.
Quality Control
6.        Quality control is performed by a separate group of quality control
staff. An Executive Engineer is responsible for quality control works. He
is assisted by an Assistant Engineer and by Research officers, senior
laboratory assistants, junior laboratory assistants who test construction
materials and works.
7.        There is one centralized Road and Building Research Institute
(RBRI) in Calcutta headed by one Director which keeps a close liaison with
C.R.R.I.  in Delhi, as well as with other research institutes throughout the
country.  There is also one central laboratory in Calcutta performing test-
ings, pavement design, and allied investigation works primarily for national
highways. It has base units in different areas of the State. In addition
there are other laboratories located in several district towns of the State
which sometimes do work for the PWD.
Influence Area of the Subproject
8.        The subproject involves the construction of a 65 Kms, two-lane
highway which will relieve congestion in NH 2, which links Delhi and Calcutta
and serves as the principal artery of road traffic in the hinterland of the
Calcutta Port. Aligned on the Cangetic valley, the road passes through the
States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. Major cities on this route,
besides Delhi and Calcutta, include Agra, Kanpur, Asansol, Durgapur, and
Bokaro. The proposed subproject will reLieve congestion in the
Calcutta-Durgapur section, which has high traffic (ranging between 4,000 and
10,000 vehicles Der dav). The new road wiLl bring about the following
benefits ({a) shorten the distance by 18.5 Kms, as it will be a direct
alignment: (t) segregate the fast and slow-moving traffic; and (c) by-pass
several towns on the current alignment where congestion is noticeable.

Punjab
State Background
1.        Punjab State is one of the most prosperous states in the country
and leads all other states in terms of agricultural production and
small-scale industries. Puniab's most valuable asset is its hard working,
persevering, and enterprising population. Punjab is amongst the smallest
states in India with an area of 50,362 sq. km. and a total population of 16.8
million.  Its population density is 331 persons per sq. km. above the
all-India level of 220.
2.        The State's per capita income which stood at Rs 3,164 in 1981/82 is
the highest in India. Punjab has had substantial economic growth during the
1970s with its net domestic product and per capita incomne increasing by 4.7%
and 2.6% per annum, respectively. The major factor behind Punjab's rapid
economic growth were: (a) the enterprising nature of its population; (b) the
introduction of high-yield varieties of seeds, intensive fertilizer, and
irrigation use and modern technology in agriculture; and (c) rapid develop-
ment of smnall-scale industries throughout the State.
3.        The economy of the State is predominantly agro-based with agricul-
ture accounting for 44% of net domestic product and providing employment to
70% of the population. The most important agricultural crops are foodgrains
(mostly wheat and rice) and potatoes. In 1982-83 Punjab State produced 11%
of total foodgrains and 7% of total potatoes in India. Agricultural yields
in Punjab are by far the highest in India. For example, the annual rate of
increase in foodgrains production in the period between the triennium ended
in 1961/62 and that which ended in 1982/83 was 6.3% compared with the
alL-India average of 2.4%.
4.        Punjab's industrial sector has benefited from its tremendous
agricultural growth which augmented demand for industrial goods. The struc-
ture and composition of industry have been mostly influenced by the marked
deficiency of natural resources in raw materials (other than agricul-
ture-based) and by the existence of skilled labor, enterprising individuals,
and a high consumer demand. As a result the major industries are rer-
tlizers, cotton processing, paper manufacturing, and engineering goods
(machine tools, agricultural implements, diesel engines, industrial
machinery, etc.). The only resource-based industries of the large-scale type
are fertilizers, cement, and steel. Other important industries are breweries
and pharmaceuticals.

Transport Sector
5.         Punjab's transport network is well developed relative to the
country as a whole. Road and rail route length per sq. km. and per capita
are substantially higher than comparable ratios for all-India and any other
state in the Union. Similarly, the number of motor vehicles per 100 people,
although low by international standards at 1.9, is significantly higher than
the all-India figure of 0.6.
6.         Punjab has 964 kilometers in the country's national highways system.
with some sections (particularly in NH 1) having very high traffic levels.
Traffic levels similar as those experienced in Punjab are only found in parts
of the national highways network close to major cities such as Delhi, Bombay,
Madras, Hyderabad, and in the Ahmedabad-Vadodara corridors.
Roads and Highways Administration
7.        The construction of all roads in Punjab (including national high-
ways) is entrusted to the Buildings and Roads Branch of the Public Works
Department (PWD). A Secretary (PWD) located in Chandigarh is the head of the
Department, seconded by a Chief Engineer (Central), seconded by various
Superintending Engineers in charge of various Circles which include central
works and national highways. The staffing pattern and responsibilities are
similar to that encountered in PWD Departments of other states.
Influence Area of the Subproject
8.         The subproject involves the construction of a new two-lane
carriageway beside the existing two-lane road over 120 Kms in the
Khanna-Jullundur section of NH 1. National Highway No.1 is a component
within India of the Asian highway as defined by ESCAP. From Delhi, it cros-
ses the State of Punjab from its border with Haryana near kmbala, to the
international border with Pakistan at Wagah. Agricultural production in
Punjab has increased enormously in recent years, and this increase has been
reflected in a correspondingly rapid growth in road traffic, particularly of
freight vehicles. In addition, the fast growth in agriculture has been
accompanied by a high rate of industrial growth. Ludhiana and Jullundur, two
major industrial cities in Punjab, will benefit from the subproject. The
traffic on this road is extremely high, and is in the range of 10,000 to
20,000 PCUs per day. The presence of a high proportion of slow moving traf-
fic further compounds congestion problems.

Haryana
State Background
1.        Haryana is one of the smallest states of the Indian Union with
44,056 sq. km. and a population of 12.9 million. It is a predominantly
agricultural State with almost 50% of its net domestic product originating
from the land. Haryana is a very fertile State which has benefited from
various irrigation schemes in northern India and from the introduction of
high-yield varieties of crops, intensive use of fertilizers, and modern
agricultural technology. This successful agricultural development accounts
for Haryana's rapid growth of NDP (4.5% per annum in the 1970s) compared with
the country's 3.6% and for its high per capita income (Rs 2,581 in 1981/82)
relative to other Indian states.
2.        Haryana is a surplus State in foodgrains.  The major crops besides
foodgrains and pulses are cotton, potato, rapeseed, mustard, and sugarcane.
The State has a very high percentage of net cultivated to total area (82.4%)
compared with the all-India figure of 46.8%. The ratio of net irrigated area
to net cultivated area (51.4%) is also higher than the all-India figure of
25.8%.
3.        Manufacturing accounts for 16% of Haryana's net domestic product.
Industrial growth has also been a major factor in the State's rapid economic
growth in the 1970s. The value of manufacturing output in Haryana increased
by 14% per annum in the period 1973-74/1978/79, substantially faster than the
all-India growth (10%) during that period. Major industries are fertilizers,
steel, cotton, yarn, sugar processing, and paper and paper board.
Transport Sector
4.        Haryana has a well-developed transport system with 1,500 kms of
railway route length and 23,000 kms of roads (2.8% of which are national
highways). Both road length and railway route length per 100 sq. km. are
higher than the all-India average, indicating that its transport system is
more developed than that in other states. Being a landlocked State, Haryana
does not have ports nor coastal shipping. Inland waterways do not constitute
a significant transport mode. Relative to other Indian states, Haryana has a
good road system. Eighty six percent of its roads are surfaced compared with
the all-India average of 46%. The proportion of national highways length to
total roads is 2.8% also higher than the all-India average of 2.1%.  The full
length of Haryana's national highways is double laned.

Roads and Highways Administration
5.        The construction of all roads (including national highways) is
entrusted to the Public Works Department (PWD). An Engineer-In-Chief is the
head of the Department and is seconded by three Chief Engineers in charge of
(a) National Highways; (b) Roads; and (c) Buildings, respectively.
6.        The staffing patterns of the PWD and of the National Highways Wing
are shown in the following chart.  Each Chief Engineer divides the work by
circles which are managed by Superintending Engineers.  Each circle has 3-4
divisions, depending upon the extension of the region to be covered and the
magnitude of work.  An Executive Engineer is in charge of each division and
is ultimately responsible for work execution. Each division is further
subdivided into 3-4 subdivisions headed by Subdivisional Engineers (SDE),
who supervise the work. In addition each subdivision is staffed by 4-5
Junior Engineers, who are responsible for daily supervision of progress and
quality of work and to maintain the various accounts.
Staffing National Highways
7.        The National Highways Wing is headed by a Chief Engineer (NH).  He
is supported by two Superintending Engineers located at Karnal and Faridabad.
The NH Wing is responsible for construction and maintenance of all national
highways in the State. The NH Wing is divided into seven Divisions, each
headed by an Executive Engineer and subdivided into 3-4 subdivisions, each
headed by Subdivisional Engineers.
8.        The Central Government spent Rs 48.8 million in national highways
in Haryana during 1980/81. Rs 38.7 million was used in capital investments
(new roads and widening and strengthening existing ones), while the balance
of Rs 10.1 million was spent in maintenance. The works are either done on
force account or sub-contracted to private contractors.
Influence Area of the Subproject
9.        The proposed subproject involves the widening to four lanes of an
80 Kms section of NH 1 in Haryana. The importance of NH I was explained
earlier when analyzing the subproject in the State of Punjab which is adjoin-
ing. The traffic situation referred to in preceding paragraphs for the
Punjab apply equally to this section since it is estimated to range between
15,000 to 25,000 PCUs per day. The widening will improve traffic flow,
increase speeds, and reduce accidents and vehicle operating costs. The
subproject will improve the transport facilities in one of the most rapidly
growing areas of the country.

Tamil Nadu
State Background
Tamil Nadu covers an area of 130,000 sq. kms, which is about 4% of
the national territory and has a population of about 50 million (1981 census
figure: 48.4 million), about 7.1% of the national total. It is a densely
populated State with 371 persons per sq. km. compared with the national
average of 220. It is the second most urbanized State with 33% of its
population in urban areas, compared with the national average of 23%.
2.        Agriculture is the largest sector in the Tamil economy, providing
27.7% of the State's net domestic product. Other important activities are
commerce (15%) and industry (12%). Its annual per capita income was Rs 1,373
in 1981/82, ranking fifteenth among all states and Union territories and
below the national average (Rs 1,758). In addition, the State's average
annual growth of net domestic product during the 1970s was 2.5%, below the
national average of 3.6%. Major reasons for this unsatisfactory performance
are inadequate water resources coupled with erratic monsoons which produce
sporadic droughts and floods and high population density.
3.        The State's agricultural area covers approximately 56% of its total
surface, of which approximately 35% is irrigated. Thus, crop production is
very dependent on the two monsoons: the southwest monsoon from June to
September and the northeast monsoon from October to December. Tamil Nadu's
major crop is rice, which accounts for about 45% of the total crop production
of the State. Other important crops are sugarcane, tapioca, and groundnut.
Transport Sector
4.        Tamil Nadu has a well developed transport network compared with
other states in India. Its road length per area and population is substan-
tially higher than the all-India average. In 1981 the proportion of surfaced
roads to total roads in the State stood at 74.8%, also substantially higher
than the all-India ratio of 46.1%. The national highway network account for
1.5% of the State road network (below the national average of 2.1%). The
State is also served by Indian Railways (3,893 kms. of route length) and has
two major ports, Madras, and Tuticorin, which together account for about 16%
of total cargo handled at major Indian ports.
Roads and Highways Administration
5.        The Highways and Rural Works Department is responsible for the
construction and maintenance of roads and rural works in the State of Tamil
Nadu. The Department is headed by a Chief Engineer (General). There are
three separate wings headed by Chief Engineers who look after:
(a) construction of Pamban bridge works (major project); (b) construction and
maintenance of national highways; and (c) flood relief works. The Chief



-57-
Arnnex B
Page 15 of 20
Engineer (General), in addition to being the administrative head of the
Department, also looks after the construction and maintenance of all state
roads (excluding national highways) and rural works. In this connection he
manages 17 Superintending Engineers and 75 Deputy Engineers. The National
Highways Wing is staffed by 1 Chief Engineer, 6 Superintending Engineers and
35 Deputy Engineers. The Pamban and the Flood Relief Work Wing each consist
of one Chief Engineer, one Superintending Engineer and four Deputy Engineers.
The Department also has a Research Station staffed by a Director (Chief
Engineer) and four Deputy Engineers in addition to technical and support
personnel.
National Highways Wing
6.        The National Highways Wing looks after the constructioLn and main-
tenance of national highways in the State, taking into consideration the
guidelines issued by the Ministry of Shipping and Transport (MOST). MOST
officials also inspect the state of the national highways system and advise
the Chief Engineer (NH) on matters concerning investment and maintenance.
Maintenance work on NH is done by the NH Wing on force account, while invest-
ment work such as strengthening and widening is sub-contracted. Contracting
procedures are similar throughout the country and are detailed in Chapter 2
of the main text. Tamil Nadu's NH Wing spent Rs 50 million in capital
investments and Rs 14.8 million in maintenance during 1980/81.  Part of the
work was done by force account and the balance was sub-contracted.
Research Station
7.        The Highways Research Station at Madras is one of the best research
stations in the country, second only to the Central Road Research Institute
in New Delhi. It has four laboratories for testing soil, concrete, traffic,
and bitumen, respectively. The Research Station is engaged in applied
research work in addition to testing materials and effecting quality control
on behalf of the National Highways Wing and other wings of the Highways and
Rural Works Department. The Station is well equipped fcr its testing
activities in-house and also has facilities for field testing.
Influence Area of the Subproject
8.        The proposed subproject consists of the provision of an additional
two-lane carriageway and the strengthening of the existing two-lane carriag-^
way of NH 45 for about 40 Km between km 27 and 67, and from km 67 to 160 the
strengthening of the existing two-lane carriageway and the provision of
strengthened, paved shoulders 2.5 m wide with an additional 0.5 m gravel
support. NH 45, also known as the Southern Trunk road, originated at Madras
and connects important cities such as Trichy and Madurai and joins NH 7 at
Dindigul.  NH 45 is the major artery of traffic in the SLate of Tamil Nadu.
Madras, with its international airport and port, serves as the principal
traffic generator for NH 45. The pavement, which has become seriously dis--
tressed and is overdue for rehabilitation, is not suited for withstanding the
present traffic volume of about 5,000-10,000 vehicles per day.

Uttar Pradesh
State Background
1.        Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) is the fourth largest State in India in terms
of area (443 thousand sq. km.) and ranks first in population with 110.9
million in 1981 or 16.2% of the national population. U.P. is one of the most
densely populated states in India with a population density of 377 persons
per sq. kni. compared with the national average of 220. Only 18% of U.P.'s
population is urban compared with the national figure of 23.3%. U.P.'s net
domestic income was Rs 147.6 billion in 1981/82, 43% of which originated in
agriculture and 12.7% in industry. Per capita income stood at Rs 1,313,
among the lowest relative to other Indian states.
2.        Agriculture is the most important occupation, as well as the main
source of income in the State. Agricultural productivity is significantly
higher than the all-India average. Since 1951 there has been a steady
increase in output per hectare accompanied by an increase in output per
worker, which allowed the sector to sustain the State's economic growth and
meet its demaid for food and other agricultural products.  High agricultural
productivity has resulted from: (a) continuous increase in double cropped
areas; (b) increase in irrigation facilities; (c) introduction of high yield-
ing seeds (mainly wheat, rice and hybrid); and (d) more intensive use of
fertilizers. There has been a significant productivity increase in oilseeds,
sugarcane, wheat, and rice.
3.        Uttar Pradesh has a relatively underdeveloped industrial sector due
to various reasons, such as: (a) poor availability of raw materials other
than agricultural resources; and (b) infrastructure shortages caused by lower
availability of Dower and transport facilities relative to other states.
There is a predominance of agro-based industries with textiles and food
processing, the two most important industries in terms of employment gener-
ation, accounting for about 60% of total workers in manufacturing. A large
proportion of manufacturing industry is of the traditional household type:
non-factory located in rural areas. Large-scale industry has not developed
significantly due to the resource limitations of the State. In addition,
growth in the two major factory industries (cotton textiles and sugar) has
been hampered by problems of power shortages, obsolete technology, industrial
disputes, and high cost of production. Other major industries are engineer-
ing, fertilizers and steel.

Trans ort Sector
4.        The basic network of transportation in U.P. consists of railways
and road transport. Water transport is also used to a limited extent for
carrying goods and services over short distances. U.P. is well served by a
network of railways which total 8,882 km. of route length.  The roads network
is about average when compared with other states. The large number of people
in the State which live in villages pose significant demands for road
transport facilities which have remained largely unmet. About 46% of the
roads length is surfaced and 1.6% consist of national highways. The NH
network consists of 2,475 kms. (1981 figures), 58.4% of which has a width of
standard double lane or wider.
Roads and Highway Administration
5.        Roads and highway administration in the State is under the Uttar
Pradesh Public Works Department, which is headed by an Engineer-in-Chief,
assisted by eight Chief Engineers, each heading a department. One of these
Chief Engineers is in charge of national highways in the State. He has
overall responsibility for the proper construction, repair, and maintenance
of the national highways in the State.
6.        The Chief Engineer (N.H.) is assisted by a Personal Assistant and
by 6 Superintending Engineers in charge of various circles.  There are four
civil circles for controlling execution of works and another for survey
design and quality control, each headed by a S.E. (Civil) located in the
field. In addition, there is a mechanical circle headed by a S.E. (Mechani-
cal) with headquarters at Lucknow, which controls the repair of plants and
machines used for national highways' works.
7.        The civil circles are divided into divisions.  There are a total of
23 civil divisions in the State for national highways, 22 of which are
engaged in maintenance works, repairs, widening and/or strengthening of
national highways.  One division does sur'Tey works, two reform quality con-
trol, and the remaining three are in charge of bridges. Each division is
headed by an Executive Engineer who is assisted by Assistant and Junior
Engineers. There are 90 Assistant Enginieers and 214 Junior Engineers.
Junior Engineers supervise the works on site.
8.        There are four mechanical divisions, each headed by an Executive
Engineer (Mechanical), who is responsible for the proper functioning of the
equipment under his division. He is also assisted by Assistant and Junior
Engineers.
Research Tnstitute and Laboratories
9.        There is one Research Institute under the U. P. Public Works
Department headed by the Director, Research. The Institute has three wings:



-61-
Annex B
Pagej 1 of 20
(a) building materials and road aggregates testing wing; (b) soil testing
wing; and (c) between testing wing. Each wing is headed by a Deputy-Director
Research assisted by various Assistant Engineers and Assistant Research
Officers. In addition to the Research Institute, the U.P. has 12
laboratories for testing highway material, which are located in various
cities throughout the State.
Influence Area of the Subproject
10.       The City of Varanasi (Benares) on the banks of the Ganges River
is one of India's most important holy cities. This fact alone, without
taking any account of its economic importance, is sufficient to ensure that
Varanasi remains almost permanently choked with a mix of pilgrim-oriented
traffic, which must be unique even for India. The main road through the city
is encroached upon by stall-holders catering to the pilgrim market, by
road-side repair shops for the multitude of vehicles which negotiate the
crowded streets; but everywhere there are pedestrians, animals, cyclists,
rickshaws, cars, and trucks swarming the streets like an ant hill in full
activity. Through traffic using National Highway No. 2 (NH 2) on the main
Calcutta-Delhi corridor has no alternative but to negotiate the hazardous and
time-consuming transit of Varanasi, and in so doing adds another quantum of
congestion to the existing confusion. Consequently, a bypass of Varanasi is
proposed under the project to remove this considerable volume of traffic,
which has no economic connection with the city.

Highway No. 8 (NH-8) is one of India's main transport corridors connecting
Bombay and Delhi. The present 102 km road linking the cities of Ahmedabad
and Vadodara has a two-lane carriageway, widened for about 10 km at each
end to four lanes. From a strength point of view, its present condition
warrants major rehabilitation, but at least a doubling of the carriageway
capacity is needed to cater for growing traffic demand. However, pressure
cf land development along the present road and the need to accommodate
increasing volumes of local traffic thereon has dictated a new alignment
to handle the considerable volumes of long-distance through traffic. The
alignment finally selected is through flat, unimproved agricultural land
and shortens the through journey by about 10 km. A controlled access
four-lane divided freeway facility has been designed to accommodate
forecast traffic. As the first freeway to be built in India, it will
provide a test-bed to see how such a facility, designed and built to the
latest standards of geometry and safety, with grade-separations to obviate
the conflicts of intersecting traffic, will operate under Indian condi-
tions of traffic mix, discipline, and toll structure. The State of
Cujarat, which as a result of its steady industrialization (see Annex B)
is generating heavy flows of long-distance freight traffic, provides an
ideal setting. Moreover, the State Government is one of India's most
competent in its capability to build, operate, and maintain roads.
2.        The 92 km freeway begins and ends at a city ring road, obviating
any foreseeable problem of traffic dispersal from the facility. Two
diamond interchange structures provide access to two sizeable towns en
route, and among the several river bridge and overpass structures there is
one major crossing (about 700 m) of the Mahay River. Experiments will be
made with various types of vandalproof fencing to preserve the integrity
of the right-of-way and to prevent unauthorized access to the road.
West Bengal
3,        With the aim of providing a fast, direct connection between
Calcutta, the State capital, and Durgapur, its main industrial complex,
construction of an expressway along the general alignment of NH2 was
mooted by the State about 20 years ago. The alignment in general follows
the existing road except for the project length where the new route cuts
off a long loop in the present road. For the particular section of 65 km
encompassed in this project, the right-of-way has long since been



-75-
Annex C
Page 2 of 4
acquired. Some years ago work started on the embankment of the new road,
and a few cross drainage structures were built. However, lack of funds
brought the project to a halt. The work proposed now is to open this new
alignment to traffic by the completion of a two-lane highway.
4.        The terrain is flat and although there are a number of minor
river crossings, no major structures are involved.
Punjab
5.        National Highway No. 1 is a component within India of the Asian
highway as defined by ESCAP. From Delhi, it crosses the State of Punjab
from its border with Haryana near Ambala, to the international border with
Pakistan at Wagah. Agricultural production and industrial development in
Punjab has increased enormously in recent years (see Annex B), and this
increase has been reflected in a correspondingly rapid growth in road
traffic, particularly of freight vehicles. The present two-lane road is
showing signs of distress under the heavy traffic load and its rehabilita-
tion is overdue. However, to meet present capacity demands with safety,
it is necessary to construct a new two-lane carriageway beside the exist-
ing road which would itself be rehabilitated. The present right-of-way is
sufficiently wide that it will not be necessary to acquire more land for
the purpose. The terrain is flat and apart from poor subgrade bearing
values the work presents no unusual features. To avoid problems of accom-
modating traffic under construction conditions, it is proposed that sec-
tions of the new carriageway be built and all traffic diverted thereon so
that the parallel section of the existing road may be rehabilitated.
Frontage roads are provided within townships to accommodate local traffic
movements.
Haryana
6.        The traffic situation referred to in the preceding paragraphs
for the Punjab applies equally to this, the adjoining 80 km section of NH1
in Haryana. Again, doubling of the existing carriageway, which itself
requires rehabilitation, can be done within the existing right of way.
Like the Punjab, the terrain is flat and no particular construction
problems are envisaged.
Tamil Nadu
7.        National Highway 45 (NH-45) is the State's main arterial route
leading from Madras to its junction with NH7 at Dindigul in the south of
the State and Madras, with its international airport and port, serves as
its principle traffic generator.



-76-
Annex C
Page 3 of 4
8.        Over the 130 km of the project section starting 27 km south of
the Madras distributor, traffic has been increasing to the extent that,
like the roads in the foregoing two states, the pavement has become
seriously distressed and is overdue for rehabilitation.
9.        From the point of view of forecast traffic, the road divides
into two sections, the first from km 27-67 and the second from km 67-130.
For the first section a second two-lane carriageway must be provided now
and the present one rehabilitated. However, for the second section the
medium term solution proposed is a different one and one that is new to
India. The 6.7 m wide section of the present road will be widened to 7 m,
but to accommodate slow moving traffic, the volume of which fluctuates
according to season, the 2.5 m wide shoulder will be strengthened and
paved and a gravel shoulder of 0.5 m width added. This solution should
prove adequate until about mid 1990's, by which time a second carriageway
should be added, as currently proposed for both Haryana and Punjab. The
terrain is flat, and no particular problem is envisaged.
Uttar Pradesh
10.       The City of Varanasi (Benares) on the banks of the Ganges River
is one of India's most important holy cities. This fact alone, without
taking any account of its economic importance, is sufficient to ensure
that Varanasi remains almost permanently choked with a mix of pil-
grim-oriented traffic, which must be unique even for India. The main road
through the city is encroached upon by stall-holders catering to the
pilgrim market, by road-side repair shops for the multitude of vehicles
which negotiate the crowded streets; but everywhere there are pedestrians,
animals, cyclists, rickshaws, cars, and trucks swarming the streets like
an ant hill in full activity. Through traffic using National Highway
No. 2 (UH-2) on the main Calcutta-Delhi corridor has no alternative but to
negotiate the hazardous and time-consuming transit of Varanasi, and in so
doing adds another quantum of congestion to the existing confusion. Con-
sequently, a bypass of Varanasi is proposed under the project to remove
this considerable volume of traffic which has no wish to transit the city.
The proposed alignment diverts to the south of the city and includes a
major bridge crossing the Ganges River at approximately the mid-point of
its 30 km length. To cater for the local traffic generated by the Univer-
sity and the diesel engine works which will be fronted by the new align-
ment, a service road is included in the project. More than any other road
section in the project as a whole, traffic segregation is crucial if the
bypass is to continue functioning as such and not become a replica of
conditions in the city. Hence, the integrity of the bypass must be
preserved by fencing and control of ribbon development. Although at
present only a two-lane carriageway is needed to accommodate traffic,
sufficient land is being acquired to accommodate a second two-lane car-
riageway.



-77-
Anrex C
Page 4 of 4
11.       The bridge, 920 m long, is a major strucLure, but its magnitude
is a factor which India has had to face in the many other crossings of the
country's major rivers. The structure proposed provides for four lanes of
traffic, two of which will cater to slow-moving vehicles and the other two
to the faster through traffic. Segregation is critical as .he mixing of
the two streams would rapidly result in the chaotic condition3 found on
the existing bridge. A physical separator will be required as traffic
signs and road markings have little impact on drivers of ox-carts.  The
State Government has prepared an outline design of the structure based on
a thorough foundation investigation, but bidders for the bridge component
will be encouraged to submit their own designs. The bid documents will
emphasize the need for traffic segregation, and designs will be expected
to incorporate physical separators.

Ministry of Shipping and Transport
Study of the Road Vehicle Fleet and Road User Charges
Terms of Reference
I. Introduction
1.01      In line with its wish to implement the recommendations on road
transport of the National Transport Policy Committee, the Government of
India (GOI) intends to undertake a study of road transport related in
particular to the appropriateness of: (a) the transport vehicle fleet,
presently largely comprising two-axle vehicles to the needs of the country
and the condition of the road network; (b) the charges by way of taxation,
duties, etc., levied on different classes of road vehicle; and (c) the
relationship between such charges and the costs of developing and main-
taining the road system to a suitable degree.
II. Objectives
2.01      The study has two main objectives.  The first is to evaluate to
what extent, consistent with the capabilities of the road system, larger,
heavier, or more fuel-efficient vehicles than the two-axle vehicles
predominantly in use now, should be permitted to use the inter-urban roads
of India and to determine the desirable legislative, fiscal, and
administrative changes needed to promote their use and to recoup from them
the economic cost which their use of the road network incurs.
2.02      The second is to review the taxes paid by road users of the
inter-urban network to determine whether the taxation system could better
reconcile the multiple aims of economic efficiency, equity, revenue gener-
ation, energy conservation, and administrative simplicity in revenue
collection. In this connection the study should ensure that the forms in
which taxes are specified and the administrative mechanisms by which they
are collected do not materially misdirect the decisions of transport users
and Government agencies in the allocation of scarce resources.

III. Vehicle Fleet Modernization
A. Scope of Work
3.01      With the purpose of assessing the optimum mix in commercial
vehicles, which will minimize the present value of the total road tran-
sport costs 1/ in the country, the consultant shall perform the following
tasks:
(a) review the existing mix of commercial vehicles by size, load
carrying capabilities, and chassis configuration;
(b) review the current conditions of the highway system, with par-
ticular attention to load bearing capabilities and contraints to
use of large vehicles;
(c) estimate present and future road freight demand by main com-
modities in volume as well as in spatial distribution;
(d) define alternative future mix of commercial vehicles (numbers,
size, energy efficiency, and chassis mix) to be evaluated;
(e) conduct the economic evaluation of different alternatives from
the standpoints of vehicle performance and the structural
capability of the network to sustain the recommended fleet
composition; and
(f) make recommendations on the optimum commercial vehicle fleet
mix.
B. Work Program
Review of Existing Vehicle Fleet
3.02      The consultant will collect information already available on the
existing light, medium, and heavy commercial vehicle fleet with breakdowns
by size, load bearing capabilities, chassis configuration. Similarly, the
consultants will collect data on the substantial number of new licenses
and foreign collaborations issued during the last three years, which will
mean a substantial increase and improvement in the commercial vehicle
1/ Total road transport costs incl*ude vehicle operating cost, road con-
struction and maintenance costs.



-80-
Annex D
Page 3 of 7
fleet, particularly for light and medium vehicles.  Finally, the consult-
ant will gather information on the industry's plans for future expansion.
Data on the existing fleet, present producticn capacity, and expansion
plans are available from the Ministry of Industry and the Automotive
'fanufacturers association.
3e03      The consultant also will review: (a) commercial trucks and bus
registration and age distribution; (b) commercial trucks and bus annual
kilometrages; (c)- axie load surveys already conducted in Lhe country;
(d) the existing system of vehicle inaintenance; and (e) the existing
system of permits so o,-erate trucks and buses. The consultant also should
analyze in detail the existing legislation governing vehicle weights and
dimensions, at both the national and state levels, and the degree of
enforcement of regulations.
Review of the Highway Systemn
3.04      Thirty-seven percent of the national highway system in India
comprises single-lane roads, and many bridges are old and in poor condi-
tion. This situation should be carefully analyzed when framing recommen-
dations for modernization of the vehicle fleet.
3.05      The consultant should collect information on the nationaL and
ma7cr state highway systems, including but not restricted to: (a) design
standards for the present network of roads arnd bridges; (b) inventory by
homogeneous sections specifying present geometric standards, weight and
size restrictions on bridges and roads, current surface condition,
strength, and estimated residual lives before pavement strengthening; (c)
research studies conducced in the country concerning road behavior under
different conditions of terrain, axle loads, traffic, climate, soils,
etc.; and (d) Government's plans for road construction and maintenance for
the next 15 years.
Road Traffic Demands
3.06      A projection should be made of the likely development over the
next 15 years of road traffic in India, identifying freight and passenger
volum,ies, type of commodities transported, spatial distribution of traffic,
likely utilization of concainers, etc.
3,07      Projections should be made on the basis of several plausible
assumptions to be identified by the study and in consultation with the
planning units in the Covernment of India.



-81-
Annex D
Page 4 of 7
Commercial Vehicle Fleet
3.08      Based on the information collected, the consultant should define
alternative future mix of the commercial vehicle fleet: (a) assuming that
the major constraints to adoption of heavier vehicles caused by the con-
figuration of the highway and road system, and road charges remain; and
(b) assuming that improvement in road system and charges are made.
3.09      The consultant should conduct an economic evaluation of the
alternative vehicle mix-transport system scenarios. For example,
experience world-wide indicates that the utilization of larger vehicles
reduces the cost per ton-km of transporting goods and passengers, but this
economic saving should be weighted against the incremental capital and
maintenance costs of improving the roads. Also, improvements in fuel
efficiency might entail a significant initial capital cost which should be
compared with future savings in fuel consumption. The suggested criterion
to evaluate different proposals is the minimization of the present value
of the total transport cost, at an opportunity cost of capital, which in
India could be assumed at 12%. The consultant should evaluate alterna-
tives under a reasonable number of different operation conditions (ter-
rain, geometric standards, congestion, traffic mix, commodity transport,
etc.), which could lead to different recommendations applicable under
specific operating conditions. All costs should be calculated net of
taxes, duties, and subsidies, and a shadow-price analysis shall be carried
out, if relevant. Also, the consultant should carry out a sensitivity
test of the alternatives with respect to variations in the main assump-
tions used in the economic evaluation (traffic volume and growth, savings
in vehicle operating costs, cost estimates, opportunity cost of capital,
etc.).
Final Recommendations
3.10      The consultant should make the final recommendations on the
optimum fleet mix--road system solution based on economic, engineering,
marketing, availability of credit, legal, administrative, and managerial
criteria. It should be recognized that a restructuring of the high-
way-road system and the related shift in commercial vehicle fleet mix will
take time to materialize. The consultant should prepare a detailed
implementation program specifying phases and intermediate targets for its
development. For example, it seems advisable to limit the first phase of
the implementation program to a major corridor of the country where enough
experience could be collected to be later applied to the rest of the
country.



-82-
Annex D
Page 5 of 7
3.1.1     The consultant should also prepare the necessary legislative,
fiscal9 and administrative changes required to induce the adoption of an
optimum commercial vehicle fleet mix.
IV. ROAD USER CHARGES
C. Scope of Work
4.01      With the aims of economic efficiency in view, the consultants
shall for the current situation:
(a)  estimate the costs attributable to road use;
(b)  allocate these costs to the principal categories of vehicles;
(c)  estimate the total taxes paid by each vehicle category and
compare them to the corresponding road use costs; and
(d)  propose changes in the forms of taxation that would enhance the
efficiency of the transportation system.
4r02      The consultant should carry out a similar type of analysis for
the units recommended in Section III. Because these units may not at
present exist in India, the consultant should base his analyses on the
experience available from other comparable countries.
4.03      To clarify the scope of the study, it should be stated that the
Government wishes to draw a distinction between road use charges and
general tax revenues. Road use charges 1/ are to be construed as payments
to the state, related as closely as possible to the sum of: (a) costs
incurred by the state in providing and maintaining the road infrastruc-
ture; and (b) the costs that each user imposes on other road users by
accelerated road damage and congestion. All taxes not designed as road
use charges are presumed to be for general revenue purposes. They may,
like VAT or sales tax, be levied on all productive activities with the aim
of raising revenues while distorting productive efficiency as little as
possible, or they may be levied on luxury consumption items with the aim
of redistributing income. Many of the present taxes are not clearly
1/ The term "road use charges" is used here instead of the more commonly
found term "road user charges" to avoid any ambiguity in their defini-
tion.                   I



-83-
Annex D
Page 6 of 7
identified with one or the other of these objectives, so that it is dif-
ficult to judge their effectiveness, and the consultants will have to
decide in which category such taxes are to be classified.
D. Work Program
Estimation of Costs Attributable to Road Use
4.04       Principles of economic efficiency require that the road use
costs to be charges to users include at least all the identifiable vari-
able costs (short-run marginal costs). These are normally defined as the
variable portion of routine and periodic road maintenance and congestion
costs, occasioned by trafficking.
4.05      As for the costs of providing future capacity (road strengthen-
ing, geometric improvements, and new construction), it is considered a
matter of Government policy whether part or all of such costs should be
recovered from present road users. Policy on this question of cost
recovery will be shaped by concern to provide relative prices to transport
users, which reflect relative costs of the different modes of transport
(where costs are defined on a comparable basis). To help the Government
make better-informed decisions on this subject, the consultants should
conduct sensitivity analyses that show the impact of alternative cost
recovery policies on the level of user charges and relative prices of
different modes of transport.
4.06      A similar analysis should be conducted to show the effect on
road use charges of an optimal level of road maintenance, as distinct from
the present level of expenditures.
Allocation of Costs to Vehicle Categories
4.07      The consultants should allocate the road use costs defined above
to the different vehicle categories, in accordance with the criterion of
causality. 1/ In so doing, attention should be paid to the axle configura-
tion of truck types currently assembled in India and alternative con-
figurations to which Indian assemblers could switch in the future in
accordance with the results of the analyses described in Section III.
1/ In this connection, recent research in the United States, Brazil, and
elsewhere on road deterioration and the resDective effects of traffic,
climate, and aging will be reviewed.



-84-
Annex D
Page 7 of 7
Comparison of Road Use Costs and Taxes Paid
4.08      By comparing the road use costs imposed on the system and the
total taxes paid by each category of vehicle, at both the national and
state levels, the consultants should identify which categories are
under-charged and, for the remainder, what is the breakdown between road
use charges and general tax revenues.
Proposed Changes in Forms of Taxation
4.09      It is possible that taxes paid by large trucks do not fully
cover the cost of road damage that they incur. If the analysis confirms
this, the consultants should propose appropriate taxes to rectify the
situation, with particular attention to encouraging axle configurations,
which minimize total transport costs. Also, the consultant should propose
appropriate taxes for the units analyzed in Section III, and in some
cases, those taxes could be used as incentives (or disincentives) for
operators to use certain vehicle types. The consultant will make recom-
mendations on the total amount of taxes to be paid by each vehicle,
without making a distinction between national and state taxes, which is a
matter to be decided later by the Government of India. Motor fuel prices
are at or above international levels, and the consultant should carefully
analyze their tax component.
4.10      Where the analysis reveals that efforts by road users to avoid
or reduce taxes in their present form are substantially reducing the
efficiency of transportation, appropriate changes should be proposed.
Each should be supported by an assessment of their foreseeable impact on
the efficiency of the transportation system and on the level of tax
revenues paid.
4.11      Finally under this heading, the consultants should propose any
changes they believe will significantly reduce the administrative cost of
collecting road user taxes without prejudice to economic efficiency or the
level of revenues. In this respect, the consultant should analyze the
implications of establishing a toll system in the country, a system that
is only applied at the present time to major bridges.

Principal Recommendations of National Transport Policy Conmittee R por t
The National Transport Policy Committee (NTPC) issued a report made
available to the general public in November 1980, and its recommendations
were approved by GOI, practically in its totality in March 1982. On
November 23, 1982, ASPPT issued a memorandum reviewing the NTPC report, and
summarizing the most important recommendations (Out of a total of about 170).
which would form the basis for our transport policy dialogue with GOI. A
copy of the "9Main Conclusions and Recommendations for GOI and Bank Group
Strategy in the Transport Sector" of the above-mentioned ASPPT memorandum is
attached as a general reference in this matter.

Page 2 of 4
Main Conclusions and Recommendations
For GOI and Bank Group Strategy
In the Transport Sector
1.        Bank's Strategy:  In India the Bank has an excellent starting
position because there is already a good mutual understanding on what are
the main transport sector issues and a general agreement concerning a con-
venient way of improving matters. The Covenment has taken the initiative in
finding sound solutions, mainly through a comprehensive study carried out by
a special committee called National Transport Policy Committee (NTCP), which
produced a report made available to general public in November 1980, and
whose recommendations were approved by GO, practically in its totality, in
March 1982. As a general comment, the recommendations are rightly oriented
towards liberalization of the transport sector to the maximum extent to
permit an optimum resource allocation in the sector.  The underlying prin-
ciples reflect support to price mechanism, competition, reliance on consumer
choice.  Matters such as regulations, tariffs, subsidies, all sorts of
man-made constraints, transport legislation, inter-modal coordination, etc.,
are dealt with the overall objective of releasing the transport sector from
all kinds of distortions that might increase the transport economic cost
required to satisfy the country's transport demand. Of course the current
situation in the sector is quite different, and significant changes would be
required to implement the recommendations. Several of them might have heavy
political implications, some lie in the boundary between Central and State
Government, and others might prove to be very unpopular. The big difficulty
is to get an adequate implementation of the advocated solutions. In order to
be more effective, Bank's efforts should be concentrated on a rather small
number of major issues in each subsector (the total number of NTPC recommen-
dations is 174), and the main emphasis should be placed on preparing and
monitoring a realistic implementation plan with a clear indication of
attainable phased targets, coordination action among relevant agencies
involved, etc. Finally, the Bank's position would be stronger if it is able
to discuss and monitor the implementation plan as part of specific lending
operations, which obviously would enhance Bank's leverage. Currently, Bank's
knowledge and intervention in the different subsectors is very uneven, with a
clear predominance of railway projects.
2.         The major issue common to ALL MODES is the abolition of subsidies
in the transport sector and the need to have a cost-based pricing system for
every agency sector.  An improvement in this area would not only optimize
traffic allocation, but would also enable generation of internal resources
and allow a higher investment in the subsector, which is reouired for the
replacement of over-aged assets and for development. The task of fixing
fares and rates could still remain with relevant Ministries, but the defini-
tiorn and elaboration of modal costs should be done by a central coordination
group so that uniform methodologies are applied and comparable results are
obtained. This activity is part of the second major issue relevant to ALL



-99-
Annex H
Page 3 of 4
MODES: transport coordination in its broadest meaning. There are enormous
differences among the different subsectors in terms of organization, pianning
capabilities, type of ownership, government control, financing, taxation,
etc., and their coordination, admittedly not easy, is essential. But to be
effective, it should also include all interface activities and every possible
bottleneck that might affect the whole transport. GOI has decided that the
present coordination done by Planning Commission and by the Department of
Coordination will proceed, but the Planning Commission should be adequately
srengthened to fulfill the other very important tasks of transport coordina-
tion (study of traffic flows, cost-based pricing, etc.).
3.        One of the major issues in RAILWAYS is the abandon of freight
equalization. The scheme has been in operation since 1956 in commodities
like cement and iron and steel.  The carrier, usually railways, is not finan-
cially affected because it charges normal rates. The equalization is later
made by the Ministry of Industry through self-financing accounts, the result-
ing equalization freight rate being the total real freight divided by the
total originated tonnage. The negative result of that policy is the
non-optimal locations of industries with respect to either raw materials
sources or consumption centers and the disregard of transport incidence in
their prices. Therefore, the issue has strong implications for transport as
well as for industrial projects. Another issue is the closure of uneconomic
lines especially of about 23 lines identified by IR as working with very
heavy losses and where alternative modes of transport exist and could meet
the transport need at a lower total marginal transport economic cost.
Another important issue for railway is the way freight rates and tariffs are
set up. There is a need to plan a phased reduction of cross-subsidization of
certain type of traffic considered to be a social obligation of railways,
namely: concessional monthly season tickets for passengers and the low
freight charged on commodities like foodgrains, salt, fruits, and vegetables,
etc. To compensate for this losses, IR has to overcharge another segment of
traffic. This type of cross subsidy may lead to uneconomic movements of the
subsidized traffic and on the other hand diversion of traffic to other modes
of transport for those commodities for which higher rates are charged to
offset the overall effect of the subsidy. To the extent that significant
transport distortions are created by these cross-subsidies, their phased
reduction should be analyzed. Finally, an area that needs further investiga-
tion is the possibility of underinvesment in railways. The issue is
intimately related to operating efficiency and, although this paper points
out some evidence of under-investment in IR, the matter should be more fully
analyzed and considered in our dialogue with COI.

4.         The major issue in the HIGHWAY subsector is the poor condition of
the national highway network from the road standards and maintenance condi-
tions viewpoints, resulting mainly from inadequate resource allocation. The
problem is further compounded because of the Federal type of Government of
the country, under which maintenance of roads is undertaken by the States,
including national highways for which tne Center provides the funds.  This
situation brings lack of uniformity of works done, problems in work planning,
nonl-optimal uses of resources, etc.  Another important issue from the road
planning viewpoint, is the need for the preparation of a Road Master Plan
1932-2000 based on traffic needs and national priorities, and covering all
types of roads, identifying missing links, weak bridges and prescribing
modern construction standards and financial requirements for road maintenance
and construction. This plan is unde-- p.eparation by GOI.
5.        Several issues affect the normal operation of ROAD TRANSPORT such
as regulations, operational permits, administrative constraints, etc. The
GO has accepted most of NTPC recommendations to facilitate the operation
of road transport, and they will be incorporated in the New Motor Vehicle
Act already prepared by Ministry of Shipping and Transport, and ready to be
presented for Parliamentary approval. Another issue affecting road transport
is the determination of adequate road user charges a matter that requires
further studies to assist in adequate inter-modal comparison.
6.         In PORTS the major issue is the improvement of efficiency in all
ports of the country where productivity is very low as compared with interna-
ticnal standards. Several reasons cause this situation, such as inadequate
administration and management, labor unrest, vehicular congestion in the port
areas, disorganized container movements, obsolete equipment, etc. There is a
lot of room fort improvement in this matter. Another issue is the estab-
lishmnent of adequate port charges in the country to optimize the port
capacity in India.  Bombay Port charges, for example, are much lower than in
the rast of the ports, and this situation could contribute to increase port
congescion.
7,         In the URBAN TRANSPORT the number and complexity of the problems
is very high. One important issue, not addressed by NTPG report, is the
intensification of privately operated buses which at present exist in a very
limited extent, and which could play an important role in coping with India's
increasing urban transport demand without requiring ever increasing public
subsidies. Another important issue is to improve traffic safety in the
cities through traffic management, education and enforcement; of particular
importance in this respect is the role to be played by the traffic police.
