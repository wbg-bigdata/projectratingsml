INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR
THE THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US$36.0 million on standard IDA terms to help to finance a project for
the development of the telecommunicatior.n system. The proceeds of the
Credit would be relent to the Telegraph and Telephone Department (T&T) of
the Ministry of Communications for amortization over 24 years, including
4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECON014Y
2.        The most recent economic report "Economic Situation and Prospects
of Pakistan" (392-PAK, dated April 1, 1974) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 19, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (the former West Pakistan) grew rapidly
during the Second Plan (1960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7% per annum.
This high growth was spearheaded by an industrial growth of 13.1% per annum.
However, agriculture grew by only 3.7% per annum. W4est Pakistan's overall
economic growth slowed down somewhat during the Third Plan (1965-70) to about
6% per annum. The industrial growth rate fell to 7.6%, but agricultural
output grew at 5.6% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and
rice varieties, reducing, but not eliminating, the food deficit.
4.        The Pakistan economy underwent severe strains during FY71 and FY72
when political uncertainties, the disturbances leading to the separation of
former East Pakistan, and severe drought combined to bring growth to a
virtual halt. In FY73, however, GDP rose about 6%, or at about the same
rate as during the Second and Third Plan periods (July 1960 - June 1970).
Growth in FY74 was also about 6%, despite the severe floods of last August.
More than 80% of the financial value of flood damage was loss of crops and
livestock, but, due to impressive efforts to increase winter crops and dis-
tribute fertilizer and other inputs on credit, a record wheat crop was
achieved and overall agricultural production this year is expected to rise
by 3%. There was relatively little flood damage to industrial capacity,
although transportation was severely disrupted for about one month, and
manufacturing output is expected to rise by about 8%.
5.        The floods caused a deterioration of perhaps $300 million in the
FY74 balance of payments, reflecting reduced exports due to damage to the
cotton and rice crops and increased wheat and vegetable oil import require-
ments due to loss of stored wheat and reduced cotton seed oil supplies.
Higher petroleum prices also added perhaps US$150 million to import require-
ments. Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings, however, are benefitting



from higher prices for cotton, cotton textiles and rice exports. Neverthe-
less, the FY74 current account deficit will be about US$415 million, compared
with only US$130 million in FY73. The current account deficit is expected to
be about US$380 million in FY75, with considerably larger exports of cotton,
cotton textiles and rice. Imports of wheat and vegetable oils will be less
because of this year's record spring wheat crop and the expected increase
in cotton production. The higher price of petroleum will add at least
JS$250 million, or perhaps 17 to 20%, to this year's import bill. That the
impact is not greater reflects the fact that the share of petroleum in
total imports has been fairly small (7.4% in FY73) because there are sig-
aificant supplies of petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectric energy in
Pakistan.
The flood and the rise in the price of petroleum added to the
problem of inflation. Wholesale prices rose 20% in FY73, and at a con-
,iderably faster rate in July-September, 1973. However, after the flood,
new taxes were imposed and lower priority expenditures cut in order to carry
out flood repair work without increasing the deficit.    High international
prices for major exports (which added to export duties and government trading
revenues) made it possible for the government to avoid recourse to bank
lfinancing during FY74, even though such financing had amounted to 2.6% of
GNP in FY73. The financial outlook for FY75, however, is less favorable,
with prospects that net bank borrowing may be about 2% of GNP.    The govern-
ment has taken steps to improve tax collections and increase public enter-
prise profits and larger cotton and rice exports may offset reduced govern-
ment revenues from lower international prices and export duties. Recent
government actions to reduce flour and fertilizer subsidies and to increase
prices of natural gas, electricity and transportation fares and freight
charges have also helped. Nevertheless, government revenue will still be
importantly dependent upon export duties and government profits on the monop-
oly export of cotton and rice. Revenue from these sources has recently been
declining due to lower world market prices, however, and should be lowered
considerably further in order to encourage more use of chemical inputs and
other measures to increase productivity. Therefore, development of alterna-
tive revenue sources to support expanding investment and social welfare
expenditures will be a critical requirement for the achievement of economic
growth and social development goals.
7.        The two key economic problems now facing Pakistan are to increase
saving and investment and to continue the expansion of production and exports.
Other major problems are to improve the distribution of income and reduce
population growth. The increase of public saving will depend upon further
actions to reduce direct budget subsidies to consumers (particularly on
wheat flour and edible oils), increase prices for irrigation water and
other goods and services supplied by the public sector, improve tax adminis-
tration and modify the tax structure to capture much more of the growth in
agricultural and urban income. This increase in public saving must be
achieved at the same time that education, health and other social expenditures
are being considerably expanded, and that the tax system is being made more
equitable. An increase in private saving may depend upon strengthening



-3-
private sector confidence. Private investment particularly by the major
enterprises, continues to be hampered by uncertainty about nationalization
and other government policies (such as prices controls and wage and labor
policy) affecting industrial profitability. However, small- and medium
scale private investments seems to be growing.
8.        Government price measures must be adjusted so that farmers
receive higher (closer to world market) prices for their cotton, wheat,
rice and other products if agricultural production is to increase satis-
factorily. The government has recently lowered export duties and announced
higher procurement prices and higher prices to consumers, but further changes
in this direction are needed to rationalize the price structure. Other
requirements for rapid agricultural growth are more adequate programs to
make use of Tarbela Dam water, increase tubewell water supplies, reduce
water-logging and salinity, improve seeds and cultural practices, and
provide more power to pump water and cultivate fields. Water from Tarbela
Dam will be available in 1975 and, with the increasing desire of small-
and medium-scale farmers to participate in the "green revolution", agri-
cultural growth in the next five years could at least equal the 5.6 percent
annual rate of the 1965-70 Third Plan period if appropriate government
pricing and other policies and programs were followed.
9.        Industrial growth potential appears high provided saving and
investment are adequate to expand productive capacity sufficiently to
satisfy domestic and export demand. Prospects for fairly rapid growth of
agricultural production promises more rapid growth of agro-processing in-
dustries and of industries supplying agricultural inputs. Investment
in government enterprises is expected to rise rapidly as extensive planning
for rationalization and expansion of this sector is now reaching the
implementation stage.
10.       Income distribution appears to be improving and unemployment and
underemployment rates to be falling. Special efforts are being made (the
People's Works Program, the Integrated Rural Development Program, and pro-
vision of credit to small farmers and businessmen) to increase production
of small farmers and businesses and to provide employment. Lower income
groups are also benefitting from more rapid expansion of health and educa-
tion programs. The revelation by the 1972 census of a 3.2 percent annual
increase in population during the previous decade has led to renewed
efforts to reduce the birth rate. A revitalized and expanded family plan-
ning effort is being launched with heavy U.S. support.
11.       Pakistan thus has good growth potential, and may be able to ful-
fill government hopes of achieving at least a 7 to 8 percent growth rate
over the next five years and also meeting ambitious education, health and
other social goals. The achievement of such a rate of development, however,
depends upon increasing public saving, continuing the rapid expansion of
exports and carrying out programs to increase agricultural production and
private investment. W4hile not an easy task, these problems are soluble
but would require the support of an expanding in-flow of foreign assistance.



- 4 -
12.       Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June, 1973, amounted
to about US$4.9 billion equivalent of which US$744 million was undisbursed.
Of this total, about US$664 million represents debt incurred on account of
pro,ects visibly located in Bangladesh and negotiations are now under way
as a result of which most of this debt will be assumed by Bangladesh.
Furt:hermore, in accordance with an understanding reached in June 1974 be-
tween Pakistan and the creditor countries of the Pakistan Consortium, Pakistan
wil:L be provided with US$650 million of debt-relief over the next four years
(US',175 million in FY75 and the two subsequent years and US$125 million
in 1Y78). Taking both these factors into account, Pakistan's debt service
is expected to rise from 9% of foreign exchange earnings in FY75 to 20%
in FY80. Although, therefore, in the short term the debt service problem
has been considerably eased, Pakistan still needs substantial amounts of
foreign aid and it is important that as much as possible be provided on
concessionary terms. For this reason the major part of the Bank Group's
assistance to Pakistan is provided by IDA. Including undisbursed balances,
Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 22% of its external
pub.Lic indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio might increase to about 24%. The
share of the Bank Group in total debt service, after taking account of the
debt relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors, is now about
28% and is expected to decrease to about 14% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATION.S IN PAKISTAN
13.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for East and West) between the start of operations in 1952
and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had committed $1.2 billion to the
country, about one-half of which was providecd by the Bank and one-half by
IDA. Of this amotnt, one loan and 19 development credits, totalling US$4.7
mil:Lion and US$168.1 million, respectively (net of cancellation), were for
projects located wholly within what was then East Pakistan and another 10
loans and 8 development credits involved expenditures in both East and West
Pakistan.
14.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA,
and it was agreed that Bangladesh would take over liability for credits
made for all uncompleted projects in its territory. Accordingly, 11 such
credits in an aggregate amount of US$151.4 million have since been made to
Bangladesh.  Of this amount, US$44.1 million has been used for the notional
repayment of amounts disbursed under the corresponding previous credit
agreements with Pakistan. Bangladesh has recently agreed to enter discussions
with all members of the Pakistan Consortium concerning the assumption of
liability for debts on account of projects visibly located in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh has also agreed to assume liability for about US$54.9 million
equivalent of Bank loans and about US$37.5 million equivalent of IDA credits
which are on account of projects visibly located in Bangladesh.



-5-
15.       Of the gross amount of US$1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East and West),
West Pakistan received about 72%. During its long association with Pakistan,
the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the economy. Until
1972, 38% of the total commitments were for the public services, 29% for
agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for industrial imports, and 1% for educa-
tion. Lending for public services amounted to some US$325 million and in-
cluded loans and credits for railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi
Port, highways, telecommunications and water supplies. A large part of the
lending for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for in-
dustry has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation (PICIC). For all the projects for which loans and credits are
now being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactorily. The
principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by the public
services have not kept pace with inflation and hence some utilities are
not earning the returns which they need, and that some borrowing agencies
have financial problems arising from the loss of assets in the former East
Pakistan. However the appraisal for the proposed credit confirmed that this
is not the case in telecommunications where the entity remains in a sound
financial condition. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and IDA credits as of June 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
16.       Lending operations in the future will have three main objectives.
The first of these is to support the directly productive sectors of the
economy to increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain
export growth in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other
industrial and agricultural products. The main part of our assistance for
industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries. The Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC) and the Industrial
Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) are concerned chiefly with the large and
medium-scale private sector. Some lending for the newly established National
Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) which is to provide finance for in-
dustries in the public sector is also under consideration.
17.       The most important part of future lending for agriculture is
expected to be for the government's new program to increase productivity
in the Indus River basin by controlling salinity and improving the utili-
zation of surface irrigation and groundwater. This is becoming more urgent
with the approaching availability of water from Tarbela dam. An irrigation
and drainage review mission has recently returned from Pakistan and is
preparing its report. It is clear, however, that a substantial amount of
investment will be needed. Other projects in the agricultural sector on
which preparatory work is proceeding include agricultural credit, livestock,
seeds multiplication and rural development.
18.       The second objective is to continue to improve the institutions
whiclh are responsible for the principal public services which have benefit-
ted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely, the Port of Karachi, the
Telegraph and Telephone Department, the Water and Power Development Authority,



-6-
i:he Pakistan Railways, and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most
of these, institutional improvements are being made with technical assistance
iinanced by the Bank.
19.       The third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the lowest 40% of the population. The Government is giving
high priority to its new program of rural development and a mission to study
this program recently visited Pakistan. It reports that although the program
is still in an early stage it is conceived on sound lines and with further
preparatory work it would be possible to develop a suitable project. At the
Government's request a mission has recently studied the plans for the urban
development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds 4 million.   A Karachi
master plan has just been completed with the assistance of consultants financed
by UNDP and urban projects are being developed within the framework of this
plan. In view of the preparatory work which has already been done on urbani-
zation problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile participation
by the Bank Group in this area. The Government has also asked the Bank to
study the urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.
Elanning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than is the case in Karachi
and the immediate need is for technical assistance. A mission to examine
problems of urbanization and regional development on a country-wide basis
Is scheduled for this fall.
20.       During this fiscal year, in addition to the credit now proposed,
I expect to recommend a Bank loan for the expansion of the natural gas
transmission and distribution system. Other projects on which preparatory
work is now going forward include a seeds multiplication project, an irriga-
tion and drainage project, a power transmission project and a project for
water supply and sewerage in Lahore.
21.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of USS28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million by
equity participations. (They are shown in Annex II). About US$14 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN PAKISTAN
The Sector
22.       The substantial distance between the only port, Karachi, the agri-
cultural centers of the Punjab and Sind and the industrial centers make an
effective telecommunications system essential for the development of the
economy. An adequate system is necessary to modern marketing, the establish-
ment of secondary industrial centers, export promotion and increased business
and administrative efficiency. The role of telecommunications in the efficient



organization of transportation assumes even greater importance with rising
fuel costs and shortages of fuel supply.
23.       The telecommunications sector consists of T&T which is responsible
for the operation of all local, long distance and international public
telecommunication services in Pakistan and two factories which produce
telecommunications equipment: Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP)
which manufactures switching equipment, telephones and teleprinters, and
Carrier Telephone Industries (CTI) which produces multiplex equipment.
Other important responsibilities of T&T are the licensing of commercial
and amateur radio transmitters, control of radio spectrum usage in Pakistan
involving registration of frequencies and operation of a radio monitoring
service.
24.       T&T is a Government department under the control of the Ministry
of Communications with its budget and development plan approved by the
Executive Committee of the National Economic Council. Some of T&T's
managerial and operating functions are at present performed by other Govern-
ment authorities, financial control being exercised by the Ministry of
Finance and various accounting, in addition to auditing, functions being
performed by the Auditor-General's staff. The Government and the Association
have agreed that the present arrangements are neither efficient nor desirable.
As a requirement of an earlier IDA Credit (145-PAK), the Government of
Pakistan agreed to reorganize T&T, with the assistance of consultants, in
order to provide the Chief Executive of T&T with adequate financial and
operational autonomy to manage its activities and operations effectively.
The Government has agreed that a detailed program for this reorganization,
which is expected to provide for the establishment of a Telecommunications
Board, will be submitted to the Association for review, and thereafter for
implementation, by not later than December 31, 1974 (Development Credit Agree-
ment, Section 4.02).
25.       Both TIP and CTI are commercial corporations with the Government
of Pakistan the majority shareholder. The other shareholder in both com-
panies is Siemens AG which also provides technical support. Pakistan
provides the main technical effort and all financial and managerial direc-
tion.
26.       The Credit Agreement for 145-PAK made provision for the establish-
ment of a fully commercial relationship between T&T and TIP. This requirement
has been fulfilled and there no longer are interest-free advances to TIP.
Installations by TIP of equipment for T&T are also now subject to guarantee
or retention payments. Previously shared arrangements for training, research
and telephone exchange planning and installation have been separated between
the two organizations. Appropriate coordination arrangements have been
established for exchange planning and installation with a proper allocation
of costs.



- 8-
Present Telecommunication Services
2i'.      Although existing customers have a reasonable standard of local
service, there is a large waiting list for telephone connections. Telephone
density in Pakistan currently stands at 0.28 telephone for 100 of population
wl-,ich is low when compared with other developing countries. The long dlis-
tance service is overloaded and subject to delays and interruptions but
completion of ongoing projects will provide a substantial improvement. The
long distance network is heavily dependent at present on the two tube coaxial
cable system which interconnects Karachi, Hyderabad, Lyallpur, Lahore and
Rawalpindi/Islamabad.   This was demonstrated when the 1973 floods in the
Ptnjab affected 60 coaxial repeater buildings over 200 miles of the route.
Communications between the north and south were disrupted for more than a
month. The coaxial cable capacity and open-wire routes are also fully
utilized and available long-distance circuits are overloaded resulting in
high congestion levels in busy periods. Subscriber trunk dialing (STD)
facilities are available on 15 routes between major cities, mainly those
served by the coaxial cable, and 68% of the long distance calls made last
year were subscriber dialed.
28.       Pakistan's international telecommunication facilities are good.
A satellite earth station located 20 miles northwest of Karachi and com-
missioned in November 1972 has improved Pakistan's international communica-
tions. The CENTO microwave route provides for international telegraph
and telephone connections to Iran and Turkey. HF radio connections are
maintained to centers not accessible via the satellite or the CENTO link.
29.       Works in progress which are being supported by Credits 145-PAK
and 186-PAK will increase local telephone exchange capacity by 72,000 to
232,000 lines and will yield 50,000 additional telephone connections
(DELs) bringing the total DELs to 183,000 before the commencement of the new
project works. The long distance network will also be substantially improved
by the introduction of new high capacity routes interconnecting the major
cities from Peshawar through Islamabad/Rawalpindi and Lahore to Karachi. In
particular, the Karachi-Lahore-Rawalpindi microwave system being financed
under Credit 186-PAK will supplement the existing coaxial cable and bring in-
creased capacity and improved reliability to the backbone of the Pakistan long
distance network.
Past IDA Lending
30.       The Association has made two prior Credits for telecommunications
development in Pakistan. The first Credit (145-PAK) signed in March 1969
for US$16.0 million was for the extension of facilities in both East and
West Pakistan. Following the independence of Bangladesh, US$5.2 million of
this Credit was cancelled as it related to equipment shipped or destined
for East Pakistan (Bangladesh) and an additional US$2.1 million was repaid
by Bangladesh from the proceeds of Credit 343-BD in recognition of equipment
earlier installed in its territory under Credit 145-PAK. The second Credit
(186-PAK) signed in May 1970 for US$15.0 million did not involve any investment



- 9 -
in East Pakistan and no part of it was cancelled. Both of these projects,
suffered initial delays due to the events of 1971: the first project has
now been substantially completed and the second is proceeding satisfactorily
and is expected to be completed by June 30, 1975, two years later than
originally anticipated. Foreign-exchange cost overruns on these two projects
together are expected to amount to approximately US$4.3 million and are being
provided for under the proposed credit.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The project, intended for implementation during FY75-77 and proposed
to be financed under a third IDA credit, was appraised in October/November,
1973. The Appraisal Report (No. 408a-PAK) on the proposed project is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A project summary is
attached as Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington in July, 1974.
Pakistan's Telecommunications Development Program
32.       T&T's program for FY3 1975-77, which will be supported by the
proposed Credit, consists of:
(a) Works to be carried out before the end of June 1975 which
will complete the projects covered by the first two IDA
Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAYK (with cost overruns to be
financed under the proposed project);
(b) new works in the 1975-77 expansion program (see below); and
(c) initial provisions for the next phase of development
which will increase local exchange capacity by a further
15,000 lines and will provide for connection of another
20,000 Direct Exchange Lines (DELs) in FY 1977.
33.       The total cost of the program is estimated at PRs 1,368 (US$138)
million with a foreign exchange component of PRs 698 (US$71) million.     The
program provides for an increase of telephone exchange capacity by 162,000
lines and for connecting about 145,000 DELs to the system. Backbone long
distance microwave and cable routes are to be established between important
cities. Open wire routes and VHIF radio systems will extend the long distance
service into rural areas. New trunk exchanges included in the program will
provide a through switching capability which will enable subscribers' trunk
dialing to be extended in range, increased in efficiency and developed towards
the ultimate goal of nationwide automatic service.
34.       To comply with the first Credit Agreement and to improve its
operations, the Government of Pakistan is reorganizing the Telegraph and
Telephone Department as a Board and is improving its accounting system. Com-
mercial-type, accrual-basis financial statements will be produced for FY75 and
subsequent years and they will be audited by the Director of Commercial



- 10 -
Audit of the Auditor General's office. In conjunction with the reorganization,
personnel now reporting to the Auditor-General but performing accounting
functions for T&T will be transferred to T&T and top level financial leadership
will be obtained to direct the function. With the organizational and account-
ing changes, and with their capable technical organization, T&T will have the
autonomy and ability to carry out their construction program and operate
effectively.
Project Description
35.       The project includes new works to be completed during FY 1975-77
and procurement of additional material to complete the two on-going projects.
The new works are:
(a) Installation of 75,000 lines of local telephone exchange
equipment and cable distribution networks to complement
these installations and to improve exchange equipment
utilization so that 75,000 new DELs can be connected;
(b) provision of three microwave routes between Quetta and
Sukkur, Hyderabad and Badin, and Karachi and Manora having
a total route mileage of 300; two cable routes, a coaxial
cable between Sahiwal and Bahawalnagar and an extension
of the existing Lahore-Khanewal carrier pair cable to
Multan, having a total route mileage of 80 miles; and
about 700 miles of open wire and VHF radio routes. These
routes will be equipped initially to provide a total of
approximately 700 additional long distance circuits;
(c) installation of manual switchboard positions for the
long-distance service and long distance switching equip-
ment to terminate an additional 1,200 circuits; and
(d) provision of three additional repeaters in the Karachi-
Rawalpindi microwave route (now under construction and
financed under IDA Credit 186-PAK) as a flood protection
measure.
36.       Credits 145-PAK (US$8.7 million net of cancellations and refundings)
and 186-PAK (US$15 million) supported T&T's 1969-74 development program and
provided for extensions to local telephone networks (125,000 DELs), moderni-
zation and expansion of long distance facilities, air conditioning of exchange
and transmission equipment rooms and consultant services. Due principally to
changes in currency parities, it has not been possible to place any contracts
for air conditioning equipment and the quantity of cables and open-wire line
material which could be procured has fallen short of the planned program
requirements. Additional financing is proposed to cover cables for local
distribution networks (US$2.6 million), line wire and accessories (US$1.4 mil-
lion) and air conditioning equipment (US$0.3 million).



37.       The estimated cost of the new works is Rs 669 (US$67.5) million
with a foreign exchange component of Rs 342 (US$34.6) million. The proposed
Credit would be for US$36.0 million. Of this amount, US$31.7 million would
finance the foreign exchange requirement for all items in the project listed
above except for 25,000 lines of local exchange equipment produced from
materials requiring a foreign exchange component of US$2.8 million which will
be financed by bilateral loans and credits. Of the US$31.7 million, US$22.1
million would finance equipment imported by T&T and US$9.6 million would
finance the foreign exchange content (raw materials and components) of
domestic production. The balance of the Credit, US$4.3 million, would finance
the increased foreign exchange costs of on-going works included in the
projects financed by IDA Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK.
Financing Plan
38.       T&T's financing plan for FY 1975-77 estimates that 53% of the
funds required will be provided from internal generation. The remainder
will be provided from borrowings -- 9% from bilateral loans and credits
already secured, 1% from the previous IDA Credit 186-PAK, and 31%. frco e
proposed IDA Credit. The remaining 6% relates to the future program whose
source of funding will not be secured until this phase of the program is
finalized and can be presented to possible financial sources, including the
Bank Group. The high level of internal generation during the project period
illustrates the strong position of the entity. The relending terms of the
proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit would be 24 years including a four-year
grace period and an interest rate of 8-1/4%, the current interest rate
charged by the Government in onlending funds for such purposes (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(b)). T&T will carry the foreign exchange
risk. The debt equity ratio during the project period will vary from 19/81
to 29/71 which is satisfactory.    Debt servicing coverage of at least 8.8:1
is projected for all years of the project period. Except as the Association
shall otherwise agree, the Government would not incur additional debt for
the benefit of T&T unless this ratio is at least 1.5:1 (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.07).
39.       Operating revenues are expected to increase at an average of
about 19.8% per year from 1972 to 1978 due mainly to the growth of the system
and to the improved long distance facilities. Operating expenses, exclusive
of depreciation, are projected to increase at a rate of about 15.5% per year.
Thus the operating ratio will decrease from an acceptable level of 58 to an
even more impressive 48. The Government has agreed that the ratio of T&T's
staff to the number of telephones in service will be reduced at a rate not
less than 4% per annum during the period of the project (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.03). The Government has also agreed (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.06) that tariffs will be maintained at a level to produce
a rate of return of not less than 10% on average net fixed assets in operation,
properly revalued from time to time, as from FY1975. The forecast rate of
return is 14.7% in FY76 and 17.3% in FY77.

Procurement and Disbursement
40.       All equipment and materials imported directly by T&T, costing
US$26.0 million (including US$4.3 million for on-going works) and to be
financed under the Credit, would be subject to international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement."
Telephone switching equipment and carrier multiplex equipment, the estimated
foreign exchange component cost of which is US$9.6 million, would be purchased
from domestic factories. The microwave radio equipment to be purchased at an
estimated cost of US$0.4 million to allow re-routing of the Karachi-Rawalpindi
system as a flood protection measure should, for reasons of compatibility,
be obtained from the supplier of the equipment at present being installed on
that route. Prices will be negotiated on the basis of the previous interna-
tional bid price.
41.       Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP) and Carrier Telephone
Industries (CTI) produce good quality equipment at prices which are compe-
titive with international prices. TIP has, in fact, successfully exported
equipment to other countries. The TIP and CTI factories have the capacity
to meet the delivery requirements of T&T and local manufacture results in
about a 50% saving in foreign exchange costs in both cases. There are also
a number of operational benefits for T&T, arising from shortened lead times
and availability of repair facilities and spares for complex equipment,
apart from the benefits of standardization which are significant, particu-
larly for switching equipment. Except for proprietary components available
from only one supplier and amounting to less than 20% of the value of factory
imports, all materials and components imported for local manufacture will be
obtained through methods of international procurement as normally employed
by factories.
42.       Disbursement of IDA funds would be made against CIF costs incurred
bv T&T to import equipment, cables and materials. In respect of procurement
from dom,estic factories, it is proposed to disburse to T&T against invoices
for completed equipment delivered to T&T at a predetermined percentage, re-
presenting the average foreign exchange content of the factory's material
and component cost. This percentage was established for both TIP and CTI
to be about 50% of the ex-factory price.
Project Benefits
43.       The basic justification for the project is the support it will
give to Pakistan's national development by providing essential services
for industry, commerce, agriculture and Government administration. Dis-
persion of industry and agriculture and the distances separating centers
of population make good communications essential for efficient marshalling
of inputs and marketing of outputs, for effective usage of transportation
and for administrative efficiency. Pakistan's existing telecommunication
facilities are inadequate and the proposed program is the minimum which
should be undertaken to avoid impeding Pakistan's general economic devel-
opment.



- 13 -
44.       Service will be provided to some of the waiting applicants in the
24 largest cities of Pakistan and the long-distance components of the project
will make high-quality communications more widely available throughout the
country. About 10% of the total project expenditures is devoted to improv-
ing service to rural areas including provision of facilities in the under-
developed areas where existing facilities are negligible or non-existent.
These works will contribute to implementation of Government policy for
improvement of conditions for rural communities and will provide essential
infrastructure for rural and agricultural development.
45.       The rate of return on the project, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs, excluding taxes and duties attributable
to it, is 23%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted and even when assuming
an unfavorable combination of conditions, the rate of return is an acceptable
14%. The true economic return on the project is undoubtedly higher than the
foregoing suggests, since (a) the prices charged do not adequately measure
the full benefits to the subscribers, (b) there are external benefits which
accrue to parties other than those who pay directly for use of the facilities..
and (c) the costs include the full costs of extending service to new areas
even though the full benefits will be obtained only in the future when
additional lines are connected in these areas.
46.       The Government will receive a direct fiscal benefit during the
project period. The contribution to Government is estimated to total Rs 480.7
million. Another Rs 70.2 million would be paid to Government in customs
duties on imported materials and equipment. In addition, Government will
receive an estimated Rs 84.4 million as payment of interest at commercial
rates for funds on-lent to T&T from existing and proposed IDA Credits. Thus
the total receipts by Government will be Rs 635.2 million in the project
period without any offsetting contribution by Government of funds to finance
T&T's operations or development program.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and International Development Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       In addition to the special features referred to in paragraphs 20,
30, 33 and 34, the Development Credit Agreement makes provision whereunder
the proceeds of future foreign loans incurred by the Government for the
benefit of T&T are to be on-lent to, and serviced by, T&T in accordance with
current Ministry of Finance directives which prescribe an interest rate not
less than the rate payable by the Government on such foreign loans (Develop-
ment Credit Agreement, Section 4.08).

C.   Projects in Execution -
Loan No. 266        Indus Basin:  US$90 Million Loan of September 19,
1960; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Some minor remedial works have still to be finished and settlement remains
to be made on a number of claims. Further disbursement of this Loan (main-
ly for Tarbela Dam), which was interrupted in 1971 by agreement with the
United States in order to disburse first the loan contribution of the
United States to the Indus Basin Development Fund, has now resumed.   Work
on the Tarbela Dam project is proceeding on schedule. The original Closing
Date of September 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 50          Education: US$8.5 Mfillion Credit of March 25, 1964:
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project suffered initial delays due to administrative
difficulties, shortages of building materials, lack of local funds, the
1971 war and, more recently, extensive floods. The pace of implementation
has improved but problems of equipment procurement and shortages of building
materials remain. All construction contracts have been awarded, of which
about 76% are completed. Equipment installed at the agricultural university
represents about 80% of the total allocated. The project is expected to be
completed by the new Closing Date.
Loan No. 376        Karachi Port:  US$17.0 1MIillion Loan of March 14, 1964;
Closing Date: .June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially.   The
total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of US$37.5
million to US$47.0 million but there has been no change in the foreign
exchange component of US$17.0 million. This increase has not materially
affected the economic justification of the project. The project was first
delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves. In 1967
work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was found
that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant further
delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the delay.
However, the project is now complete apart from some she/ work and the
completion of dredging operations.  The Closing Date is expected to be post-
ponecl to enable disbursement to be made for consultant's supervision costs.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanc:ed evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam; US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are expected until FY 1976. Good progress is being maintained on
the project. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted through
tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage - the construction of the
closure section of the dam - to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974, the main
embankment had been completed to full height, and the first impoundment
began on schedule on July 1, 1974. In mid August difficulties were encountered
in the operation of the tunnel gates. Efforts are under way to resolve these
difficulties. The main civil works contractors have submitted substantial
claims on account of labor costs, inflation and the 1972 devaluation of the
Rupee which are being considered by a special Government committee.
Cr. No. 145          Telecommunications; US$16.0 Mlillion Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing Date:   December 31, 1974
Cr. No. 186          Telecommunications; US$15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
There have been delays in implementing both these credits. The
original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the two credits of
about US$11.3 million in the former East Wing and US$19.7 million in the
West. US$5.2 million of the undisbursed balance of Credit 145-PAX was
cancelled in November, 1972 after a telecommunications project to Bangladesh
was approved. The Closing Date of 145-PAK was extended from the original
date of December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1974. The Closing Date of Credit
186-PAK has been extended from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975; and
the credit proceeds have been reallocated to reflect the increased costs
of imports resulting from the realignment of currencies. This has also
allowed GOP more time for the reorganization of the Pakistan Telephone and
Telegraph Department, the introduction of an effective accounting system
and the completion of installation of equipment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC; US$40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974, has been extended to September 30, 1975, to enable
disbursements to be made for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621         Railways; US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969:
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 7 pages
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead. The change was based on a
feasibility study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France), who indicated
that a new yard at Pipri would be economically and operationally preferable.
The original Closing Date of Decenmber 31, 1972, has been extended by three
years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for Pipri yard to be built and
the balance of the loan has been reallocated. PWR has also reappointed the
consultants for a period of 18 months.
Cr. No. 157         Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the original
schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in lending for
tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical connections were
originally responsible for this delay. IThe original Closing Date of
June 30, 1972, was first extended to June 30, 1974 and then to December 31,
1974.
Cr. No, 177          Development Finance Company - IDBP:  US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Although IDBP has restored its organizational effectiveness, the
loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching repercussions on its
financial position. Pending a satisfactory solution of this problem, and
to enable IDBP to resume lending to industry, the unwithdrawn amount of the
credit has been converted into a Government owned fund administered by
IDBP as an agent of the Government. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1974, has been postponed to December 31, 1977.
Loan No. 696         Gas Transmission:  US$19.2 Million Loan of June 29,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3%). The project was
substantially completed in July 1973, but to enable disbursements to be
made for retention payments and some equipment procurement, the original
Closing Date of June 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 206          Engineering Education: US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Civil works and equipment procurement are expected to be completed
six months prior to the closing date. However, progress in staff develop-
ment has been poor, partly because of frequent changes in the post of
principal, and the staff development program may extend some two years beyond
the closing date. Civil works costs are expected to be about 90 percent above



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 7 pages
the appraisal estimate in rupee terms and the government may need to provide
an additional Rs 7.0 million to meet its share of increased construction costs.
Because of the 1972 devaluation of the rupee, the overall project cost ex-
pressed in U.S. dollars is unlikely to exceed the original estimate of
US$6.3 million.
Credit No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution: US$23.0
Million Credit of August 14, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Implementation of the project is now proceeding much more
satisfactorily. Contracts to the value of about US$17.0 million equivalent
have been placed. Orders for remaining equipment are expected to be placed
soon. The first consignments of equipment are beginning to arrive in
Pakistan. Some difficulty has been experienced in acquiring the necessary
sites for substations and the delivery of six 301VA transformers has had
to be delayed. WAPDA is making every effort to speed up acquisition pro-
ceedings. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 has been postponed
to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 398          Industrial Import II:  US$45.0 Mtillion Credit of
June 15, 1973: Closing Date: September 30, 1974
Disbursements have been completed.
Cr. No. 422          Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of
July 19, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Construction has not yet started. The closing date for
receiving bids for civil works is September 2.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Invesment: USS25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The first sub-project has been approved.
Cr. No. 466         Flood Rehabilitation: US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Good progress has been made in restoring the protective bunds and
canals damaged during the 1973 floods, largely by labor-intensive methods,
and most of the work were completed before the 1974 monsoon season. The
restoration of road works has been considerably slower, and provisions made
under the credit for importation of spare parts for the repair of construc-
tion machinery have been delayed due to administrative difficulties, with
the result that machinery is still in very short supply.

Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan
