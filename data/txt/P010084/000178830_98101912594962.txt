T!5LEGRAPH AND T:LEPHONE DEPARTMENT (T&T)
APPAISAL OF A THI1  TELECOMJUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMtARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project appraised in this report is scheduled to be imple-
mented during FYs 1975-77. The estimated cost of the project is PRs 710.9
(US$71.8) million with a foreign exchange component of PRa 384.5 (US$38.8)
million. The proposed Credit of PRs 356.4 (US$36.0) million would finance
part of the foreign exchange component for new works in this period amount-
ing to PRs 314.2 (US$31.7) million and in addition would cover foreign
exchange cost overruns of PRa 42.2 (US$UO3) million on the projects financed
by prior IDA Credits 145-PJAX and 186-PAX.
ii.       The Association has made two prior Credits for telecommunications
development in Pakistan.  The first Credit (145-PAK) signed in March 1969
for US$16.0 million was for the extension of facilities in both East and
West Pakistan. Following the independence of Bangladesh, US$5.2 million
of this Credit was cancelled as it related to equipment shipped or destined
for East Pakistan (Bangladesh) and an additional US$2.1 million was repaid
by Bangladesh from the proceeds of Credit 343-BD in recognition of equip-
ment earlier installed in its territory under Credit 145-PAK. The second
Credit (186-PAK) signed in May 1970 for US$15.0 million did not identify
any specific provision in East Pakistan and therefore was not subjected to
any cancellation.  Both of these projects, after some initial delay due to
the unsettled conditions, are proceeding satisfactorily and are expected
to be completed by June 30, 1974 and 1975 respectively.
iii.      Pakistan has widely dispersed industrial, agricultural and popu-
lation centers which need the support of an efficient telecommunication
service. Current local exchange facilities are inadequate and there is a
waiting list of 140,000 which is approximately equal to the existing num-
ber of subscribers.  Long distance services are also inadequate, The
project is designed to improve the telecommunication service by meeting
part of the demand for new telephone connections by providing 75,000 lines
of local telephone exchange equipment and by extending and improving the
quality of the long distance service. This project in relation to demand
is modest and there will be a waiting list of 110,000 at its completion.
It, however, represents the limit of T&T construction capacity.
iv.       To comply with the first Credit Agreement and to improve its
operations, the Government of Pakistan is reorganizing the Telegraph and
Telephone Department as a Board and is installing an improved accounting
system. In conJunction with the reorganization, personnel now reporting
to the Auditor-General b'ou  performing accounting function for T&T will be
transferred to T¶C z- -nao'o lsve. financial leadership will be obtained to
direct the funct- ron  'in 4e or anizationa-. and accounting changes, and
with their capable  -e,a!z orga.rzzat-^ on, T&T will have the autonomy and
ability to carry out t      construction program a:d operate effectively.



- ii -
V.        All equipment and material procured under the project and
imported directly by T&T would be subjected to international competitive
bidding. Telephone switching equipment and carrier multiplex equipment
would be purchased directly from well-established domestic factories under
Government majority ounership and is proposed for financing under the
Credit to the extent of its estimated foreign exchange component.
vi.       The project is technically and financially sound and economi-
cally justified. The economic rate of return is estimated to be 23%.
During the project period, earnings will be sufficient without requiring
any tariff revision to provide at least a 10% rate of return on average
net fixed assets. Internally generated funds during this period will be
adequate to provide for 53% of the funds required for the development
program and service all debt associated with T&T's current operations.
vii.      The borrower would be the Government of Pakistan which would
relend the funds to the beneficiary, the Telegraph and Telephone Department
(T&T), which would be responsible for the execution of the project.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$36.0 million.

TELERAPH AND TELEPHONE DiEPAR2TENT (T&T)
APPRAISAL OF A THID TEGCOiJiŽUCATIONS PROJECT
1 . INTRODUCTION
1.01      In July 1973 the Government of Pakistan requested IDA assistance
in financing a third telecounications project and in providing additional
funds so that cost overrans on prior projects could be met.
1.02      The Government of Pakistan would be the borrower and would relend
the proceeds of the Credit to the Telegraph and Telephone Department (T&T),
the beneficiary, at 8&i per annum for a term of 24 years, including a
four-year grace period.
1.03      The project which is scheduled to be carried out between July
1974 and June 1977 will provide 75,000 lines of local exchange equipment
and cables to partia81y meet the demand for new connections, and additional
long distance transmission and switching equipment to improve and extend
the long distance network, and will provide additional financing to meet
cost overruns on projects under Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK as a result of
changes in currency parities and thus enable completion of the works on
these projects. The estimated cost of the project is PRa 710.9 (US$71.8)
million with a foreign exchange component of PRB 384.5 (US$38.8) million.
An IDA Credit of PRs 356.4 (Us$36.0 million is proposed, of which PRs 314.2
(US$31.7) million will cover part of the foreign exchange cost of the new
works in this period and PRs 42.2 (US$4.3) million will cover the cost
overruns on the projects under the prior IDA Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK.
1.04      The proposed Credit would be the Association's third for tele-
ccuumunications development in Pakistan. The first Credit (145-PAK) for
US$16.0 million for extension of facilities in both East and West Pakistan
was related to the 1969-72 program. Following Bangladesh obtaining its
independence, the sum of US$5.2 million was cancelled and US$2.1 million
was repaid by Bangladesh in respect of works completed or equipment clearly
identifiable as delivered to Bangladesh, leaving a balance of US$8.7 mil-
lion available to Pakistan. After some delay due to the unsettled condi-
tions in Pakistan during 1971 and 1972, the project is proceeding satisfac-
torily and is scheduled for completion by June 30, 1974. The second Credit
(186-PAK) for US$15.0 million contains long distance provisions in West
Pakistan and extension of the local telephone network. No cancellation
of funds was made as the project description did not identify arn specific
provisions in East Pakistan; the entire amount therefore remained available
to Pakistan. This project, although also delayed, is proceeding satisfac-
torily and is scheduled for completion by June 30, 1975.
1.05      This report is based on information provided by T&T and the find-
ings of a mission composed of C. R. Dickenson, G. E. Hams, and R. C. Mitchell
which visited Pakistan in October and November 1973.

2.  THE ECONOMY .110 THE SECTOt
The Economy
2.01      Pakistan is located on the Arabian Sea with Iran to the west,
Afghanistan to the northwest and india to the east. Its topography is
made up of plains in the north in the province of Punjab and Ln the south
in the province of Sind with mountains and foothills of the Hindu Kush
and Himalayas to the west and north and the Thar Desert in the southeast.
The population of over 65 million is heavily concentrated in the cities
and in the fertile areas along the rivers. A large area of law popula-
tion density separates Karachi, the major city and only port, by more
than 800 miles from the other main population centers of Lahore,
Rawalpindi/Islamabad and Peshawar.
2.02      The GDP of Pakistan was estimated at 48 billion rupees (rY 1972).
Agriculture is the principal economic activity producing about 35% of the
GDP and employing 55% of the work force. Cotton alone makes up over 50%
of total export value.
2.03      The Government of Pakistan is aware of the necessity to build
an adequate infrastructure to support this needed industrial and agricul-
tural development. The substantial distance between the only port,
Karachi, the agricultural centers of the Punjab and Sind and the indus-
trial centers make an effective telecommunications systerm essential to
this development. An adequate system is necessary to modern marketing,
the establishment of secondary industrial centers, export promotion and
increased business and administrative efficiency. The role of telecom-
munications in the efficient organization of transportation assumes even
greater importance with rising fuel costs and shortages of fuel supply.
The Telecommnications Sector
2.04      The telecommunications sector consists of T&T which is respon-
sible for the operation of all local, long distance and international
public telecommunication services in Pakistan and two factories which
produce telecommunications equipment; Telephone Industries of Pakistan
(TIP) which manufactures switching equipment, telephones and teleprinters
and C5arrier Telephone Industries (CTI) which produces multiplex equipment.
Other important responsibilities of T&T are the licensing of commercial
and amateur radio transmitters, control of radio spectrum usage in Pakistan
involving registration of frequencies and operation of a radio monitoring
service.
2.05      T&T is a Government department under the control of the Ministry
of Communications with its budget and development plan approved by the
E>cecutive Committee of the National Economic Council Some of T&T's mana-
gerlal and operating functions are at present performed by other Govern-
ment authorities, financial control being exercised by the Ministry of
2inance and various accounting, in addition to auditing, functions being



-3-
performed by the Auditor-General's staff.  The Government and the
Association have agreed that the present arrangements are neither effi-
cient nor desirable. As a requirement of the first IDA Credit 145-PAK,
the Government of Pakistan agreed to reorganize T&T, with the assistance
of consultants, in order to provide the Chief Executive of T&T with ade-
quate financial and operational autonomy to effectively manage its
activities and operations. T&T was to be reorganized as a Board in
accordance with the consultants' recommendations by the scheduled date
for completion of the first Bank Group assisted project (see para. 5.02).
2.06      Both TIP and CTI are commercial corporations with the Government
of Pakistan the majority shareholder. The other shareholder in both com-
panies is Siemens AG who also provide technical support. Pakistan pro-
vides the main technical effort and all financial and managerial direction.
2.07      The Credit Agreement for 145-PAK required that a fully commercial
relationship exist between T&T and TIP. This requirement has been ful-
filled and at present there are no interest-free loans to TIP. Installa-
tions by TIP of equipment for T&T are also now subject to guarantee or
retention payments. Previously shared arrangements for training, research
and telephone exchange planning and installation have been separated
between the two organizations. Appropriate coordination arrangements have
been established for exchange planning and installation with a proper
allocation of costs.
Existing Telecommunications Facilities
2.08      Although existing customers have a reasonable standard of local
service, there is a large waiting list for telephone connections. The
long distance service is overloaded and subject to delays and interrup-
tions but completion of ongoing projects will provide a substantial
improvement. Pakistan's international telecommunication facilities are
good. Information on basic data and existing facilities is set out below
and detailed in Annexes 2 and 3.
Local Telephone Service
2.09      Local telephone service is provided by 99 automatic and 340
manual exchanges with total installed capacity at June 30, 1973 of 159,792
and 22,258 lines respectively. There were 133,257 direct exchange lines
(DELs) giving an overall exchange equipment utilization of 73%. This
fairly low utilization under conditions of heavy demand is mainly the
result of delay in the provision of the associated cable network. The
automatic exchanges are entirely of step by step type -- the older
exchanges using two motion selectors and those installed since 1967 using
modern EMD selectors. Subscriber line distribution is primarily under-
ground cable in cities with aerial cable and open wire in the small towns
and rural areas.



- 41 -
2.10      Telephone density in Pakistaan currently stands at 0.28 telephone
for 1 00 of population which is low when compared v;ith other developing
countries.  (Annex 1 gives statistics of telephone density for a number
of countries.)
Long Distance Telephone Service
2.11      The long distance network is heavily dependent at present on
the two tube coaxial cable system which interconnects Karachi, Hyderabad,
Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi/Islamabad. This was demonstrated when
the recent record flood levels in the Punjab affected 60 coaxial repeater
buildings over 200 miles of the route. Communications between the north
and south were disrupted for more than a month.
2.12      The coaxial cable capacity is also fully utilized and available
long distance circuits are overloaded resulting in high congestion levels
in busy periods. The remainder of the long distance network comprises
open wire routes which are in many cases of insufficient capacity to meet
demand and are subject to interruption due to storms and, in particular,
to theft of copper line wire.
2.13      Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) facilities are available on 15
routes between major cities mainly those served by the coaxial cable and
68% of the over 40 million long distance calls made in the year were sub-
scriber dialed. Further extension in the use of this service is at present
limited as the existing facilities only permit point-to-point working.
Telegraph and Telex Facilities
2.14      A public telegraph service is mainly operated through point-to-
point circuits linking 745 offices throughout the country. A Gentex
service has been introduced recently with automatic switching centers in
Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. A telex network based on the same auto-
matic switching centers together with 10 manual exchanges serves 264
subscribers.
International Facilities
2.15      The satellite earth station located 20 miles northwest of Karachi
and commissioned in November 1972 has improved Pakistan's international
communications, as indicated by the 75% increase in annual international
telephone calls during FY 1973 to a total of about 1 million calls. The
CENTO microwave route provides for international telegraph and telephone
connections to Iran and Turkey. HF radio connections are maintained to
centers not accessible via the satellite or the CENTO link.
Works in Progress
2.16      Works in progress which are being supported by Credits 145-PAK
and 186-PAK will increase local telephone exchange capacity by 72,000
lines and will yield 50,000 additional telephone connections (DELs) before
the commencement of the new project. The long distance network will also



be substantially improved by the introduction of new high capacity routes
interconnecting the major cities from Peshawar through Islamabad/Rawalpindi
and Lahore to Karachi. In particular, the Karachi-Lahore-Rawalpindi micro-
wave system being financed under 186-PAK will supplement the existing
coaxial cable bringing increased capacity and improved reliability to the
backbone of the Pakistan long distance network.



3. THE PROGRAM AIS THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      TVr's program for FYs 1974-77, which will be suppcrtad by the
proposed Credit, consists of:
(a) Works to be carried out before the and of June 1975 which
will ccmplete the projects covered by the first two IDA
Credits 145-PFA  and 186-PAK;
(b) the project ccmposed of new works in the 1975-77 expan-
sion program (see para. 3.04 below); and
(c) initial provisions for the next phase of development which
will increase local exchange capacity by a further 15,000
lines and will provide for connection of another 20,000
DELs in FE 1977.
3.02      The total cost of the program is estimated at PRs 1,368 (US$138)
million with a foreign exchange component of PRs 698 (US$71) million.
3.03      The program provides for an increase of telephone exchange capac-
ity by 162,000 lines and for connecting about 145,000 DEsA to the system.
Backbone long distance microwave and cable routes are to be established
between important cities. Open wire routes and VHF radio systems will
extend the long distance service into rural areas. New trunk exchanges
included in the program will provide a through switching capability which
will enable subscribers' trunk dialing to be extended in range; increased
in efficiency; and developed towards the ultimate goal of nationwide auto-
matic service.
The ProJect
3.04      The project comprises:
A. New works to be completed during FYs 1975-77.
(i) Installation of 75,000 lines of local telephone exchange
equipment and cable distribution networks to complement
these installations and to improve exchange equipment
utilization so that 75,000 new DELs can be connected;
(ii) provision of three microwave routes between Quetta and
Sukkur,  Hyderabad and Badin, and Karachi and Manora having
a total route mileage of 300; two cable routes, a coaxial
cable between Sahiwal and Bahawalnagar and an extension
of the existing Lahore-Khanewal carrier pair cable to
Multan, having a total route mileage of 80 miles; and
about 700 miles of open wire and VHF radio routes. These
routes will be equipped initially to provide 700 additional
long distance circuits;



-7-
(iii)  installation of manual switchboard positions for the long
distance service and long distance switching equipment to
terminate an additional 1200 circuits;
(iv) provision of three additional repeaters in the Karachi-
Rawalpindi microwave route (now under construction and

3.05     The estimated cost of the new works in the project is PRs 668.7
(US$67.5) miUion with a foreign exchange component of PRB 342.3 (US$34.6)
million.  The foreign exchange cost overrun items will require a further
PRs 42.2 (US$4.3) million.

3.07      All costs in this appraisal are based on conditioas prevailing
in Dccember 1973. Costs for imported equipment and services are based
on TMr's experience of prices obtained for ongoing projects. Those for
locally manufactured equipment are based on current contracts and detailed
quotations for sup3pl of equipment for FY 1971. Local expenditure for
civil works, buildings and installation is estimated on the basis of
recent experience. These various estimates are reasonable. Custaa3 duties
of 20% on imported equipment have been included in the local project costs.
Contingencies
3.08      Price contingencies provided for in the estimates of total proj-
ect costs amount to 20% of foreign exchange costs and 19% of 'Local costs.
The year-by-year allowances on foreign exchange costs are FY 75 - 10%, FY 76 -
20% and F! 77 - 32%. The contingencies are based on the Bank Group's view
of the likely average price increases in the years covered by the project
taking into account the effects of increased oil and comodity prices.
These allowances should be ample in the teleconmunications field where the
direct effects of fuel costs on equipment manufacture and installation are
small and where competition between suppliers should remain high. Physical
contingencies have been allowed amounting to 5% of both local and foreign
exchange costs for items in the project associated with the long distance
network, where quantity increases could occur due to deviations from the
planned routings and to the need to add equipment to handle additional traf-
fic, which could arise when the present overloaded system is relieved. No
physical contingencies are associated with either local or foreign exchange
costs of local service items. These items are part of a continuing growth
process and are comprised of a large number of component works spread
throughout Pakistan. T&TIs past experience makes possible fairly accurate
estimation of the material and labor required for these individual works
and those deviations from the estimates which may occur in execution will
tend to balance out in the aggregate of works.
Item Proposed for IDA Financing
3.09      The proposed Credit would be for US$36.0 million.  Of this amount,
US$31.7 million would finance the foreign exchange requirment for all new
works in the project set out under (A) in paragraph 3.04i above except for
25,000 lines of exchange equipment produced from materials requiring a
foreign exchange component of US$2.8 million which will be financed by bilat-
eral loans and credits. The balance of the Credit, US$4.3 million, would finance
the increased foreign exchange requirements for the projects financed by IDA
Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK due largely to changes in currency parities.
The foreign exchange financing over the program period FY 74-77 would then
be as follows:

3.10      The proposed Credil of US$o6.40 million would provide US$22.1 for
the  new works and US$4.3 million for Completion of on-going works to
finance equipment imported by T&T ana uS$9.6 million for foreign exchange
content of domestic production, represenrting raw materials and components
(see paras. 3.14 - 3.16 and 3.18). The items involved are:

2.  Carrier multiplex equipment (CTI)             1.6
9.6
Total            36.0
Procurement Arrangements
3.11      All equipment and materials imported directly by T&T, costing
US$26.0 million and to be financed under the Credit, would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
"Guidelines for Procurement".
3.12      Telephone switching equipment and carrier multiplex equipment,
the estimated foreign exchange component cost of which is US$9.6 million,
would be purchased from domestic factories (see paras. 3.14 - 3.16
relating to domestic production and 3.18 disbursement).
3.13      The microwave radio equipment to be purchased at an estimated
cost of US$0.4 million to allow re-routing of the Karachi-Rawalpindi
system as a flood protection measure should, for reasons of compatibility,
be obtained from the supplier of the equipment at present being installed
on that route. Prices will be based on the previous international bid
price.
Domestic Production
3.14      Telephone Industries of Pakistan was established in 1952 with
the Pakistan Government as the major shareholder (83%) and with technical
support from Siemens A.G., Germany, the other shareholder, TIP produces
good quality EKD equipment at a price which is competitive with inter-
national prices.  TIP has, in fact, successfully exported equipment to
other countries. The factory is operating below single shift capacity



and should not en.ourier any ri'ficf r: _.et:ing .g3  I&T's total requirements
during the project period.  Garrier Te1e;hone lnadustries was established in
1969 in collaboration with Siemens A.G. with a 60% Government ownership and
is producing multiplex equipment of Siemens' design. The product quality
is good and the price is in line with _nternational prices.  The factory
has capacity to meet the delivery requirements of TOT. More information on
these domestic companies is given in Annex 6.
3.15      The local products are competitIve in price with alterna_tves
available from overseas and local manufacture results in about a 50% saving
in foreign exchange costs in both cases.  There are also a :rrxber of opera-
tional benefits for T&T, arising from shortened lead times and availability
of repair facilities and spares for complex equipment, apart from the bene-
fits of standardization which are significant, particularly for the switching
equipment.  For convenience, these benefits are summarized in Annex 6.
3.16      Except for proprietary components available from only one supplier
and amounting to less than 20% of the value of factory import3, all materials
and components imported for local manufacture will be obtained through
methods of international procurement as normally employed by factories.
Disbursement
3.17      Disbursement of IDA funds would be made against CIF costs incurred
by T&T to import equipment, cables and materials.
3.18      In respect of procurement from domestic factories, it is proposed
to disburse to T&T against invoices for completed equipment delivered to
T&T at a predetermined percentage, representing the average foreign exchange
content of the factory's material and component cost. This percentage was
established for both TIP and CTI, to be about 50% of the ex-factory price,
3.19      A schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements under the proposed
Credit is shown in Annex 7. Because the project forms part of a continuing
investment program, any unused credit balance should, it is proposed, be
applied, after consultation with IDA, to the purchase of additional goods
similar to those procured under the Credit.
Execution of the Project
3.20      T&T has the capability to plan, design and execute the project
including the installation of cables and open wire lines and, in collabora-
tion with TIP, the installation of all telephone exchange equipment.  Long
disvance cables and microwave radio syatvems will be installed by T&T's
staff with assistance from suppliers' engineers. As discussed in paragraph
5.o6, T&T has established comprehensive technical training facilities which,
witn overseas technical assWstaoe I wi   ensure an adequate supply of
skilled staff to carry ouv the development program and operate the facili-
ties provided.



3.21      The project has been appra4sed in the context of an agreed T&T
construction program which has been found to be financially viable and
which is judged to be close to the maximum effort which can be mounted
by T&T for the period. The agreement of the Government of Pakistan has
therefore been obtained that, prior to completion of the project, no
major expansion of telecommun;cations facilities, which costs more than
the equivalent of US$2 million in any fiscal year and which is not
included in the agreed program, will be undertaken without prior consul-
tation and agreement with the Association.

4.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.01      The basic justification for the project is the support it will
give to Pakistan's national development by providing essential services
for industry, commerce, agriculture and Government administration.
Dispersion of industry and agriculture and the distances separating cen-
ters of population make good communications essential for efficient
marshalling of inputs and marketing of outputs, for effective usage of
transportation and for administrative efficiency. Pakistan's existing
telecommunication facilities are inadequate (see para. 2.08) and the
proposed program is the minimum which should be undertaken to avoid
impediment of Pakistan's general economic development.
4.02      The inadequacy of the local telephone service is indicated by
the low telephone density of 0.28 telephone per 100 of population exist-
ing at June 1973 and by the waiting list of 140,000 customers, many of
whom have been waiting years for connection.  The program increases the
number of direct exchange lines by the end of FY 1977 by 145,000 of which
the project accounts for 75,000, but even then the telephone density will
still be low and the waiting list large.
4.03      The completion of long distance routes in the ongoing works,
including the routes being financed under Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK,
will establish a reliable network interconnecting the major cities (please
see map IBRD 10821). The dependence of Pakistan's long distance service
on the Karachi-Lahore-Rawalpindi coaxial cable system only will be
removed and much needed relief from traffic congestion will be gained
through increased traffic-carrying capacity. The long distance components
of the project will extend the benefits of this high quality network to
more centers of population and also deeper into rural areas. The princi-
pal route involved, the Sukkur-Quetta microwave route, will also permit
the Karachi-Quetta section of the CENTO microwave system to Iran and
Turkey to be retired from service. The CENTO system, which is of early
design, has substandard performance and is very costly to maintain.
4.04      Automatic long distance switching centers being provided in the
nine major cities as part of the ongoing works will establish the founda-
tion for a true nationwide automatic service. This is needed to give T&T
benefits from lower operating costs and more efficient usage of long dis-
tance circuits and in addition will provide customers with an economic
and convenient service. The project will augment these exchanges to pro-
vide for some 1200 additional long distance circuits.
4.05      About 20% of the total project expenditures is devoted to improv-
ing service to rural areas by giving them access to the high quality long
distance network and by provision of facilities in the underdeveloped areas
where existing facilities are negligible or non-existent. These latter
works include fifty-seven new manual exchanges (10 - 50 line capacity),



- 13 -
50 new public telephone offices (PCOs) and circuits connecting them to
their parent centers and the long distance network. This part of the
project will contribute to implementation of Government policy for improve-
mont of conditions for rural communities and will provide an essential
infrastructure for rural and agricultural development.
4.06      The program is a balanced allocation of the limited resources
available to T&T. Sufficient investment is allocated to augmenting the
network traffic-carrying capacity to satisfy the top priority need for
preserving an adequate quality of service to the existing customers and
to provide for new customers. Network extensions with high national
priority are included and the remainder of the funds are allocated to
meeting demand for new connections.
Demand for Telecommunications Services
Local Telephone Service
4.07      As of June 30, 1973, Pakistan had 133,257 DELs connected to its
telephone network and waiting applicants stood at 140,000, giving a total
demand for service of 273,000 connections. Growth of demand (existing
plus waiting applicants) which is discussed in Annex 8 has been projected
over the project period to increase at a conservative rate of 9.5%,
giving total estimated demand at the end of FY 1977 of 388,000 connections.
The programmed increase of 145,000 DELs will still leave, therefore, a
waiting list of about 11 0,000.
Long Distance Service
4.08      The demand for long distance circuits and for switching equipment
terminations has resulted from route by route studies by T&T, taking into
account traffic growth due to (i) planned increase in the number of direct
exchange lines and (ii) need for improving the quality of service. These
forecasts appear reasonable and their aggregate is consistent with a fore-
cast made at the national level which is summarized in Annex 8. The pre-
dicted overall growth rate is 15% per annum.
Least Cost Solution
o.09      The least cost method of meeting the demand forecast depends on
(i) having made correct fundamental technological/economic decisions initi-
ally when planning the networks and (ii) following an optimum path in the
design, dimensioning and timing of the thousands of installations com-
prising the continuous development process.
4.10      Aindamental decisions taken some time ago by T&T, with advice
from German and Swedish consultants, include design of the nationwide dial-
ing network, standardization in the use of one switching system to be manu-
factured locally and the use of modern line practices including provision
of conduits and of cable distribution schemes utilizing cabinets and pil-
lars. These decisions, which are consistent with principles applied with
success in many countries, have determined the pattern of long distance
and local networks in Pakistan.



- 14 
4.11      The technical methods to be used in the large works included in
the project and program and the magnitude and timing of the works were
selected by T&T as components in the optimum path of development after
individual engineering/economic studies. The methods chosen for smaller
works and the sizes of plant items used were based on generalized solu-
tions which are available for the various classes of plant involved.
Return on Investment
4.12      The rate of return on the project, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs, excluding taxes and duties, attribu-
table to it, is 23% (Annex 9). When computing this rate of return the
price contingency provision was deducted from the capital expenditures in
order to reflect constant 1973 prices. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
and even when assuming an unfavorable combination of conditions, the rate
of return is an acceptable 14%.
±4.13     This rate of return reflects the subscriberst willingness to
pay. The true economic return on the project is undoubtedly higher than
the foregoing suggests since (a) the prices charged do not adequately
measure the full benefits to the subscribers, (b) there are external bene-
fits which accrue to parties other than those who pay directly for use of
the facilities and (c) the costs include the full costs of extending serv-
ice to new areas even though the full benefits will be obtained only in
the future when additional lines are connected in these areas.

5. THE BENEW`CIARY
5.01      T&T, the beneficiary of the proposed Credit, is responsible for
the provision and operation of all public telecommunication services in
Pakistan.
Organization and Management
5.02      T&T is organized as a department of Government within the
Ministry of Communications. At the time of the first project financed by
IDA Credit 145-PAK, the Association, the management of T&T and the Govern-
ment of Pakistan agreed that this type of organization was not the most
effective as it did not provide management with adequate autonomy for its
commercial-type activities and operations. The Credit Agreement requires
a reorganization acceptable to the Association originally by the comple-
tion of the project financed under Credit 145-PAK. Arthur D. Little, Inc.
(USA) were engaged as consultants to review the organizational structure
of T&T and make recommendations on its improvement. In a report, dated
December 1970, the consultants recommended reorganization as a Board with
eventual further reorganization as a statutory corporation at some future
date. The Government of Pakistan has subsequently agreed to reorganize
T&T as a Board with the necessary fiscal and operational autonomy. How-
ever, due to the unsettled conditions in Pakistan, this reorganization has
not been finalized. It was agreed during negotiation that the Government
of Pakistan would submit the plan for reorganization to IDA for review by
September 30, 1974 and, subject to such review, initiate action to
achieve this reorganization by December 31, 1974.
5.03      T&T's internal organization is shown in Chart WB 8264 (placed
after Annex 9). This structure is similar to that of many other telecom-
munications organizations and is satisfactory.
Staff and Training
5.04      As a requirement for the financing under Credit 186-PAK, T&T was
required to reduce the staffing per telephone ratio by at least 4% per
year. Its performance has been a reduction of approximately twice this
percentage per annum. As of June 30, 1973, T&T had a staff of 21,205 pro-
viding a staffing level of 115 per 1,000 telephones, which is high. During
negotiation, agreement was reached to repeat this covenant in the Credit
Agreement for the proposed Credit.
5.05      T&T has a capable senior management group supported by an ade-
quate technical staff group whose efficiency will further improve as a
result of T&T's extensive training program.
5.06      T&T's technical training facilities are being improved currently
and will be adequate to produce the technical staff for the construction
program and to maintain the growing telecommunications system. Courses
at the Haripur Staff College, which gives postgraduate study for higher



(degree) and middle (diploma) level enbgineers, are being upgraded with
the aid of three German experts. 2o'ur training schools at Karachi,
Lahore, Sukkur and Peshawar train technicians with the latter two schools
being developed with the aid of six German experts to produce staff for
maintenance of the EMD automatic switching equipment.
5.07      Training abroad is secured by T&T under UNDP and bilateral aid,
mostly from Federal Republic of Germany and from Sweden. About 25 scholar-
ships are being utilized each year.
5.08      An adequate training program has not been prcvided for the
accounting and financial personnel. The reason for the lack of a train-
ing program is that the authority for these functions is divided between
the Finance Ministry, the Auditor-General and the Chief Accounts Officer
of T&T. The Government of Pakistan recognizes that this situation must
be remedied if the staff is to effectively administer the planned com-
mercial accounting system. Government proposes to transfer the finance
functions other than budget approval from the Finance Ministry to T&T,
and obtain a senior financial/accounting staff member to provide necessary
leadership. Government and the Auditor-General have agreed to transfer
to T&T personnel presently performing accounting functions for T&T who
are now with the Auditor-General. In addition, staff with the Auditor_
General propose to conduct training courses in commercial accounting prior
to the initiation of the new systemn
Accounting
5.09      T&T has been operated as a Government department and its account-
ing system is a cash-basis system typical of governmental departments.
This system does not provide adequate and timely data for business manage-
ment purposes and does not produce commercial financial statements. T&T's
cash flow is not separated from the Central Government's Consolidated Fund
and no effort has been made, or could be made with T&T's present system
for adequate financial management.
5.10      The weaknesses of the system were recognized by the Governument
of Pakistan and by the Association at the time of the first Credit (145-
PAK). The Credit Agreement for 145-PAK required that an effective account-
ing system be provided by the completion of the project,anticipated at
that time to be by June 30, 1972 and the Arthur D. Little study recom-
mended the installation of a commercial type accounting system.  Due to
the unsettled conditions in Pakistan during 1971-72, the completion date
was revised to June 30, 1974.
5.11      T&T now plans to begin a commercial accounting system for the fis-
cal year 1975. This conversion would initially provide for overall state-
ments to reflect its operations on a commercial basis and to comply with
the requirements of the new organization (see para. 5.02). This first
step should broadly meet the requirements of the Credit Agreement for 145-
PAK and make reasonable financial reporting possible. The needed revi-
sions of accounting practices and procedures at lower levels which will



- 17 -
further improve the timeliness and ef2ectiveness of financial reporting
are planned progressively following the initial conversion. Since many
of the recommendations assume the completion of this first step as planned,
the Government of Pakistan has agreed that accounts in this form would be
produced for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 and thereafter.
Audit
5.12      Audits of T&T are performed by the Auditor-General's office in
accordance with Pakistani law relating to Government departments and
boards. This office performs primarily Government-type audits but does
have a branch composed of industrial and commercially trained auditors
who perform audits of Government-owned commercial corporations and will,
it appears, be able to perform audits of T&T that will satisfy Association
requirements. The existing Credit Agreements require that an annual audit
of T&T shall be performed by auditors acceptable to the Association, and
that audited financial statements including the auditors' opinion shall be
transmitted to the Association within six months after the close of the
fiscal year. A similar covenant is included in the new Credit Agreement.
Commercial accounts audited by the Auditor-General's office will be pro-
duced for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975.
Tariffs
5.13      The tariff structure is reasonably well balanced between rental,
local call charges and interurban call charges. The STD call charges are
presently higher than comparable manual rates for a three minute call.
This is not a desirable situation as it does not encourage maximum use of
the STD facilities and T&T has decided to review the relationship between
manual and STD rates when the next tariff revision is required. Details
of existing tariffs are shown in Annex 11.
5.14      The level of tariffs is adequate.  The annual income per DEL
is US$234 (1973) which is higher than most European countries, despite the
considerable lower personal income in Pakistan and the early stages of
development of its interurban network. The current tariff which, except
for an increase in the security deposit from PRs 50 to PRs 450 has not
been revised since 1968, continues to provide T&T with an acceptable rate
of return and adequate funds to continue its development and service its
debt. Financial projections reflect a further improvement in the rate of
return and internal generation of funds during the project period (see
para. 6.11). At this tine no tariff revision is anticipated during the
project period (1975-77). A rate of. return covenant has been provided
for in paragraph 6.15.



- 18-
Taxes and Insurance
5.15      As a department of Government, T&T is not subject to any form
of taxation other than customs duties which amount to approximately 20%
on imported material and equipment value.
5.16      T&T's assets have a wide geographic distribution and there is
limited concentration of risk. Moreover, experience elsewhere confirms
that the risks of significant damage are minimal and rehabilitation of
the system is comparably not expensive except in the event of a national
catastrophe which would involve excessive premiums. Based on these
considerations, insurance coverage for T&T's assets is not necessary and
the policy of the Government, not to carry insurance, is acceptable.
T&T does, however, follow the normal and desirable practice of requiring
insurance coverage on materials and equipment in transit.



6. FL AiN\CES
Summary of Flinances
6.01      T&T does not utilize commercial accounting practices or produce
annual audited financial statements and its accounting system has many
deficiencies (see para. 5.09). Consequently, the financial data presented
in this report and relating to past operations is notional, being developed
from information obtained from T&T. These data, however, reflect a satis-
factory operating performance during the past two years, the only period
when data Were available for Pakistan operations without Bangladesh, and a
sound financial position at June 30, 1973. It is anticipated that this
satisfactory performance will continue throughout the project period (FCs
1975-77) and that there will be no need for tariff revision during this
period.
Past Performance
6.02      The past two IDA Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK contained a cove-
nant requiring that T&T after the installation of an effective accounting
system earn an annual rate of return of 10% on its net fixed assets (see
para. 6.14). Although the installation of this accounting system has not
been completed (see para. 5.10) and this covenant has therefore not been
in force, the pro forma financial results indicate that the provision of
t.his covenant has been met and bettered with a 12.5% rate of return in
FYs 1972 and 1973 and a forecast 11.8% rate of return in FY 1974.  The oper-
ating ratio during this period is also very satisfactory, varying from 55
to 59. Detailed statenents of income for FYs 1972-74 are included in
Annex 12.
6.03      A notional summary of the financial position of T&T as of June 30,
1973 is given below. A detailed statement is shown in Annex 13.

6.04      T&T is currently taking an nventory of its plant, and at the
same time revaluing these assets giving consideration to increased
indebtedness resulting from changes in currency parities. T&T expects to
complete this work by the end of FY 1975. The above notional presentation
reflects this revaluation of fixed assets.
6.05      T&T does not maintain a complete aging of accounts receivable.
However, based on tests of regional records, collections appear to be
satisfactory with from 40 to 50% of billings being collected within 15
days. The value of accounts receivable at June 30, 1973 equals about
two months' billings, a satisfactory level. Government accounts make up
39% of this balance and reflect satisfactory collection experience. The
second IDA Credit (186-PAK) included a covenant which required Government to
promptly pay for all services performed by T&T for its departments,
agencies or instrumentalities. This requirement has greatly assisted T&T
in its collection effort and has helped prevent a continuation of the
previous late payment problem. Therefore during negotiations the repeti-
tion of this covenant in the new Credit Agreement was agreed.
6.o6      Presently, the Economic Affairs Mvision contracts and services
the foreign exchange loans for all Goverment departments.  Therefore,
T&T does not maintain complete records of outstanding loans and credits
incurred by Government for its benefit or the servicing requirements of
this debt. It is difficult to distinguish what portion of this debt relates
to Pakistan and what portion relates to Bangladesh. Further it is difficult
to detennine what portion of the Pakistan debt relates to T&T and what
portion relates to TIP and CTI. As a result of these difficulties, all prior
debt from bilateral sources has been included in Government equity in the
financial statements. During negotiations agreement was reached that all
future bilateral debt would be shown as debt and serviced by T&T.
Financing Plan
6.07      Annex 14 presents the past and future financing plan for T&T
operations. A summary of this plan for the period (FYs 1975-77) is shown

* The total fund requirement for the construction is PRs 710.9
(US$71.8) million of which PRs 11.2 (US$1.1) million is planned
to be expended outside the project period FYs 1975-77.
* The total proposed Credit is PRs 356.4 (US$36.0) million of
which PRs 3.3 (US$0.3) million represents retention payments
to be disbursed during 1978.
6.o8      The above financing plan estimates that 53% of the funds required
will be provided from internal generation. The remainder will be provided
from borrowings -- 9% from bilateral loans and credits already secured, 1%
from the previous IDA Credit 186-PAK and 31% from the proposed IDA Credit.
The remaining 6% relates to the future program whose source of funding has
not been and will not be secured until this phase of the program is final-
ized and can be oresented to possible financial sources, including the Bank
Group. The high level of internal generation (53%) during the project period
indicates the strong position of the entity which would not require this
level of external financing to meet T&T's need if Pakistan did not have an
acute scarcity of foreign exchange funds.
6.09      The debt ecuity ratio during the project period will vary from
19/31 at June 30, 1975 to 29/71 at June 30, 1977. This is satisfactory.



- 22
6.10      The relending terms of the oroceeds of the proposed IDA Credit
have been assumed to be 24 years including a four-year grace period and
an interest rate of &4%, the current Government interest rate. These
terms were agreed during negotiation.
Future Operating Results
6.11      Estimated and forecast income statements for FYs 1973-78 are
given in Annex 12.  A summary of the results is shown below:
Year ahding June 30:   1973     1 1974 197       1976    1977    1978
Revenues (PRs million) 358.8   392.1   486.6   600.9   736.2   886.9
Operating income "      150.3   161.8   213.3   276.2   361.0   462.7
Operating ratio (%)      58       59      56      54       51      48
Rate of return (%)       12.5    11.8    13.3    14.7    17.3    20.4
6.12      Operating revenues are expected to increase at an average of
about 19.8% per year from 1972 to 1978 due mainly to the growth of the
system and to the improved long distance facilities.  Operating expenses,
exclusive of depreciation, are projected to increase at a rate of about
15.5% per year. Thus the operating ratio will decrease from an accept-
able level of 58 to even more impressive 48, due to a large degree to the
low level of wages, particularly for the lower ranked staff. No major
wage increase changing this situation is anticipated during the project
period.
6.13      Prior Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK have required that T&T pay a
dividend to Government of 6% based on Government's equity in T&T. As long
as the present practice is followed that all cash flows directly to Govern-
ment and T&T has no claim on its final disposition, this requirement cannot
be enforced and has not been included in the proposed Credit.
6.14      The past Credits have required that the rate of return computa-
tion include a working capital factor represented by a 4% addition to net
fixed assets in operation. This percentage increase applied to the base
used for return determination does not realistically represent a working
capital requirement nor does it alter the composition of this base.
Therefore, little is accomplished by requiring the application of this
unusual method. During negotiations, agreement was reached revising the
method to be used in determining the rate of return, when the accounting
system is operative, to the conventional method where the rate base is
simply the average net fixed assets in operation.
6.15      The rate of return of 10% prescribed in Credit Agreements 145-
PAK and 186-PAK stipulated that expenses would include depreciation at rate
of 5%. The forecast rate of return exceeds 10% during all years of the
project period and is 17.3% in the final year, FY 1977. Since the funds



- 23
generated are adequate to meet T&T'- rzociIrement, no tariff revision is
necessary. Agrenewnt was obtained during negotiations that tariffs will
be maintained at a level to produce a rate of return on average net plant
in operations of not less than 10%.
6.16      With the installation of the new accounting system, T&T is
required to service all future debt including foreign exchange loans
incurred by Government on its behalf. The forecast financial statements
reflect the servicing of all future debt applicable to T&T's present
operations and show a debt-equity ratio of from 19/81 to 29/71 and a debt
servicing coverage of at least 8.8 times in all years of the project period.
This is acceptable.
6.17      The debt servicing covenants of 145-PAK and 186-PAK require
that no debt other than that whose terms and conditions are acceptable to
the Association be incurred by Government for the benefit of T&T. Agree-
ment of the Association was required unless the historical 12-month net
revenues of T&T covered the maximum debt service at least 1.5 times.
During negotiations a similar covenant was agreed for the new Credit.
Fiscal Impact
6.18      During the project period, the contribution to Government is
estimated to total PRs 480.7 million. Another PRs 70.2 million would be
paid to Government in customs duties on imported materials and equipment.
In addition, Government will receive an estimated PRs 84.4 million as
payment of interest at commercial rates for funds on-lent to T&T from
existing and proposed IDA Credits. Thus the total receipts by Government
will be PRs 635.3 million in the project period without requiring any
contribution of Government funds to T&T for T&T's operations or for the
financing of the development program.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:
(a)  No major expansion of telecommunication facilities not
included in T&T's agreed expansion program will be under-
taken without prior consultation and agreement with the
Association (para. 3.21);
(b) the Board will be set up at an agreed date in a form
acceptable to the Association (para. 5.02);
(c) levels of staffing related to the number of telephones
will continue to be reduced (para. 5.04);
(d) T&T will produce commercial accounts for the fiscal year
1975 (para. 5.11);
(e) T&T's accounts will be audited annually by an independent
auditor acceptable to IDA and the audited statements will
be submitted to IDA within six months after the close of
each fiscal year (para. 5.12);
(f) Government will take all action necessary to assure the
payment of Government accounts on a timely basis (para. 6.05);
(g) T&T will service all future debt including foreign exchange
loans incurred by Government on T&T's behalf and applicable
to its operations (para. 6.06);
(h) the proceeds of the Credit will be relent to T&T at 8k% per
annum for a term of 24 years including a four-year grace
period (para. 6.10);
(i)  from the FY 1976 T&T will maintain tariffs at a level ade-
quate to assure a minimum rate of return of 10% on average
net assets in service (paras. 6.14 and 6.15); and
(j) no debt will be incurred except with the agreement of IDA
unless historical 12 months' internal cash generation would
cover maximum debt service at least 1.5 times (para. 6.17).
7.02      With the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of US$36.0 million.

2.  Long Dlstance Service
The present long distance network (shown in Map No. IBRD 10821)
is based on the two-tube coaxial cable linking Karachi - Lyallpur - Lahore
and Rawalpindi/Islamabad which provides capacity for 960 telephone cir-
cuits on any sector of the route. This capacity has been reached on some
sections and further development of the service with maintenance of accept-
able standards depends on completion of the microwave route which is being
constructed under Credit 186-PAK to interconnect these key cities with a
second major transmission system. Sixty-eight percent of long distance calls
made in 1973 were subscriber dialed using point-to-point facilities on the
following routes:
Circuits                                     Circuits
Karachi - Hyderabad         88             Multan - Lahore               33
- Lahore          183                 "   - Lyallpur            27
- Lyallpur         50              Lyallpur - Lahore            87
- Multan           18                 It    - Sargodha          23
- Rawalpindi      144              Lahore - Sargodha            29
- Larkana          12                 It- Rawalpindi           123
- Quetta           36              Rawalpindi - Murree          40
if      - Peshawar        24
Most of the cities and towns not on the coaxial cable route are served by
open wire routes.  Thefts of copper wire have made this part of the net-
work unreliable and costly to maintain.  Recent estimates place the rate of
theft at 2400 km of wire per year. The Government is making intensive
efforts to check the thefts and T&T has underway a orogram for replacing
copper wire with copperweld (copper-covered steel wire) which has similar
transmission characteristics but which has relatively little scrap value.
3. International Telephone Service
Pakistan has connections to other countries via an earth satel-
lite station located 20 miles northwest of Karachi working into the Indian
Ocean satellite; via the CENTO microwave route which passes through Baluch-
istan to Iran and Turkey; and via HF radio links. There are 10 telephone
circuits from Karachi via the satellite stations to Bahrain (2), London (4),
Rome, Kuwait, Hong Kong, New York (via Spain); 6 circuits from Karachi via
the CENTO microwave system to Tehran (5) and Ankara; and 15 circuits via
HF radio - 13 circuits from Karachi to Bangkok, Beirut, Berne, Cairo, Co-
lombo, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Moscow, Nairobi, Peking, Rangoon, Singapore, Tokyo
and 2 circuits from Rawalpindi to Berne and Katmandu.
4.  The Telegraph Service
4.1 The Dbmestic Service
(i)  The Public Telegram Service.  At present there are 745 telegraph
offices operating on a point-to point basis. Five hundred
twenty-six railway offices and 143 recognized private agencies



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 3 pages
are authorized to handle public telegrams in locations where
T&T offices do not exist. A Gentex service is being intro-
duced. Three automatic switching centers have been installed
in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi using Siemens TW 39 equip-
ment. ELghty-four stations have been connected. In 1973,
3,400,000 telegrams were handled.
(ii) Telex Service. The telex network is in the early stage of
development, and consists of automatic switching centers at
Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi which it shares with the Gentex
service and 10 manual exchanges. Two hundred sixty-four sub-
scribers were connected to the telex service at June 1973.
(iii) Leased Service. There were 143 leased telegraph lines in
use at June 1973.
4.2 Intemational Service
International public telegraph service is available over 19
circuits - 6 via satellite, 2 via the CENTO microwave system and 11 via
HF radio - to London, Hong Kong, New York, Rome, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Ham-
burg, Moscow, Rangoon, Peking, Jeddah, Bangkok, Colombo, Kuwait, Tehran,
Ankara and Katmandu. There are 24 international telex circuits to London
(6), Hong Kong (2), New York (7), Rome (4), Tokyo (2), Amsterdam, Tehran
and Ankara.

3.   Long Distance Facilities
3.1  The Main Long Distance Routes Included in the Project
(i)  The Quetta-Sukkur Microwave Route,  A 960 channel microwave
system is proposed. It is to be equipped with 3 RF channels --
one for telephony, one for TV relay and one as standby. The
route will initially provide an additional 216 circuits to meet
the telephone and telegraph needs of Quetta, Sibi and Jacobabad
and will meet a firm requirement from the TV Corporation of
Pakistan for TV relay facilities to Sibi and Quetta. The area
is currently served via the CENTO microwave system which has not
got the capacity to meet future needs; which cannot cater for TV
relay; and which, because of its age and the fact that it was
installed in 1964 in the early days of microwave system design,
is substandard in performance and costly to maintain. The new
system will enable the Karachi-Quetta sections of the CENTO sys-
tem to be retired from service.
(ii) The Hyderabad-Badin Microwave System. A 300 channel system is
proposed. Initially it would provide 108 telephone circuits
interconnecting Hyderabad, Matli, Mohd Khan and Badin.
(iii) The Karachi-Manora Microwave System. This single hop 300 chan-
nel system will provide junction circuits to the exchange on
the off-shore Manora Island.  Initially T&T propose to derive
60 junction circuits.
(iv) The Sahiwal-Arifwala-Bahawalnagar Cable. A 60 mile, 4 tube
small-diameter coaxial cable system with a capacity for 300
telephone channels per pair of tubes is proposed. Initially
60 circuits would be derived.
(v) The Khanewal-Multan Cable. T&T propose to install a composite
cable comprised of d carrier pairs plus 38 voice frequency pairs
to extend the existing Lahore-Khanewal cable of this type to
Multan. The carrier derived circuits and some of the VF pairs
would be used for the public telecommunications network. Other
VF pairs would be used for railway control and communication
purposes.

Introduction
1.  This annex rrovides suoplementaiy infonation on the two Government-
owned enterorises nroducing telecommunications equirment in Pakistan --
TeleDhone Indu,tries of Pakistan which produces switching equipment and
Carrier Teleohone Industries which produces carrier multiplex equinment.
Telenhone Industries of Pakistan (TIP)
2.  TIP was es;tablished in 1952.  Its two shareholder' are the GJovernment
of Pakistan, which holds 83% of the shares, and Siemens A.G. of Germany.
3.  Vanagement of the Company is in the hands of a Board of Directors --
five including the Chairman noTinated by the Government and two by Siemens.
Two senior managers from T&T Deoartment are 9oard members.
4.  The factory is located at Haripur, a country town approximatelr 50
mile  by road to the north of Islamabad.  At present it employs 3,713
people and has made a major contribution to the development of the
area.
5. The present range of products is:
Automatic telephone exchange equipment - both the $iemens bimotional and
EMD selectors are manufactured and are used to build:
(i) extension units for existing local exchanges;
(ii) new local exchanges (now all END type);
(iii) automatic long distance switching equipment; and
(iv) nrivate automatic branch exchanges (PAHXs).
Manual telenhone exchange equipment - for local, long distance and
private exchanges.
Teleohone instruments.
TeleDrinters.



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
The factory has capacity to produce annually 100,000 telephone  instru-
ments, 500 teleprinters, 50,000 lines of automatic exchange equipment,
together with T&T's requirements for manual exchange equipment.
6. TIP's cost of production compares favorably with general international
price levels for the items it produces.  TIP has won export orders, a num-
ber after open competition, totaling US$0.923 million in 1971, US$2.629
million in 1972 and US$1.031 million in 1973. Imported materials and
components account for approximately 50% of TIP's cost of production.
Carrier Telephone Industries (CTI)
7. As for TIP, CTI is partnership between the Government of Pakistan and
Siemens A.G. of Germany with the Government holding 60% of the shares.
It was established in 1969.
8. The management of the enterprise is in the hands of a Board of Direc-
tors.  The number of members is similar to that for TIP.
9. The factory is located in the industrial area of Islamabad. It is
equipped to produce each year 4,000 channel ends of carrier multiplex
equipment and 1,000 channel ends of Voice Frequency Telegraph (VFT)
channel ends. It employs 333 people.
10. CTI produces equipment at prices which are competitive with prevail-
ing international prices. Imported items, consisting almost entirely
of proprietary components from Siemens, account for approximately 50% of
the price of the equipment produced by the factory.
Benefits to Pakistan T&T from Standardization and Domestic Production
11. The advantages to the public telecommiunications authority of stand-
ardization and efficient domestic production of telecommunication equip-
ment are considerable in any country. In the case of Pakistan, wider
advantages of a country nature such as savings in scarce foreign exchange
and contribution to employment and training of the Pakistan work force,
give further strong reasons for support of domestic production.
12. The advantages of standardization of switching equipment are set out
in the Telecomnunications Sector Working Paper.  Summarized, they are:
(i) Economies are possible by designing exchange installations
for their ultimate capacity but making the initial instal-
lations only to meet the immediate needs;
(ii) interworking problems and costs are minimized. Since any
telephone subscriber may call any other, all exchanges in



AN2NEX o
Page 3 of 3 pages
the network must be able to interwork. The signaling
"language" used for this purpose differs for equipment of
different manufacture and often difficult and expensive
provisions are required to allow exchanges of different
manufacture to interwork;
(iii)  training of staff for planning, procurenent, installation,
maintenance and operation is simplified and the work force
can be used flexibly as compared to the situations where it
must be sub-divided into groups specializing on different
types of equipment;
(iv) technical documents and records can be standardized; and
(v)  inventories of spares may be minimized.
13. Although carrier multiplex equipment is manufactured to interna-
tional standards which reduces the problem of interworking between
different types, most of the above advantages apply also for standardi-
zation of this class of equipment.
14. Local manufacture shortens the lead time for equipment supply, giving
operational benefits of both economic and service nature. Inventories
may be reduced; work may be planned for a shorter period ahead and hence
more accurately; and program changes resulting from changes in traffic
patterns can be more readily handled. The factories also can play an
important part in maintenance of the service by handling repair tasks
requiring specialized knowledge. This is particularly so for modern elec-
tronic equipment such as carrier multiplex equipment where solid state
technology and miniaturization, whilst giving increased reliability and
reduced costs, has made repair a much more specialized task.

TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARMENT (T&T)
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD TELECOMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Demand for Telephone Services
1. Demand for Telephone Connections
Chart WB-8326 shows the growth of demand for telephone coinec-
tions (measured as existing customers plus waiting applicants) and
predictions covering the period to the end of FY 1978.
A study by the German consultants NTB (Narchrichtentechnische
Beratungsburo GMBH) in 1964 recommended that a growth rate of about 11.5%
per annim in telephone connections needed to be maintained for telecom-
munications services to adequately support national economic development.
The history of teleconmmnications demand to 1970 confirms that the under-
lying growth rate is in fact of this order. Such a growth rate is con-
sistent with experience in other countries at a similar stage of develop-
ment.  T&T, in their prediction, (see Chart WB-8326) assume that the
buoyant demand in 1973 represents a return to the development trend that
was disrupted by the unsettled conditions in Pakistan in the period 1970-
72, and they extrapolate accordingly to predict demand for 455,000 con-
nections (DELs) by the end of 1977. A more conservative prediction using
a long-term growth trend of 11.5% but taking more account of the recent
history yields a prediction of demand for 388,000 connections at the end
of 1977 -- a short-term growth rate in demand over the program period of
9.5% per annum. The more conservative prediction still exceeds the level
of connections to be achieved through the program by 110,000.
2. Growth in Long Distance Calls
Chart WB-8327 shows history and prediction of the growth of long
distance calls as following a 15% per annum growth trend. Departure from
the trend in the last three years has been ignored by T&T on two grounds.
First, it reflects the effect of the unsettled conditions in Pakistan and
the reduction in the rate of adding new subscribers in that period and
second, growth has been limited due to saturation of the call carrying
facilities on the manor long distance routes.
The mission agrees that the depressed figures should be ignored
and considers that the 15% growth rate is conservative. The long distance
traffic growth rate in most countries is nearer to twice the growth rate
for telephone connections.

Asmptions Relating to the Inoome Statement
Revenues
Telephone rental - projected at PRs 300 per average DEL.
Call charge - projected at an average revenue per DEL of PRs 1889
per average DEL stimulated at an experienced rate of 4.7%.
Installation fee - projected at PRs 250 per each added DEL.
Tele raph and telex - projection reflects T&T estimate of normal
growth Of these services plus the effect of the connection to the
satellite system. These estimates appear reasonable.
Bpenses
Operating     administrative-/ - projected at a diminishing rela-
tionship to total revenues varying from 26% in 1975 to 23% in 1978.
Maintenance and minor worksv - projected at 2% of average gross
plant in service, an experienced relationship.
Depreciation - projected at 5% of average gross plant in service.
Interest expense - projected at specific interest rate applicable
when relating to bilateral debt and the onlending rate when
relating to IDA Credits.
/ Expense projections do not contain an explicit factor for inflation.
Inflation in the past has been about 20% annually and is expected to re-
duce to around 10% in the immediate future. The method of projecting
expenses, which has been discussed and agreed with T&T, is to relate the
operating and administrative expense category to the level of revenues,
and to relate maintenance expense to the value of plant. These methods
produce increases which amount to over 15% per year over the project
period. The results are reasonable even though the method used for pro-
jecting operating and administrative expense is unusual and not based on
firm scientific principle.

Assumptions Relating to the
Statement of Financial Position
Plant in service - value reflects revaluations as of June 30, 1972
to reflect effect of changes in currency parities based on the change in
valuation of related unamortized debt at June 30, 1972. The actual revalu-
ation of fixed assets will include physical inventorying and repricing based
on estimated current costs therefore reflecting the inflationary trends of
local costs as well as foreign costs. Thus there is a possibility that the
value of plant in service will be higher than that used in the pro forma
statements. However the depreciated value of plant resulting from this in-
ventory should not be materially different than that projected and the result
on the rate of return will be minimal.
Plant under construction - valued on the basis of the estimated
construction schedule.
Accounts receivable - value based on a relationship to total tele-
phone revenue of 16% reflecting a two-month billing value in accordance
with past experience.
Inventories - valued at 3 to 4% of fixed assets in accordance with
past experience.
Accounts payable - valued at one month's capital and expense ex-
penditure requirement.
Current maturities - valued to reflect the aggregate estimated
payment in the following year required to amortize each specific loan or
credit relating to T&T's past and present financing.
Fixed investment - estimated value of Government investment in
T&T at June 30, 1974 when the entity is reorganized and commercial account-
ing practices are initiated.
