REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
SECOND DEVELOPMT FINANCE COMPANIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of $20 million to help
finance productive investment projects in Ecuador. The proceeds of the loan
will be relent through Banco Central to Comision de Valores-Corporacion
Financiera Nacional (CV-CFN) and Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S.A. - Compania
Financiera (COFIEC), to be used for sub-loans to enterprises with terms up
to 15 years, including a grace period not exceeding three years. Sub-loans
would carry an interest rate of 12 percent per annum plus a supervision fee
of not less than one percent per annum. Repayment to the Bank will be
based on a composite amortization schedule substantially conforming to the
aggregate of amortization schedules corresponding to the individual invest-
ment projects; interest would be at 7 1/h percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ecuador" (No. l1a-EC), dated June 1, 1973, is being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The report observes that government revenues
and the balance of payments will benefit to a great extent from petroleum
exports which started in mid-1972. It concludes that prospects for achiev-
ing a satisfactory growth rate over the medium-term are very good provided the
Government follows appropriate policies. Resolute action is required to
increase the absorptive capacity of the public sector and enable it to mobi-
lize available resources to come to grips with the country's development needs.
Annex I shows the main economic and social indicators.
3.        Although a precise estimate of the country's petroleum resources
does not yet exist, it is clear tnat they would provide an opportunity to
achieve both a faster rate and a more balanced pattern of economic growth.
The anticipated high level of foreign exchange earnings from petroleum exports
strengthens Ecuador's creditworthiness for external borrowing as well as
its capacity for direct financing of the imports required to support the
development efforts. Substantial tax revenues from petroleum should strengthen
public finances, thereby enabling the Government to support a high level of
develonment exDenditures.
4.        However, there is also the danger that the petroleum boom will
weaken fiscal discipline, encourage unnecessary imports and at the same
time put pressures on costs and prices within the country, which could
undermine Ecuador's competitive position in both agriculture and industry.
As the demand for food grows due to increasing population and income, a



- 2 -
tendency may develop for Ecuador to become a large-scale importer of
foodstuffs, rather than develop its agricultural potential. Moreover,
the petroleum industry as such contributes relatively little to the
expansion of employment opportunities -- a priority objective in view of the
3.4 percent per annum population growth rate and the existing widespread
underemployment. Therefore, to increase employment and to overcome the basic
'imitations of the economy, it is urgent to diversify the economy. Expanding
and improving activities other than oil production will permit the country
to continue self-sustained development when the expansion of the petroleum
sector eventually levels off.
5.        Furthermore, although petroleum will play a leading role during
the next several years in terms of its contribution to aggregate growth,
its direct effect on the standard of living of the population will be small
in the absence of well-designed government programs. Thus, spreading the
opportunities made possible by the petroleum-generated wealth over large
segments of the population will be one of the major challenges facing the
Ecuadorian authorities in the 1970's and appropriate development strategy
for the 1970's will have to focus on removing severe constraints to output
expansion and income redistribution.
6.        Balance of payments equilibrium at the prospective economic growth
rate of 10 percent estimated in the above-referred economic report, will re-
quiire gross capital inflows totalling over $1 billion in the period 1973-77,
compared with a total of $675 million in 1967-71. Direct foreign investment,
75 percent of which is likely to be in the petroleum sector, is expected to
cover almost 60 percent of these requirements; gross public sector inflows
would provide the balance, averaging around $90 mil'Lion annually.  Of this,
suppliers credits are estimated to amount to some $24 million annually (only
slightly higher than the levels of the past several years), and the remainder
would come from external development financing agencies. Because of- large
amortization and interest payments, the net transfer of public external re-
sources over the period would be of the order of $1:10 million or some $22
million annually.   These levels of external financing would permit foreign
exchange reserves to rise to a more secure level equivalent to almost four
months of imports by 1977. The projected pattern of financing would also
lead to an improvement in the structure of the public external debt; on the
basis of reasonable assumptions about terms of new 'Lending and the foreseen
large expansion in exports, the debt service ratio is expected to fall from
15 percent of exports of goods and services in 1972 to a little over 10 per-
cent in 1977.  The Bank/IDA share in total debt service payments would at
the same time increase from 10 to slightly over 14 percent.
7.        Despite these favorable prospects, Ecuador will for some time
remain one of the less developed countries in Latin America. While the
Government has decided to tackle some of the obstacles which have tradition-
ally hampered the developmnit of the country - low savings capacity of the
public sector, limited government power to direct the economy, insufficient
growth in the rural sector, and slow development of non-traditional exports -
the solution of these problems will require substantial changes in the
economic and administrative structure which can only be achieved gradually.



- 3 -
During the transition period, and pending a more precise determination of
the country's petroleum production prospects, Ecuador may still need to
receive part of her foreign assistance under concessional terms.
8.        In the longer ternconditions for lending to Ecuador will depend
on actual developments and perspectives in petroleum and on the ability of
the Government to meet the challenges created by them. The degree of
execution of -&he Five-Year Development Plan, recently approved by the Govern-
ment, will be a good indication of the Government's success in fostering
Ecuador's economic and social development. Explicit aims of the Development
Plan are the improvement in the situation of the poorest sectors of the popu-
lation; the strengthening and expansion of the country's productive capacity;
and the creation of exployment opportunities.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
9.        Since 1954 the Bank and IDA have made nine loans and five credits
to Ecuador for a total of $102.7 million, net of cancellations. Of this
amount, about 50 percent has been for transportation, to finance the expan-
sion of Ecuador's road network and a new port at Guayaquil; 20 percent for
agriculture, to develop the country's livestock and fisheries sectors; 16
percent for power generation and transmission for the City of Quito; 8 percent
to support the industrial development activities of two development finance
companies, and the remainder for education. As of April 30, 1973, a total
of $25.9 million remained to be disbursed on nine loans and credits. In
addition to the proposed loan for a second development finance companies
project, a $5.5 millhon credit for irrigation is to be presented shortly
for your approval. IFC's total commitments to date amount to about $4.0
million - all in industry - of which $2.4 million is still held by the
Corporation. A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC in-
vestments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on ongoing projects are attached
as Annex II.
10.       Apart from the Bank Group, external development financing is pro-
vided principally by USAID and IDB. External financing by sector and source
as of the end of 1972 is summarized below:

I/ Another $29.7 million were approved but not signed in 1972.



-4 -
AID loans are normally for a term of 4O years with interest at 2 to 3 percent.
IDB extends most of its loans to Ecuador from the Fund for Special Operations;
they carry 2 percent interest and terms of up to 40 years with ten years of
grace.
11.       In line with the external financing requirements discussed in
paragraph 6 and assuming a continued government effort to adopt appropriate
sector policies and achieve adequate levels of public savings, we would ex-
pect Bank Group financing to increase substantially in the period 1973-75.
Since the Government is now likely to have less severe budgetary constraints
for local financing owing to petroleum development, the main limitation to
Bank lending to Ecuador in the future may very well be the Government's
capacity to identify and prepare high priority development projects. To
help overcome this constraint, we plan to include an adequate component of
technical assistance in our loans.
12.       In spite of the expected expansion of petroleum output in the next
few years, Ecuador is likely to remain a primariLy agrarian economy for some
time, and the performance of the agricultural sector will be a decisive
element in the country's economic and social development. We intend, there-
fore, to expand our lending activities in agriculture. Our operations in
the sector will aim at assisting the Government to promote crop diversifica-
tion, sustain agricultural employment, and expand production to avoid in-
creasing dependency on food imports. Recognizing the high level of rural
poverty in Bcuador, we will give priority to projects which directly benefit
the poorer farmers; the first example of this type of undertaklng is the
Milagro Irrigation Project, to be presented for your approval shortly. We will
also be reviewing with the Government, on completion of a German-financed
feasibility report in the summer, possible assistance to the Chone-Carrizal
project in the highly populated and depressed area of Manabi Province, which
is likely to entail a broad-based program of agricultural development with
irrigation. Further support to the development of livestock production is
envisaged through a fourth operation, currently being prepared. An agricul-
tural credit program is also under consideration; however, its timing de-
pends on progress in similar credit operations being financed by AID. The
Bank will also act as Executing Agency for the UTNDP in a feasibility study
to develop 3cuadorls rich forestry resources in the north-western coastal
plain.
13.       With respect to industry, besides the proposed development finance
companies loan, the Bank is planning to participate in the financing of small-
scale industries to support the Government's efforts to broaden the industrial
base and create additional employment opportunities. In the energy sector, we
are considering a fourth power project to help expand Quito's generation and
transmission system, and we have had discussions with the Instituto Ecuatoriano
de Electrificacion (INECEL) regarding possible assistance in carrying out
some projects included in INEEL's 1973-78 development program. In the area
of transportation, further Bank participation in the development of the
country's road network is expected to result from a highway master plan
being drawn up with Bank/IDA financing (Loan 379-EC/Credit 51-EC). Finally,



in the social sector, the Government is currently preparing for possible
Bank financing a second education project identified with assistance from
UNESCO in the fall of 1972, and we have had preliminary discussions with
the Ecuadorian authorities on possible sites and services and water supply
projects.  In proceeding with further lending, the Bank will continue to
stress the importance of strengthening the fiscal system and the institu-
tional set-up, as well as the need for undertaking an effective program to
improve standards of living and development opportunities for the poorest
segments of the population.
PART III - INDUSTRY IN ECUADOR
14.       The contribution of Ecuador's manufacturing sector to output,
export diversification, employment and income distribution has so far been
limited. The main constraints to a more vigorous expansion of the sector
have been the limited size of the domestic market, insufficiency of trained
human resources, inadequate physical infrastructure, and the absence of
coordinated government action to stimulate and regulatemanufacturing expansion.
15.       In the 1950's, total manufacturing value added increased at an
annual rate of 4.5 percent, slightly below the GDP growth rate of 4.8 per-
cent. A number of incentives (mainly exoneration from import duties on
capital equipment) pro,&ed by Ecuador's Industrial Development Law in 1957,
and the commencement of industrial credit operations by CV-CFN and COFIEC
in the mid-1960's made possible a more rapid expansion of the sector,
leading to the development of new industries in metal products, machinery,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, paper, and synthetic fibers. As a result, the
growth of value added in manufacturing accelerated in the 1960's to an average
of 6.3 percent against a GDP increase of about 4.5 percent, and manufacturing's
share of GDP increased from about 15 percent in the 1950's to around 17 per-
cent in the 1960's. This growth in manufacturing was also accompanied by
increased emphasis on intermediate and capital goods: whereas consumer goods
accounted for two-thirds of factory output in 1964, they represented less
than 55 percent of the 1971 output.
16.        Until the mid-1960's no long-term credit was provided by financial
4rstitutions in Ecuador, except for some very limited amounts granted by
the Nlational Development Bank (ENF) to small industries.  Extensions of short-
term credit on a rollover basis by commercial banks   met some of the medium-
term needs, but only financially strong enterprises benefitted from such
extensions. However, since the mid-1960's, when CV-CFN and COFIEC started
to operate, the availability of long-term credit to industry has improved
markedly, but it is still not sufficient to meet all needs. In 1971 long-
term financing represented less than 15 percent of the total credit advanced
to manufacturing industries by the financial system.



17.       Under the impetus of the rapid development of the petroleum sector,
the investment climate is becoming increasingly favorable and the demand for
industrial finance is accelerating. Moreover, together with Bolivia, Ecuador
enjoys preferential treatment in various ways under the Andean Pact regime:
ic offers more liberal terms for foreign investment and is better placed
within the group in terms of progressive elimination of tariff barriers.
To e-ploit these opportunities, the Government plans a more aggressive role
in n,irecting industrial growth toward priority areas such as agroindustries
a; metal and chemical industries.   The Government has also reserved certain
_ ic industries for State ownership, and intends to broaden the industrial
base by expanding long-term credit programs so as to reach not only the
large and medium-size enterprises, but also the small entrepreneurs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
18.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Financieras Project"
(No. 122a-EC,, dated June 6, 1973) is being distributed seDaratelv.  The main
features of the project and the proposed loan are summarized in Annex III.
19.       The first Bank loan (721-EC) for the two finance companies, amount-
ing to $8 million ($4 million to each company) was approved by the Board in
December 1970 and the loan agreement was signed in February 1971. Because
of delays in the fulfillment of the conditions of effectiveness, the loan
became effective only in October 1971,   The high demand for long-term
industrial credit resulted ±n the proceeds of the loan being fully committed
in less than one year (72 percent has been disbursed as of April 30, 1973),
sooner than forecast. Anticipating this rapid commitment, the Ecuadorian
Government requested the Bank in mid-1972 to consider further assistance
to the two companies for the financing of industrial projects. The project
was appraised during two field visits in November 1972 and February 1973,
and negotiations were held in Washington from May 1 to May 4, 1973.
Mr. Cristobal Flores, Advisor in the Ministry of Finance and Deputy Mmmnager
for Finance in CV-CFN, represented both the Government and CV-CFN. Mr. Jose
Correa, President of the Company, represented COFIEC.
CV-CFN
20,       CV-CFN, government owned, was organized originally in 19h8 to
establish a market for government bonds and only began industrial lending
in 196h. Its nine-member Board of Directors includes seven government
appointees, the remaining two seats being held by representatives from the
Chamfbers of Industry of Quito and Guayaquil. CV-CFN has experienced manage-
ment; at mid-1972 its staff numbered 139, including 57 professionals. During
the IaSt two years the quality of project appraisal by CV-CFN's staff has con-
tinued to improve but an assessment of the economic merits of projects is
still lacking. Under the proposed loan, CV-CFN has now agreed to include such
an economic assessment for prolects submitted to the Bank for approval.



- 7 -
21.       CV-CFNts net worth, which amounted to S/555 million at June 30, 1972,
continues to be its most important financial source, but the company's reliance
on external borrowings, both from international agencies and bilateral sources,
is growing rapidly, as shown by an increase from S/175 million as of June 30,
1970, to S/424 million as of June 30, 1972. Given the company's substantial
equity, the debt/equity ratio amounted only to 1.6 as of mid-1972 in spite of
these borrowings. Responding to the growing demand for industrial finance,
CV-CFN's loan approvals have increased at an average annual rate of about 25
percent since 1964, to reach S/410 million in 1971.   Loans granted by CV-CEN
since its inception totalled S/1.5 billion as of mid-1972. About 75 percent
of its loans have been made to the manufacturing sector, with the balance
going to tourism, fishing, forestry and utilities. Guayaquil and Quito have
accounted for 73 percent of the lending operations, reflecting the concentra-
tion of industry in these areas. In addition to its industrial operations,
CV-CFN acts as Government agent in certain operations (mostly sale of bonds)
which have aided its profitability. As of June 30, 1972, CV-CFN's obligations
to repurchase such securities amounted to S/324 million.   So far, CV-CFN's
equity investments have been limited and primarily oriented to projects which
have required Government assistance in their promotion. Most of these in-
vestments have been in companies in the preoperating stage, with still little
or no returns. As of June 30, 1972, equity portfolio consisted of S/102 mil-
lion, representing 13.6 percent of total loan and equity portfolio and 18.3
percent of net worth.
22.       CV-CFN's financial condition is satisfactory.   The company continues
to follow a policy of securing ample guarantees for its loans, and the number
of arrears and clients in difficulty remains low; anticipated portfolio losses
are adequately covered. CV-CFN's net profit, as a percentage of average total
assets, amounted to 2.5 percent in 1971 and 2.7 percent in 1972. These rates
of return compare well with those of other government-owned development finance
companies financed by the Bank.
23.       Under the first financiera loan, the Government had provided CV-CFN
with a bl-anket foreign exchange risk coverage that applied to all foreign bor-
rowings. As a means of increasing CV-CFN0s accountability, the Government has
now agreed that with regard to such foreign borrowings other than Bank loans
(for risk coverage under the proposed loan, see paragraph 30), CV-CFN would
carry the exchange risk, but should CV-CFN suffer exchange losses which would
impair CV-CEN's capital (i.e. a loss exceeding the total of net profits and
free reserves), then the Government would restore CV-CFN's capital to the
level existing prior to such loss.
COFIEC
24.       COFIBC started operations in 1966 as an industrial finance company.
It is a private company, with 52 percent of the shares belonging to local
shareholders and 48 percent to foreign investors, including IFC. COFTEC has
capable management; its Quito office has qualified staff, but its Guayaquil
office has suffered from a shortage of trained personnel which has resulted



- 8 -
in sub-standard evaluation and supervision of projects, The company has re-
cently taken steps to improve the organization of its Guayaquil office as
well as the coordination and control between the two offices at the level
of project evaluation and loan approval. As in the case of CV-CFN, COFIEC
has agreed to assess the economic merits of projects submitted for Bank
approval under the proposed loan. COFIEC has also agreed to upgrade its
supervision work.
25.       Initially, COFIEC concentrated on short-term operations, but since
1970 its long-term lending has gained impetus as new funds made available by
EXIMBANK ($3.0 million) and the Bank ($4.0 million) increased substantially
its resources. In addition, COFIEC has utilized about $2.4 million from the
Bank's three livestock operations (501-EC, 1?3-EC and 222-EC). COFIEC's most
important long-term local currency resource has been its own equity (S/89
million) but recently it has successfully issued five-year bonds amounting
to about S/16 million. Under the 1971 Project Agreement, COFIEC was allowed
in the calculation of its debt/equity ratio to consider as quasi-equity
provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of 2 percent of its portfolio, It
would no longer do so since these provisions actually represent a deduction
from equity.  However, in order to avoid decreasing its borrowing capacity, the
debt/equity ratio will be increased from 6:1 to 7:1.   At the same time, because
of the rapid growth in long-term financing operations expected to result from
the use of Bank funds, COFIEC will need to increase its share capital to levels
that will permit it to commit new Bank funds within the agreed debt ceiling,
To this effect, COFIEC has recently obtained commitments to increase share
capital from the 1,esent S/82 million to S/92 million, which would allow it
to incur further obligations to the Bank. In order to obtain access to Bank
funds over this amount, COFIEC's capital and reserves will need to be further
increased. It is expected that COFIEC will raise in the near future some
additional S/5 million, which will enable it to draw its full initial alloca-
tion under the proposed loan (see paragraph 29).
26.       COFIEC has diversified its lending operations reasonably well.
Since the company commenced operations it has granted loans totalling $71,0
million equivalent. The manufacturing sector has been favored with 59 percent
of the total, and the remainder has been shared between construction,
agriculture and livestock, and transportation. As in the case of CV-CFlN,
lending has been limited to a large degree to the Guayaquil and Quito areas,
which have accounted for 92 percent of operations. Equity investments have
not played a significant role in COFIEC's operations and have amounted to
only S/15 million as of June 30, 1972, representing 6.4 percent of total loan
and equity portfolio and 20.3 percent of net worth.
27.       COFIEC's financial condition is satisfactory.   Arrears are not
significant and the company maintains an adequate provision to cover anticipated
portfolio losses. In spite of COFIEC's shift to long-term operations, which
are financially not as profitable as its short-term activities, and in spite
also of its administrative expenses, which remain fairly high, COFIEC's return
on average capital was 15 percent in 1972, as compared to 11 percent in 1970.
(In 1971 the return was reduced to 2 percent due to deduction for provision
for doubtful loans).



- 9 -
28.        Under the 1971 Project Agreement, COFIEC is required to establish
a provision against losses from foreign exchange obligations existing as of
February 5, 1971 (the date of the first loan). COFIEC has allocated S/1.5
million (equal to about 2 percent of foreign exchange liabilities) to cover
this risk, an amount which is considered reasonable. As allocations to a
provision (which involve reducing total assets and equity) can be justified
only if a loss has been sustained or is expected, COFIEC will now maintain
a reserve to cover foreign exchange risks existing as of February 5, 1971,
rather than a provision as presently required under the first loan. The
adequacy of COFIEC's allocations to such a reserve will be reviewed annually.
WRith regard to foreign exchange risk coverage on borrowings made after
February 5, 1971, other than the proposed Bank loan, COFIEC has agreed to
take adequate steps to protect itself against such risk.
Terms of Proposed Lending
P9.        Comparing the projected operations of CV-CFN and COFIEC with their
expected resources, they will need $20 million equivalent over the next two
vears to help finance the foreign exchange requirements of industrial projects
involving the expansion of existing firms or the establishment of new enter-
prises. The proposed loan is intended to fill this gap. Of the $20 million
loan, $8 million would be initially allocated to each financiera. The re-
maining $4 million would be available to each financiera on a first-come-first
served basis once each one has fully committed its original allocation.
Given the progress made by the companies in improving their operatiornsince
the first loan, the limit for projects not requiring the Bank's prior approval
would be raised f'rom $100,000 to $200,00O for both financieras. The aggregate
free limit for each financiera would be increased from $1.3 million to $4
million.
30.        The proceeds of the proposed loan would be relent by the Government
to the two financieras through the Central Bank. As in the first loan, the
Government will assume the foreign exchange risk. However, while under the
first loan the Government charged to each financiera a nominal fee for
assuming the risk (1/4 of one percent per annum to COFIEC; a one-time fee
of 1/2 of one percent on each disbursement to CV-CiN), this time it will charge
a fee of 1 and 3/4 percent per annum, the latter reflecting more closely the
average devaluation of the sucre in relation to the dollar in recent years.
Thus, the cost of Bank funds to the financieras would be 9 percent, composed
of an interest rate of 7 and 1/4 percent per annum plus the above mentioned
fee of 1 and 3/h percent per annum. The financieras would lend to ultimate
borrowers at an Interest rate of 12 percent per annur, and would in addition
charge a fee of not less than one percent per annum for services rendered in
the preparation, appraisal and supervision of projects. The cost of Bank
funds to the ultimate borrowers would thus be not less than 13 percent,
compared with 12 percent under the first loan. The terms of sub-loans would
be up to 15 years, including a grace period not exceeding three years.

31.       In order to provide continuity to COFIEC's operations, the Bank
would reimburse it for disbursements made after May 7, 1973 for selected
sub-projects, if approved by the Bank. COFIEC has submitted eight such
projects with a total cost of $1.9 million equivalent. Retroactive financing
would be limited to the equivalent of $1.0 million.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.      The draft Loan Agreement between   the Republic of Ecuador and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and, respectively, CV-CFN and
COFIEC, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
33.       The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern in loans for
development finance companies and contain provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part IV above. Of special interest are the following
provisions of the draft Loan Agreement:
(a) Section 3.02(a) providing conditions under which CV-CFN
and COFIEC will have access to the proceeds of the loan;
(b)  Section 3.02(b) providing the financial terms for ultimate
borrowers;
(c)  Section 4.03(b) providing the financial terms for each
financiera;
(d) Section 4.07 containing the Borrower's undertaking to
safeguard CV-CFN's capital;
(e) Sections 7.01 and 7.02 enabling the Bank to take remedial
action in respect of only one of the financieras; and
(f)  Section 8.01 providing conditions prior to the effec-tiveness
of the Loan Agreement.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 379-EC/Credit No. 51-EC - Second Highway Project;    $9.0 million Loan and
$8.0 million Credit both of May 26, 1964;
Ulosing Date: December -1, ly79
The project, financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, the IDB and AID,
has been completed. However, a further extension of one year in the Closing
Date has been authorized to permit the use of a balance of funds umder the
Credit account for financing a highway master plan and repairs and improve-
ments of various highways. This additional work is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 501-EC - First Livestock Development Project;    $4.0 million Loan of
June 19, 1967; Closing Date:  December 31, 1973
Execution of this project has been satisfactory and funds were
committed ahead of schedule.   However, a few ranch investment programs and part
of the research program remained unfinished as of the end of 1972, which
required a one-year extension of the Closing Date. The Loan should be ful-ly
disbi-ursed within the extended period.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not n".rport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Loan No. 124-EC - Education Project; $5.1 million Credit of June 27, 1968;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974
Execution of this project had a slow start mostly due to difficul-
ties in setting up the project organization, lac of counterpart funds and
tardy recruitment of experts. However, most of these problems were largely
overcome during 1971. In the ensuing months, the project made satisfactory
progress until earlier this year, when construction of the second and third
phase schools (the first phase schools have been almost completed) camne to a
standstill due, again, to lack of local funds. In addition, there have been
procedural delays in the procurement of furniture and equipment. A supervision
mission visited Ecuador in March to assist in resolving these issues. The
local financing problem has now been temporarily resolved, but additional
funds will be needed later this year to complete school construction and for
procurement of furniture and training of teachers. We are following up this
matter with the Government in an effort to achieve a permanent solution.
Concerning procurement, the Ministry of Education was expected to award soon
contracts for the supply of furniture, and call new tenders for the supply
of equipment to permit participation of manufacturers who had failed to
comply with some minute technical requirements of Ecuador's tenders law in
the first bidding.  Due to these problems, a 20-month extension of the
Closing Date to August 31, 1974 has been necessary.
Loan No. 555-EC - Fisheries Project- $5.3 million Loan of September 5, 1968;
Closing Date: October 31, 9T74
Execution of this project has also had a slow start due mainly to
institutional problems and delays in finding prospective sub-borrowers; it
was only in 1971 that applications were received from potential borrowers. The
first four fishing vessels will now be delivered at one month intervals over
the period July-October 1973.   The contract for feasibility studies for im-
proved harbor facilities is expectly to be signed soon. A revised training
program to adapt it to present fishing conditions in Ecuador has been agreed
by the Bank; consultants to help set up the program are expected to be
recruited shortly. Although disbursements should improve in the next few
months, when large payments for vessel construction, port studies and the
training program are anticipated, it will not be possible to complete dis-
bursements before the Closing Date, which will have to be extended by about
18-24 months.
Credit No. 173-EC - Interim Second Livestock Project;    $1.5 million Credit of
January 20, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Execution of this project has been satisfactory and the Credit is
being disbursed on schedule.
Credit No. 222-EC - Third Livestock Development Project;    $10.0 million Credit
of December 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Although commitments of funds are on schedule, disbursements are behind
the rate forecast due mainly to procedural delays in the submission of withdrawal

applications. However, some improvement in these procedures was evident
after the matter was reviewed with the Government in late 1972. Legislation
passed by the Government in April and May of this year creates a new mechanism
for channelling external financial resources and fixes at 9 percent the
ceiling on interest rates in the agricultural and small-scale industries
sectors. As the Credit Agreement establishes an interest rate of 12 percent
to be charged to the beneficiaries, the Association has informed the Govern-
ment that it cannot process withdrawal applications under the new arrangement.
The Association has proposed to the Government that a Bank mission should
v½sit Ecuador in late June to discuss the implications of said legislation.
Loan No. 721-EC - Development Finance Companies Project; $8.0 million Loan of
February i, 1971; Closing Date: June 1, 1974
Execution of this project is satisfactory, wi-th comrmi-tments and dis-
bursements ahead of schedule. Full disbursement is expected well before the
Closing Date.
Credit No. 286-EC - Third Power Project; $6.8 million Credit of February 15,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
This project is about five months behind schedule due to delays in
implementing a tariff increase which deferred IDA's consideration of the
Credit, and due also to the consultants not hating yet completed some of the
engineering and specifications. Because of these delays a six-month extension
of the Closing Date may be necessary. As of November 1972, overall cost
estimates were approximately 9 percent over the appraisal estimate, and may
nowhb higher following the currency realignments earlier in the year. These
cost overruns should be met from the Beneficiary's (Empresa Electrica
Quito) own internal resources and from the increased amount available from
the Japanese loazr which is expressed in yen.
