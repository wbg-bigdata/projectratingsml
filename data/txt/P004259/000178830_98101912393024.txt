DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate:   Number of live births per year per 1,000 of
population.
Crude Death Rate:   Number of deaths per year per 1,000 of population.
Rate of Natural
Increase:          Difference between crude birth and crude death rate;
usually expressed as a percentage.
Rate of Population
Growth:            Rate of natural increase adjusted for (net) migration,
and expressed as a percentage of the total population
of a given year.
General Fertility
Rate:              Number of live births per year per 1,000 women, aged
15-49 years.
Age-Specific
Fertility Rates:  Number of live births to women in a given age group
per 1,000 women in the same age group, in a given
year. It is usually calculated for 5-year age
groups.
Total Fertility
Rate:              The average number of children that would be born
per woman if she were to live to the end of her
childbearing years, and bear children according
to a given set of age-specific fertility rates.
The Total Fertility Rate often serves as an esti-
mate of the average number of children per family.
Gross Reproduction
Rate:              This is the same as the Total Fertility Rate, but
refers to the number of daughters a woman would
have under prevailing fertility patterns.
Net Reproduction
Rate:              The number of daughters a woman would have under
prevailing fertility and mortality patterns, who
would survive to the mean age of childbearing.
Infant Mortality
Rate:              Annual number of deaths of infants under 1 year
per 1,000 live births during the same year.

DEFINITIONS (Cont'd)
Maternal Mortality
Rate:              Number of maternal deaths per 1,000 births attri-
butable to pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperal
complications (i.e., within six weeks following
childbirth).
Life Expectancy:    Average number of years expected to be lived by
children born in the same year if mortality rates
for each age/sex group remain the same in the
future.
Dependency Ratio:   Number of people of 14 years or under, plus people
65 years or over, divided by the population aged
15 to 64 years.

T   POPULATION GROWTH AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Population Problem
1.01      Malaysia's population of 12.3 million in 1975 grew at a rate of
3.2% per annum between 1960-70, and doubled in size over the past 20 years.
Its natural rate of population growth declined from a level of 3% in 1966
to 2.4% in 1975, 1/ in response to both socio-economic development and family
planning efforts.   At a growth rate of 2.4%, the population will again double
in about 29 years.  The legacy of the high birth rate, experienced in the
1950s, continues to push a greater proportion of women into the reproductive
ages and a larger number of entrants into the labor market, with potential
for high rates of population growth and unemployment in the absence of delib-
erate policies to moderate these trends.
1.02      Despite the decline in fertility during the past decade, the cur-
rent population growth rate remains a handicap in achieving the objectives
of the new economic policy. The twin objectives of this policy, enunciated
in 1970, were: (a) eradicating poverty by raising income levels and in-
creasing employment opportunities; and (b) accelerating the process of
restructuring the Malaysian society to correct economic imbalances. The
development decade (1966-75), which began both with the initiation of a
population program and formulation of the development plan, witnessed sub-
stantial progress in raising the income levels and reducing the rate of
population growth. Evidence towards progress on the second objective, how-
ever, remains inconclusive. According to the Third Malaysia Plan, as of
1970, about half (49.3%) of the households ranked below the poverty line, 2/
86% of these were in rural areas; 65% of the Malay households, as compared
to 39% Indian and 26% Chinese, were under the poverty line. The incidence of
poverty in the Eastern States (Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Trengganu) exceeded
the national average, with about 50% to 65% of the households falling below
the poverty line. Avaiiable evidence suggests the existence of notable income
disparities within and among ethnic groups and regions.
1.03      The higher fertility level in the poorer section of society is
believed to have made the achievement of the second objective, the correc-
tion of economic imbalances, more difficult. The larger family size preva-
lent among poorer sections of society perpetuates the vicious circle of a
low standard of living/high fertility leading to inadequate economic oppor-
tunities/and therefore back to a low standard of living. Notable fertility
differentials in Malaysia corresponding to socio-economic inequalities men-
tioned above reinforce this belief. The Malaysian Post-Census Enumeration
1/   The rate has been adjusted for underenumeration of population estimated
in the Post Census Enumeration Survey, 1973.
2/   The poverty line is defined as income below the level necessary "for
meeting minimum nutritional and other non-food requirements of each
household to sustain a decent standard of living." Government of
Malaysia, Third Malaysia Plan, 1976, p. 160.



Survey of 1973 showed that families within the lowest 40% of the income dis-
tribution were comparatively larger than those in the upper income group.
The same type of inverse relationship between socio-economic status and family
size was observed in the Malaysian Fertility and Family Survey (MFFS) and in
the national family planning statistics of 1975 described below.
1.04      In 1975, women whose husband's monthly income averaged more than
M$500 had an average of 3.6 children, compared to 4.6 children among those
with a monthly income below M$100. On the average, women with 12 years of
education had less than two children, women with no education had more than
5 children; rural women had an average of 4.4 children, while their urban
counterparts had 4.0. Malay women had an average of 4.8 children, compared
with 4.0 for the Indians and 3.7 for the Chinese. The less-developed states
of Trengganu and Kelantan had birth rates of about 37 and 36 respectively,
compared with about 26 in the more-developed states of Perlis and Penang
(Annex 4, Tables 1-3).
1.05      The Third Malaysia Plan has given renewed emphasis to redressing
economic and social imbalances. It is now recognized that providing means
to poorer sections of society to limit family size is essential for equaliz-
ing economic opportunities. The program is taking new directions to help
meet these objectives by: (a) intensifying the family planning program in
the urban areas to reach an estimated 36% of the population who live in slum
areas; (b) extending further the integrated maternal, child health and family
planning services to rural areas; and (c) integrating the family planning
program with other development activities designed to reach disadvantaged
communities and regions. The design of the proposed project is based on
these program directions.
Past Demographic Trends, 1966-75
1.06      The decline in the rate of natural increase of the Malaysian popula-
tion (births minus deaths) since the inception of the family planning program,
as shown below, is primarily due to the fall in the birth rate. Further
decreases in the rate of natural increase will depend largely upon further
decreases in the birth rate. The death rate is already very low and has been
stable since the early 1970s. Net migration in Malaysia is insignificant, so
that the rate of natural increase is nearly the same as the rate of population
growth.

1.07      The decline in the national birth rate over the period 1967-74
was largely due to a substantial decline in the birth rate in Peninsular
Malaysia, where 85% of the population live, and where the official family
planning program has been active since 1967. Without a substantial decline
in fertility, the birth rate would have risen 1/ due to a larger number of
women born during the post-war baby boom period entering the reproductive
age group. The high birth rate during the post-World War II period con-
tributed to a dramatic increase in the proportion of population under five
years of age (19% in 1957). Consequently, 18 years later, in 1975, there
were about 1 million females aged 15-24, compared with 0.5 million in 1957.
Women in this age group contributed about 39% of the total live births in
1975, and will contribute a still higher proportion of births over the next
10-15 peak years of their reproductive life span. This legacy continues to
put pressure on population growth as young women of marriageable age begin
to constitute a higher proportion of the population.
1.08      Birth rates in Sarawak remained constant at about 29 per 1,000
during 1967-74, and a slight decline in the birth rate (from 37 to 35.5 per
1,000) was reported for Sabah, although it is still as high as Peninsular
Malaysia's rate ten years ago. Demographic trends are described in Annex 4,
T-4.
1.09      A comparative analysis of the trends of fertility decline and that
of the family planning program performance indicates that family planning
practice has made a significant contribution to the decline in fertility
during 1967-74. The total fertility rate (average number of children per
woman over her childbearing age) declined from 6.1 in 1960 to 4.3 in 1974.
Between 1960-67, fertility declined by about 14%. A large part of this
decline (over 60%) occurred in the age groups below 25, primarily because of
the increased age at marriage associated with the socio-economic development.
In contrast, in the subsequent seven-year period (1967-74), fertility declined
by about 17% and about three-quarters of this decline occurred in the age
groups of 25 years and over, with a corresponding increase in contraceptive
practice among these groups (Annex 4, T-5). Of the total program acceptors,
over 61% were aged 25 and over.
1.10      This latter fertility trend corresponds with the increase in the
level of family planning program performance during 1967-74. The number of
program acceptors per year rose from 20,000 in 1967 to 62,000 in 1974.
In 1974-75 an estimated 75% of all acceptors received contraceptives from
program sources. Over this period (1967-74), the percentage of women within
the childbearing ages in Peninsular Malaysia with knowledge of contraception,
rose from 44 to 92 and the percentage of those who ever used contraception
rose from 14 to 45.
1/   With constant 1966 fertility, the expected birth rate in 1974 would have
been about 40 per 1,000 population.



- 4 -
1.11      The median age of women at marriage, estimated at about 22 years in
1970, is believed to have gone up further. Given its present high level, it
is unlikely that further increase in the median age of women at marriage will
have any appreciable impact on fertility. Therefore, a major factor in past
fertility decline cannot be counted on for the future. This makes a strong
family planning program vital if fertility is to be reduced further.
1.12      The well-developed Malaysian health system made great strides in
reducing mortality by about 50% during the 1957-67 decade; at present the
death rate is about 6 per 1,000. The average expectation of life at birth
increased from 56 years in 1970 to 64 in 1975 for males and from 58 to 68 for
females. Infant (under 1 year) mortality declined from about 76 per 1,000 in
1970 to 33 in 1975. Infant and toddler (1 to 5 years) mortality rates vary
markedly among states and ethnic groups (Annex 4, T-1 and T-6). In spite of
the overall decline, these rates are still high in areas with inadequate
health facilities. It will be difficult to persuade people in these areas to
accept family planning unless mortality rates are reduced. Extension of
integrated MCH/nutrition services to areas where health facilities are not
available will facilitate this reduction and thus promote acceptance of family
planning.
1.13      One effect of a sharp fall in mortality while fertility remains
high is a rise in the dependency ratio, i.e., the ratio of the population
below 15 and over 64 to the population of working ages (15-64). In Peninsular
Malaysia, this ratio rose from 82% in 1957 to 87% in 1970 while, for Sarawak
and Sabah, it rose from 83% in 1960 to about 92% in 1970. A high dependency
ratio means that: (a) a high proportion of household income will be spent for
subsistence rather than a better standard of living; and (b) a high proportion
of public expenditure must be devoted to health, education and other social
services, rather than to economic development.
Future Demographic Prospects (1975-2030)
1.14      The Government of Malaysia (GOM) has not yet stated its long-term
demographic targets. Its medium-term target for Peninsular Malaysia is a
reduction of the birth rate from 30.3 per 1,000 in 1975 to 26 per 1,000 in
1985, and a corresponding population growth rate reduction from 2.4% to 2%.
No demographic targets have been set for Sabah and Sarawak, where the approach
will be to persuade people to space their children in the interest of maternal
and child health.
1.15      Attainment of the medium-term target would make it possible to
achieve replacement-level fertility in Peninsular Malaysia by 1990. This
implies a decline in the natural rate of population growth from the current
level of 2.4% to about 1% by the end of this century. Thus Peninsular Malay-
sia's population may stablize at about 18 million in the year 2030.  Alterna-
tively, if replacement level fertility is reached in the year 2000 instead of
1990, the natural rate of population growth would be about 1.8%, and the
population would stabilize at over 20 million in 2040. Under the assumption
of replacement level fertility by 1990, the population of Sarawak may stabilize
at about 2 million by the year 2030, and Sabah at about 1.6 million by the



- 5 -
year 2045. If reaching the replacement-level fertility is delayed up to the
year 2000, the population of Sarawak may stabilize at 2.3 million in 2040,
and Sabah at about 2 million in 2050 (Annex 4, T-7). If the tempo of socio-
economic development is maintained and the population program's effort is
accelerated to cover the presently underserved one third of the urban and
about one half of the rural population by 1980, Peninsular Malaysia is likely
to succeed in reaching replacement-level fertility by 1990. The family
planning program's performance trend in Malaysia, and Singapore's proven
success in approaching replacement-level fertility in about a decade, provide
reasons to be optimistic about the Malaysian demographic target.
1.16      Among the ASEAN countries, the Malaysian family planning program
performance stands second only to Singapore--a state with 90% urban popula-
tion, the world's second highest population density, and an older and stronger
family planning program in a more favorable social setting. In 1976, the
percentage of women within the reproductive ages who ever used contraception
in Peninsular Malaysia (45) was exceeded only by Singapore (77). Correspond-
ing figures for Thailand (32), Philippines (22) and Indonesia (15), were much
lower. The Malaysian program has also the distinction of achieving greater
demographic impact as it has been recruiting a much larger proportion of
younger and low-parity couples compared to other ASEAN countries. In this
region, the Malaysian family planning program budget as a percent of the
total national budget (0.11%) is the highest (Annex 4, T-8).
Socio-Economic Implications of Future Demographic Trends
1.17      Under the assumption of reaching replacement-level fertility by 1990
instead of 2000, the population of Peninsular Malaysia will possibly be about
2.4 million fewer when it stabilizes in 2030. Total fertility would decline
from 4.1 in 1975 to 1.9 in 1990 and the dependency burden may fall by about 46
percentage points by the end of the century.
1.18      Due to the baby boom of the fifties, the labor force has been
growing at a much faster rate (3%) than the population growth rate. The
Third Malaysia Plan estimates that the labor force may continue to grow at
more than 3% annually during 1980-90. During this period, the working age
population (15-64) is likely to increase by about two million, i.e., about
four times the number of jobs created under the Second Malaysian Plan when
the economic growth rate was more rapid because of favorable export prices.
Between 1970-75, 588,000 new jobs were created compared with 618,200 new
entrants in the labor force. By 1975, although the rate of unemployment was
reduced to 7%, the number of unemployed increased by about 300,000. Absorp-
tion of these new entrants into the labor force will require sustained rapid
growth of the economy. Further, to achieve the Government target of the
ethnic balance in sectoral employment, a heavy burden will be borne by indus-
tries to absorb the fast growing Malay labor force.
1.19      The impact of the decline in fertility on the working age group is
felt with a minimum lag of 15 years. Therefore the need for additional jobs
will be less by as much as 75% by the year 2015 if the replacement-level of



- 6 -
fertility is reached by 1990 instead of 2000. Feasibility of achieving this
level is enhanced by the proposed improvement in the family planning program
through the project.
1.20      Malaysia's education is heavily subsidized by the Government.  If
fertility reaches replacement level by 1990, the GOM may be able to save as
much as M$1,535 million in educational subsidies by 1990, at 1973 constant
prices.
1.21      Even at a lower rate of annual increase than the present 5%, the
total urban population will increase to three to four times its 1970 level
by the year 2000. Without a corresponding increase in urban employment, the
migrant and less-skilled workers in the urban job market are likely to expe-
rience the highest unemployment rate and consequent social problems. Thus,
without a rapid reduction in fertility to reach replacement level by 1990,
reducing economic disparities will continue to be difficult. The national
population policy and program, described in the following section, are de-
signed to accelerate the pace of this reduction in fertility to complement
the Malaysian development goal of reducing economic disparities.
II. NATIONAL POPULATION POLICY AND PROGRAM
Population Policy
2.01      The family planning activities in Peninsular Malaysia were initiated
in 1953 by a private organization, the Federation of Family Planning Associa-
tions (FFPA). In 1966, the first five-year development plan officially adopted
family planning as a means of enhancing family health and welfare and reducing
the population growth rate. The target of the plan was to reduce the rate
from 3% in 1966 to 2% in 1985, with a corresponding decline in the birth rate
from 37 to 26 per 1,000. The National Family Planning Board (NFPB) was set
up by an Act of Parliament in 1966 to prepare and implement plans to reach
this target.
2.02      In 1967, the family planning activities were initiated in East
Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) by voluntary family planning associations. The
local authorities have been providing the maternal and child health services
(MCH). The success of these activities indicates a latent demand for these
services, thus efforts are being made by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to
provide comprehensive MCH care which will include family planning services.
The MOH will thus be responsible for program implementation, while the NFPB
will coordinate and evaluate program activities and supply contraceptives.
Program Organization
2.03      NFPB:  The Board, which is an interministerial body under the Prime
Minister's Department, has been mainly responsible for the program since its
inception. The Board consists of a Chairman and 21 members, 10 representing



interested ministries/departments and 11 representing non-governmental sectors.
Under the Board are the Director General and the staffs of four technical divi-
sions and of the planning and development units. A Deputy Director General
was added as part of the first project. In 1976, the total staff of the NFPB,
including field staff, numbered over 600. The organization of the NFPB is
shown in Annex 4, C-1.
2.04       The NFPB formulates population and family planning policy, imple-
ments the program directly or through other agencies, and coordinates activ-
ities. An executive committee, consisting of the NFPB Chairman, Director
General and four other Board members, oversees the implementation of the
Board's policies with respect to the family planning program, finance and
administration. Routine program management is carried out by the chief
executive of the Board, the Director General, with the assistance of the
Deputy Director General and the four divisional directors. At the state
level, in Peninsular Malaysia, a state family planning officer carries out
routine program management responsibility.
2.05       Coordination of population program implementation is achieved
through various committees at the central and state levels. Of the nine
such committees under the Board, three deal with major aspects of the
program while the other six have specialized functions. These three commit-
tees are the National Family Planning Committee, Central Coordination Com-
mittee and Project Implementation Committee (now renamed Project Steering
Committee). The National Family Planning Committee is responsible for overall
coordination of the program as well as for formulating program guidelines and
implementation strategies for the Board. It has three subcommittees, namely:
(i) service and training; (ii) information, education and communication; and
(iii) evaluation and research. The Central Coordination Committee is respon-
sible for the coordination of the integrated rural health and family planning
program. Inter-agency population activities with respect to the project are
coordinated through the Project Steering Committee. The State Family Plan-
ning Committees and the State Coordination Committees carry out corresponding
functions at the state level. Progress and problems of the interministerial
family planning program implementation are also discussed in the monthly
meeting of the heads of the government departments chaired by the chief
secretary to the Government. The NFPB Director General represents the Board
in this meeting (Anex 4, C-2).
2.06       The NFPB budget for 1976 was M$7.75 million (US$3.2 million); this
represented a three-fold increase since 1973. The NFPB's share of the national
operating budget increased from 0.08% in 1973 to 0.15% in 1976.
2.07       MOH:  In the early 1970s, the MOH began to integrate family planning
with its MCH services. As part of the first population project, the admin-
istration of the MOH was strengthened by the appointment of an Assistant
Director for family planning at the headquarters and one MCH/FP officer in
each of the 11 states of Peninsular Malaysia. Also, an additional trained
assistant nurse and clerks have been provided at each of the main health
centers in the "intensive input demonstration area" (IIDA) program as required
under the first project. The organization of the relevant sections of the
MOH is shown in Annex 4, C-3.



- 8 -
2.08      The MOH budget in 1976 was M$379 (US$158 million), or about 7% of the
total national budget. The corresponding figures for 1973 were M$254 million
(US$106 million) and about 7%.
2.09      FFPA:  The activities of the FFPA are implemented through its 11
State Family Planning Associations which form the Federation. With the ex-
pansion of the official program, FFPA activities have become more varied and
the Federation has begun to concentrate in specialized areas such as the
treatment of sub-fertility, family life education and marriage counseling.
2.10      In Sabah and Sarawak, the Family Planning Associations, like the
FFPA, receive funds directly from the International Planned Parenthood Federa-
tion and subventions from the State Governments. These State Associations
have not yet joined the FFPA in Peninsular Malaysia, but the possibility is
under consideration.
2.11      Ministry of Education:  As part of the first project, the Ministry
of Education, with United Nations Fund for Population Activities' (UNFPA)
support, established a Population Education Unit consisting of eight profes-
sional and five general support staff to prepare population education curri-
cula, produce teaching aids and educational materials, and train teachers to
introduce population education into the school system.
2.12      Ministry of Agriculture:  The Ministry has been training its agri-
cultural extension and community development workers in family planning since
1971. Its Community Development Division has recently begun to promote activi-
ties, including family life education, which are designed to raise the socio-
economic status of women in rural areas. The Ministry's extension workers
(including 5,500 full-time village workers and 105 supervisors) receive brief
training from the NFPB in conveying family planning information in their dis-
cussions with people in the rural areas. The village workers are responsible
for recruiting women for the family development program and giving them
vocational training at the village level. The structure of the Community
Development Division is shown in Annex 4, C-4.
Program Facilities
2.13      Family planning services are provided through various channels under
the NFPB, FFPA and MOH, and by private medical practitioners and traditional
midwives. The urban areas and their peripheries are served by 79 static and
373 mobile clinics under the NFPB, and 26 static and 112 mobile clinics under
the FFPA. The FFPA also operates 98 clinics on rubber estates and plantations.
2.14      In rural Peninsular Malaysia, the health infrastructure is composed
of 1,626 facilities (68 main health centers, 243 health sub-centers and 1,315
midwife clinic-cum-quarters (MCQs) and community health centers). In 1,130
of these facilities (70%) family planning services are already available. In
the remainder, family planning services are being integrated as and when the
full complement of staff is trained. In addition, services are provided
by 170 traditional midwives in rural areas and in about 29 MCH centers in
urban areas. These existing service outlets cover a little over one-half
of the rural population of Peninsular Malaysia.



- 9 -
2.15      In Sabah and Sarawak, FPAs provide family planning services through
state health service outlets, while the NFPB supplements the supplies of con-
traceptives in Sarawak. The health infrastructure in Sarawak covers 14% of
the population adequately, 57% inadequately and 29% of the population not at
all; coverage in Sabah is even more inadequate, but specific data are not
available.
Program Performance and Trends (1967-77)
2.16      During 1967-77, the program recruited a cumulative total of about
677,000 acceptors, i.e., about 70% of the target. Of these acceptors, 60%
were recruited by the NFPB, 23% by the FFPA, 10% by MOH, and the remaining 7%
were recruited by other sources (Annex 4, T-9 and T-10). Initially, between
1967-69 the program was confined to providing family planning services through
NFPB clinics located mainly in large urban areas. The number of new acceptors
increased sharply up through 1969 (averaging more than 70,000 in 1968 and
1969). However, as the reservoir of ready acceptors was exhausted, program
performance declined because of the difficulty of recruiting additional
acceptors in urban areas and the absence of trained manpower which would
be needed to extend the program to rural areas.
2.17      Starting in 1970, the number of new acceptors dropped to 56,000 and
remained near that level until 1973. It was during this period that the MOH
started to integrate family planning services into its MCH services. Program
performance again improved after 1973 and the trend is continuing. The number
of new program acceptors exceeded 80,000 in 1977, of which about 36,000 were
from integrated rural areas covered by the first Bank-supported population
project.
2.18      The program has also been reaching the younger, low-parity, low-
income and less-educated groups. During 1967-76, the proportion of total
acceptors below age 30 increased from 57% to over 72%; the acceptors with
two or less children increased from 30% to 54%; acceptors with primary or
no formal education increased from 59% to 74% and acceptors whose husband's
income was below M$300 rose from 46% to over 62% (Annex 4, T-11). Over the
period (1970-76), the ethnic composition of acceptors has gradually approxi-
mated the composition of the population (Annex 4, T-12).
2.19      During 1967-76, significant changes took place in the levels of
knowledge of and attitudes toward family planning. Only 44% of the women of
reproductive age (15-44) knew about family planning in 1967; the proportion
increased to 92% in 1975. Simultaneously, the proportion of women 15-44
years of age who had ever used contraception increased from 14% to 45% during
this time period (Annex 4, T-13).
2.20      The demographic impact of these achievements is reflected in the
decline in total fertility from 5.2 to 4.1 during 1967-75 and a decline in
the crude birth rate in 1975 to 30.3 (compared to the target of 30). (Details
of demographic achievements are described in Annex 4, T-14).



- 10 -
Program Targets, 1978-85
2.21      The NFPB estimates that about 1 million new acceptors need to be
recruited in Peninsular Malaysia during the period 1978-85 to reach the crude
birth rate target of 26 per 1,000 by 1985. To reach this target decline in
fertility, about 44% of Peninsular Malaysian women of reproductive age (15-44
years) will need to practice contraception regularly. In 1974-75, about
35% of the women of reproductive age were reported to be practicing family
planning--40% in urban areas and 25% in rural areas. To ensure increased
level of contraceptive use, the program must provide more effective contracep-
tion to a progressively greater proportion of couples in the reproductive ages
and gradually reduce their dependence on less-effective methods and uncertain
sources of non-program acceptance. Accordingly, targets of new acceptors
to be covered are apportioned between program and non-program sources such
that the program contribution increases from 60% to 75% while the non-program
contribution decreases from 40% to 25% during the period 1978-85 (Annex 4,
T-15). These target rates of contraceptive practice will be feasible if the
plans to strengthen the program are carried out. The proposed second project
would support a major portion of the improvements needed.
III. THE FIRST POPULATION PROJECT
Design
3.01      The first population project was designed to strengthen the national
family planning program by: (a) improving administration and management;
(b) extending family planning services to rural areas and demonstrating the
effect of intensive inputs in selected rural areas; (c) expediting the family
planning training of paramedical personnel; (d) introducing population educa-
tion into the school system; (e) improving family planning, nutrition and
health education programs, particularly for the rural population; and (f)
establishing population research programs.
Composition
3.02      The project consisted of:  (a) the construction and equipping of
MCH/FP administrative centers, urban and rural clinics, a new rural health
training center, and extensions to an existing rural health training center
and to 365 mid-wifery clinic-cum-quarters (MCQs); (b) equipment for evaluation
and research, family planning services/nutrition education, and for the
production of IEC materials; (c) 147 four-wheel drive vehicles and 200 scooters;
(d) advisory services; (e) funds for training teachers, paramedical staff, and
traditional midwives; (f) the preparation of materials for population education
and the IEC program; (g) contraceptive supplies; (h) the establishment of a
Project Construction Unit; and (i) an external review of the program.



- 11 -
Financing
3.03      Total project cost was estimated at US$14.5 million.  It was financed
by a UNFPA grant of US$4.3 million, a Bank loan of US$5.0 million, and a GOM
contribution of US$5.2 million. The Bank loan financed the total foreign
exchange cost, estimated at 49% of the Bank-assisted component of the project,
including interest and other charges.
Implementation
3.04      For implementation of the project, the GOM formed a Project Imple-
mentation Committee (newly renamed Project Steering Committee). The loan was
signed in February 1973, and became effective in June 1973. The UNFPA entered
into direct agreement with the GOM to finance a set of separate project com-
ponents in parallel with the Bank. After initial delays, most of the UNFPA
funds have now been spent. The main delay in executing the Bank component
of the project has been in the completion of physical facilities. The basic
reasons for the delay were:
a.   the NFPB Project Secretariat was weak at the outset, while
at the MOH no individual was assigned full-time responsibility
for project implementation. Because the project was small,
the MOH did not establish the Project Construction Unit as
required by the Legal Agreement; consequently, there was
inadequate coordination of the civil works;
b.   the location of buildings and the architects' briefs were fre-
quently changed causing several months' delay in construction;
and
C.   the sites were not acquired as scheduled, thus preparatory
work for construction was delayed.
3.05      To avoid repetition of these situations and to improve implementa-
tion, several measures are being introduced into the proposed second project
(described in paras. 4.68 and 5.16-5.24). In the meantime, new management at
the NFPB has significantly expedited progress of the first project through
intensification of management control, field supervision and closer inter-
agency coordination.
Progress
3.06      Despite initial delays and difficulties, considerable progress has
been made in the following crucial project activities such as: (a) comple-
tion of family planning training of 2,700 MOH auxiliary health staff and
supervisory personnel; (b) the provision of staff and equipment in the IIDA
and the completion of related baseline surveys; (c) appointment of 11 state
MCH/FP officers; (d) preparation of 20 IEC training modules and expansion
of IEC activities; (e) establishment of a population education unit in the
Ministry of Education; (f) installation of a mini-computer for the NFPB;



- 12 -
(g) initiation of a population study program in the University of Malaya;
(h) completion of project activities under FFPA; and (i) completion of a
management study and an external review of the program.
3.07      Almost all vehicles and special equipment have been either procured
or ordered. Most of the advisers have completed their assignments. About
232 buildings out of a total 571 have been completed and the remaining are
scheduled for completion during the next 15 months.
Disbursements
3.08      As of the end of May 1978, US$1.3 million (about 26% of the loan)
had been disbursed, although the Government had expended sums equivalent to
more than 36% of the loan by April 1978; an updated disbursement schedule is
given in Annex 4, T-16. In addition to slow project implementation, disburse-
ment delays related to civil works are also caused by the difficulty of
obtaining payment vouchers to support applications for withdrawals. The cost
of the civil works component of the project has almost doubled, and is now
estimated at US$10.6 million (Annex 4, T-17). The GOM has allocated adequate
funds in the Third Malaysia Plan to meet these cost overruns. However, if
loan disbursements for civil works continue at the agreed rate of 30% of the
total cost, the loan will be exhausted by the end of 1979.
Impact
3.09      Preliminary indications suggest that the demographic impact of
a number of components already completed and of the covenants in the Legal
Agreement complied with is significant. As the project has progressed, the
number of acceptors has steadily increased, reaching over 80,000 in 1977. The
most striking increase was achieved by the integrated rural health/family
planning services, where annual acceptance rose from less than 3,000 in 1971
to about 36,000 in 1977.
External Review
3.10      As provided in the first Loan Agreement, the progress of the program
was reviewed in 1977 by an External Review Team. The Team's principal recom-
mendations are: (a) in addition to new acceptors, the family planning target
should be expressed in terms of protection rate and reduction of fertility,
and not more than 25 to 30% of the target should be left to non-program
sources; (b) consideration should be given to the provision of payments to
medical practitioners to perform sterilizations and IUD insertions when
Government facilities cannot cope with the demand; (c) additional service
delivery points should be created in the rural and urban areas in order to
provide services for the estimated 730,000 rural and 105,000 urban households
classified as "poor"; (d) the NFPB should try to improve the political accept-
ability of family planning through a "desensitization" campaign; (e) the capa-
city of NFPB's IEC Division to produce program materials should be strength-
ened; (f) the number of professionals in the NFPB's Evaluation Division should
be increased; (g) a National Research Committee should be set up to encourage
research, propose topics and set priorities; (h) a Population Study Center



- 13 -
should be established in the graduate school of the University of Malaya; (i)
the NFPB, MOH and FFPA should set up a committee to design standard forms for
data collection and performance reports; (j) a cost-effectiveness analysis
should be applied to the program, and the NFPB Finance Division should be
strengthened for this purpose; and (k) a coordinator should be appointed to
supervise the progress of civil works.
Program Requirements and Extension of First Project Activities
3.11      In the light of the External Review Team's recommendations and
new program directions, a number of activities initiated in the first project
need to be extended to improve the program, such as: (a) construction of
additional urban clinics; (b) extension of the IIDA program; (c) further
addition of mobile information units; and (d) strengthening of the management
information system initiated in the first project. Other program needs are:
(a) reduction in the emphasis on pills and provision of alternative con-
traceptive methods; (b) provision for treatment of side effects of contra-
ceptive use over a long duration; and (c) broadening of the program base
through integration of population education in development programs. The
following section describes the component activities which will be under-
taken in the second project to meet these program needs.
IV. SECOND PROJECT
A. Design, Objectives, Activities and Composition
Design
4.01      The project is designed to help meet the demographic and develop-
ment goals of Malaysia as defined in para. 1.05. It will further support
the national family planning program by extending the activities begun in the
first project and by meeting other priority program needs identified by the
GOM, the External Review Team and the Bank. Unlike the first project, the
second project will also cover the states of Sabah and Sarawak.
Objectives
4.02      The objectives of the project, which will form the basis of its
evaluation, are: (a) to improve the rate of continuation of contraceptive
practice, promote the availability of alternative methods, and increase the
number of acceptors; (b) to extend services to regions and communities where
they are at present inadequate or unavailable; (c) to improve the monitoring
and evaluation of the program and promote operational and policy-related
research into determinants of demographic changes and their linkages with
socio-economic development; and (d) to promote a smaller family norm and
demand for family planning services.



- 14 -
Activities
4.03      To these ends the second project, to be implemented over a four-
year period, will: (a) establish family planning specialist centers under the
NFPB for the provision of specialized health care related to family planning;
(b) extend the NFPB service delivery network in urban areas; (c) strengthen
the MCH and family planning services of the MOH in 44 districts by replicating
the first project's IIDA program; (d) expand and strengthen the capacity of
the MOH to give in-service training to its staff in integrated rural health
and family planning; (e) strengthen the health education program of the MOH
and the information, education and communication (IEC) program of the NFPB;
(f) strengthen the NFPB management information system and increase NFPB's
research and evaluation capacities; (g) expand the capacity of the Ministry
of Agriculture's family development training and promote non-familial roles
for women; (h) strengthen the administration of health and family planning
services at the MOH and NFPB; (i) improve NFPB's contraceptive storage and
distribution system; and (j) make provision for various innovative activities
to test new strategies for program improvement.

B. Project Description
Specialized National Family Planning Services
4.05      Since its inception, the program has relied heavily on pills;
nearly 85% of all new acceptors during the last ten years chose this method.
The availability of other methods, such as IUD, sterilization and menstrual



- 16 -
regulation, is not adequate. Heavy reliance on pills reduces program effec-
tiveness for two primary reasons:  First, as the average age of acceptance
declines, the time span over which the acceptor needs protection increases,
thus representing possible health risks. Second, as the increasing volume
of acceptors makes the incidence of side effects more conspicuous, greater
discontinuation may result. (A 1971 survey indicated that pill side effects
were the chief reason for discontinuation.)
4.06      About 10% of program acceptors are found to be in need of medical
attention. Among married women aged 15-44, 10% are estimated to be sterile
or sub-fecund and in need of infertility counseling. About 46,000 women every
year give birth to deformed babies and need genetic counseling. It is esti-
mated that at present the hospitals are meeting only 14% of the potential
demand for sterilizations (4,000 sterilizations were performed in 1974 in
Government hospitals, compared to an estimated demand of 29,000). A recent
FFPA survey (Maternal Health and Early Pregnancy Wastage, 1977) noted that
11% of the reported pregnancies resulted in abortions. Seventy percent of the
abortees responded that they would have used reliable contraceptive methods if
alternatives had been available. Hospital records indicate a high fatality
associated with these abortions.
4.07      Present ad hoc efforts to deal with these problems are inadequate.
Hospitals and other institutions are too busy to deal with abnormal and
complicated family planning cases. Because facilities are not available,
less than 2% of women accepting pills are able to obtain Pap smear tests
for cancer detection. There is a backlog of two to three months for
sterilization cases, partly because of inadequate theater space and
partly because few doctors are trained in out-patient sterilization
techniques.
4.08      The NFPB lacks the capacity for bio-medical research pertaining to
the safety, effectiveness and practicability of family planning methods in the
context of bio-medical and cultural characteristics of the Malaysian popula-
tion. At present this research is conducted to a limited extent by individuals
in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Malaya.
4.09      To meet these needs, the NFPB proposes to establish one national and
four regional family planning specialist centers whose functions will be to:
a.   provide: (i) the services of specialists for cancer
detection; (ii) diagnosis and treatment of complications
resulting from oral pills, injectables, and menstrual
regulation; (iii) counseling for genetic defects and
infertility; and (iv) sterilization, injectables and
menstrual regulation on an out-patient basis;
b.   train doctors to provide the above services; and
c.   conduct and promote program-oriented and country-specific
bio-medical research in collaboration with other medical
institutions.



- 1 7 -
The provision of specialized services will help dispel the stigma attached
to family planning as a birth reducing effort only; it will improve the
program approach to people and thus increase the number of clients. The
research facilities will also help to make specialization in family planning
more attractive to medical and paramedical personnel.
4.10      The national center will be located in Kuala Lumpur and the regional
centers at Kota Bahru (Kelantan), Johore Bahru (Johore), Ipoh (Perak) and
Penang. Consideration in the planning of both the national and regional
centers has been given to subsequent expansion. Although all five centers
will provide services and training and conduct research, the regional centers
will concentrate on services, and conduct research and training only as
directed by the national center.
4.11      Besides construction and equipping of these centers, the project
provides for special equipment, vehicles and technical assistance, including
fellowships. Full physical facilities will be required for the national
center only. Urban family planning clinic buildings provided under the first
project will be enlarged or modified to meet the needs of the four regional
centers. Pending completion of the physical facilities, the centers will
begin functioning on a small scale in existing premises. The project includes
operating expenses for four years for all five centers to cover staff salaries,
laboratory operating expenses, research costs, and related maintenance expenses.
4.12      The Director of the national center will report directly to the
Director General of the NFPB. The center will have 9 technical sections,
staffed by about 12 specialists, 7 technicians and 30 general support staff
(see Annex 4, C-5). Each regional center will be headed by a medical officer,
and its staff will consist of 2 specialists, 5 technicians, 4 staff nurses and
12 general support staff.
4.13      A Medical and Research Advisory Committee will:  (a) determine
research priorities; (b) approve research study designs; and (c) ensure coor-
dination of research with other institutions. The Committee will consist of
representatives of the NFPB, MOH, the Universities of Malaya and Kebangasaan,
and the Institute of Medical Research.
4.14      The NFPB proposes to appoint an adviser for an initial period of six
months to: (a) prepare an action plan for the centers; and (b) determine
physical space, equipment and manpower requirements. The appointment of the
adviser will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.15      The capacity of the centers will not be sufficient to meet program
requirements. In any case, the innovative nature of their activities limits
the rate at which these centers can be expanded. The number of Pap smear
tests at these centers will be limited to 90,000 a year, 30,000 at the
national center and 15,000 at each of the four regional centers. Although,
ideally, the present 600,000 oral pill acceptors and an additional 100,000
acceptors every year should undergo these tests, for at least three years the
centers will be able to examine only those already suspected to have complica-
tions, or who have taken the pill for three years or more.



- 18 -
4.16      By training existing Government physicians, the national specialist
center may be able to increase the number of sterilizations performed in
Government hospitals and clinics from 4,000 to 10,400. These, together with
the proposed capacity for 2,000 sterilizations at the national center and
1,300 at the four regional centers, will create a total annual capacity of
about 14,000 sterilizations. This capacity will meet only 50% of the esti-
mated annual demand of 29,000. It is assumed that private physicians, who
also will be trained at the centers, will be able to satisfy part of the unmet
demand.
4.17      About 240 doctors (180 Government and 60 private), representing 10%
of the total physicians in the country, need to be trained. The corresponding
figure for nurses is 420, or 40% of the existing nurses. The centers will
train about 100 doctors and 80 nurses a year in sterilization techniques and
other modern methods of fertility control. It will take about two and a half
years to train 240 physicians and five years to train 420 nurses. Meanwhile,
a backlog of 80 new doctors and 200 new nurses will accumulate each year.
Annual training capacities are given in Annex 4, T-18.
4.18      The family planning specialist centers' performance will be assessed
in terms of quantitative performance indicators specified in Annex 3.
Urban Family Planning Services
4.19      The rapidly growing urban population, estimated at 3.6 million in
1977, is expected to reach 4.5 million by 1982. No data are available, but
it is believed that migration from the country to the towns has accelerated.
The migrants are concentrated in a few slum areas in which the NFPB is making
special efforts to provide family planning services.
4.20      In 1977, there were 113 urban static family planning clinics.  Of
these, 79 were run by the NFPB and 34 by the FFPA. At the present time each
clinic, on an average, reaches a population of more than 26,000. There are
also about 440 so-called "mobile clinics" attended on certain days of the week
by staff from the static clinics in areas where full-time clinics have not yet
been set up, or the demand for family planning does not warrant full-time
service. Each mobile clinic, on an average, covers 3,000 population.
4.21      It is estimated that by 1982, 36 additional clinics will be needed
to maintain the coverage of population at 30,000 per clinic. The second
project includes the construction and equipment of 36 urban clinics. These
36 clinics do not meet the total requirement as only 15 will be additional
clinics located in areas where no services are yet available; eight will
represent conversions from mobile to static, and 13 will replace inadequate
clinics. Out of the total 36 clinics, the 15 clinics in new areas will
include space for MCH services to be provided by the MOH, hitherto not avail-
able in these areas. The remaining clinics' needs will be met by using MOH
facilities and additional mobile units.



- 19 -
4.22      The 15 additional clinics will enable an additional 450,000 people
to have ready access to services. Another 200,000 population will be served
through conversion of mobile to static clinics. This improved coverage is
expected to help in reaching the urban target of contraceptive use--which is
60% of the women within the reproductive age group by 1985. In 1976, about
41% of the total acceptors were served by urban clinics, although only 19% of
the total acceptors were urban residents. Thus, about half of the acceptors
served by urban clinics were classified as rural residents for that year.
(Data are given in Annex 4, T-19.)
4.23      The project also includes 14 station wagons to strengthen supervision
and home visiting, and 24 man-months of fellowships for advanced training of
the senior staff of the Service Division under the NFPB. The incremental
operating cost for the additional clinics will be M$460,000 (US$192,000) per
year and will be met from the recurrent budgets of the MOH and NFPB.
4.24      The criteria for evaluating the performance of urban services are
specified in Annex 3.
MCH/FP Services in Rural Areas
4.25      The rural population was estimated at 7.3 million in 1977 and is
expected to increase to about 9 million by 1985. The present 1,626 MOH
health centers and clinics in rural areas cover a little over half of the
population, and the more remote areas are served by mobile teams. The MOH
proposes to further strengthen the existing MCH/FP services through additional
mobile teams, better supervision, frequent home visits and improved health and
family planning education.
4.26      The MOH has already introduced family planning services into the
M.CH program in about 70% of its rural health facilities. To promote this
integration and strengthen the MCH services, the first project provided for
an IIDA program. Under this program, the project provided additional inputs
in 27 out of 70 administrative districts, covering a population of three
million, or 25% of the total rural population.
4.27      The additional inputs of the first project consist of:  (a) con-
version of MCQs into community health centers; (b) training of midwives and
assistant nurses in the delivery of family planning services; (c) an increase
in the nursing and clerical staff at the health centers; (d) supplying vehi-
cles, including scooters for midwives, and nutrition equipment (weighing
scales and cooking equipment); (e) production of IEC materials; and (f) the
evaluation of the program. All of the above, except the physical facilities
and IEC materials, have been in place for one to two years.
4.28      Pending a complete evaluation scheduled for 1978-79, the NFPB is
monitoring performance through service statistics which indicate that, during
1975 and 1976, IIDAs accounted for over 70% of the new acceptors from rural
areas, and that in 1976 about 36% of women in IIDAs were practicing family
planning, compared to 25% in all rural areas. An ad hoc survey in Trengganu
showed that the number of home visits by midwives doubled after they were
provided with scooters.



- 20 -
4.29      Encouraged by these results, the MOH has decided to extend the
program to 44 district, using similar inputs. The project will contribute
to these inputs by providing: (a) 188 mini-buses and 500 scooters; (b) 2,580
infant and adult weighing scales; (c) 1,100 refrigerators for vaccines; and
(d) educational and audiovisual materials and equipment.
4.30      The first project provided the MOH with 26 mobile teams to cover the
more remote areas. The need for further expansion of comprehensive health
services in remote areas was emphasized by a 1976 World Health Organization
(WHO) study. The second project will, therefore provide 50 vehicles, 24 of
them for new mobile teams, and 26 to replace the vehicles assigned to the
existing teams. Each team consists of a medical officer, a hospital assistant,
a public health staff nurse, an assistant nurse, one female and one male
attendant and a driver. The teams provide a wide range of medical and health
services (including antenatal, postnatal, and child health care), immunization,
and nutrition, family planning and health education. Each team covers 10,000
to 20,000 people. Thus, the 24 additional teams will cover 240,000 to 480,000
people.
4.31      The project will also equip 10 mobile teams for Sarawak with ambu-
lances, long boats and engines and provide fellowships for nine man-months to
train MOH officials in planning and management of integrated MCH/FP services
and addition of MCH/FP clinics to 12 existing dispensaries including vehicles
for these clinics.
4.32      The evaluation of the above facilities should be made through the
analysis of routine service data and a few special studies administered before
and after the new inputs to obtain quantitative measures of performance indi-
cators specified in Annex 3. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the GOM that the MOH will finalize the establishment of an appropriate
transportation maintenance system 1/ not later than August 31, 1979, to ensure
proper upkeep of the vehicles to be provided under the project.
Training of Staff for Integrated Rural Health and Family Planning Services
4.33      The categories of health staff responsible for rural health and
family planning services are: (a) physicians; (b) nurses with three years
of training and 12 years of basic education; (c) assistant nurses with two
years of training and nine years of basic education; (d) hospital assistants
with three years of training and 12 years of basic education; and (e) midwives
with two years of training and six years of basic education.
4.34      The midwives--the basic peripheral workers--will soon be replaced
by community nurses in order to provide a broad range of health services,
including family planning, instead of simply MCH care as at present. They
will be stationed in MCQs which will be upgraded to community health centers.
The MOH is trying to convert a cadre of midwives into a cadre of community
1/   The MOH, with WHO's assistance, completed a study (1976-77) on the ways
of improving the maintenance of MOH's vehicles. A proposal of estab-
lishing a new maintenance system is under review by the Government.



- 21 -
nurses by giving them six months' training. In addition, three new schools
are being established to provide a two-year training program for community
nurses. Midwives will continue to be stationed in hospitals.
4.35      The basic training of the above categories of nurses (e-cept com-
munity nurses) has hitherto included only two hours of instruction in family
planning. In-sevice training in family planning is, therefore, essential.
The MOH is now planning to include family planning training in the basic
training of nurses and midwives. The training of supervisory staff (both
doctors and nurses) in family planning is conducted by the NFPB, which has
already trained 90% of them. The NFPB can train 100 personnel annually,
and this is adequate for completion of the supervisors' training.
4.36      The in-service training of assistant nurses, community nurses and
midwives is conducted by the MOH, which has trained the present 2,700 assistant
nurses and midwives at the five temporary schools set up under the first pro-
ject. The MOH is now proposing to give these workers three weeks' retraining
in family planning and nutrition. The staff to be retrained in the two above-
mentioned categories will exceed 3,500 in 1980, and will increase to 4,400 in
1985 and near 5,000 in 1990. The GOM proposes to retrain all staff every four
to five years.
4.37      In Sarawak and Sabah, the Government plans to give all health and
medical staff in-service retraining, which will include family planning. The
total number of staff to be trained in Sarawak will be over 1,000 in 1980 and
will reach about 2,000 in 1990. The corresponding figures for Sabah are 440
and 730. The annual training requirements in both Peninsular and East Malaysia
are given in Annex 4, T-20.
4.38      The project includes:  (a) the construction and equipment of:  (i) six
integrated rural health and family planning training schools for various cate-
gories of rural health staff--three in Peninsular Malaysia, two in Sarawak and
one in Sabah; (ii) field training facilities for community nurses and hospital
assistants including trainees' quarters--73 quarters--39 at community health
centers and 34 at MCQs in Peninsular Malaysia, 56 quarters at 32 rural health
centers in Sarawak; (iii) 25 staff quarters at training schools in Sarawak;
and (iv) conversion of 34 MCQs in Peninsular Malaysia into community health
centers; (b) the provision of vehicles, equipment, training materials and
manuals; (c) the evaluation of the training program; and (d) 46 man-months of
fellowships, (40 man-months to train eight tutors for the Sabah training
school and six man-months of study tours for the MOH Training and Manpower
Division).
4.39      During negotiations, the GOM agreed that: (a) the MOH will evaluate
the functions and training needs of the health staff prior to developing the
training curricula; and (b) the curricula and training of trainers of such
staff will be completed at least three months before completion of construc-
tion of the schools.

Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
4.40      Malaysia has reached a stage of development at which it is becoming
more difficult to recruit new family planning acceptors without an effective
IEC program. The need for such a program is already obvious in the urban
areas, where the number of acceptors has leveled off since 1970. The GOM,
therefore, proposes to intensify IEC activities in urban areas, and integrate
family planning education with development activities for rural areas (such as
health education and the community development program) to sustain an increase
in the recruitment level and thus avoid plateauing of performance experienced
in urban areas.
4.41      In Malaysia, the family planning IEC program has so far been largely
conducted by the NFPB and FFPA. The role of the FFPA, as a voluntary organi-
zation, is small, though extremely important. The introduction of population
education into the school system by the Ministry of Education and into rural
development training program by the Ministry of Agriculture is recent. The
NFPB is responsible for coordinating and standardizing all IEC activities and
disseminating population and family planning knowledge.
4.42      The IEC program has been handicapped by:  (a) political sensitivity
to the use of mass media for IEC; (b) the absence of a detailed IEC plan and
inadequate coordination of IEC efforts of the various agencies; (c) a weak
health education program largely because of the frequent transfers of the
central unit staff and shortages of educational materials and software for
audiovisual equipment; (d) insufficient research and systematic evaluation;
and (e) slow progress of population education activities. The project is
designed to overcome some of these limitations.
4.43      During formulation of the first project, the NFPB prepared plans
for campaigns directed towards a variety of target audiences. Some of these
campaigns had to be curtailed because of increased political sensitivity to
family planning. The External Review Team recommended the engagement of a
commercial firm of public relations experts to advise ways of reducing public
sensitivity to the issue of family planning. Although the NFPB feels that it
might not be desirable to use a commercial firm for this purpose at present,
it proposes to develop an IEC plan which will include strategies to elicit
social and political support for the program. Another way is to include
family planning in the development programs of as many ministries as possible.
The project, therefore, aims at strengthening health education and community
development activities.
4.44      While the NFPB has prepared an outline of IEC activities to be under-
taken during the project period, it should also prepare a detailed coordinated
IEC plan of action defining the objectives of the IEC program, methods for
reaching individual target groups, the role of each of the agencies, the
mechanism for coordination and evaluation, and a time schedule. On the basis
of this overall plan, the participating agencies should prepare their own
sub-plans.



- 23 -
4.45      During negotiations the GOM agreed that the proposed overall IEC
plan will be submitted for the Bank's comment not later than January 31, 1979
and the sub-plan for health education not later than April 30, 1979. To
monitor the IEC program, the NFPB has established an IEC Subcommittee to the
National Family Planning Committee. The composition and terms of reference of
the Committee should be included in the IEC plan.
4.46      Group talks have been successfully conducted through NFPB's mobile
information units. Altogether, the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia have 23
mobile vans with audiovisual equipment. Eleven of these vans were supplied
under the first project, which also provided for communication research and
evaluation. The second project will add to these units and expand the NFPB's
capacity for producing printed materials and films and strengthen communica-
tion research and evaluation capabilities.
4.47      The MOH has a Health Education Unit with a small central staff and
one health education officer in each state which provides health education,
including family planning, with the help of six audiovisual vans and a small
press for printing pamphlets and posters. In the first project, the Bank
provided audiovisual equipment while the UNFPA provided technical assistance
and equipment for the production of films and other materials (film strips,
slides, charts, etc.,) for use in training health education officers. Not
all of the equipment is yet in place. The present project proposes the
establishment of an Audiovisual Material Production Center (AVPC) under the
MOH's Health Education Unit to enhance the capability to develop and produce
audio-visual materials such as film strips, slides, transparencies, posters
and printed material.  This unit should be able to meet the needs of the MOH
and other agencies for these materials.
4.48      The Ministry of Education, with UNFPA support under the first
project, is preparing population education curricula for the school system,
but has yet to arrange for the requisite training of teachers and to incor-
porate the subject in textbooks. The first project Loan Agreement required
the introduction of population education in the schools by December 31, 1976;
this date will be revised. UNFPA funds under the first project are adequate
to complete the training program.
4.49      For the Ministry of Agriculture, since 1971 the NFPB has been train-
ing agricultural extension workers to spread family health and family planning
ideas, and to help the Community Development Division arrange courses in
family planning in its four family development training centers (para. 4.55).
4.50      Evaluation of the IEC program to be implemented by all agencies, as
well as communication research, is the responsibility of the Research, Evalua-
tion and Management Information System (REMIS) Division of the NFPB. The
project provides for a small staff and fellowships to strengthen this capabil-
ity in the NFPB.  The project will thus provide the NFPB with:  (a) construc-
tion and equipping of a print shop; (b) 18 mobile vans--seven to replace old
ones and 11 to add one van per state; (c) funds for the production and pur-
chase of films; (d) fellowships for the training of IEC managers and evaluators
(27 man-months); and (e) two officers for evaluation of IEC activities. For
the MOH Health Education Unit, the project will provide:



- 24 -
(a) construction and equipping of an AVPC; (b) one three-ton truck for deliv-
ery of AVPC supplies; (c) a mobile maintenance unit for audiovisual equipment;
(d) 16 mobile vans with audiovisual equipment (five to replace old ones and
11 new ones); (e) funds for the production and purchase of films and other IEC
software; (f) 77 film-strip projectors; (g) fellowships (nine man-months) for
staff training; (h) advisory services (two man-years) to help establish the
AVPC; and (i) funds for health education evaluation studies.
4.51      During negotiations, the GOM agreed to strengthen the Health Education
Unit of the MOH with the appointment of a head in an appropriate rank to
ensure effective execution of the project, and not later than March 31, 1979,
a competent health professional will be appointed to head the AVPC with direct
responsibility to the head of the Health Education Unit. The proposed staffing
of the Unit is given in Annex 4, C-6.
4.52      The MOH should obtain the services of an adviser for six months to
assist in preparing a master plan of action for Health Education and a pro-
duction plan for the AVPC, and also to determine the space, equipment and
manpower requirements of the AVPC. During negotiations, the GOM agreed that
the appointment of this adviser, in accordance with the terms of reference to
be agreed on between the GOM and the Bank, will be made not later than October
1978. The operational cost of the center will be borne by the GOM.
4.53      The IEC activities of the NFPB and the MOH will be assessed in terms
of quantitative performance indicators specified in Annex 3.
Women's Development Programs
4.54      Measures to improve the socio-economic status of women, and thus
give them alternatives to child bearing, have proved effective in many coun-
tries in creating a demand for family planning services. One of the most
convenient channels for reaching women in Malaysia is the Family Development
Program under the Community Development Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.55      The Community Development Division has four family development
training centers (FDTCs), which offer full-time residential courses for:
(a) village community development workers--one in each village; and (b) other
women from rural areas wishing to be trained. Already 5,500 village workers
and 105 district supervisors have been trained at these four centers. The
functions of the village workers are to: (a) organize home economics demon-
strations, including vocational training classes; (b) visit rural families to
offer advice on home economics topics; (c) organize community projects; and
(d) conduct play groups for pre-school aged children. Because of the growing
demand for this training, the Ministry of Agriculture is planning three more
FDTCs--one is now being established and two are proposed under the present
project.



- 25 -
4.56      The four existing and three planned FDTCs will permit about 750
students a year to be trained in various courses of varying duration. The
training capacity of the FDTCs is summarized in Annex 4, T-21. The capacity
will not be sufficient to cope with the backlog of applications and the need
for retraining the 5,500 village workers and 105 district supervisors. Based
upon the experience of the experimental community service centers (para. 4.57),
the GOM will plan for further extension of the training facilities. The proj-
ect provides for the construction and equipping (including vehicles) of two
FDTCs.
4.57      The GOM proposes to establish 15 experimental community service
centers (CSCs) at district levels, one per state and one additional for each
of the two priority states. Three of these CSCs will be established under the
Bank's fourth education project and 12 under this project. These centers will
be a link between the village worker and the village women, inasmuch as they
will provide short training courses for the villagers in various vocations,
and demonstrations of housekeeping, child care, nutrition and handicrafts.
These centers will serve as a focus for social activities and as a development
service referral network for the district. Previously trained village women
will provide handicraft demonstrations at these centers. Six delivery vans are
included in the project to take the goods produced in the CSCs to the FDTCs
for grading and pricing and then to the women's handicraft sales organization
for marketing.
4.58      Unless the above-described activities result in tangible economic
benefits to the village women, they will be self-defeating. To help establish
the organizational mechanism necessary to promote these activities, the project
includes funds for the purchase of a shop for the women's handicraft sales
organization and the payment of staff salaries for four years. Funds are also
provided for surveys to determine: (a) types of handicrafts in demand;
(b) available skills and resources for production; and (c) the preferences of
village women in terms of vocational and home development training. Findings
from the comprehensive study of existing non-formal education (funded under
the Bank's fourth education project and conducted by the Malaysian Center for
Development Studies) to be available in mid-1978, will be used for preparing
detailed action plans for the FDTCs and the CSCs. During negotiations, the
GOM agreed that the Ministry of Agriculture will prepare and furnish for Bank
comments, no later than December 31, 1978, a detailed plan of action which shall:
(a) specify the time allotted to family life and MCH/FP topics in the training
at the FDTCs and in the activities at the CSCs; and (b) link the training to
be carried out in the FDTCs with activities at the CSCs and women's handicraft
sales organization.
4.59      The project includes 53 man-months of fellowships to train ten
professionals in six areas of specialization. On completing their training,
they will staff the two FDTCs, the women's handicraft sales organization and
the relevant units within the Community Development Division.
4.60      The Ministry of Agriculture's performance will be assessed in terms
of the quantitative performance indicators specified in Annex 3. The findings
of the study under the Bank project on the existing status of non-formal



- 26 -
education and family-development activities and those of project-funded market
research will be used to establish baseline measures to compare with later
measures of project performance.
Research, Evaluation and Management Information System (REMIS)
4.61      The REMIS Division of the NFPB has hitherto concentrated on the
production of routine service statistics and on making periodic evaluation
studies. Shortage of computer software and professional staff, and lack
of interest on the part of local research institutions have restricted the
Division's capacity to analyze routine service statistics for feedback to
state and district officers. The first project increased this capacity by
providing a mini-computer and advisory services.
4.62      On the recommendation of the External Review Team, the NFPB has
established a National Population Research Committee to coordinate research
and determine priorities. Assurance was obtained during negotiations that,
as recommended by the External Review Team, an evaluation subcommittee re-
presenting each of the implementing agencies will be formed by December 31,
1978 in order to: (a) review the existing research system; (b) determine
operational data needs; (c) specify the frequency and means of data collec-
tion; and (d) design forms and procedures for data collection, processing and
feedback.
4.63      Research and evaluation studies to be undertaken by the NFPB during
the project period will help to identify the determinants of reproductive
behavior and analyze the interaction between demographic and development
variables in the Malaysian socio-economic context. Because of the increasing
demands on its operational research and evaluation capacity, the NFPB should
contract out to universities and other institutions as many research studies
as possible. Further, as recommended by the External Review Team, the NFPB
should engage graduate students with a view toward their specializing in
population research and evaluation. Recognizing the part the universities
could play, the first project supported the population study program at the
University of Malaya. This program has developed to a stage where a full-
fledged Population Study Center could be established, and the GOM is now
seeking UNFPA assistance for this purpose.
4.64      Although the MOH is collecting MCH data, it has not yet analyzed
these with a view toward the development of a system of feedback. The NFPB
will work closely with the MOH in analyzing operationally relevant service
statistics.
4.65      To help the REMIS Division to undertake the above activities, the
project provides software for the mini-computer, office equipment, vehicles
for surveys and funds for six research studies. It also provides for the
hiring of university graduates for secondary data analysis and contracting
out of indepth analyses of existing data to the universities.
4.66      The External Review Team pointed out that the staff of the REMIS
Division is "bottom heavy." To correct this deficiency, the NFPB should fill
the vacancies for six professional staff at headquarters (Annex 4, C-7). The



- 27 -
project provides fellowships to train three senior professionals and salary
support for 20 evaluation assistants. It also provides 6.4 man-years of
advisory services to help analyze existing NFPB data and guide future special
studies and surveys. These advisers will also assist in the analysis of MCH
data and the evaluation of the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Administration and Management
4.67      The first project included a management study.  The principal
recommendations of this study, which have been accepted by the NFPB, were:
(a) a computer-based management information system should be set up to monitor
program inputs and performance; (b) a management information unit should be
set up in the Research and Evaluation Division; (c) a Planning and Development
Division should be created; (d) the positions of Director General and Deputy
Director General of the NFPB should be permanent and full-time, and the
Director General should also be Project Administrator; (e) a ministerial
circular clarifying NFPB's role in the formulation, review and monitoring
of population-related programs, including their funding, be issued; (f) the
integration of family planning with rural health and its introduction into
the work of other development agencies be accelerated; (g) a manual of project
operational procedures should be adopted; and (h) the NFPB should gradually
transfer the implementation of the family planning program to other agencies,
with a view toward eventually confining its role to that of planning and
coordination.
4.68      Action has been taken on all recommendations.  The last recommenda-
tion is of long-term nature and is being gradually implemented. The Project
Secretariat of the NFPB is finalizing an operational manual (referred to in
(g) above) which is to be approved by the Project Steering Committee. This
manual will consist of: (i) program and project objectives and targets for
participating agencies along with quantitative indicators for measuring
the attainment of such objectives; (ii) mechanism for collection of required
information and analysis; (iii) project implementation schedules; and
(iv) project administrative procedures. During negotiations, the GOM agreed
that the participating agencies will adopt and adhere to this manual in the
implementation of their respective activities.
4.69      To decentralize NFPB administration and promote cooperation between
the NFPB and MOH state level administration, the first project helped to con-
struct 11 MCH/FP administrative centers--one in each state. Of the 11, only
three are in operation as yet; the remaining eight are in various stages of
construction. The MOH is also strengthening its district health administra-
tion. At present, the NFPB has no district-level administration.
4.70      The number of health districts has increased from 44 in 1970 to 61
in 1977, and is expected to reach 70 by 1985. The average population cover-
age of each health district will then be about 180,000. Of the existing 61
district health offices, 28 are in temporary accommodations. The MOH intends
to construct 37 permanent office buildings--28 to replace existing temporary
accommodations and nine health offices for those yet to be established. Of
the 37 new health office buildings, seven are already under construction.
The project includes the construction and equipping of eight district health



- 28 -
offices, five of them in areas where there are no accommodations and three
to replace inadequate temporary accommodations. Each of these offices will
be provided with a vehicle to strengthen field supervision within the health
district.
4.71      Both the External Review Team (1977) and the management study made
under the first project (1974) recommended the strengthening of the NFPB's
cost-accounting and budgetary control system to facilitate cost-benefit and
cost-effectiveness analyses. Such analyses will entail the collection of
appropriate financial information from other implementing agencies and from
different sections within the NFPB. The project includes administrative and
accounting equipment to facilitate these undertakings and a fellowship in
administration and management.
4.72      The cumulative effects of:  (a) the decentralization of program
operation; (b) the adoption of the operational manual; and (c) the centrali-
zation of financial data processing for cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness
analyses will improve program monitoring.
Contraceptive Storage and Distribution
4.73      The NFPB is responsible for supplying contraceptives (mainly pills)
to its own and MOH clinics throughout the country. At present, a warehouse,
for which the NFPB pays a rent of M$3,000 (US$1,250) a year, serves as a
central storehouse for supplies worth about M$1.5 million (US$0.6 million).
The size of the warehouse is inadequate, and there is danger of its contents
deteriorating. Most of the stock on hand is kept in the central warehouse,
which is consequently overburdened with orders. This situation results in
delays in the dispatch of supplies, which are sent by mail or commercial
carrier and are not always delivered promptly. The NFPB, therefore, proposes
to expand central storage capacity and decentralize distribution by establish-
ing storehouses capable of stocking supplies for six months in each state.
Also, the present system of supplying contraceptives directly to MOH clinics
causes delays. Instead, the NFPB should supply the contraceptives to MOH
state offices so that their delivery to the individual clinics could be
combined with MOH's well-established drug distribution system.
4.74      The project provides for the construction and equipping of a central
warehouse with a space of 17,300 sq. ft. to replace the existing inadequate
facilities and provide additional space for central storage of family planning
supplies to be procured by the NFPB for all agencies. Based upon the assump-
tion that a six-month supply will be transferred to the proposed state ware-
houses, the warehouse space provided in the project should be able to meet
NFPB's growing requirements. The project also provides six delivery vans, two
for the central store, and four to serve the 11 state stores and NFPB urban
clinics.
Innovative Activities
4.75      An amount of US$600,000 equivalent is earmarked for funding innova-
tive proposals that may be made during the course of project implementation.
These innovative proposals refer to testing of new strategies for program



- 29 -
improvements during the course of project implementation. This provision is
intended to add flexibility to the project and encourage local authorities to
seek innovations to meet emerging program needs on a continuing basis.
4.76      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the GOM that the
NFPB will form a committee not later than January 31, 1979, to work out the
details of various innovative schemes. The committee will consist of the
Directors of Services, REMIS and the National Family Planning Specialist
Center of NFPB; representatives of the Ministries of Health, Labor and Agri-
culture; National Union of Plantation Workers, Malaysian Medical Association,
Federal Land Development Authority and the FFPA.
4.77      During negotiations, confirmation was obtained that the GOM will
seek the Bank's comments on details of the proposals for innovative activities
prior to using funds earmarked for this purpose.
4.78      For details on project inputs by functional category, see the
Project Activity Matrix, Annex 4, T-22.
V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
A. Costs and Financing
5.01      The total estimated cost of the project is US$37.7 million equiva-
lent. Of this amount, the proposed loan of US$17.0 million equivalent will
finance the foreign exchange component, estimated at about 45% of the total
cost. The remaining US$20.7 million in local costs will be financed by the
GOM. The total base cost of the project is almost evenly apportioned between
civil (50.5%) and non-civil works (49.5%) components of the project. The
project costs by expenditure categories are given in Annex 4, T-23, and are
summarized in the following table:

account for 23.3% of the total base cost and the remaining one third of the
cost is accounted for by training (16.2%), administration (7.7%), research and
evaluation (5.5%) and project implementation (2.1%).

5.03         Cost  estimates  are based on salaries  and prices prevailing in
October 1977 and have been adjusted for price increases in 1978. For civil
works, costs are calculated from schedules of accommodation, or type plans
where available, and on the basis of unit prices obtained from the Public
Works Department. Schedules of accommodation provided by the GOM have been
examined to ensure that economic building standards are adopted.
5.04         Estimates  for furniture  are based on preliminary  furniture lists
at prices prevailing in October 1977. Estimates for equipment have also been
based on preliminary equipment lists, and unit prices were obtained from the
latest suppliers' lists.



- 32 -
5.05      The cost of fellowships for officials was based on the amount
awarded by the GOM in the recent past--US$25,000 per year. The cost estimates
for advisory services vary from US$35,000 to US$60,000 per annum, according to
the length of assignment and the skills and expertise needed. 1/ Operating
costs include salaries, materials, the cost of production activities, studies
and innovative activities. Salaries were based on current scales; for other
items NFPB estimates were examined and accepted as reasonable. Local taxes
and import duties included in the project cost estimates amount to about US$1
million equivalent.
5.06      The foreign exchange component of civil works and furniture is
calculated at 25% of the total cost. Vehicle and equipment costs are treated
as 100% foreign, and the operating cost as 100% local, except for materials
which are 37% local and for innovative activities which are 50% local.
5.07      The contingency allowance of US$6.5 million includes:  (a) physical
contingencies for unforeseen factors estimated at 10% of base civil works
costs; and (b) price contingencies averaging 15% of base costs and physical
contingencies. Contingencies were calculated on the basis of estimated expen-
ditures, and expected annual price increases as follows:
Annual Percentage Price Increases

B. Procurement
5.08      Buildings are required at 201 locations in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah
and Sarawak. Most buildings will cost between US$10,000 and US$500,000, with
a total construction cost of US$13.1 million.
1/   The cost of consultancy services of three months or less duration is
estimated as follows: round trip ticket--$1,800; per diem--$50; and fee
per day--up to a maximum of $140. Cost of consultancy for more than
three months includes: round trip ticket--$1,800; annual family
allowance--$600; annual salary--$19,000-33,000 and 1,800 lbs. of freight.



- 33 -
5.09      Malaysia has a well-developed and competent construction industry,
and foreign contractors not already established in Malaysia are unlikely to
be attracted because  f tbe relatively small contracts and the scattered site
locations (see maps: IBRD 13445 and 13446). Contracts for civil works will
be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with pro-
curement procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign contractors
would not be excluded from bidding.
5.10      Government regulations require civil works contractors to be pre-
qualified. Contract packages for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent
of US$200,000 or more, equipment and furniture estimated to cost the equivalent
of US$100,000 or more, and vehicles and materials estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$50,000 or more would only be awarded after Bank review.
5.11      Contracts for furniture, equipment and vehicles will be grouped in
appropriate bid packages. Except as specified below, these will be awarded
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
In the evaluation of bids, domestic manufacturers will be accorded a prefer-
ence margin of 15% of the price of competing imports or, if lower, the appli-
cable customs duties. Contracts for equipment and furniture which cannot
be reasonably grouped in packages equivalent to at least US$100,000 and
contracts for vehicles which cannot be reasonably grouped in packages equiv-
alent to at least US$50,000 will be awarded after local competitive bidding,
in accordance with Government procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank,
unless Public Works Department's term contracts exist for the procurement of
furniture or central Treasury contracts exist for the procurement of equipment
and vehicles. Both the Public Works Department and the central Treasury
contracts are let in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures and
awarded for one year's term. It is estimated that about US$3.6 million worth
of equipment and about US$3.7 million worth of vehicles will be procured
through ICB. The remaining US$0.7 million worth of equipment and US$0.4
million worth of vehicles will be procured through local competitive bidding
or through Treasury contracts where they exist. The total value of furniture
to be procured through the Public Works Department's term contracts is esti-
mated to be US$900,000.
5.12      The project includes US$920,000 for the purchase of materials such
as materials for the production of films, film strips, transparencies and
printed materials. These items are specialized and diverse and cannot be
packaged in lots suitable for international competitive bidding. Contracts
for these will be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, although
foreign suppliers will not be excluded. Local tendering procedures are
satisfactory to the Bank.
5.13      Notwithstanding the above, however, in order to provide flexibility
in the procurement of smaller items, contracts for equipment, furniture,
vehicles and materials (where the individual contracts are estimated to cost
not more than the equivalent of US$20,000 each) may be procured on a basis of
reasonably competitive procedures without resort to local competitive bidding
as long as their aggregate will not cost more than the equivalent of US$200,000.
It is estimated that about US$45,000 worth of these items will be procured in
this manner.



- 34 -
5.14      Consultant services will be procured in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Fellowships will be awarded after consultation with the Bank with
respect to duration, purpose, place of study and the qualifications of the
candidates.
C. Disbursement
5.15      The proposed loan would be disbursed for:  (a) 100% of the foreign
exchange costs of directly imported equipment, vehicles and materials
(clinical, laboratory and audiovisual), 100% of the ex-factory cost of these
items when locally manufactured and when awards are won under international
competitive bidding and 70% of the cost of other such items when locally-
procured; (b) 100% of the total cost of consultants' services, technical
assistance, studies and fellowships; (c) 30% of the cost of civil works and
furniture; and (d) 50% of the cost of innovative activities (the purpose and
amount of the withdrawal requests should conform to the proposals on which
the GOM obtained Bank's approval prior to the use of funds). Disbursements
by the Bank are expected to be completed by June 30, 1983. The estimated
quarterly disbursement schedule is given in Annex 4, T-24.
D. Implementation
5.16      To avoid repetition of administrative and managerial difficulties
encountered with the first project (paras. 3.04-3.05), a number of steps
will be taken to ensure effective administration of the second project. The
Project Secretariat within the NFPB will be strengthened and upgraded to a
full Unit through the appointment of an Assistant Director, an Administrative
Officer and a clerk. The project includes salaries for these staff for four
years. The Assistant Director of the Unit will also be accountable to the
Director General, NFPB, who will be the Project Administrator. The Unit will
be responsible for the overall coordination of the project activities. Inter-
agency policy coordination for the project will be carried out by the Project
Implementation Committee (now renamed as the Project Steering Committee)
formed under the first project and chaired by the Economic Planning Unit.
Administrative support to this Committee will be provided by the Project
Secretariat.
5.17      During negotiations assurances were obtained that by November 30,
1978, each of the participating agencies in the project (the NFPB, MOH,
Ministry of Agriculture and the Public Works Department) will designate a
project manager to coordinate and expedite the project work within the agency,
including the acquisition of land and preparation of architects' briefs. The
project manager at the MOH will be full-time. The work of these agencies will
be coordinated and monitored by a Project Management Committee, a subcommittee
of the Project Steering Committee, which will meet monthly and be chaired by
the Assistant Director, Project Secretariat. The Project Steering Committee



- 35 -
will delegate authority to this sub-committee to assume responsibility for
routine matters. Annex 4, C-8 shows the organizational structure of the
project administration and implementation.
5.18      In order to ensure coordination and steady implementation of civil
works, a project construction coordination unit (PCCU) will be set up at the
Public Works Department headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. The project provides
for salaries and allowances for the PCCU staff. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the GOM will appoint within the PCCU an architect
and two technicians with supporting staff not later than December 31, 1978.
Pending these appointments, the assignment of one part-time architect and two
part-time technicians with supporting staff to form the PCCU is a condition of
loan effectiveness.
5.19      The PCCU will ensure that the responsible agencies take prompt steps
to acquire building sites and provide space requirements. The PCCU will also
maintain close contact with the Project Secretariat, to whom it will submit
monthly progress reports on all project buildings. It will also arrange with
the Public Works Department a program for the preparation of designs and con-
tract documents for all buildings in the project so that these can be completed
in accordance with the implementation schedule. Funds are provided to support
the design of project buildings, either through the use of local architectural
consultants for individual buildings or the employment of additional architects
by the Public Works Department. Further, support will also be given to both
central and state levels of the Public Works Department in the form of trans-
portation for increased civil works supervision.
5.20      In addition to the staff provided for the PCCU at the Central Public
Works Department, 10 technicians will be provided in the project to strengthen
the Public Works Departments in the states of Johore, Pahang, Perak, Kelantan
(combined with Trengganu) and the Federal Territory, which have large construc-
tion programs under the project. The allocation of funds by states is given
in Annex 4, T-25. Project activities in each state will be coordinated by the
State Development Officer; he will particularly assist in the acquisition of
land.
5.21      Each ministry will be responsible for procurement of furniture,
equipment, vehicles and materials, as well as for the appointment of person-
nel and initiating the award of fellowships. The NFPB as Project Coordinator
will: (a) ensure that the Bank procurement guidelines and agreements are
followed; (b) monitor the project implementation schedule of each agency; (c)
ensure that changes in the project contents are not made without the Bank's
approval; (d) consult the Bank on terms of reference for advisers, training
programs for fellowships and qualifications of candidates; (e) submit consoli-
dated quarterly progress reports to the Bank; and (f) consolidate the project
accounts and have them audited.
5.22      During the first project, lack of clarity of financial procedures
for processing withdrawal applications to the Bank contributed to long lags



- 36 -
between allocation of funds by the Central Public Works Department to the
State Public Works Departments and disbursements. Under the proposed second
project, these lags will be reduced through: (a) the submission of vouchers
by the Public Works Department and all other implementing agencies directly
to the Project Administrator at the NFPB, who will be authorized to sign the
withdrawal applications on GOM's behalf, and thus curtail the present five-
step voucher countersigning procedures; and (b) routine collection of vouchers
and monitoring of civil works by the proposed project management committee.
5.23      As under the first project, payment vouchers, instead of cancelled
checks, will be accepted by the Bank as evidence of payment in case of civil
works and furniture procured by individual states. Suppliers' receipts will
be furnished for vehicles, furniture, equipment and material procured cen-
trally.
5.24      During negotiations, the GOM has agreed that the acquisition of
all sites that will be needed during the first year of the project will be a
condition of loan effectiveness. Assurances have been obtained during nego-
tiations that the GOM will acquire all sites that will be needed during the
second year of the project life by December 31, 1979 and the balance of the
sites needed for the project by December 31, 1980.
5.25      The implementation schedule for civil works is given in Annex 1.
At negotiations, the GOM agreed to ensure that the key actions with respect
to the project are completed according to the timetable agreed on during
negotiations and described in Annex 2 of this report.
E. Project Risks
5.26      In view of the experience with the first project, it would be
unrealistic to assume that no difficulties are likely to arise with respect
to the second. Some of these could arise if: (a) the Government does not
take measures recommended in this report to prevent the recurrence of delays
of the kind experienced in the first project; (b) the Government encounters
increasing political sensitivity to family planning; (c) the administrative
and managerial momentum generated by the present leadership of the NFPB and
the Project Secretariat is not sustained; or (d) the personnel and organiza-
tional commitments of other agencies, such as the MOH and Ministry of Agri-
culture, are weakened. However, the increased interest of the Government's
Economic Planning Unit, demonstrated during the proposed project appraisal
work, and NFPB's recent intensification of managerial control over the first
project, provide reasons to be optimistic about the success of the proposed
project.
F. Project Evaluation
5.27      The project provides for a built-in evaluation system.  Immediate
progress of the project will be measured against the implementation schedule
for each component agreed on by the GOM during negotiations. Intermediate
progress of the project will be evaluated on the basis of quantitative
indicators specified by the NFPB in consultation with other participating



- 37 -
agencies. A listing of these indicators is given in Annex 3 which will be
further refined by the NFPB. Assurances have been obtained during negotia-
tions that a plan of action for project evaluation will be prepared by the
NFPB by March 31, 1979. This plan of action will: (a) define measurable
objectives of each project component; (b) identify corresponding quantitative
indicators; (c) ascertain the availability of baseline values of these indi-
cators from existing data; and (d) determine the future data needs for measuring
the progress so that these data are collected through service statistics or
future surveys. The project includes 1.9 man-years of technical assistance
for project evaluation activities.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The primary justification of the project lies in its contribution
to the planned reduction of the birth rate from 30.3 per 1,000 in 1975 to 26
in 1985 by helping the national family planning program recruit about 800,000
new acceptors over this period. It is difficult to separate the probable
contribution of the project from the program s contribution to the achieve-
ment of the demographic objective; although NFPB's share of the project
budget will constitute about 50% of the NFPB's estimated total budgetary
requirements during the next four years. However, possible program improve-
ments resulting from project inputs are described below.
6.02      The establishment of a national and four regional family planning
specialist centers will improve the quality of services, provide a wider range
of contraceptive methods, with increasing emphasis on more effective and
permanent techniques, and offer specialized treatment for complicated cases.
Such improvements will inspire greater confidence and thus ensure greater
retention of contraceptive use and attract a larger clientele. These centers
will increase the potential for sterilizations from 4,000 to 14,000 a year and
the number of women undergoing cancer detection tests from 16,000 to 90,000.
About 10% of Government physicians, a large number of private physicians and
40% of the nurses in government service will be trained in the latest tech-
niques of sterilization. The treatment of contra-indications associated with
contraceptive use is expected to improve through relevant bio-medical research
to be conducted at the center. By providing genetic and infertility counsel-
ing, both the substantive work and the image of the family planning program
will be improved.
6.03      The establishment of additional service points in the fast growing,
low-income housing areas in urban centers is expected to increase acceptance
among the urban eligible couples from 40% in 1975 to about 60% by 1985.
6.04      The extension of integrated MCH/nutrition/FP services in the rural
areas will reduce infant, toddler and maternal mortalities, which in themselves
are desirable goals. Further, these reductions will strengthen the motives to
plan family size and to take advantage of the easier access to contraceptives.
The provision of transportation will widen access of services to the people
through mobile teams and improve the quality of services through increased



- 38 -
supervision. The provision of 500 motor scooters for community nurses is
expected to nearly double their mobility and facilitate access to hitherto
neglected areas. The provision of equipment for immunization and nutrition
services, besides strengthening MCH activities, will also help to attract
young mothers to the clinics.
6.05      The quality of health and family planning services will improve
through continuous in-service training of health staff through six training
schools and accommodations for field trainees. Over 1,000 health staff, or
about 20% of the total, will receive in-service training annually.
6.06      It is uncertain if the facilities provided in the rural areas will
be adequate to increase contraceptive use among the eligible women from 25%
in 1975 to 40% by 1985. The present level of health services leaves about
half of the rural population to be served only by mobile clinics. Permanent
health facilities for these areas will await completion of a survey of the
underserved areas being conducted by the MOH to determine the services re-
quired in these areas and strategies to be adopted for extension of services.
A more comprehensive coverage of underserved areas by health and family plan-
ning services should be an important part of a possible third project.
6.07      By integrating population, education and motivational efforts with
health education, and family and community development activities, the project
will reach the disadvantaged communities more effectively with family planning
information and services. Simultaneously, it will improve the health status
of the population and create employment for women. These efforts will create
conducive conditions for acceptance of a smaller family norm. As the project
will help in reaching progressively greater proportions of the population in
disadvantaged communities and regions, it will complement Malaysia's develop-
ment goal of equalizing economic opportunities. Finally, by reducing the
overall rate of population growth Malaysia will achieve a better balance
of population between those in the productive ages and their dependents, the
number of persons entering the labor force after a 15-year time lag will
decline, and a larger proportion of investment will be available for raising
the standard of living.

/1  Assuming 1966 age-specific fertility rate holds constant from 1970-1975.
/2  (Prevalence in year) x (acceptor's fertility rate at acceptance) = births
averted by program.
/3  Contraceptive prevalence rate has been estimated on the basis of continuation
rate obtained in 1969 acceptor survey. This rate is based on an initial
loss of 10% of users, followed by a monthly reduction of 2% of those remaining
at the beginning of each month. This gives a 12 month continuation rate
of 76.6%.
/4 Actual births figures need further checking as these appear to be under-reported.
