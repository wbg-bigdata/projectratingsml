A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
Within a still fragile post-conflict context, the project aims at helping the Government: implement its
reform program supported by the recently approved Fiscal Consolidation Credit (FCC), particularly the
privatization program; articulate its poverty reduction strategy (PRS); start rebuilding its statistical
infrastructure; strengthen the management of the promising mining sector; and further strengthen the
technical committee in charge of the reform program.
The reform program supported by the FCC includes: (i) improving budget management, notably through
the non-accumulation of additional salary arrears, the non-granting of new special tax exemptions to
mining and logging operations and the settlement of PETROCA's obligations to the Road Fund; and (ii)
expanding privatization and liberalization, notably through preparation of appropriate policy and
regulatory frameworks; creation of an autonomous regulatory body for the utilities sector; and bringing
ENERCA (the power company) to the point of lease, and SOCATEL (the telecommunications company) to
the point of sale.
The building blocks for the poverty reduction strategy include the updating of knowledge and preparation
of diagnostic studies on social sectors and productive sectors where growth is most likely to benefit the
poor. The sectors concerned are education, health (including the H[V/AIDS problem), cotton, livestock,
forestry, rural transportation and mining. Following extensive consultations with stakeholders, the
Government would use those studies to formulate its PRS.
The rebuilding of the statistical infrastructure, which suffered from the mutinies of 1995-96 and
subsequently from inadequate resources, is expected to improve the quality and timeliness of statistics and
to enhance the quality of policy making in all areas.
The formulation of a sector strategy for the mining sector, the revision of the mining code and the
strengthening of the Ministry in charge of mining are expected to improve the development prospects of the
sector, through a business environment more conducive to investment, notably foreign investment, within a
more transparent framework.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Privatization program supported by FCC completed. Notably, ENERCA and SOCATEL are brought to
point of lease and sale, respectively; draft electricity code and revised telecommunications law, as well as
the draft law establishing the autonomous regulatory authority are submitted to Parliament.
PRS in place.
Better quality and more timely statistics are produced.
Better business environment and more transparent operations in the mining sector result in increased
Government revenue and attract more investment.

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: P-7348-CA (Annex C): A Transitional Support Strategy Note, dated November 24,
1999                Date of latest CAS discussion: 05/19/92
A Transitional Support Strategy Note (TSSN) was submitted to the Board as an annex to the President
Report on the Fiscal Consolidation Credit, dated November 24, 1999. The note recommends a two-phase
approach, with the first one centered on fiscal consolidation, improving governance and laying the
foundations for a poverty alleviation program. The first phase would last about 18 months ending in June
2001, and would include, in addition to the FCC (approved on 12/16/1999), this companion operation to
help the Government implement its reform program, notably the reform measures to be taken under the
FCC.
The TSSN envisages the PSP as a simple technical assistance operation. Given the dilapidated and
demoralized state of the public administration and the continuing need to demonstrate lasting commitment
to the reform program, a more complex institution-building project would most likely be beyond the
Authorities' implementation capacity. It would also require more time, while reform needs to be urgently
implemented.
The TSSN also outlines the agenda for the PSP, which notably includes: (i) improving efficiency and
transparency by disengaging the State from commercial activities; (ii) developing a policy and regulatory
framework favorable to private investment;
(iii) preparing a reform program for the cotton sector; and (iv) supporting the formulation of a poverty
reduction strategy and action plans in key poverty-related sectors;
Successful implementation of the FCC and the PSP would allow consideration of additional adjustment and
investment lending in the second phase.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector issues:
v inefficient public enterprises, notably in the utilities sector;
*   weak Govemment capacity to articulate, implement and monitor economic reforms;
* unskilled, unmotivated and poorly paid civil service;
*   insufficient political and popular support for the reform program;
* serious knowledge gaps on poverty, social sectors and the most promising productive activities;
* deficient statistical infrastructure;
* inability to tap mining potential efficiently and in a transparent manner, due to the absence of a sector
strategy, an outdated mining code and weak institutions.
Government strate:
* In a still fragile post-conflict situation, the Government short-term strategy focuses on fiscal
consolidation to sustain civil peace and provide basic public sector services. In this respect, improving
revenue mobilization to ensure timely payment of salaries (particularly to the military) and
privatization to help Government focus on its basic functions are essential. The Government relies
mainly on two externally- financed task forces, the Technical Committee for Structural Adjustment
(CTP-PAS) and the Privatization Commission to implement and monitor its reform program;
- 3 -



* The Government is aware of the need to build support for the reform program and has successfully
implemented some difficult measures recently (e.g., reduction in cotton producer prices; increase in
petroleum prices) following public information campaigns. The Government intends to strengthen
support for the reform program, notably through consultations with stakeholders on key aspects of the
reform program and on the Poverty Reduction Strategy;
* The Government is aware of the need to reverse the fall in incomes and the deterioration in social
indicators, and have started to correct the situation (for instance, budget allocations for health and
education have been increased), but a lot remains to be done in this area. More recently, the
Government has endorsed the PRS approach, created a technical committee to manage the PRS process
and prepared a draft interim PRS paper;
* The Government is aware that good policy requires good macroeconomic and sectoral data, as well as
social indicators, and intends to start rebuilding its statistical capacity, which has suffered from recent
mutinies and subsequent adverse developments. A statistical development plan has already been
mapped out with IMF assistance and a statistical law will be submitted to the Parliament shortly;
* The Government is keen on developing CAR mining resources in a more transparent manner, but so
far, has lacked the technical assistance and financial resources to formulate a sector strategy, revise the
mining code, improve the business environment, notably secure property rights, and strengthen sectoral
institutions.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
* The Government's weak capacity to prepare, implement and monitor key structural reforms. The
strategic choice is to provide temporary technical assistance to the two task forces on which the
Government relies to implement its reform program (the CTP-PAS and the Privatization Commission).
A successful implementation of the reform program would create an environment favorable for civil
service reform and institutional development;
*   The limited support for the reform program among politicians, civil servants and the population in
general. The project will attempt to address this difficult issue by launching well targeted IEC
campaigns;
*  The lack of up-to-date knowledge and strategy regarding the social sectors and likely sources of
growth. The project will address this issue through support to the technical committee in charge of
managing the PRS process and the preparation of: diagnostic studies on education and health, including
MV/AIDS, and the most promising sectors in terms of poverty reduction and growth, namely, cotton,
livestock, rural roads, forestry and mining. These diagnostic studies will be prepared by consultants,
using as much as possible work done by the Bank and other donors (e.g., UNDP for poverty, the E.U.
for roads and the AFD for the cotton sector), and are expected to be completed in early 2001. The
Government will review and internalize these studies and consult with stakeholders, prior to formulate
its Poverty Reduction Strategy by mid 2001;
*  The weak statistical capacity. The project will assist the Government in starting the implementation of
the statistical development plan, notably by prioritizing among the many elements of the plan;
determining skill needs and proposing training programs;
*  Weak capacity in the Ministry in charge of mining, outdated mining code and insecure mining rights.
The project will address these issues through the preparation of a sector strategy, the revision of the
mining code and the strengthening of the Ministry.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
CAR has embarked in 1998 on an adjustment and reform program underpinned by a PFP for the,
1998-2000 period. Main achievements under the program include enhanced macro-economic stability, more
transparent budget management and progress in privatization. However, much remains to be done to
consolidate macro-economic stability, improve govemance and put in place a policy environment conducive
to poverty reduction and good quality growth. The IMF is taking the lead in the pursuit of macro-economic
stability, notably the necessary increase in revenue, especially but not exclusively, from customs. The Bank
focuses on reversing the trend of worsening poverty and improving governance. The recently approved
FCC and this companion project aim at making significant progress towards these goals, notably through:
*  expanding privatization, notably through the preparation of regulatory frameworks and the
establishment of an autonomous regulatory body for the utilities sector; bringing ENERCA, the power
company, to the point of lease; and restructuring SOCATEL, the telecommunications company, and
bringing it to the point of sale;
*  improving govemance, through more rigorous public resource management, tighter application of
investment incentives, notably for mining and logging operations, and privatization;
-5 -



* helping the Government to formulate a Poverty Reduction Strategy, including action plans for the
productive sectors with the greatest potential for poverty reduction, namely, cotton, livestock, forestry,
rural roads and mining, through extensive consultations with stakeholders;
*   reforming the cotton sector, which provides livelihood to nearly 200,000 rural families;
*   preparing for a new start of the mining sector, notably through the revision of the Mining code and the
strengthening of the Ministry in charge of the sector;
* building support for the reform program through IEC campaigns targeting the Government's partners
and stakeholders;
*   starting to rebuild the statistical capacity of the country; and
*   strengthening the CTP-PAS and the Privatization Commission to improve the management of the
reform program.
3. Benefits and target population:
The PSP will ensure the timely implementation of the recently approved FCC. Therefore, benefits expected
from the PSP include benefits to be derived from the FCC, namely:
(i) enhanced prospects for civil peace in a still fragile post-conflict context (the international peace keeping
force left CAR in mid-February 2000) through the regular payment of salaries to civil servants and the
military;
(ii) reduced budget burden and improved economic efficiency and transparency, through privatization of
parastatals, and putting in place an appropriate and transparent regulatory framework;
(iii) improved governance, not only through privatization, but also through a tighter management of
investment incentives, notably for logging and mining operations; and
(iv) better service of CAR's external debt, improved credibility and larger external assistance.
Without the PSP, the vital FCC would be in jeopardy, and so would be the IMF-supported program. Civil
peace would be seriously threatened, external assistance would not be forthcoming and the limited support
for the reformist government would further decrease.
In addition to the above benefits to be derived from a speedy implementation of the FCC, benefits from the
PSP include those expected from the preparation of a timely, good quality and participatory plan of actions
to reduce poverty, reverse the deterioration in social indicators and revive growth in the most promising
sectors.
Benefits expected from the statistical component are good quality and timely data, particularly social
indicators, although the improvement is more likely to take place after the end of the project.
Benefits expected from the mining component include: stronger sectoral institutions, which are better able
to carry out their functions; better mining code, leading to a more transparent management of incentives
and more secure mining rights. It is expected that in time, these would result in increased revenue from
mining and increased investment.
Some of these benefits (e.g., resumption of growth, better statistics) are for the population as a whole, but
the formulation a Poverty Reduction Strategy, through a participatory process involving the poor, target the
latter more specifically. Even the sectoral strategies to be articulated under the PSP are for sectors where
growth would particularly benefit low income families (e.g., cotton, livestock, forestry and small scale
mining).

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Estimated period of implementation is 42 months after effectiveness.
Overall supervision is by the Inter-ministerial Committee chaired by the Minister Delegate of Finance and
Budget, which has been overseeing the reform program for the past few years.
Overall technical coordination is by the CTP-PAS, which has been created by the Government in 1998 to
advise on the reform program and monitor its implementation. The CTP-PAS has efficiently carried out its
functions. The privatization and regulation component will be implemented by the Privatization
Commission. The latter is in great need of strengthening as it is just beginning to hire technical staff under
the PPF, and will receive support from the CTP-PAS, at least at the beginning.
The recently created technical committee for the PRS will implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy
component and will be supported by the PSP.
The Statistical Division of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and International Cooperation will
implement the Statistical Strengthening component.
The Ministry in charge of the mining sector, in particular the General Directorate of Mining and the
BECDOR (valuation office) will implement the mining component of the PSP.
Financial Management and Accounting:
The Bank has reviewed the project implementation agencies CTP-PAS and the Privatization Commission in
Bangui in February 2000 in order to assess the financial management systems and capacity of the two
agencies. The CTP-PAS which has had previous experience in handling IDA operations through
adjustment operations has a staff of nine people, including an experienced accountant who had been the
accountant of another IDA funded project, the Transport Sector Project. The CTP-PAS has been managing
the PPF of US$350,000 using manual accounting procedures which are not formalized. The Privatization
Commission has no staff except its President and does not have any accounting system in place. The IDA
team concluded that in view of insufficient local accounting capacity and the relative small size of the
credit, the project accounts should be kept by the CTP-PAS. The Privatization Commission would retain
the responsibility for making commitments but would transfer invoices for payment and recording to the
CTP-PAS. The CTP-PAS would be responsible for the management of the Special Account and the Project
Account, the preparation of consolidated project accounts, the preparation of withdrawal applications, and
eventually the preparation of quarterly PMR. A consultant will be recruited to: (i) help CTP-PAS design an
accounting and financial management system acceptable to IDA; (ii) prepare an accounting manual; (iii)
assist CTP-PAS purchase a project software and in its customization; and finally (iv) train CTP-PAS staff
in the use of the accounting software. During the first year of the project and as soon as the project
accounting system is functioning, the project will prepare an action plan over an 18 months period to
produce PMR quarterly under LACI. Terms of reference for the recruitment of the above mentioned
consultant and the short list of firms acceptable to IDA have been agreed with the borrower.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The proposed operation aims to keep the reform program supported by IDA and the IMF on track and to
help the Government prepare its Poverty Reduction Strategy. It consists of providing technical assistance to
two task forces in charge of the reform program (the CTP-PAS and the Privatization Commission), to
make up for serious weaknesses in the civil service. For the two main components, i.e., the privatization
and the PRSP components, there are in principle two alternatives that could be considered. The first would
be to do nothing, i.e., let the Authorities implement their reform program without technical assistance.
Given the present weakness of the civil service, progress in implementing the FCC and the IMF-supported
program would stall, ensuring the failure of this alternative. The second would be to provide technical
assistance to the civil service to enable it to implement the reform program. However, at present, CAR's
civil servants often lack the required skills, motivation and support for the reform program, and receive
uncompetitive salaries with considerable delays. Therefore, the second alternative would require a lengthy
process of capacity building, while speed of reform implementation is essential. Furthermore, it would be
risky to implement reform through civil servants who do not support it.
The second alternative has actually been used in the Economic Management Project (Cr. 1971-CA),
approved in December 1988, for an amount of SDR 10.3 million. The project was designed to support
implementation of the adjustment program, through the strengthening of the core ministries. It was closed in
March 1997. Despite the relatively long implementation period, the project has had only limited success in
both capacity building and reform implementation.
Thus, it appears that the proposed approach is more realistic than the two alternatives. It must be noted,
however, that the project will help launch and build two new institutions: the autonomous multi-sector
regulatory body (Annex 2), including training of selected staff in litigation solving; and the Petroleum
Sector Management Information System (Annex 2). Moreover, the project will also strengthen the Ministry
in charge of mining and the Statistical Division in the Ministry of Economy. In any case, it is clear that
since the sustainability of reform requires an efficient, motivated and well paid civil service, institutional
rebuilding would be a priority objective of the CAS to be prepared in FY0 1.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Key lessons leamed from previous operations in CAR (investment and adjustment), notably the Economic
Management Project, the most recent IDA Technical Assistance project in CAR (ICR dated June 26, 1997,
Report No. 16799) include:
*   projects should have clear and limited objectives and their design must be kept simple to fit the
borrower limited implementation capacity;
*   given the weakness of the civil service, which is aggravated by serious budget constraints resulting in
salary arrears of about 12 months, and the likelihood of political interference, interim substitution
technical assistance (domestic and foreign) is appropriate to complete urgent and priority tasks and
programs;
*   project objectives must be consistent with instruments; in particular, long-term institution building
objectives are not consistent with a short-term lending operation;
*   lack of ownership impacts negatively on projects.
The design of the present operation takes into account these lessons:
*   its objectives are relatively simple as they consist mainly of ensuring the timely implementation of the
FCC and of providing inputs to the Authorities' Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper;
*   the operation does not overestimate the capacity of the public administration to implement the project
and rather, provides interim, substitution technical assistance to task forces that operate outside the
civil service;
*   the Minister of Finance, who is also the Prime Minister, is committed to the success of this project,
which is key to the implementation of the reform program.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The borrower's commitment and ownership is indicated by the following:
*  A PFP for 1998-2000 was agreed in May 1998, under which good progress in structural reform was
achieved. The Authorities took difficult measures recently to correct the fiscal slippage of the last
quarter of 1999 and serious price distortions, for cotton and petroleum products, which allowed the
approval of the FCC;
*   The Authorities are fully aware that without implementation of the IDA- and Fund-supported reform
program, progress achieved in re-establishing order after the mutinies of 1995-96 could be negated;
o   There is already a PPF for this operation;
*   Govemment ownership of the PRSP process has been confirmed by the recent creation of the technical
committee for the management of the PRS process. The committee has already prepared a draft interim
PRSP which provides a detailed road map for the completion of the paper;
*  The Government has already prepared a draft statistical law that will be submitted to the Parliament
shortly;
*  The Government is also very keen on tapping the mining potential of the country.

5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
*   The following reasons justify Bank involvement in the project. The PSP aims at the timely
implementation of the recently approved FCC, which makes IDA uniquely qualified to carry out this
companion project. It is also important, after several years of neglect, to reverse the increase in poverty
and the deterioration in social indicators, and the first step is the preparation by the Government of a
Poverty Reduction Strategy, another key goal of the proposed operation. IDA is uniquely qualified to
carry out this component of the project. The Bank experience in mining development in many countries
and also its past involvement in the sector in CAR justify IDA's involvement in the mining component
of the PSP. IDA involvement in the statistics component is justified by the importance of having
accurate and timely statistics and by the existence of relevant expertise in the Bank. However,
cooperation with the IMF and AFRISTAT will be sought;
*   On a more general level, Bank involvement is also justified by the relative dearth of donor assistance.
In particular, LJNDP financial assistance to the CTP-PAS has been discontinued recently; and CAR is
in non-accrual status with the African Development Bank, which thus, cannot provide financial
support;
*   The Bank will make the best use of studies prepared by or with the help of other donors, e.g., previous
work on poverty sponsored by UNDP, the EU-financed transport sector strategy and the French
AFD-financed cotton sector strategy. The IMF will be relied upon to improve macroeconomic stability,
notably the performance of revenue collecting agencies.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Other (specify)
A technical assistance operation like this one does not lend itself to a meaningful quantitative analysis of
the economic and financial return. It can be safely assumed, however, that successful implementation of
this project would allow CAR to obtain the full benefits of the recently approved FCC, notably the ability
to pay civil servants and the military, thus enhancing the chances of sustained civil peace, and the benefits
to be derived from the privatization of State-owned utility companies (less budgetary subsidies, more
efficiency and transparency). By contrast, without the project, the implementation of the reform program
supported by the FCC and the IMF would be in jeopardy, rising the likelihood of renewed civil strife and
worsening poverty. Successful implementation of the PRSP component would also help the Government
prepare its strategy to reduce poverty in an efficient and timely manner. There are presently large
knowledge gaps on many sectors which would be filled by the TA to be provided under the project. By
contrast, without the project, it would be difficult for the Government to prepare a good quality Poverty
Reduction Strategy on time, which could delay future IDA and IMF lending.
Successful implementation of the statistical component would result in more accurate and timely statistics
and social indicators, which would improve the capacity of the Government to plan and conduct policy in
relevant areas.
Successful implementation of the mining component would improve the legal and business environment of
the sector and strengthen its institutions, increasing the likelihood of more growth, employment and
revenue.

2. Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
N/A
Fiscal Impact:
The direct impact of the PSP on the budget is expected to be limited: Government contribution to project
financing, including in kind, would be US$0.5 million over three years (6% of the project cost and about
0.7% of annual tax revenue).
3. Technical:
N/A
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The Technical Committee for Structural Adjustment Program (CTP-PAS) a task force created by the
Government to accelerate the implementation of its reform program, and which operates in parallel to the
civil service, will be in charge of overall technical coordination of project implementation. The CTP-PAS
has a good track record of implementation and monitoring of the reform program, and its performance is
expected to improve, as a result of support to be provided under the project (five key staff, including the
Head of the committee will be financed under the project over a three year period).
The Privatization Commission will be in charge of the privatization component. It is seriously understaffed
at present, but it will be strengthened by the hiring under the project of a financial analyst and a lawyer, for
a three year period.
The recently created PRS Committee will be in charge of the PRSP component and will be supported by
the PSP.
The Statistical Division of the Ministry of Economy will be in charge of the statistical component. It is
rather weak at present but will be strengthened under the project through provision of training and
equipment.
The mining component will be executed by the General Directorate of Mining and the valuation office
(BECDOR). Both will be strengthened through the provision of training and equipment (testing equipment
and computer).
4.2 Project management:
Please see 4.1 above.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Procurement capacity in CAR has weakened substantially following civil strife in the mid-nineties.
Substantial capacity rebuilding will be needed to recreate procurement proficiency at the central and
sectoral levels. In 1998, a procurement committee ("Commission des marches") has been created under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and several members of its staff are reportedly familiar with Bank
and EU procurement procedures and received procurement training. The president and the accountant of
the CTP-PAS have had previous procurement training and experience with the execution of IDA financed
- 11 -



projects, but they have not been exposed to recent developments in Bank financed procurement and would
in any event not be able to handle the many detailed procurement procedures under the PSP. A procurement
specialist will, therefore, be recruited to assist with the preparation of Requests for Proposals, proposal
evaluation and contract management. The recruitment of the procurement specialist is expected to
accelerate the selection and contracting process and to reduce the procurement risk to an acceptable level.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The Bank has reviewed the project implementation agencies CTP-PAS and the Privatization Commission in
Bangui in February 2000 in order to assess the financial management systems and capacity of the two
agencies. The CTP-PAS which has had previous experience in handling IDA operations has a staff of nine
people, including an experienced accountant who had been the accountant of another IDA funded project,
the Transport Sector Project. The CTP-PAS has been managing the PPF of US$350,000 using manual
accounting procedures which are not formalized. The Privatization Commission has no staff except its
President and does not have any accounting system in place. The IDA team concluded that in view of
insufficient local accounting capacity and the relative small size and low complexity of the project
operations, the project accounts should be kept by the CTP-PAS. The Privatization Commission would
retain the responsibility for making commitments but would transfer invoices for payment and recording to
the CTP-PAS. The CTP-PAS would be responsible for the management of the Special Accounts and the
Project Account, the preparation of consolidated project accounts, the preparation of withdrawal
applications, and eventually the preparation of quarterly PMR. A consultant will be recruited to: (i) help
CTP-PAS design an accounting and financial management system, including a procedures manual,
acceptable to IDA; (ii) prepare an accounting manual; (iii) assist CTP-PAS purchase a project software
and in its customization; and finally (iv) train CTP-PAS staff in the use of the accounting software. During
the first year of the project and as soon as the project accounting system is functioning, the project will
prepare an action plan over an 18 months period to produce PMR quarterly under LACI. Terms of
reference for the recruitment of the above mentioned consultant and the short list of firms acceptable to
IDA have been agreed with the borrower.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The lease of ENERCA (the power company) to a private operator may result in the firing of excess labor.
Therefore, a Social Plan sub-component is included in the project to help smooth out separation of excess
labor.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Each sector strategy of the PRSP (health, education, cotton, livestock, forestry, rural roads and mining),
will be finalized after consultations with stakeholders, e.g., cotton farmers, employees of SOCOCA,
herders, students' parents, forest communities, miners representatives). An IEC Campaigns sub-component
is included in the project to that effect.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustained civil peace in a still fragile post-conflict situation and support for the reform program are critical
for the sustainability of project benefits, during and after project implementation. Adequate implementation
capacity in the executing agencies, notably the CTP-PAS is also critical. Realistically, the sustainability of
the benefits of the present operation is low.

TA TO IMPLEMENT PRIVATIZATION AND REGULATION PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY
FCC
This first component consists of TA to ensure the timely completion of the privatization program supported
by the recently approved FCC. It includes:
- 19 -



1.1    Support to the Privatization Commission US$150,000
The Privatization Commission has been created to advise the Government on privatization issues and
implement the privatization program. In practice, however, the Commission has been seriously hampered
by lack of staff and finance, as it has been operating with just its Head and an assistant. The Project will
allow the financing of a financial analyst and a lawyer over three years (Cost estimate: US$80,000).
Moreover, the Project will finance the cost of equipment, including computers and a vehicle, as well as
operating costs, including training, during three years.
1.2    Regulatory Framework US$500,000
The revision of the legal and regulatory framework must be part of the Government's privatization strategy.
However, progress in this area has been limited, due to weak capacity in the civil service and lack of
technical assistance. With the exception of the electricity code (prepared with IDA assistance), and the
forestry code (updated with French assistance), CAR has been unable to advance the updating of the legal
framework in important sectors. In particular, the Telecommunications law of 1996 needs to be revised.
The management of the water company has been privatized since 1991 and a new lease-farming contract
has been negotiated. The French cooperation will assist the ministry in charge of water supply in managing
the new contract. The Government has agreed that the preparation of regulations for the electricity and
telecommunications sectors, as well as the establishment of an autonomous regulatory body are conditions
for the release of the floating tranche of the FCC.
A regulatory agency for telecommunications has been created by the 1996 Telecommunication law, but so
far it exists only on paper. The objective is to replace it by a multi-sector, autonomous regulatory body.
Given the limited number of customers in the electricity and telecommunication sectors, a multisectoral
approach presents numerous advantages: (i) it will reduce the financing requirements on each and every
sector through the generation of economies of scale, especially since the substance of some of the
regulatory issues is similar in all sectors; (ii) it will increase the independence of the body, that might
otherwise be threatened by line Ministries; and (iii) it will develop arbitration mechanisms that will reduce
the cost and delays of conflict solving.
Specifically the sub-component will provide technical assistance in the following areas:
(i) drafting the law and decrees required to establish the autonomous regulatory body as well as
preparing an organizational study, notably on staff and financing requirements; the cost is
estimated at US$2 1 0,000.
(ii) training selected staff in litigation solving; the cost is estimated at US$290,000
1.3    Leasing of ENERCA US$1,470,000
Electricity in CAR is expensive, despite the availability of cheap hydroelectric power, and access is limited
to only about 10,000 residential consumers, mostly in Bangui, the capital. ENERCA, the State-owned
electricity company, is de facto financially bankrupt and cannot expand the provision of electricity. to
reduce costs and expand provision of electricity, particularly to the poor, the Government has decided to
privatize at least the management of ENERCA, keeping for itself the definition of objectives and strategies
as well as the regulation of the sector. The proposed project will, provide TA to help CAR: seek expression
of interest from international private operators/investors, select the most favorable offer and negotiate with
this operator/investor; complete the electricity sector new regulatory framework; and carry out other tasks
- 20 -



essential to successful privatization (e.g., environmental audit, social plan, and information and
communication campaigns directed at stakeholders). Below is a more detailed description of the
sub-component.
1.3.1. Selection of a private operator/investor. Financial, Economic and Engineering Advisors
(US$470,000). These advisors will assist the Government in: (a) defining the best institutional and
contractual options to ensure a sound and effective development of CAR's electricity sector. In view of the
perceived risks and of the technical and financial situation of ENERCA, the Government is leaning towards
a leasing arrangement, which will however be reassessed by the advisors; (b) attracting interest from
private operators/investors; (c) preparing bid documentation ensuring a transparent process for the
selection of the operator/investor and reflecting private sector interest; (d) evaluating the bids; (e)
negotiating with the selected operator/investor; and (f) assisting the parties in the transition, particularly
during negotiations, and in meeting contract effectiveness conditions.
Legal Auditors (US$85,000). An in-depth assessment of the legal context in which the proposed transaction
will be implemented and of the proposed new contractual arrangements will be carried out.
1.3.2. Interim Management (US$200,000). The project will also finance the cost of interim management
for about a year, prior to the leasing of ENERCA to safeguard the integrity of its financial and physical
assets. If possible, and in order to reduce costs, the interim manager will be shared with SOCATEL (see
1.5. (i), below), which faces the same problem.
1.3.3. New Regulatory Framework. Electricity Code and Implementing Decrees (US$65,000). The
Authorities have initiated the preparation of a new electricity code, that will reflect the Government new
long and short term objectives and the strategy in the electricity sector. To make this code fully
operational, a series of implementing decrees also need to be drafted and approved by the relevant technical
ministries. In particular, the decree for setting and adjusting electricity tariffs, as well as the decree -
delineating the policies and arrangements for the development of the electricity sector outside Bangui will
be critical. Consultants will assist the Government in preparing this documentation.
Main Regulatory Tools (US$57,000). The main tools needed initially by the new regulatory body to
monitor the performance of the selected private operator/investor and of the Government's undertakings
will need to be defined and put in place. Consultants will assist the Government in preparing this
documentation.
Technical and Tariff Studies (US$163,000). Two studies will be carried out: the first study will define the
equipment technical standards to be installed in the future in order to minimize costs; the second study will
propose revisions to the tariff schedule (including connection charges) with the objective of addressing the
concerns of low revenues customers.
1.3.4. ENERCA Financial Audit and Restructuring (US$180,000). Independent audit of ENERCA's
financial accounts is essential to carry out the much needed financial restructuring of the company. The
cost of the audit is estimated at US$95,000. It will be followed by financial restructuring, which would cost
US$85,000. An analysis of the debt situation of ENERCA, particularly with respect to suppliers, banks
and other creditors will be essential in developing a transparent financial restructuring strategy. Financial
experts will be hired to cany out this inventory and audit as well as defining and implementing the sector
financial restructuring.
- 21 -



1.3.5. Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan (US$140,000). An
environmental assessment of the impact of existing and future electricity generating, transporting and
distributing facilities need to be carried out to determine: (a) the environmental issues and risks related to
the operation of these facilities; and (b) the compliance with CAR's (or generally accepted) environmental
guidelines. An environmental management plan to correct issues related to the existing facilities and
prevent or mitigate possible environmental impacts related to the development of new facilities will be
designed. International as well as national experts in these fields will be hired for this activity.
1.3.6. Social Plan (US$50,000). It is possible that some of ENERCA' s employees may be willing to
leave or may not be needed by the new the operator/investor. The Government had initiated studies with
respect to the design of a Social Plan for ENERCA. Such work needs to be completed, particularly with
respect to implementation.
1.3.7. Information, Communication and Consultation Program (US$60,000). Such program aims at
informing and consulting the main parties impacted by the reform of the electricity sector, mainly
ENERCA's personnel and consumers. This will take the form of workshops, direct consultation with
stakeholders and communications through written media, radio and TV. An expert in the management of
such process will be hired to lead this activity.
1.4.   Follow up Activities to PETROCA'S Privatization US$245,000
At the beginning of year 2000, the import, storage and distribution of petroleum products were transferred
to 3 private oil companies and PETROCA, the State-owned company, was set to be liquidated. However,
to complete the privatization of PETROCA, some additional activities need to be carried out. These are:
(a) the Environmental assessment and the environmental management plan for the existing facilities; and
(b) the setting-up of the petroleum sector management information system.
Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan (US$160,000). An environmental
assessment of existing facilities and processes for import, storage and distribution of petroleum products
within CAR needs to be carried out to determine/design the: (a) environmental issues and risks related to
these facilities and processes; (b) compliance with CAR's environmental policies and guidelines (or
generally accepted ones); and (c) environmental management plan to correct issues related to existing
facilities and processes. International as well as national experts in these fields will be hired for this activity
and will work in close collaboration with the private oil companies.
Petroleum Sector Management Information System. (US$85,000). The authorities will need specific and
up-to-date information to monitor and negotiate with the private oil companies, notably regarding the
setting-up/revisions of petroleum prices. Such information, which will constitute the core of CAR's
Petroleum Sector Management Information System (MIS), relates to up-to-date data on demand and supply
by product in CAR, imports and exports, world market conditions (supply/demand, prices, financial terms,
etc.), oil business conditions in the Gulf of Guinea, technical and financial standards used in the petroleum
industry and practices in the sub-region. This MIS will be designed and implemented by an individual
consultant. This consultant will also cary out the associated capacity building.
- 22 -



1.5    Privatization of SOCATEL and Reform of Telecommunications Sector US$1,500,000
Telecommunications services are largely insufficient and of poor quality. The Government has been trying
to reform the telecommunications sector, with limited success. SOCATEL, the State-owned
telecommunications company, has been partially privatized, with a French company, FCR, owning part of
the capital. A law was adopted and published in August 1996 to liberalize the telecommunications sector,
granting a limited exclusivity on basic telephone services to SOCATEL and establishing a regulatory
agency (ART). Cellular services were opened to competition, and rights were granted to five new cellular
operators, out of which two are currently operational, with almost 6.000 subscribers at end of 1999.
However, the process by which rights have been granted was not transparent.
The issues in the sector are:
*  ART is not yet operational;
*   SOCATEL network only connects only 9.600 main lines, about 28 lines per 10,000 inhabitants, with
1858 potential customers on the waiting list. About 90% of the lines are concentrated in Bangui, and
only 5 cities have access to an automatic telephone service;
*   Network fluidity is abnormally low: the rate of success of local calls is less than 60% vs. a
recommended rate of 90%; for domestic long distance communications the rate falls at 28%. The
company could easily increase its revenues provided that basic maintenance programs are implemented,
and investments needed to cope with demand growth realized;
3   SOCATEL productivity (24 main lines per employee) is low compared to neighboring countries (about
40 main lines per employee);
v  The company's turnover has been decreasing during the past couple of years due to inefficiencies and a
more adverse economic environment, this despite high revenue per line ($1,140); SOCATEL is badly
managed, resulting in FCR's refusal to buy an additional 15% of equity offered by the Government. In
particular, very weak debt recovery is crippling the company, to which the Government owes about
FCFA 6 billion (private customers owe even more). It takes 630 days on average for customers to pay
for service. As a result, SOCATEL is virtually bankrupt.
The project will help address these issues through
(i) SOCATEL Privatization through a competitive and transparent bidding process. The cost of technical
assistance is estimated at US$700,000. The project will also finance the cost of interim management of
SOCATEL prior to its privatization, including the preparation of a social plan for employees who may be
found redundant, estimated at US$200,000. If possible, the same interim management would be shared
with ENERCA (see 1.3.2. above).
(ii) Revision of the regulatory framework (revision of the 1996 Telecommunication law and drafting of
associated decrees), preparation and granting of definitive licenses to authorized cellular operators, transfer
to the autonomous regulatory body the prerogatives of ART and suppression the latter. The cost is
estimated at US$400,000.
(iii) Review and reorganization of spectrum control and transfer of spectrum control to the regulatory
agency. The cost is estimated at US$80,000.
- 23 -



(iv) Preparation of Rural Communications Strategy: More than 70% of CAR's population live in rural
areas, without telephone service. The project will assist the Government in preparing a strategy to promote
access of rural populations to telecommunication services, including need assessment, technical and
institutional options and recommendations. Cost is estimated at US$120,000.
Project Component 2 - US$2.03 million
2.  TA TO HELP PREPARE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
The second component consists of TA to help the Government prepare its Poverty Reduction Strategy,
which will serve to underpin future IDA and IMF lending. The formulation of the strategy would require
the updating/acquisition of knowledge on poverty, social sectors and productive sectors where growth is
most likely to benefit the poor. Accordingly, the Poverty Note dated June 30, 1998 will be updated and
expanded, using on going work on poverty profile. Diagnostic studies will be prepared for the health and
education sectors as well as for promising productive sectors, namely, mining, cotton, livestock, forestry
and for rural transportation. These diagnostic studies will serve as inputs to be used by the Government to
prepare a draft PRS. The draft will be submitted to various stakeholders for discussion and consultation.
Following this participatory process, the PRS will be validated and finalized.
2.1    Support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Committee (Cost Estimate: US$180,000)
On April 3, 2000, the Government has created a special committee to implement the various activities
which should lead to the formulation of the poverty reduction strategy (PRSC). The project will finance
necessary equipment, including computers and a vehicle to help the Committee carry out its functions, as
well as other operating costs. Moreover, training will be provided to selected staff in the PRSC.
2.2    Updating/expanding of poverty note (Cost Estimate: US$60,000)
A poverty note has been prepared in 1998 (Report No. 1 8134-CA) based on incomplete results of an
integrated survey of household expenditures and social indicators completed in 1996 (due to the mutinies,
the processing of data could not be completed). The statistical profile of poverty is being completed in the
Bank, which should allow the updating/expanding of the 1998 poverty note.
2.3    Diagnostic study on public health (Cost Estimate: US$80,000)
The health status of Central Africans is among the poorest in the world. The main causes of mortality and
morbidity are malnutrition and infectious and parasitic diseases. The high prevalence of sexually
transmitted diseases, including AIDS, especially among young women, is a major health problem. Access
to health services is most limited. In 1995, the vaccination rate for DPT3 (diphtheria, pertussis and
tetanus) and poliomyelitis (oral vaccine) was only 40 percent for children under one year of age. In recent
years, the quality of services had deteriorated and the price of drugs risen. Consequently, people surveyed
in rural areas indicated that they often prefer to go to traditional healers because their services were
affordable and more readily available.
Before the mutinies, public spending on health was insufficient, inefficient and inequitable. It benefited
urban and relatively wealthy households. Most of the investment budget was for expensive curative care.
With regard to recurrent costs, the Government spent less than a dollar per person per year; in addition,
recurrent spending was concentrated in Bangui (90% of recurrent costs) where 30% of the population lives,
leaving 10% to the remaining 16 regional hospitals and health centers.
- 24 -



The diagnostic study of the sector will first produce a health map, based on available data; It will also
make an assessment of services presently available and their cost, review public expenditure in the sector,
and outline a strategy to increase the availability of services across the country in a cost effective way. It
will make recommendations on how to (i) increase the number of personnel; (ii) decentralize the
management of health resources; (iii) improve the supply of essential drugs; (iv) address the AIDS
epidemic; and (v) improve the management of public expenditure in the sector.
Considering that there are many studies which have been carried out, the first task of the consultants would
be to review the existing documents, update the diagnostic of the situation and prepare a two- or three-year,
realistic and affordable plan of actions, (not a long-term strategy, already available but seemingly
unrealistic) addressing the most pressing problems identified during the diagnostic phase. This plan should
be focused on the issues most affecting the poor.
The cost estimate for this sub-component is estimated at US$80,000 (4 consultant/months).
2.4    Diagnostic studies on education (Cost Estimate: US$180,000)
The education sector is in serious need of rehabilitation and upgrading, as shown by the following features:
*   Low enrollment rates : in 1995, the net enrollment rate nationwide was 49% at the primary level, and
37% for girls. In rural areas, one child out of three was attending school;
e  The demobilization of teaching personnel;
-   Inadequate budget allocation for education and inadequate allocation of funds amongst the various
levels of education. Thus, higher education receives 25% of the budget, although it has only 2% of the
student population;
3  Lack of school books and teaching materials;
* Inadequate infrastructures and equipment in classrooms, workshops and special-purpose spaces;
e   The deterioration of existing infrastructures;
3   The system's poor retums;
e  Inadequate quality and quantity of teaching personnel, and the deployment of too many teachers in
administrative functions;
*   Inadequate structures and methods for monitoring, evaluation and control.
In addition, there are no schools map, and there is little dialogue between the ministries in charge of
education and vocational training and the employers.
Reforming education should start with diagnostic studies of the sector, dealing with: (i) costs and financing
of the educational system; (ii) management and govemance; (iii) quality and access; and (iv) higher
education and technical training.
2.4.1  The first study will be devoted to the cost and financing of education.
Inadequate financing of education manifests itself in
*   The paucity of operating funds;
*   The virtual non-existence of investment funds;
*   The inappropriate distribution of available resources among levels of education; and
*   The absence of standards for determining the true level of investment as a function of needs.
- 25 -



The study will:
*   Review the financial situation of the educational system: compute the share of education in the budget;
review the structure and evolution of spending by educational level; compare resource allocation
among educational levels and stated priorities; analyze the investment program; estimate unit costs of
education ( direct and indirect, and by level of education);
*   Review the relative proportions of public and private financing, including contributions of parents,
local communities, external financing;
*   Analyze the degree to which private education is currently being encouraged and supported by the
Govemment;
*   Project the financial situation of education for the next five years, based on the ability to pay of
various partners, unit costs and the projected growth of the student population; and
* Propose improvements to the sector's financing (with a view to efficiency and equity).
The expected product is: a detailed diagnostic of the current status of the sector in terms of costs and
financing, accompanied by performance indicators; and options for improving financing, transparency in
the process of financing and budget allocation; mobilization and organization of partnerships in education;
and reducing costs.
The study, to be carried out by an educational economist/financial specialist, is expected to last about
6 weeks.
2.4.2 The second study will be devoted to the management and governance of education.
Managerial practices within the educational system need to be improved. Although there is a commitment,
at the central level, to strategic planning and work programming, as well as a concern with streamlining
structures and management procedures, the effects are not yet perceptible. Neither the process of resource
management nor the system of controls incorporates the principles of accountability and transparency.
Managerial functions (i.e., planning, organization, and control) need to be re-developed from scratch.
There is neither a School Map nor an overall coherent and systematic vision of the process of managing
entities within the educational system.
The study will assess the operational adequacy of the administrative apparatus and of its means, methods
and management tools, from the quantitative and qualitative standpoints, in order to identify dysfunctions
and inadequacies, and propose measures to remedy problems and strengthen structures; the study will also
analyze the organization and operation of the teaching and administrative functions, and their impact upon
the efficiency of the education and training system. More precisely, it will:
(a) Review the current situation of institutional management, notably the functions of planning,
organization, human resources and teacher training, and control and audit;
(b) Analyze the status of pedagogical management, (i.e., school inspections, monitoring of teachers,
program development and textbook selection); and
(c) Propose adequate measures for remedying problems and strengthening structures to make
institutional management more effective and efficient.
The expected product is: (a) a detailed diagnostic of the current management/governance situation in the
sector, and identification of key issues; (b) definition of priorities and objectives to be achieved with
respect to the issues identified; and (c) proposed measures for improving management within the system:
- 26 -



*   Organizational structure of the sector;
* Main procedures;
*   Expansion of partnerships to include the entire educational community;
*   Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms;
*   Managerial mechanisms and administrative and financial controls;
*   Human resource management.
The proposed measures must take into account the objectives to be attained, the means to be deployed in
their attainment, the responsible parties and relevant structures, and the partners already involved or to be
sought. They must also be accompanied by performance indicators.
The study will be carried out by one specialist in administrative and financial management and by one
educator with thorough knowledge of education management and teacher training. It is expected to last 4
weeks.
2.4.3. The third study will be devoted to the access and quality of education.
The study will analyze the causes for the low enrollment rates, especially in rural areas and review the
quality of general education at both primary and secondary levels.
Regarding access to education, the study will:
(a) Review potential and actual demand for education;
(b) Establish, in quantitative terms, the current status of the supply of educational services:
infrastructure and equipment; teachers; teaching material (textbooks and pedagogical aids); and
cost of education to parents;
(c) Analyze data on access and equity (notably imbalances by region and by gender); and
(d) Propose strategies to improve access to education and reduce inequity.
Regarding the quality of education, the study will:
(a) Assess the quality of general education at the primary and secondary levels, both public and
private, especially as regards to foreign languages, mathematics and science at various levels;
(b) Determine and analyze internal returns on education (continuation rates at the five-year mark
in primary school, transition rates at key points in the system, average number of years spent per
diploma and level, distribution of secondary school students amongst the various types of
education and by broad educational track, etc.);
(c) Analyze the ways in which students' knowledge is assessed and the mechanisms in place for
monitoring and improving educational quality; and
(d) Propose measures for improving the quality of education, notably in the following areas:
*   Infrastructure;
*   Status, career paths and structuring of qualification requirements for teachers at various
levels (mechanisms and structures for initial and on-the-job training, working and living
conditions, etc.);
* Curricula (annual totals of hours and their structure, availability and use of lesson plans);
*   Teaching materials;
*   Condition of special-use classrooms and workshop spaces;
*   Condition of equipment; and
-27 -



*   Teacher training.
For the access to education, the expected product is: (a) a detailed diagnostic of educational demand
(potential and actual) and supply (along with all indicators of access and equity); (b) definition of priorities
and objectives with respect to issues identified; and (c) proposed measures to improve the situation with
regard to access and equity. With respect to quality of education, the expected product is a detailed
diagnostic of educational quality (accompanied by all quality indicators); definition of priorities and
objectives related to issues identified; and proposed operational strategies to improve educational quality.
The study will be carried out by one education specialist and one planning specialist, and is expected to
last 10 weeks.
2.4.4. The fourth study will be devoted to higher education and technical training.
The study will: (a) review the situation in higher education and technical training, (including private and
informal training), and analyze its responsiveness to signals from the labor market; (b) analyze the various
financing options; and (c) propose ways for improving the system. In particular, the study will review the
following:
v   Organization of higher education and technical training;
*   Their relationship to economic operators and the relevance of various educational tracks to employers'
needs;
*   Training conditions (duration and structure of programs: general teaching, theoretical and practical
teaching, business intemships, etc.);
*   Job insertion and tracking of graduates of the training system;
: System management (outreach, staffing and various pupil/teacher ratios, physical conditions:
workshops, equipment and materials, structuring and qualification of teachers, methods ofjob
placement and tracking of graduates, etc.);
*   Identification of informal training opportunities.
The expected product is a detailed diagnostic of the current situation in higher education and technical
training, accompanied by performance indicators; a definition of priorities and objectives with regard to
key problems identified; and proposed options for improving the system, such as:
*   Restructuring of the sub-sector;
*   Improving responsiveness to labor market; and
*   Mobilization and organization of training partnerships.
The study is expected to last 8 weeks. The study would be carried out by one specialist in technical and
vocational training, and one specialist in higher education.
The cost of the four studies above is estimated at US$180,000 (US$108,000 for 28 weeks of consultants,
60% international and 40% local, US$48,000 for travel and US$24,000 for four consultation/dissemination
seminars).
2.5    Diagnostic study on Rural Transportation (Cost estimate: US$350,000)
Rural areas in RCA are characterized by low population densities and isolation (622,000 km2 for
3,000,000 people). The predominant means of transport for the population who live in rural
- 28 -



communities are walking and headloading. Very different climatic zones are covering the country from
south to north. The country has a huge rural development potential but is hindered by the poor state of
rural infrastructure in general and rural transport in particular. Past efforts to improve rural roads and
rural mobility, although well intended, have, to a large extent, been piece meal and failed to
comprehensively establish a coherent approach to improve rural transport.
The roads network comprises around 4,000 km of classified roads and 24 000 km of unclassified rural
roads. At the central level, many Ministries and institutions deal with rural roads. Among the most
prominent are the Ministry of Publics Works and territorial administration (MTPAT), the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, many rural development operations and enterprises.
The objective of the Rural Transportation Diagnostic Study (RTDS) is to improve rural livelihood by
facilitating access to economic and social goods and services (inputs, markets, clinics, government
administrative services, schools, food processing facilities). The RTDS will assist in developing a
national strategy to:
*   Improve the planning, financing and maintenance of rural roads, tracks, paths and footbridges;
*   Provide motorized and non-motorized rural transport services to move people and goods;
*   Promote the use of least-cost methods, local resources and small contractors for rural transport
infrastructure works.
More specifically, the RTDS will help government formulate an action plan including:
a) the preparation of a map presenting key road axes that inhibit supply responses of
agricultural produce;
b) the review of experiences of community involvement in road maintenance in CAR, and
draw lessons;
c) the presentations of recommendations for an action plan defining priority road to be
constructed/rehabilitated, including specific criteria for their selection, and conditions and
modalities of community involvement during construction/rehabilitation, and subsequent
maintenance.
Activities under the RTDS will include:
Inventorv (cost: US$150,000) 2-3 months. The first activity will be the launch an inventory of the
road network by using the Geographical Information System (GIS). GIS is a computer-based tool
designed to process information and data in order to facilitate analysis of relationships between
different social, economic and infrastructure variables. The GIS is use with the Global Positioning
System (GPS). The GPS is a system of 24 satellites which circle the globe twice a day and transmit
information to the GIS. The GIS technology integrates common database operations such as query and
statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps.
These abilities distinguish GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of
purposes within strategic planning. GIS has become increasingly valuable for collecting, organizing,
coordinating and analyzing spatial data. It is used by many governments (in Cameroon for example),
encourages a more systematic approach to rural infrastructure information collection. It can reduce the
overall costs and institutional overlap of rural infrastructure information collection and management.
-29 -



It increases comparability and compatibility of diverse data sets. It makes data used in infrastructure
planning accessible to a wider range of decision-makers. It finally encourages the spatial analysis of
infrastructure impacts that would otherwise be more easily ignored because of analytical difficulty or
cost.
Study (cost: US$200,000) 5-6 months The second activity is the preparation of sharply focused
position paper on key aspects of rural transport, including an assessment of the experience in RCA on
management of rural roads, community transport infrastructure, introduction and application of
labor-based methods, rural transport planning, promotion of intermediate means of transport (IMT),
and passenger transport services in rural areas. Components for the study are:
Planning and Local Management of Rural Roads: The study will assess the experience so
far and determine best practice on how to assist local authorities in preparing maintenance programs
and bid document, selecting contractors and supervising road works.
Local Financing of Rural Roads: The study will assess the capacity of local govemment and
communities in financing the maintenance of roads.
Private/Community Roads: Many countries have succeeded in motivating groups of private
individuals, such as property owners (farmers) and neighborhoods to assume ownership of their roads.
Ownership has been provided through legal instruments. This study will provide guidance on how this
would best be done in RCA.
Promotion of IMT in RCA: There are numerous on-going and past efforts at promoting IMT
usage. What is lacking is a coherent assessment of these efforts to establish best practice. The study
will assess these efforts and will provide guidance as to how the Government can provide the enabling
environment for the implementation of its policy of encouraging IMT usage for village transportation.
The national workshop will provide a first opportunity to bring together the various actors supporting
this effort.
Rural Transport Services: Rural transport is not well organized and operates largely outside
the existing legal framework. The study will assess what type of incentives (positive and negative) are
required, in addition to rehabilitating the roads, to improve provision of rural transport services.
Small Scale and Labor-Based Contractors: This study will address the specific issues
relating to small scale and labor-based contractors.
2.6    Diagnostic study of the cotton sector (Cost Estimate: US$200,000)
Cotton is an important activity, as it is the main cash crop for almost 200,000 rural families (about one
third of the population). The sector is managed by SOCOCA, a joint venture involving CAR Govemment
and the French CFDT. However, the sector faces structural problems due to poor agricultural practices,
high transportation costs and excessive operating costs of SOCOCA. For instance, in 1997/98, a good year
in terms of output (46,000 tons), CAR's cost of cotton fiber was 18% and 7% above those of Mali and
Chad, respectively. These problems have been exacerbated by declining cotton international prices, which
reached a 14 year low around the end of 1999. As a matter of fact, in January 2000, SOCOCA's export
price was about CFAF 680/kg (about 50 US cents/lb.), while its cost was about CFAF 880/kg (about US
- 30 -



cents 64/lb). Predictably, this has resulted in large losses by SOCOCA, which are putting a heavy burden
on the budget (and threatening to pressurize the recently restructured and privatized banking sector). This
has also led to a steep decline in production (estimated at only 28,000 tons in 1999/2000). Thus, the future
of the sector is at risk, with potentially major consequences on poverty.
The future hinges on the implementation by Government of a vigorous reform program to ensure the
viability of the sector. Progress in reforming the sector is crucial and is viewed by the Transitional Support
Strategy Note as a condition for IDA lending beyond the FCC and the proposed operation. Reforrn should
include: (a) improvements in the competitiveness of SOCOCA as a ginning and marketing enterprise; (b)
improvements in productivity to increase cotton farmers' income; (c) strengthened farmers' institutions that
would be more active in cotton marketing, input procurement and producer price setting.
The diagnostic study will help the Government fornulate the reform program for the cotton sector. It will
integrate existing analyses including the recommendations of the 1998 Round Table and present a plan of
action to rehabilitate the sector. The study will address both short-term and structural issues.
Short-Term Issues and Measures
*  Review of SOCOCA's income statements for 1998/99, and projection of its income statement
for the 2000/2001 season;
*  Assessment of SOCOCA's cash-flow situation at the end of 1998/99, and projection at the end
of the 2000/2001 season;
*  Advise on whether or not was opportune to re-open the ginnery;
-   Assist in the formulation of a producer pricing system closely linked to world prices; and assist
in the determination of producer prices for the 2000/2001 season;
*   Formulate cotton sector-wide recommendations for implementation in 2000/2001, including on
farm input procurement; collection and transport of seed cotton; transport of farm inputs and
fiber; spare parts management; and any other relevant measures.
Structural Issues and Measures
*  Audit of SOCOCA's financial accounts 1998/99;
   Assess SOCOCA's management performance and make recommendations for improvement,
including on management procedures and organizational set-up;
*   Technical Audit of SOCOCA to assess, inter alia, technical and financial performance of
ginning activities; transport of seed cotton, farm inputs and cotton fiber. Propose measures to
address shortcomings and improve performance;
*   Review SOCOCA's performance in seed cotton collection and cotton fiber marketing and make
recommendations for improvement;
*   Assessment of farmers' incentives and yields (presently the lowest in Francophone Africa
producing countries) and of the performance of agricultural services including extension;
Propose measures for improvement.
The short-term study would be implemented over 6 weeks by a firm or a financial analyst with proven
familiarity with cotton sector issues. At the end of the first 4 weeks, a draft report with a short and concise
summary would be issued for discussion in CAR, with key partners, including donors. The cost of the
study is estimated at US$40,000.
The medium-term study would follow the first study and would be implemented over 4 months by an
experienced firm or consultant(s) with proven familiarity with cotton sector issues. The team of consultants
should include: (a) an agronomist familiar with cotton production; (b) an engineer familiar with ginning
- 31 -



activities; (c) an economist or agricultural economist; and (d) an agricultural services specialist i.e.
someone familiar with research, extension, and farmers' organizations. At the end of the first three months,
a draft report with a short and concise summary would be issued for discussion in CAR, with key partners,
including donors. The cost of the study is estimated at US$150,000.
2.7    Diagnostic study of the livestock sector (Cost Estimate: US$230,000)
Livestock (cattle) is potentially one of the best sources of growth, as about half the area of CAR is suitable
for grazing, though only 15% of the area is presently used. About 26,000 herders and agro-pastoralists
obtain their main income from livestock. CAR's cattle herd has been growing rapidly until the mid-1990s
(2.4 million head in 1994, compared to 1I.1 million in 1980), However, recent studies show a trend of herd
depletion affecting about half the herders, due to various causes.
The greatest issue is the prevalence of animal trypanosomiasis, which has been more or less under control
for the past three decades through intensive use of trypanocidal drugs distributed through the Herder's
Federation's network. This federation, set up under two successive IDA supported projects, has been a
model for other West and central African countries, but has been seriously weakened by the losses in assets
incurred during the mutinies, and the political turmoil of the last decade. Insecurity has deeply disturbed
grazing and cattle marketing patterns. The shortage of qualified professionals, particularly veterinarians, is
another major issue.
To exploit the sector's potential, especially since demand for livestock continues to grow in neighboring
countries, particularly Nigeria and Cameroon, would require that security be restored and effective
veterinary drug distribution reestablished. The Herders Federation (FNEC) could again provide a stepping
stone for a renewed support to the sector.
TORs of the study:
The study will take stock of the situation in the sector, using whatever studies have been prepared recently
by the Govemment and Donors. It will identify the major constraints to the sector's development and map
out options for the Government to choose from. It will focus particularly on:
(a) a review of the available qualified human resources in the sector (in Govemment, in the private
sector, among herders and other producers), and the development of a draft program to upgrade
these resources in the perspective of a privatized delivery of veterinary services;
(b) a review, to be carried out in cooperation with the Herder's Federation, of the veterinary drugs
distribution network and its potential for rehabilitation;
(c) a review of the livestock marketing organization, and the levy collection system and elaboration
of proposals for its rehabilitation, improvement or reform;
(d) a survey of local and regional markets for livestock and marketing statistics; and
(e) a survey of a sample of herders (at least 200, preferably 500) in the various regions of the
country to assess the situation of producers (status of ownership of herds, herd size, biological
productivity paramneters, fiscal pressure, marketing opportunities and herd offtake, identification of
biological and socio-economic constraints to the development of production).
- 32 -



Cost estimate:
* (a), (b), (c) and (d) would cost US$80,000, and would be completed within four months by local
consultants with support from an international consultant during 2 months.
* (e) is a more extensive piece of work, would require international expertise for the design and
supervision of the survey and for the processing of the data the cost is estimated at:
- 5 months of international consultant at US$12,000 each plus three round trip air tickets: total
US$70,000
- 2 X 6 Man months of local consultants (implementation and supervision of the survey):
US$24,000
- lOX 6 man months of surveyors: US$15,000
- Local transport, office supplies, miscellaneous expenses : US$15,000
- data processing: US$20,000
Estimated cost for (e) : US$150,000.
* Total (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) US$230,000
2.8    Diagnostic study on forestry (Cost Estimate: US$150,000)
2.8.1. Background. CAR has about 5 million hectares of tropical rain forest, distributed in two blocks:
3.6 million hectares in the southwest of the country, forming the productive forestlands, and 1.4 million
hectares in the southeast that is virtually inaccessible. The entire northern part of the country is made up of
dry woodlands and savanna which still offer a potential for wildlife conservation despite the intense
poaching currently rife in it.
Forestry is the second source of revenue and the chief source of employment after public service. However,
its contribution to State revenues and value added is well below its potential, due to: (i) the low taxation,
which is lower than in neighboring countries and is not established by competitive mechanisms; and (ii) the
weak collection capacity.
Due to the long distance to the port of Douala (over 1,000 km) wood production concentrates on noble
species such as sapelli and sipo. The offtake is about 5 m3/ha, whereas the ecologically sustainable level
for forest regeneration is 20 - 30 m3. The formal sector includes only about ten foreign forestry
companies, but the informal sector is made of several small companies.
Forest communities are heavily dependent on hunting for food and subsistence, but do not engage in
small-scale forestry. Current regulations do not encourage community forestry and the redistribution of
revenues from industrial operation (30% of the felling tax) is inefficient.
CAR has about 5,000 species of plants and 700 species of birds. Wildlife is suffering from intense
poaching in both the forestlands and the savanna zones. Sanctuaries cover about 10% of the country's area
but their management is generally mediocre despite the international support channeled through initiatives
such as the PDRN project in the north of the country. The Dzangha-Sangha wildlife reserve forms part of
a trinational complex of sanctuaries set up in conjunction with Cameroon and Congo.
2.8.2. TORs. The mission will: (a) review the present situation in the forestry and environmental sector,
particularly the constraints to its development; and (b) make recommendations for the development of the
sector, particularly: (i) ensuring sustainable management of the forest resources and conservation of the
- 33 -



natural ecosystems; and (ii) increasing the sector's contribution to Government revenue, rural development
and poverty reduction. The consultants will take stock of earlier studies made by the Government, the Bank
and other donors.
2.8.2.1 The review of the forestry sector will include:
*   Forest resources: land allocation plan at national level, areas and volumes of timber, quantification of
other resources: fuelwood, wildlife;
*   Role of the sector in the national economy: Update information on number of direct and indirect jobs,
wages, value added, tax receipts and exports;
*   Regulatory and institutional framework of the forestry sector: major provisions of the Forestry Code
and of the implementing regulations; planning, monitoring and control capacity of the government
departments concerned and interministerial coordination capacity; mechanisms for agency funding and
financial tracking; problems related with corruption;
*   Wood subsector: structure of forest exploitation and wood industry, taxation and efficiency of
collection, incentives for and constraints on investment, system for granting and managing operating
permits; degree of implementation of management plans at concession level; evaluation of the informal
sector; participation of nationals in the sector;
*   Role of forestry in local development: degree of decentralization of the State institutions, plan for
deconcentrated taxation, possible methods for management of forest resources by communities or local
authorities;
-   Biodiversity conservation: level of management of sanctuaries, level of exploitation of wildlife by local
communities or the State;
-   The parties involved in the forestry sector: capacity for intervention and innovation, and degree of
representativeness of the professional associations, local authorities and communities, and of national
and international NGOs;
i Donor interventions: spheres of intervention, level of appropriation of outcomes by the authorities and
impact on the sector, types of financial and technical instruments employed, and development trends.
The mission will also review the following issues:
3   Is the Forestry Code consistent with national objectives and development trends in the sub-region?
*   Does the regulatory framework ensure transparency and competition, especially with regard to resource
allocation and industrialization?
*   Are regulations enforced? If not, why?
*   What is the role assigned to State institutions and to what degree do they possess the capacity to
perform these functions? To what extent would these functions be performed more efficiently by other
operators?
This analysis will make it possible to determine where the country stands with respect to the following
criteria:
*   Existence of a strong and high-level commitment in favor of reforms in forestry;
*   Progress made in the implementation of recent reforms and in effective application of the regulatory
framework;
*   Identification of initiatives in the forestry field that have been successful and the reasons for their
success;
- 34 -



*   Identification of the forestry players or groups of forestry players capable of participating in the
development of the sector: in the public sector, among donors, national or international NGOs,
national universities, professional organizations, regional associations and groups.
This review will enable the consultants to:
(i) list the sector objectives and verify their mutual compatibility;
(ii) identify the constraints preventing the sector from achieving these objectives; and
(iii) establish a priority ranking of the sector's needs in order to make recommendations that could be
included in the Govemmgnt strategy for the sector.
2.8.2.2. The mission will formulate these recommendations on the basis of the experience gained in
Cameroon and Gabon, in the context of the Forests and Environment Program and the GEF Biodiversity
Program. It will identify in particular: (a) the priority actions; and (b) their sequencing.
(a) Priority actions cover the areas identified in the review: legislative, regulatory and tax reforms,
institutional reorganization; improvement of coordination among the agencies concerned and the
other players; strengthening of technical and fiscal control capacity, introduction of mechanisms
designed to foster the transparency of the sector and competition-based processes, facilitate
decentralization, ensure sustainable resource management and conservation of natural ecosystems
and optimize the sector's contribution to local development and economic growth.
(b) Establish a chronological sequence for the actions, setting priorities. The chances of success;
prerequisites, the order of magnitude of the costs entailed. The mission will identify which
interventions can be immediately effective and which will only be possible once reforms of a more
general nature have been implemented.
2.8.2.3. Practical Arrangements. The consultants will consult the main players in the sector, notably:
*   Government departments, including the ministries with responsibility for forestry, the economy and
finance, industry, tourism, rural development and land-use planning;
*   Members of the National Assembly;
*   Representatives of logging and wood processing and transporting companies, together with the other
private operators such as hunting-party guides and forest-management consultants;
*   Representatives of the conservation and sustainable forest management projects active in CAR.
The consultants will make field visits as needed. Toward the midpoint of the mission, they will convene the
main players to share their findings and receive comments. At the end of the mission the consultants will
present their recommendations.
The budget for this task, which is to be completed within two months, is US$150,000. The working
language is French. The task will be carried out by a team of two or three international consultants
possessing the following qualifications:
*   In-depth knowledge of and experience in Central Africa in the following fields: development
economics, forestry policy, institutional development, economics of the wood subsector, land-use
planning and biodiversity conservation;
*   Good knowledge of the World Bank's recent projects and in the forestry sector, in Central Africa;
*   Aptitude for developing a constructive dialogue with players of different levels and belonging to.groups
- 35 -



having divergent interests, and for conducting productive multiparty analysis meetings.
This team will be strengthened by two national consultants possessing the following qualifications:
*  In-depth technical knowledge of CAR forestry and environmental sector and of its development over
the past ten years.
*   In-depth knowledge of CAR legal and institutional framework.
2.9    Diagnostic study on mining (Cost Estimate: US$100,000)
Sector Background
The mining sector mainly includes artisanal exploitation of diamonds and gold. Exploitation of uranium
started in 1975, but ended in 1981 due to low prices, and is unlikely to resume under present market
conditions. A small but high grade iron ore deposit has been found, which might lead to some artisanal
production of iron products (e.g., hand tools). Indications of manganese, copper and other minerals have
been found, but have not been explored or evaluated. However, given that CAR is landlocked and lacks
infrastructure, it is unlikely that such deposits could prove commercially viable.
The mining sector represents an important part of the Central African economy: diamond exports are 30 to
50 % of total export earnings, 4 to 6 % of GDP and 5 to 8 % of government revenue. The sector provides
a monetary remuneration to about 100,000 diggers, artisans, collectors and staff of buying offices and
mining companies. The sector is largely self-financed, through a relatively efficient network of "collectors"
and buying offices. The artisans are well organized and are reasonably well paid for their production.
Because artisanal mining is very labor intensive, its development would benefit the poor and thus, it is,
understandably, part of the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Officially declared diamond production peaked at 531,992 carats in 1994 and has since fallen to 419,967
carats in 1998, and 431,138 carats in 1999. Total (officially declared and illegal) diamond production is
estimated at 650,000 carats at an official reference price of US$145/carat, though the average fair market
export price is estimated at closer to US$195/carat (8 billion FCFA). BECDOR, the Government valuation
office, has benefited from IDA support under the Economic Management Project in the past, and still
works reasonably well.
The sector is managed by the Ministry of Mining and Energy. This Ministry has been given exhaustive
functions but it is weak in terms of human capacity, organizational setup, and logistical support. As a
result of this weak institutional structure the mining permit and cadastre system is utter chaos. The mining
law, which dates from 1979, contains numerous and very serious deficiencies. It provides neither security
nor incentive for to private foreign investment in the sector. The tax regime applicable to mining is much
too onerous and complicated. It is not internationally competitive and therefore a disincentive to inward
investment. In addition, export taxes on diamonds are questionably too high. Nonetheless, the artisanal
diamond sector seems to be functioning well enough on its own without too much government interference.
However, many middle men and politicians are involved raising issues of governance.
Brief Description of Diagnostic Study
A clear and consistent strategy for the mining sector is needed. The diagnostic study would be organized
in-the-country through the help of outside consultants. The objective would be to conduct a dialogue
- 36 -



among the relevant actors on the main principles of policy and strategy for the sector and, building upon
these principles, prepare a declaration which would subsequently be endorsed by the government. Once the
main policies have been agreed upon work could proceed on the new mining law itself.
The diagnostic study and the dialogue which would go with it will focus on:
* Evaluation of the socio-economic potential and constraints of mining in CAR;
*   The role of the state in mining development;
* Critical comments on the legal, regulatory and institutional regimes and recommendations for
improvement;
* Analysis of the mining taxation regime and its implications for the competitiveness of the
sector;
* Studies of artisanal mining and preparation of a strategy to develop it;
* Identification of measures to protect the environment, including negative social and cultural
impacts of mining.
The declaration of policy and strategy would include an action plan (short, medium and long term)
and a description of the measures the state should take to stimulate development of the sector.
The time required for the completion of the diagnostic study is six to nine months.
2.10   IEC activities (Cost Estimate: US$500,000).
This sub-component will support the participatory process, to ensure that the final Poverty Reduction
Strategy reflects and integrates as much as possible the views and needs of stakeholders. Once the
diagnostic studies are completed by consultants, and based on these papers, the Government is expected to
prepare a draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Then, the draft would be widely distributed to, and
discussed with relevant stakeholders (e.g., the draft strategy for livestock would be discussed with the
Herders Federation, while the draft cotton strategy would be discussed with representatives of cotton
farmers and of employees of SOCOCA, etc). Several seminars will be organized in the first quarter of
2001, prior to the finalization of the PRSP.
IEC campaigns are also needed to improve support for the reform program in general. These will target a
larger audience including politicians, parliamentarians, joumalists and university students.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.60 million
SUPPORT TO THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE FOR STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
(CTP-PAS)
This component will provide support to the committee which is in charge of monitoring the implementation
of the adjustment and reform program (CTP-PAS), and of coordinating all activities under the project.
More precisely, this component will finance the salaries of the head of the CTP-PAS and four key staff in
the agency over a three year period (Cost estimate: US$240,000. It will also finance equipment, including
computers and a vehicle, and some operating costs, particularly training (Cost estimate: US$90,000). This
component will also finance the cost of a Senior Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister over a two year
period (Cost estimate: US$160,000). The PPF advance will finance the cost of an implementation
specialist who will prepare the manual of procedures and finalize the procurement plan for the project and
help manage the procurement process (Cost estimate: US$30,000). The PPF advance will also finance an
assessment of local consulting capabilities, with a view to maximize use of local consultants (Cost
estimate: US$30,000).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO START IMPLEMENTATION OF STATISTICAL
DEVELOPMENT PLAN
CAR statistical infrastructure suffered from the mutinies of the mid- 1990s, when much of the equipment
and files were destroyed or lost, and subsequently from reduced work force, compounded by rapid rotation
of staff. All existing databases are weak, including national accounts, social indicators, prices, balance of
payments, and government finance statistics. Only monetary statistics appear to be adequate. This makes it
difficult to obtain accurate data even on important areas, e.g., social indicators and domestic debt,
including salary arrears, and complicates policy making. A comprehensive diagnostic of the weaknesses
and a detailed work program for statistical development has been prepared with IMF assistance (Rapport
de la mission multisectorielle de statistiques, 28 octobre-12 novembre 1999).
The authorities agree that accurate and timely statistics are essential for policy making and are committed
to the implementation of the proposed work program. They have expressed their willingness to finance a
significant part of expenses out of their own resources, but external assistance will also be required. An
overview of future needs for financing, materials, technical assistance, and training that would be required
in the implementation of the measures for statistical development in the various sectors has been provided
by the IMF. In particular, a project to improve agricultural statistics would need significant financing from
external sources; likewise, a project to revise and harmonize the nomenclature of the budget and the
Treasury's chart of accounts would also need technical assistance and external financing.
This component, to be implemented through the Statistical Division of the Ministry of Planning, will assist
CAR in starting the implementation of its statistical development plan. It will consist of:
:  preparing TORs and cost estimates for priority tasks in the work program;
=   assessing existing statistical skills;
= determining training needed to carry out the priority tasks of the work program; and
*   providing training.
Project Component 5 - US$0.55 million
STRENGTHENING OF THE MINISTRY IN CHARGE OF MINING
The strengthening of the Ministry in charge of Mining is a much needed follow up activity to the
preparation of the diagnostic study on mining and the sector strategy. That is because of the urgent need to
revise the mining code, which has been suspended for several years, and also because of the considerable
potential of the sector for growth and poverty reduction. Although much of the detailed work under this
component is to be defined during the preparation of the diagnostic study, a brief description of the main
activities and actions to be undertaken is presented below:
Draft a new mining law. A new law would do away with many of the old fashioned notions in the old
legislation. The principal objective would to make the new law conform not only to international standards
but also to deal effectively with CAR specific conditions such as, in particular, small scale and artisanal
mining.
Harmonize CAR commercial and tax codes with other countries of the sub-region. A "good" Mining
Code in itself is of little practical use if it is not accompanied by a favorable tax system, investment
incentive, an acceptable custom system. Commercial regulations and tax policies in CAR should be
brought into line with those of other countries in the region (UDEAC). Phase Two of the studies will seek
- 38 -



to identify the critical path of these various reforms in respect of mining investment.
Training and institutional strengthening of the key government departments responsible for the sector
should be undertaken. It is of little use to draft a new mining law and regulations if the government
officials in charge of enforcing it do not have the understanding or capacity to do so effectively. Therefore
the project will strengthen the General Directorate of Mining, notably through training and purchase of
computer equipment. BECDOR, which performs essential monitoring and taxing functions, should be
strengthened immediately in order to reduce fraud in diamond exports. The Project will up-grade
BECDOR's antiquated testing and computer equipment and finance the purchase on a periodic basis market
and price information from sources in Antwerp.
Install and set-up properly functioning cadastre system. An absolutely essential ingredient to applying the
mining law is to bring some order to the granting and registering of exploration and mining permits. This is
utter chaos at the moment and no investor, foreign or domestic, will feel security of tenure until a cadastre
system is put into place. The new project will provide for some system design, equipment funding, and
training.
The time required for execution is two years.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: POLICY SUPPORT PROJECT
Cost Effectiveness Analysis
The approach selected to implement the project, i.e., mainly through the recruitment of consultants, is more
cost-effective than the alternative, i.e., implementation using the regular civil service. In principle, the
privatization and regulation program, as well as the preparation of diagnostic studies on various sectors
could be implemented through the civil service. Unfortunately, largely because civil servants are paid
poorly and late, there would be unacceptable uncertainty regarding the quality and timeliness of the
outputs. Only through extensive and lengthy capacity building would quality be ensured. But the alternative
of implementing the project through lengthy capacity building would not ensure timeliness. It would also be
more expensive. At the same time, local consultants, who are less expensive than international ones, will be
used as much as possible. A special effort will be made under the project to identify suitable local
consultants.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: POLICY SUPPORT PROJECT
Procurement
I.    Procurement Capacity. Procurement capacity in CAR has weakened substantially following civil
strife in the mid-nineties. Substantial capacity rebuilding will be needed to recreate procurement
proficiency at the central and sectoral levels. Under the PSP, the capacity of the public procurement system
will be assessed and an action plan prepared to develop a training program and strengthen capacity in order
to reduce the procurement risk level for future IDA financed investments. In 1998, a procurement
committee ("Commission des marches") was created under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and
several members of its staff are reportedly familiar with World Bank and European Union procurement
procedures and received procurement training. Although the head and the accountant of the CTP-PAS have
had previous procurement training and experience with the execution of IDA financed projects, they have
not been exposed to recent developments in Bank financed procurement and would in any event not be able
to handle the many detailed procurement procedures under the PSP. A procurement specialist will,
therefore, be recruited to assist with the preparation of Bidding documents and Requests for Proposals,
proposal evaluation and contract management, and to prepare an assessment, with recommendations, of the
procurement system in CAR. The procurement specialist will be under the supervision of the CTP-PAS.
2.    Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of goods and services financed by IDA will be carried
out in accordance with the Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January
1995 and lastly revised in January 1999, and Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers, dated January 1997 and lastly revised in January 1999. The Bank's Standard Bidding
Document for Goods will be used for the National Competitive Bidding procedure and the Standard
Request for Proposals for the Selection of Consultants, as well as the Bank's standard forms for bid and
proposal evaluation. A General Procurement Notice, announcing the list of all contracts above
US$100,000, and requesting expressions of interest for consultant contracts, will be published in
Development Business upon Board approval. After advertising in Development Business, a waiting period
of at least 30 days will be respected before short lists are prepared. The GPN will be repeated yearly for
those assignments for which a short list has not yet been prepared.
3.    Goods. Vehicles, estimated to cost a total of US$150,000, to facilitate the operations of the
CTP-PAS, the Privatization Commission and the PRS (poverty reduction strategy) Committee, will be
procured in accordance with the National Competitive Bidding procedure, taking into account the
following: (1) any bidder is given adequate response time (four weeks) for preparation and submission of
bids; (ii) no preference margin is granted to domestic suppliers; (iii) eligible firms, including foreign
suppliers, are not precluded from participation, and (iv) award will be to the lowest evaluated bidder. Some
computer equipment and office material needed for the CTP-PAS, the Privatization Commission and the
Ministry of Mining (estimated at about US$50,000 equivalent) may be procured through the National
Shopping procedure, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, by comparing written price quotations
obtained from at least three reputable local suppliers on the basis of written solicitations providing a clear
description and quantity of the items required, taking into account delivery time if not available
off-the-shelf, and indicating the terms of payments and the fact that the financing is assured by IDA. The
implementing units will maintain records for review by Bank missions.
4.    Consultant Services. The selection of consulting firms and individual consultants under the PSP
will be for assistance and studies on regulation and privatization of power, telecommunications, and the
-43 -



petroleum company, and diagnostic studies on poverty assessment, education, health, including
HIV/AIDS, cotton, livestock, rural transportation, forestry and mining subsectors. Specific contracts for
consulting firms valued above US$100,000 equivalent will be advertised separately in UNDB, the national
newspaper and technical journals as needed and contracts for firms costing less than US$100,000 will be
advertised locally, and in special magazines as needed. Embassies of member countries established locally
will receive copies of these announcements. Sufficient time - a minimum of two weeks - shall be provided
for responses before preparation of the short list.
5.     The total cost of consultant services, including reimbursables, is estimated at about
US$7.8 million. All consulting firms will be selected on the basis of QCBS (Quality- and Cost Based
Selection). Individual consultants will be selected in accordance with the method explained in Section V -
Selection of Individual Consultants - of the Guidelines, on the basis of qualifications and references.
6.     Goods needed for the implementation of the consultancies, such as vehicles or vehicle rental,
computers, office rental and office supplies, may be included in the Request for Proposals by asking
consulting firms for competitive quotes (reimbursables separate from fees) on the basis of technical
specifications provided, so that each proposal will be evaluated on a comparable basis. Separate
procurement of such goods would entail the risk that they may not be available when consultants arrive on
site. In the case of individual consultants, the Government will provide office space and transport. Terms of
reference for the various assignments will be prepared with the assistance of the Bank's Task Team and
agreed with the CTP-PAS. CTP-PAS will prepare the short lists for IDA non-objection. The procurement
specialist consultant will help prepare the draft Requests for Proposals, assist in their evaluation and in the
preparation of the evaluation report and recommendation of the selected candidate(s), to be approved by the
CTP-PAS and Government authorities concerned, and to be sent to IDA for non-objection.
7.     Planning of Consultant Services. A procurement plan for the implementation of the studies
according to priorities is being finalized. The plan is detailed for the first five components (privatization of
ENERCA, privatization of SOCATEL, follow up activities to PETROCA's privatization, mining
diagnostic study and the short-term part of the cotton diagnostic study) and will be updated for the
remaining consultancies during the initial phase of project implementation.
8.     Overall Procurement Risk and Prior Review Levels. This risk may be considered high given the
weak procurement proficiency in CAR. However, the recruitment of a procurement specialist consultant is
expected to accelerate the selection and contracting process and to reduce this risk to an acceptable level.
Nonetheless, the procedures for prior review described in Appendix I, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Guidelines
will apply to the NCB contract for the purchase of vehicles and the first two contracts of US$5,000 or
more procured under National Shopping. Similarly, Appendix 1, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Selection of
Consultants will apply to all contracts with firms estimated at US$50,000 or above and the first three
contracts below this amount, which implies that short lists and evaluation of most technical proposals
before opening financial proposals will be subject to prior review by IDA. Similarly, the selection

Overall Procurement Risk Assessment
High
Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: One every 6 months (includes special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits)
Procurement risk is alleviated by the hiring of a procurement specialist consultant by project inception,
and may be considered "average" under these circumstances.
IThresholds generally differ by country and project. Consult OD 11.04 "Review of Procurement
Documentation" and contact the Regional Procurement Adviser for guidance.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements for all expenditures should be made against full documentation, except for items of
expenditures for:
(a) contracts for consulting firms in an amount equivalent or inferior to $100,000;
(b) contracts for individual consultants in an amount equivalent or inferior to $50,000; as well as
(c) goods, training and operating costs, which will be claimed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at a suitable location and readily
accessible for review by periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.
Special account:
To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, CTP-PAS will open
a Special Account in FCFA in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The
authorized allocation will be FCFA 300 million and will cover about four months of eligible expenditures.
Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount of FCFA 150 million representing fifty percent of
the authorized allocation into the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available when
the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed the equivalent of 3 million
dollars. Replenishment applications will be submitted monthly. Further deposits by IDA into the Special
Account will be made against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.
Financial Management and Accounting
The Bank has reviewed two of the project implementation agencies, namely, the CTP-PAS and the
Privatization Commission in Bangui in February 2000 in order to assess the financial management systems
and capacity of the two agencies. The CTP-PAS which has had previous experience in handling IDA
operations through adjustment operations has a staff of nine people, including an experienced accountant
who had been the accountant of another IDA funded project, the Transport Sector Project. The CTP-PAS
has been managing the PPF of US$350,000 using manual accounting procedures which are not formalized.
The Privatization Commission has no staff except its President and does not have any accounting system in
place. The IDA team concluded that in view of insufficient local accounting capacity and the relative small
-48 -



size and low complexity of the project operations, the project accounts should be kept by the CTP-PAS.
The Privatization Commission would retain the responsibility for making commitments but would transfer
invoices for payment and recording to the CTP-PAS. The CTP-PAS would be responsible for the
management of the Special Accounts and the Project Account, the preparation of consolidated project
accounts, the preparation of withdrawal applications, and eventually the preparation of quarterly PMR.
A consultant will be recruited to (i) help CTP-PAS design an accounting and financial management system
acceptable to IDA; (ii) prepare an accounting manual; (iii) assist CTP-PAS purchase a project software
and in its customization; and finally (iv) train CTP-PAS staff in the use of the accounting software. During
the first year of the project and as soon as the project accounting system is functioning, the project will
prepare an action plan over an 18 months period to produce PMR quarterly under LACI. Terms of
reference for the recruitment of the above mentioned consultant and the short list of firms acceptable to
IDA have been agreed with the borrower.
External Audit
The terms of reference for the recruitment of external auditors and the short list of audit firms acceptable to
IDA have been agreed with the borrower.

The Prime Minister
to
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President of the World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. President,
On behalf of the Government of the Central African Republic, I am pleased to present you with the
Letter of Sector Policy for the Policy Support Project (PSP). The letter confirms the contents of the
Development Policy Letter that I addressed to you on November 23, 1999 in connection with the Fiscal
Consolidation Credit (FCC). In particular, it confirms the Government's commitment to the program of
privatization and regulation. In the case of the Central African Republic, privatization is intended to
improve the budgetary situation (by cutting the losses of public enterprises and reducing subsidies) as
well as efficiency and transparency. It is therefore an important element in our reform program. The
Government intends to use technical assistance made available under the PSP to lease ENERCA, the
electricity utility; complete the privatization of SOCATEL, the telecommunications company, of which
40 percent of the stock is already in private hands; finalize the regulatory framework for the electricity
and telecommunications sectors; and create an autonomous, multisectoral regulatory agency.
The Letter of Sector Policy also confirms the Government's commitment to a medium-term poverty
reduction strategy. The Government intends to use technical assistance available under the PSP to
prepare diagnostic studies of productive sectors where growth is most likely to benefit the poorest (i.e.,
cotton, livestock, forestry, rural transportation and mining), as well as of social sectors (i.e., education
and health, including the AIDS problem). These diagnostic studies will be used by the Government to
develop a draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which will be discussed with the relevant
stakeholders. This participatory process will serve to validate the PRSP.
Our statistical infrastructure has suffered greatly as a result of the mutinies and a lack of resources over
the last few years. Reliable statistics are needed, however, to implement effective economic and social
policies. With support from the IMF, we have begun the task of rebuilding our statistics-generating
infrastructure. In particular, we have drawn up a plan for statistics development that we must now begin
to implement under the PSP. The Letter of Sector Policy sets out the Government's ideas on this subject.
- 56 -



Efficient exploitation of our mineral resources is expected to stimulate economic growth, improve the
balance of trade and public finances, create jobs and reduce poverty. The diagnostic study of the mining
sector will help the Government to prepare a sectoral strategy, but we also need to strengthen the
Ministry of Mines and, in particular, revise the Mining Code. The Letter of Sector Policy presents the
Government's intentions regarding the development of this important sector of our economy.
The Government is convinced that the policies and measures described in the Letter of Sector Policy will
allow us to achieve our stated objectives, and it is prepared to adopt any other measures that may prove
necessary. We will respond favorably to any request from IDA for information concerning the
implementation of these policies and measures.
Sincerely,
Anicet Georges DOLOGUELE

POLICY SUPPORT PROJECT
LETTER OF SECTOR POLICY
I. Introduction
1.        Since the mutinies of 1996/97, the Government of the Central African Republic has made
great efforts, with the help of its development partners, to end internal strife and to put the economy on
the road to recovery. These efforts have paid off, since public safety has improved and the economy is
once again on the upswing. The Policy Framework Paper for the 1998-2000 period was adopted in May
1998 and approved at a donors' meeting organized by the World Bank. In July 1998, the IMF approved
a three-year credit equivalent to US$66 million under the ESAF, and in September 1998 the Paris Club
granted debt relief on Naples terms.
2.        The situation on the political front has also improved, the Central African Republic's
development partners helped prepare and oversee the November 1998 legislative elections. Presidential
elections were held in September 1999 and a new Government took office. The Government now
includes technocrats who are in charge of the reform program, as well as representatives of the
opposition and civil society.
3.        Since early 1998, the Government has taken vigorous measures to improve tax collection
and to implement structural reforms, notably in the area of privatization. These advances made it
possible for the IMF to complete its first assessment of the ESAF and to release its second tranche on
June 22, 1999. On the basis of this progress, IDA granted the Central African Republic a
US$20 million Fiscal Consolidation Credit (FCC) in December 1999 to consolidate public finances and
sustain the reform program. Prior to that, in May 1999, IDA had granted an advance under the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) to prepare the Policy Support Project, in order to help the Central African
Republic implement its reform program, and especially the program of privatization and regulation
supported by the FCC.
II The Privatization and Regulation Program
4.        Since 1998, the Government has reactivated its privatization program, which essentially
involves two large commercial banks, the petroleum importing and distribution company PETROCA, the
electrical utility ENERCA, and the telecommunications company SOCATEL. The privatization
program is aimed at reducing parafiscal losses and subsidies while improving transparency and economic
efficiency. In addition to its disengagement from existing public enterprises, the Government has decided
that no new public enterprises shall be created, particularly no new financial institutions, and that it shall
acquire no new shares in the capital of existing enterprises. In order to encourage further liberalization
of the economy, the Government also plans to improve the legal and regulatory framework of certain key
sectors (such as electricity and telecommunications) and to create an autonomous multisectoral
regulatory agency.
5.        The restructuring and privatization of the banking sector are well underway. Four banks
have been closed. Of the three commercial banks remaining, two (BICA and UBAC) have already been
privatized.. The third (BPMC) has been recapitalized by its stockholders and its privatization will be
considered at a later date. The authorities also plan to cooperate with the regional oversight agency,
COBAC, to ensure that the banks adhere strictly to prudential rules and establish adequate reserves to
- 58 -



cover their unproductive loans.
6.        PETROCA was liquidated in May 1999, and a purchase agreement was signed in October
1999 with three multinational petroleum companies. The next step will be for those three companies to
create SOGAL, a private petroleum distribution company, an event expected to take place by June 2000.
SOGAL will take over existing facilities and petroleum stocks.
7.        The Government is taking the necessary measures to lease the electrical utility ENERCA.
Bidding documents are under preparation. The Government has also prepared a draft strategy for the
electricity sector, on the basis of which an electricity code will be drawn up.
8.        Forty per cent of SOCATEL's capital has been privatized, and the Government is
endeavoring to divest itself of the 60% share it still holds in the company. However, SOCATEL needs to
be restructured before this can occur. The Government also intends to revise the regulatory framework
of the telecommunications sector.
9.        The Government believes firmly that the privatization of public enterprises having a
technical monopoly is not complete without adequate regulation. Given the paucity of our human and
financial resources, we have opted for a single regulatory agency. This will save scarce resources, create
synergies and boost the credibility of the new entity as an independent agency.
llI Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
10.       As I mentioned in my letter of November 23, our medium-term goals are to check the
deterioration of social indicators and reverse the trend towards increased poverty in our country. The
greater awareness on the part of the country's development partners of the relationship between economic
growth and poverty reduction is in complete harmony with the Govemment's concerns. Indeed, the
poverty problem has for years been among the top priorities of the Central African authorities. Thus, a
National Poverty Alleviation Plan (Plan National de Lutte Contre la Pauvrete, PNLCP) was drawn up
and validated in 1999 in collaboration with the UNDP. This plan is expected to be a great help in
developing our Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (Cadre Strategique de lutte contre la Pauvrete,
CSLP) and should allow the country to benefit quickly from the HIPC initiative and from the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). This past March, we prepared a Statement of Intent regarding
Poverty Alleviation and Medium-Term Economic Policy, which is attached herewith.
11.       The Government intends to prepare its PRSP as quickly as possible, and has already created
the committee that is to oversee it. It will first be necessary to update our knowledge of the social sectors
(education and health, including the AIDS epidemic) as well as of the productive sectors in which growth
can benefit the poorest, i.e., cotton, livestock, forestry, rural transportation and mining. Diagnostic
studies will therefore be prepared for each of these sectors. The second step will be to prepare a draft
PRSP to be presented to the various stakeholders for discussion and opinions. The PRSP would be
finalized only upon completion of this participatory process.
IV Development of Statistics
12.       Effective economic and social policy making requires reliable and timely statistics, which
our unfortunately very weak statistical infrastructure cannot provide. The system is deficient from the
standpoint of resources as well as in its organization, regulation and methodology. With support from
the IMF, we have begun the task of rebuilding our statistics-generating infrastructure, and we have
- 59 -



drawn up a plan for statistics development that must now be implemented. The required measures
involve institutional issues, the technical aspects of information-gathering, data processing and
dissemination, as well as professional training.
13.       At the institutional level, the draft law on statistics has been prepared and will be
submitted to the relevant authorities for approval. This will make it possible to create agencies such
as the National Statistics Council, the Department of Public Finance Studies and Statistics, the
working group on external trade statistics and the Balance of Payments Committee, all of which will
be able to begin operating in accordance with the spirit of the law on statistics and the
recommendations of the plan.
14.       It will also be necessary to improve the sources of statistical data used to create
performance charts and economic forecasts. Human resources in the area of statistics, which are
currently very weak, will also need to be strengthened. Efforts to train and upgrade the skills of
statistical staff will need to be intensified.
V          Strengthening the Ministry of Mining
15.       Efficient exploitation of our mineral resources is expected to stimulate economic growth,
improve the balance of trade and public finances, create jobs and alleviate poverty. This requires a good
sectoral strategy, which will be based on the diagnostic study of mining, which is part of the PRSP. The
development of a strategy for the mining sector will in turn make it possible to revise the Mining Code, a
key element in our efforts to attract foreign investment. We will also need to strengthen the Ministry of
Mines itself, and especially the Mining Directorate and the Valuation Office for Diamond and Gold
(BECDOR).

GOVERNMENT'S DECLARATION OF INTENT
ON ITS POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRATEGY AND MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC
POLICIES
1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past several decades, the economy of the Central African Republic, like those of most
sub-Saharan countries, has experienced enormous difficulties due to:
-     erratic changes in prices for its primary exports, i.e., wood, cotton and coffee;
-      imprudent budgetary and monetary policies that have caused inflation and a loss of competitiveness
and worsened the country's internal and external imbalances;
-     an increase in external debt resulting simultaneously from poor management of development
projects financed by loans and from the monetary and foreign exchange policies of wealthy
countries, and their impacts on interest rates;
-     an inefficient public administration and poor governance..
These negative factors caused a 0.9% decline in real GDP over the 1 980s and an increase in poverty.
Structural adjustment programs carried out in the mid 1 980s with the help of the Bretton Woods
Institutions, as well as the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, resulted in a reversal of the downward
slide in economic indicators. However, the three mutinies that the country has experienced since 1996,
with their attendant destruction and looting of production facilities, have dealt a harsh blow to structural
and macroeconomic reforms that had been undertaken starting in 1993.
Faced with this extremely serious situation, the Government decided to resolve its sociopolitical problems
by renewing its relationship with the Bretton Woods Institutions and by negotiating a return to peace with
the help of the international community.
Initial results obtained towards the end of 1999 indicate that the Central African economy is once again on
the road to sustainable growth, as a result of reforms underway in public finance management and the
Government's economic policies, and thanks to structural reforms involving the privatization of viable
public enterprises and the strengthening of the financial system.
However, these encouraging results cannot conceal the many challenges still facing Central African
authorities, including:
-  the low level of per capita GDP;
-  the fragile nature of the country's political stability and public security;
-  the excessive volume of debt;
- problems of governance (e.g., corruption, etc.);
-  lack of control over world prices for the main export products;
-  the country's landlocked location and its inadequacy communications infrastructure;
- the deteriorating infrastructures and declining quality of social services, such as health and education;
and
-  the AIDS epidemic.
- 62 -



The growing awareness on the part of the CAR's development partners of the relationship between growth
and poverty alleviation is entirely in harnony with the Government's own concerns. Indeed, the
phenomenon of poverty has for years been among the top priorities of the Central African authorities. For
this reason, a National Poverty Alleviation Plan was developed and validated in 1999 with help from the
UNDP.
This achievement should be a great help to us in developing our Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and
should put CAR ahead of other African countries in obtaining quick assistance under the HIPC initiative
and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
2.    PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSTIC OF POVERTY IN CAR
2.1. BACKGROUND ANALYSIS
The phenomenon of poverty has always preoccupied the Central African authorities, who have always been
concerned with reducing it. Various economic and social policies have been pursued to this end, but results
have not been satisfactory.
The standard of living is steadily deteriorating in the Central African Republic and places severe limits on
the country's prospects and options for harmonious development.
Most studies of poverty in the Central African Republic confirm the situation unambiguously: 49% of the
nation's population, and 57,3% of its rural dwellers, are affected by poverty. Women, young job-seekers,
children aged 0-5 years, handicapped persons and the socially disadvantaged are most affected by the
phenomenon.
From an economic standpoint, the real GDP growth rate has fallen from 7.2% in 1995 to -4.1% in 1996,
fiscal revenues have declined by 35% and budgetary expenditures by 25%. The attendant worsening of the
primary fiscal balance has resulted in large internal and external debt arrears, and in a loss of credibility for
the country. The consequences have been bad for economic growth as well as for poverty alleviatiori, given
the poor performance of the Government's budgetary policy, which resulted in a negative fiscal balance
(excluding interest and externally-financed investments) between 1995 and 1997. Regarding social welfare,
conditions are as follows:
in education, the gross primary enrollment ratio is 68%, with 127 pupils per class; a teacher/pupil
ratio of 1:95; an attrition rate of 53.4% ; and a net primary enrollment ratio of 53.8%. The
respective ratios for boys and girls are 61.6% and 45.4%. The geographic distribution of these
ratios indicates that 74% of school children are in cities and 41.2% in rural areas.
At the secondary level, the ratio stands at only 6.3% for the whole of the country: 7.5% for boys
and 5.1 % for girls.
The average literacy rate for persons aged 10 years and over is 46.6%: 60.6% for men and 33.3%
for women. This indicator ranges from 75.8% in the capital, Bangui, to 55.4% in other cities and
33.1% in the countryside.
In the health sector, life expectancy at birth is low, at 49.5 years, and the rate of maternal mortality
is high (948 per 100,000 births), as is infant mortality (97 per 1000 births). Forty-five per cent of
-63 -



the population lives within five kilomreters of a health care facility. There is one physician for
every 21,342 inhabitants, one midwife for every 16,000 inhabitants, one hospital bed for every 800
people and a rate of HIV/AIDS infection of 15% in Bangui, 8% in secondary cities and 4% in the
countryside. Finally, only 30.6% of the population has access to potable water and only 26.6% of
households are equipped with adequate sanitary facilities.
-     As for employment, joblessness affects about 50% of those under the age of 25, of whom 46.6%
have never attended school. Of the latter, 60% are girls.
All the figures mentioned above and in the appendices reflect the precariousness of the human and social
welfare situation in CAR, and are manifested in other ways within the various groups, sectors and zones
affected by poverty. Given the extent of the problem as described above, the Government has begun to
develop a National Poverty Alleviation Plan that incorporates objectives and strategies for reducing
poverty.
2.2. MEASURES TAKEN
After the World Summit on Social Development, the Central African authorities undertook to draw up a
National Poverty Alleviation Plan using a participatory approach..
The process included the following steps:
*     The development of a diagnostic audit, in order to measure the extent and the manifestations of
poverty. This audit included the following five sectoral studies:
i)    a study of the circumstances required for participatory development;
ii)    a study of development activities geared to women;
iii)    a study of the social integration and re-integration of young people and socially
marginalized groups;
iv)    a study of the conditions required to develop (with local resources) productive
employment based on highly labor-intensive works; and -
v)    a study of micro-finance.
the organization of local and regional workshops aimed at mobilizing all stakeholders in
development. In this connection, twenty (20) local and six (6) regional workshops were held in
rural areas. The main goals of these workshops were to disseminate the results of the diagnostic
studies and to organize a participatory planning process with the populace based on the
Accelerated Participatory Research Method (Methode Aceler&e de la Recherche participative), in
order to identify the basic building blocks of a poverty alleviation plan at the local and regional
levels.
development of the National Poverty Alleviation Plan (NPAP). Based on the results and relevance
of the various studies performed and other available information, a National Poverty Alleviation
Plan was drawn up that defined primary strategic themes, implementation measures and the main
monitoring and evaluation tools.
a validation seminar, the aim of which was to gamer support for this plan, and foster popular
ownership and implementation of it. A national validation and acceptance seminar was organized
to generate consensus concerning the document.
- 64 -



The other steps -- the passage of a law setting out the plan's goals, a donors' round table, and the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NPAP - have not yet been carried out. At this stage, new
requirements, including the need to take into account the "rapid, sustainable and lasting growth" aspects of
poverty alleviation, are causing the Govemment to review the measures to be taken.
3.  FROM THE NATIONAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PLAN TO THE NEW POVERTY
REDUCTION STRATEGY PAPER:
In order to combat CAR's endemic poverty effectively, the Government will continue to emphasize
coherent and dynamic structural adjustment programs aimed at stimulating rapid and sustainable economic
growth. Particular emphasis will be placed on cultivating a stable political and social climate, building
skills and developing human resources, and promoting the emergence of dynamic entrepreneurs.
To this end, the measures to be implemented must encourage savings and private investment, production
and job creation, improved access to basic social services, good govemance and responsible management of
public resources, and the integration of the poor into the production process.
Measures aimed at drawing up a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper will be carried out in a participatory
manner. Indeed, wider participation by civil society in the development, acceptance and monitoring of the
poverty strategy will enhance its implementation.
3.1. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
Given the extent of poverty in CAR, the Government is committed to pursuing general, as well as to more
specific, objectives.
3.1.1. General objectives include:
-     improving the well-being of the people of the Central African Republic;
-     promoting sustainable and equitable growth.
3.1.2. Specific objectives include:
In the macro-economic and financial areas:
a new style of development administration based on good governance, decentralization, political
stability and democracy;
an annual economic growth rate of at least 5 %, annual inflation of about 2% and an investment
rate equivalent to at least 17% of GDP;
maintenance of external imbalances and the volume of external debt at levels compatible with the
macro-economic objectives mentioned earlier.
These macro-economic andfinancial objectives wil be periodically refined and updated during
reviews conducted by IMF and World Bank missions, and in collaboration with other multilateral and
bilateral donors.
As regards the socio-economic well-being of the population, objectives include:
- 65 -



a reduction in the incidence of monetary poverty from 49% in 2000 to 34% in 2005 to 27% by
2015;
an increase in life expectancy at birth from 49 years in 2000 to 55 years in 2005 and at least 65
years by 2015;
a reduction in maternal mortality from 948 per 100,000 births in 2000 to 700 in 2005 and 500 by
2015;
a reduction in infant mortality from 97 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 70 in 2005 and 50 by 2015;
an increase in gross primary school enrollment rate from 68% in 2000 to 80% in 2005 and 90% by
2015;
an increase in the proportion of the population with access to potable water from 30 % in 2000 to
50 % in 2005 and to at least 75% by 2015; and
promotion of campaigns against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and locally endemic, highly contagious,
diseases.
3.1.3. Main strategic themes
In order to attain the ambitious goals outlined above, the Government of the Central African Republic
intends to base its strategy on the following main themes:
-     improvement of the statistical data system and exploitation of that system to design, implement and
evaluate economic policies;
-     better management of public finances and strict control over public expenditures in order to
increase the level of public savings and the share allocated to social sectors such as basic
education, primary health care, and AIDS and malaria prevention efforts;
-     employment promotion through highly labor-intensive works;
-     promotion of grassroots savings, development of mutualist savings and loan systems, and increased
access for women and young people to micro-credit for their own development projects;
-     coherent development of human resources and of production factors, by means of a dynamic
regional development policy characterized by the expansion of village-level hydraulic
infrastructures, rural electrification, and the equitable distribution of educational and health care
infrastructures in the countryside and in disadvantaged urban areas;
-     introduction of decentralized administrative and political structures with a view to strengthening
democratic institutions, encouraging good governance and fostering greater popular participation in
the management of publicly-financed activities.
3.2. STEPS INVOLVED IN PREPARING THE PRSP
Based on the above-described process, the Government will endeavor to revise the NPAP in order to
establish a close linkage between interventions intended to bring about substantial poverty alleviation and
those aimed at strong economic growth.
- 66 -



3.2.1. Timetable
The planned actions will include:
*  the creation of a steering committee responsible for supervising and coordinating
activities associated with the transition from the NPAP to the PRSP;
* the recruitment of national and international consultants to perform a certain number
of additional studies aimed at improving the stite of knowledge of the mechanisms
of poverty in the Central African Republic and of possible remedies;
*  a revision of the NPAP, which will occur in phases, as follows:
i) updating of data in the NPAP;
ii) additional sectoral studies;
iii) integration of the NPAP into a macro-economic and financial
framework and a coherent program of structural reform.
*  local and regional workshops organized to raise the public's awareness and mobilize
its support through participatory tactics, and to collect opinions and suggestions
concerning proposed revisions to the NPAP;
*  a national consensus-building workshop on the revised document, the goal of which
will be to validate the PRSP by democratic means;
*  lobbying for the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the PRSP.
3.2.2. Implementation and monitoring/evaluation of the PRSP
The PRSP will, by replacing the Policy Framework Paper, become the sole
design reference for cooperation programs involving the Central African
Republic and its main development partners. It will therefore be appended to that
document and will serve as the matrix of economic policies and structural
reforms covering all interventions planned by the Government in connection with
the latter's stated objectives as well as their associated implementation
timeframes. Revisions to this matrix will occur during periodic review missions
carried out by the Bretton Wood Institutions and other donors.
The PRSP will also be the point of departure for the Bretton Woods Institutions' HIPC
initiative and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. In order to ensure rigorous
monitoring of economic and social performance indicators, a National Technical
Monitoring Committee and regional and local PRSP committees will be created, to be
followed by the creation of an institute to monitor poverty (Observatoire National de
Lutte contre la Pauvrete). The experience to be acquired by the National Technical
Monitoring Committee during the development of the PRSP could be put to good use if
that committee were transformed into a National PRSP Monitoring Committee. The
Technical Monitoring Committee thus created would be the operational arm of the
Observato ire de lutte contre la pauvretei which is to be created and placed under the
oversight of the Ministry of Planning.
