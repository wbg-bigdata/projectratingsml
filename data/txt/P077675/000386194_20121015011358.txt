                                 This indicator lacked specificity as to which planning standards or
                                 guidelines were to be adopted. However, based on the experience of the 4
                                 hospitals that the project supported, a new organizational model for
Comments                         hospitals has been prepared and decreed. A number of other guidelines
                                 have been adopted including the IT Guidelines on Investments; Clinical
                                 Pathways Guidelines; Human Resources Plan, these are discussed under

                                  The target of no arrears was not achieved. This was an indicator outside

                                  arrears in health care facilities not just the 4 project supported hospitals.

2.     At the time of project appraisal, the Republic of Serbia was still part of the two
member state union of Serbia and Montenegro that came into being in 2003 (and later
peacefully dissolved in 2006) 1 2. In 2002, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
was estimated at $2,200, and poverty affected about 14.6 percent of the population. The
country has had years of political stability and, until the recent economic crisis (which led
to a drop in real GDP of 3.5% in 2009), economic stability that had led to economic
growth and reduction in poverty through strong increases in incomes. In 2010 Serbia had
a GDP per capita of approximately US$5,150. According to the latest Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), the government is committed to fiscal discipline, further
economic reforms and to European Union (EU) accession 3.

3.      Despite the difficult conditions that existed in the 1990s, vital health
indicators did not show adverse regression in health status during this time. A study
conducted by UNICEF showed that childhood mortality rates continued to decline and
infant mortality stood at 11.23 deaths per 1000 live births in 2000. In 2003, life
expectancy at birth stood at 69.8 years for men and 74.5 years for women. A significant
proportion of morbidity and mortality was due to chronic illness such as heart disease,
strokes and cancer, with smoking being responsible for 30% of mortality in the country.
Access to basic services such as improved drinking water and sanitary disposal of human
waste was universal.

4.      On the other hand, the Serbian health care system showed characteristics of
high inefficiencies that jeopardized macroeconomic stability. The system, like many
others in the region, was budgeted using an input based system creating overcapacities
and large inefficiencies. The Serbian health care system was, and is still, financed
through a combination of public (through the Serbia Health Insurance Fund (HIF)
financed by compulsory social insurance) and private out of pocket financing. At
appraisal, public spending on health stood at 6% of GDP and was among the highest in
the region, and total health expenditure stood at 11% of GDP, a figure that was regionally
comparatively higher and close to that in high income countries. On the other hand,
Serbia had an advantage over other countries in the region by having a public health
financing system that was funded by mandatory contributions to the HIF and not from the

budget and hence having some experience in contracting providers for health care
services. However, this system of financing was facing serious challenges including:
administrative complexity and inefficiency from separate contribution laws and revenue
collection; existence of non independent branches of the HIF; and poor financial
performance, which threatened the fiscal sustainability of the HIF. HIF’s expenditures
could have been better managed by providing incentives to providers to increase
efficiency and pay closer attention to pharmaceuticals prescriptions patterns. The sector
also suffered from other inefficiencies including over-capacity in the hospital sector
compared to utilization and also a monopoly and poorly controlled pharmaceuticals
sector. The other area that was at that time considered out of sync with a well performing
health sector was the need to look at the level of entitlements in the package of benefits
which, for example, included treatment abroad and needed to be brought in line with
available resources.

5.       In 2002, the Government prepared a Health Care Statement which indicated
directions to be pursued in reforming the health sector, and were the basis for the
World Bank support through the SHP. The Statement included the following guiding
principles: (i) organization of the health care delivery system into functional levels that
ensure affordable and effective service; (ii) equal availability and access to basic health
care services for all citizens and financial coverage for these services from the HIF; (iii)
basic health care services to be selected on the basis of cost-effectiveness; (iv) high
priority to be placed on preventive and primary health care services; (v) increased
involvement of the private profit and nonprofit sector in the delivery of HIF-financed
health care; (vi) the HIF to continue to be the main resource base for the financing of
health care, with an expansion of the role of supplementary health insurance and private
insurance schemes; (vii) development of a master plan that will categorize health care
institutions as a step towards decentralized planning, management and delivery of health
services; (viii) separation of the role of users, payers and providers; and (ix) promotion of
quality and monitoring of services and facilities through a quality assurance and licensing
system.

6.      The proposed project had strong links with Country Partnership Strategy.
At appraisal the Bank’s strategic program with Serbia and Montenegro was outlined in
the 2001 (updated 2002) Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) which had four
development objectives: (i) restoring macroeconomic stability and external balance; (ii)
stimulating near-term growth and creating the basis for a sustainable supply response;
(iii) improving the social well-being of the most vulnerable and building human capacity;
(iv) improving governance and building effective institutions. The health investment
project aimed to influence objectives (iii) and (iv). The project aimed to contribute to
improvements in social well being of the most vulnerable, building human capacity and
effective institutions, and improving governance. The objectives of project fitted well
with the overall strategic program to assist the GOS in its economic development
program. The design of the project in terms of the areas it aimed to tackle carefully
reflected areas in need of investments and capacity building in order to reduce
inefficiencies in the system.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The original project development objective according to the main text of the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to assist the Borrower to build capacity to
develop a sustainable, performance oriented health care system where providers were
rewarded for quality and efficiency and where health insurance coverage ensured access
to affordable and effective care. And according to the Development Credit Agreement:
“the objective of the Project was to build capacity to develop a sustainable, performance-
oriented health care system by restructuring health care services and improving financing,
management and decision making in the Serbian health care system? 4.

8.       The key performance indicators were: (i) reduction in arrears, reduction in bed
numbers and average length of stay; increase in hospital bed occupancy; reduction in
flows of patients from the area to tertiary care; increase in use of primary care and
outpatient services in the four general hospitals participating in the project; (ii) HIF and
Ministry of Health (MOH) increase the number of staff trained in health policy, health
finance, or health management, and use their skills in review of the basic benefits
package, the public/private mix in health services, resource allocation and provider
payment systems; and a critical mass of these staff remain in post; (iii) MOH, with input
from other relevant Serbian health sector agencies, monitors and analyzes at least
annually the revenue, expenditure and arrears of the HIF and public health care
institutions; the distribution of HIF expenditure per capita in different areas and among
vulnerable and other population groups (taking account of risk factors); and out-of-pocket
expenditure on health by the population; and (iv) MOH, with input from other relevant
Serbian health sector agencies, publishes regular analytical reports on the performance of
the health system and health sector institutions, using data from enhanced health
information systems, and using the WHO World Health Report 2000 categories and local
measures.

9.      Performance indicators that were negotiated and included in the
Supplemental Letter #2 included the following indicators: (i) Hospital master plan and
planning standards and guidelines adopted; (ii) Contracts and payment methods for
hospitals participating in the project provide improved incentives for efficiency and
quality of care, are consistent with restructuring plans and avoid perverse incentives, (iii)
policy and plan adopted for financing, resource allocation and provider payment methods
for public health services, with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of disease
prevention and health promotion; (iv) New Central HIS information system for Serbia in
use and metadata bases in use to allow coherent approach to HIS development; local
integrated HIS used by management in all participating health institutions in four areas of
Serbia.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.    The PDO was not revised during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.    The main beneficiaries identified in the PAD were: (i) the general public, the
MOH, health providers, and opinion leaders; (ii) people currently eligible for publicly
financed healthcare services; health care providers; (iii) the poor, who were most likely to
not seek care because of inability to pay; (iv) health care providers, plus patients who
may be less likely to be pressed for informal payment; and (v) the public, and the GOS.

12.     The main benefits expected from the project were: (i) availability of reliable
data on a variety of health system indicators such as performance measurement, health
expenditures and public health which increases the level of confidence in the quality of
care provided and the viability of the publicly financed system; (ii) improvements in
provider payment methods, to encourage providers to provide higher quality health
services, leading to improved health outcomes; (iii) increased revenue for the HIF
targeted for vulnerable groups relative to out-of-pocket payments; (iv) improved financial
position of hospitals due to rationalized services; and (v) more informed and engaged
public feeling empowered to contribute to health reform rather than to merely be affected
by it.

1.5 Original Components

13.      Component 1: Health Services Restructuring (US$13.0 million of total
projects costs).        The objective of this component was to build capacity for
implementation of restructuring of health services delivery so as to improve efficiency
while maintaining quality: to support initial stages of implementation of short-term
restructuring initiatives focused on general hospitals and related health services in four
areas. This component had sub-components as follows: (i) master-planning and
integration of the public health system into restructuring in the four regional restructuring
initiatives; (ii) restructuring in the Kraljevo demonstration site; and (iii) restructuring of
health services in Valjevo, Vranje and Zrenjanin. The restructuring part of the support
included hospital building renovations and purchase of equipment.

14.     Component 2: Health Finance, Policy and Management (US$8.9 million of
total project costs). The objective of this component was to support policy development
and build capacity for analysis, decision-making, health financing, health system
regulation and reform implementation in the MOH, HIF, the Institute of Public Health
(IPH), and Serbian health sector regulatory agencies, and to support this with information
systems development. This component had five (5) sub-components as follows: (i) basic
benefits package and provider payment systems; (ii) financing of public health services;



                                              4
(iii) licensing and accreditation; (iv) health information systems; and (v) MOH capacity-
building and communication.

15.     Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.5
million of total project costs). The objective of this component was to ensure that
project outputs were delivered on time and within budget and oriented towards achieving
project outcomes effectively. Risks were to be identified and risk management strategies
put in place and that project performance was subject to monitoring, audit and evaluation
so as to ensure that objectives were achieved and lessons learnt for future health reforms.
This component was to support: (a) the establishment of a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) to prepare, implement, and coordinate activities of the health investment project;
and (b) to finance monitoring, evaluation and audits. The PCU was expected to take
responsibility for production of routine six-monthly project reports and quarterly
financial management reports. The Credit provided resources for annual and final project
audits, and also for commissioning expert advice on monitoring and evaluation of project
activities.

1.6 Revised Components

16.      The project was restructured in 2005. Main changes to the project were: All
project components were revised when the project was restructured in June 2005 (see
paragraphs 17-19). The scope and number of activities were streamlined and rationalized
without changing the development objectives, the general architecture of the project and
the total budget (please refer to the Implementation Report of June 27, 2005). The main
revisions to project components also included changes in estimated costs for some
activities; and the introduction of some changes on procurement methods, (Schedule 3 of
the Credit Agreement, i.e. introduction of National Competitive Bidding procedures for
civil works and elimination of the two-stage bidding procedures for information
technology equipment).

The three components were restructured as follows:

17.    Component 1: Health Services restructuring (US$10.5 million of total project
costs). The component was restructured to improve efficiency and quality in service
delivery and build up management capacity in four general hospitals (Kraljevo, Valjevo,
Zrenjanin and Vranje). The component still had three sub-components which were better
defined, with rehabilitation limited to 3 out of the 4 hospitals as originally planned,
(excluding Vranje due to larger than anticipated scope of civil works). The revised
component had 3 sub-components: (i) site reconfiguration, (ii) provision of medical
equipment, and (iii) support to the definition, planning and gradual implementation of
key measures to increase performance, control operating costs and improve quality of
services provided, and waste management. In addition, previously unallocated amounts
were directed towards The Institute of Virusology, Vaccines and Serums (Torlak) to
support the reconstruction of its flu vaccine production line.




                                            5
18.     Component 2: Health Finance, Policy and Management and Quality
Improvement (US$8.2 million of total project costs). The component was restructured
by streamlining some activities, changing estimated costs for activities under the
component as well as changing procurement methods for some items. The component
aimed to support policy development and build capacity for analysis, decision-making,
health financing, health system regulation and reform implementation in the MOH, HIF
and IPH. First, it aimed to assist in building the capacity of MOH and the HIF to develop
and implement measures to improve health financing. Second, it aimed to help the early
stages of establishing licensing and accreditation bodies, support the development of
health technology assessment-HTA and of Continued Medical Education (CME). Third,
in coordination with other partners (notably the European Agency for Reconstruction
(EAR), it aimed to help develop ICT services to enable health sector stakeholders to use
and share a common set of medical and health related data that meet relevant European
and International standards. Fourth, the component aimed to help build the capacity of
MOH in the areas of policy development and planning and public relations and
communications.

19.     Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.3
million of total project costs). The restructuring for this component involved changes to
the total cost of activities under this component which was revised upwards reflecting
costs of technical assistance and training. The component had two sub-components: (i)
project coordination and fiduciary tasks of procurement and financial management, and
(ii) monitoring, evaluation and audits.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.     An Additional Financing (AF) of Euro 10.5 million (US$13.5 Million
equivalent) to the project was approved on March 19, 2009 with a closing date of
December 31, 2011. The AF was in accordance with Guidelines for Additional
Financing (OB/BP 13.20). With the AF, the PDO remained the same. The additional
financing was to scale up financing for activities that would contribute to the
effectiveness and financial sustainability of the health system, and specifically to assist
the Government in implementation of a case based payment system. The AF was to fund
the provision of: (i) management information technologies (hardware and software) for
hospitals and the Health Insurance Fund (HIF); (ii) technical assistance to hospitals, the
HIF, and MOH to support institutional and management reforms both for the sector and
hospital level so that hospitals can react to the new financial incentives set by case-based
payment systems such as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) and eventually improve
hospital productivity and efficiency, and (iii) technical assistance to support monitoring
and evaluation of the payment reform within hospitals and the HIF in order to evaluate
and adjust the impact of the payment change and to prevent adverse effects and cost
escalations.

21.    The AF impacted mostly activities under Component 2 (Health Finance,
Policy and Management and Quality Improvement). In particular sub-component 2.1
(Health Finance), sub-component 2.2 (Quality Improvement), sub-component 2.3 (Health



                                             6
Information System) and sub-component 2.4 (Capacity Building and Communication of
the MOH).

22.    The AF brought in additional KPIs. Progress towards achievement of
development objectives supported by the AF was to be monitored using the following
key performance indicators: (i) Standards and guidelines are used to make decisions on
investments in information technology, (ii) Ministry of Health safeguards quality of
services by introducing internationally certified Clinical Practice Guidelines for Clinical
Pathways, and (iii) Ministry of Health publishes regular review of performance of
hospitals. These are presented in the Results Framework Analysis.

23.     The Results Framework evolved over time. The PDO never changed through
restructuring or additional financing. The results framework was not formally changed in
the 2005 restructuring. In 2008/2009, the results framework was informally refined to
correct some deficiencies in the original framework; these changes were only
communicated through an Aide Memoire and not through a credit agreement amendment.
The applicable indicators are therefore the original key performance indicators as defined
in the Supplemental Letter No. 2 of the Minutes of Negotiations together with those
added with the approval of the AF. The 2008/2009 ‘refined’ indicators were the ones
used for monitoring progress during implementation. The difference between the official
indicators and the refined indicators are individually discussed in the results framework
analyses. In some cases the differences are minor, in some cases the original indicators
were not tracked at all.

24.     Credit closing dates were revised. The closing date of the Credit was extended
four times for a total of 22 months: (i) from February 28, 2008 to August 30, 2008 (six
months); (ii) to February 28, 2009 (six months), (iii) to August 28, 2009 (six months),
and (iv) December 28, 2009 (four months).

25.     The first extension was granted to allow time for: (i) renovation of the vaccine
production unit of Torlak Institute; (ii) review and finalization of the Health Sector
Configuration Strategy; and (iii) completion of the analysis of options for hospital
payment reform. The second extension was approved to allow time for: (i) technical
discussions for the Additional Financing Loan to be upgraded to Negotiations; and (ii)
the Additional Financing Loan to be approved by the Bank Board (March 19, 2009). The
third and fourth extensions were approved to allow for the financing agreement of the
Additional Financing to become affective (October 15, 2009) and a short overlap with the
start-up of activities to avoid the loss of momentum between the two operations.

26.    The additional financing was expected to close in December 2011, but the credit
closing date was extended to March 30, 2012 to allow for completion of IT activities and
most importantly to allow for quality assurance and due diligence in final delivery of IT
networks, hardware and software. At the time of writing this ICR disbursements
amounted to 97% of AF proceeds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR team rates design and quality at entry as Moderately Unsatisfactory on the basis
of analysis of the following features:

27.     Soundness of background analyses: This was the first Bank supported standalone
health project in Serbia, its preparation was supported through a US$500,000 PHRD
grant (TF051137). The preparation of the project benefitted from the experience of earlier
operations that supported activities in the sector, especially the Social Protection
Economic Assistance Grant (SPEAG) co financed with the Government of Canada which
had supported activities across Ministry of Social Affairs; Labor and Employment and
Health. The outcome of the project in the area of health was rated satisfactory. According
to the ICR for SPEAG, while activities in the health component of the project did not
focus on policy reforms, the technical assistance was important in shaping reforms of the
health system and supported the preparation of the subsequent health project as well as
other operations that had health sector activities such as the Sector Adjustment Credit
(SOSAC). Preparation also benefitted from the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) basic health services pilot project in Kraljevo (2000-2004) that provided
information on information system development and tobacco use. So while this was the
first health sector only operation the project team did have experiences from other
operations to draw on.

28.     Assessment of project design: Various alternatives for investments in the sector
were properly considered before the team settled on the design of the project. The team
took into account the resource envelope and the large needs of the sector, and decided to
settle on a project that would have a large capacity building component that was needed
in order for long term effects in the sector to really have an effect. The team settled on
health financing challenges facing the sector based on the importance of financial
sustainability and the large inefficiencies that had to be addressed. The team also
considered addressing specific diseases such as HIV/AIDS and TB; challenges in the
pharmaceutical sector as well as medical education and emergency medicine, and decided
not to include these since these were covered by other donors.

29.      Soundness of the assessment as to what the needs of the sector were was sound,
however, the design of components and the whole organization of the project were
lacking. The component activities were quite complex and the degree of realism was low,
and the expectations were quite high for that time in the history of the country. Project
activities required a high degree of innovation in a sector that was still growing its
capacity within the implementing agency.

30.   The degree of Government commitment during preparation and appraisal
was quite high, though the political reality, including a volatile political environment,
was not factored into the design of the project. Counterparts showed a level of
commitment that was demonstrated in the many meetings that the project team and



                                            8
management had with the Government. It is clear, however, that the political
environment and processes at the time of preparation and appraisal were not adequately
factored in to inform the design of the project and to inform the risks to the pace of
implementation of the project once the project was approved. In some aspects, project
implementation plans were secondary to the primary goal of securing funding for the
project. No mitigation measures were put in place to address issues such as change in
Ministerial leadership.

31.   The project preparation team requested a Quality Enhancement Review
whose meeting was held in January 2003. The Report made a number of
recommendations which were addressed by the Bank team as described in an email dated
March 2003. For discussion see Section 5.1.

2.2 Implementation

32.    The ICR team rates overall implementation as Satisfactory. The project was
successful in delivering most of the outputs under the four components and achieving its
expected outcomes (see data sheet, section 3.2 and annex 2). The initial phase of project
implementation, the years prior to 2006, was largely rated unsatisfactory both for PDO
and IP; though there was marked improvement after the June 2005 restructuring (see
Data Sheet section G). Implementation was successful in many ways, for example,
actions taken to restructure the project and respond to some aspects of procurement
challenges; firm commitment of the Government towards the PDO was instrumental in
moving implementation forward and the quality of MOH and PCU staff that were
responsive to challenges encountered.

Implementation was however less successful in a number of areas as follows:

33.      Three months after project effectiveness in October 2003, the project team
rated progress towards achievement of the PDO as Unsatisfactory. The following
were the reasons: (i) In August 2003, approximately two months after the project was
signed, at a crucial phase for the project, The Minister of Health as well as most assistants
to the Minister resigned, seriously affecting implementation due to lack MOH leadership.
This was also a period of uncertain political environment whereby most counterparts in
the HIF and directors of hospitals in four pilot regions supported by the project were
expected to change; (ii) Uncertainty created by the likelihood of a change in policy
direction after the appointment of a new Minister of Health; (iii) Delays in the
appointment of project working groups and no activities by the Project steering
committee, basically a PCU without authority. In this environment, implementation
preceded slowly, disbursement reached only 5 percent by June 2005 versus an expected
20 percent. The U rating for IP lasted until June 2004 when it was upgraded to
Satisfactory, only to be downgraded to Unsatisfactory in December 2004 due to very
little progress in implementation, resignation of the PCU Director (and 9 months without
PCU leadership) and weak project management. All aspects of project management
(apart from financial management), i.e. meeting procurement schedule; financial
performance, monitoring and evaluation, etc, were unsatisfactory at this time.



                                             9
34.     It was at the end 2004, about 14 months after effectiveness, that the lack of
implementation progress triggered the decision for restructuring. In addition to the
above, the project experienced significant delays caused by structural/design factors that
were noted as reasons for the restructuring in June 2005. One, the project as approved
was ambitious. Not only was the project not clear on definitions of activities to be
implemented, it also lacked an implementation strategy and lacked consistency between
and among components. Two, at credit effectiveness, the overall strategy for the IT
investments was not in place and the Terms of Reference (TOR) for key activities were
not ready. Three, delays in hiring key personnel for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
further stalled initiation of activities. For example, the PCU coordinator was not in place
until months after, this in turn delayed the appointment of staff needed to support health
financing and quality assurance activities. It was also noted that PCU-MOH coordination
was poor and that planning, reporting and monitoring of activities was still weak at this
early stage of implementation.

35.     The project restructuring improved project implementation significantly.
Together with other efforts by the MOH to improve management of the project, a year
after restructuring, and all major aspects of implementation were satisfactory apart from
monitoring and evaluation which up to this point had received a limited amount of
attention.

36.     The mid-term review (MTR) was originally planned for September 2005, but
due to initial delays in implementation, took place a year later in September 2006 5.
The MTR noted that following project restructuring, project implementation had
significantly accelerated and therefore disbursements had increased considerably.
Disbursement and commitments had speeded up, and by October 2006, 46.5 percent of
the total IDA credit had been disbursed and US$5.4 million had been contracted with a
projection of 90 percent of the credit proceeds committed by end of 2006. An area that
was still unsatisfactory was monitoring and evaluation which the project team and
management acknowledged as being a challenging area given the paucity of data needed
to provide a meaningful baseline and to monitor achievements 6 . This area was later
addressed by the refinement of indicators 7.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.     The ICR team found the design of the M&E as weak. This ICR review finds
that key performance indicators as described in the PAD was not a good reflection of the
PDO, with a number of indicators aiming to measure achievements that were outside the

scope of the project. Moreover, baselines were not identified, baseline data was not
readily available and there was little indication of how much of the gaps could be
obtained further down the implementation calendar. Project documents show that key
performance indicators needed to be more closely connected to project components, and
again, to have indicators that were realistic in the expectation of project outcomes. The
original M&E design for the project did not include baseline or target values for outcome
or output indicators, and in most cases these had to be inferred.

38.     Implementation and utilization of M&E framework was very limited. For the
larger portion of project implementation, M&E indicators were not used because there
was no baseline information and given all the structural deficiencies in project design,
there were no initiation of activities to address this deficiency until much later in
implementation. While the 2005 project restructuring did not change the PDO, outcome
indicators were reduced in numbers but no baseline or target values were identified and
no strategy was put in place to amend this deficiency soon after. In 2008/2009, the team
addressed this lack of baseline and target values and refined output indicators, which the
team continued to use for supervision and tracking implementation progress. With the
approval of additional financing to the project in 2009, another set of outcome and output
indicators were introduced to the project, these had baseline and target values and were
used for monitoring of the project going forward.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.     The environmental category of the project at the time of appraisal was B; the
project preparation team envisaged that the project will have a positive
environmental impact through improvements in infection control and safety within
hospitals. All facilities supported by the project were expected to adopt new national
standards and guidelines consistent with EC requirements including fire, medical
radiation, hazardous chemicals and biomedical waste. The midterm review and
supervision reports noted that safeguards compliance was satisfactory. A mission
undertaken for the purpose of ICR preparation visited two hospitals that received support
from the project and a review with hospital management shows that standards and
guidelines were complied with. In addition, the new standards for medical waste
collection and disposal have now been supported for wider introduction around the
country by two EU projects that support similar activities at all levels of health care
delivery.

40.     Procurement: After the deficiencies in fiduciary management noted earlier in
implementation, by and large, compliance with procurement, financial management and
disbursement and auditing for the project has been satisfactory. Project records show that
procurement was unsatisfactory from mid 2004 to mid 2005 when it was rated
moderately satisfactory. Procurement was satisfactorily managed by the PCU which was
staffed by a full time Procurement Officer with 6 years of procurement experience that
complies with Bank procurement rules. The PCU regularly updated procurement plans
and management of procurement processes, even for complex items, was overall
satisfactory.



                                           11
41.     Financial Management: Similarly the PCU was also staffed with qualified staff
in this area; and financial management has been satisfactory with proper management of
records, internal controls to enable timely preparation of financial reports and annual
financial statements. Project files show that FM was unsatisfactory during the same
period of unsatisfactory procurement performance, showing that this was a temporary
period of overall unsatisfactory project management.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.     Ongoing Bank supported activities in the sector and transitional
arrangements. Currently the Bank continues to support the sector (investments and
dialogue) through the multi-sector DILS Project (which is scheduled to close in
December 31, 2012). The DILS PDO is to increase the capacity of institutional actors and
beneficiaries in order to improve access to, and the efficiency, equity and quality of local
delivery of health, education and social protection services, in a decentralizing
environment. For the health sector the project supports decentralization of responsibility
for primary health service delivery which in 2007 was transferred from the state level to
provincial and municipal governments. Implementation of the DILS Project is
coordinated by the same PCU and MOH team that were involved in the implementation
of the SHP. The project ensures the continuation of dialogue in the sector; it provides an
opportunity for the implementation team to remain engaged and also provides for some
continuation of a select group of activities from SHP. Progress towards the achievement
of the DILS PDO is satisfactory.

43.      The Bank-Government of Serbia Partnership Strategy aims to continue
supporting the GOS in its efforts to strengthen the health sector. The 2011 CPS aims
to assist the GOS to improve efficiency and outcomes of social spending. The Bank will
continue to work with other development partners in supporting the GOS to strengthen its
capacity to monitor and evaluate social spending. The Bank will continue to work with
the GOS through a new health project planned for FY13 and which is likely to use the
new Program-for-Results (P4R) lending instrument. There is also a Regional Health
Finance AAA planned for FY14 as well as a third operation in the three series Public
Expenditure Development Policy Loans (PEDPLs) that will further strengthen
Government’s efforts to restrain growth in public sector wages and pension obligations,
while improving public expenditure management. The aim of the PEDPL 3 will be to
reduce the size of Serbia’s large public sector and support reforms that will improve the
efficiency of public spending while mitigating the persistent social impact of the
economic crisis. It is designed to: (i) increase the efficiency of expenditure in the health
and education spending; (ii) strengthen public expenditure and debt management; and
(iii) strengthen social assistance to cushion the impact of the economic crisis and expand
coverage of social assistance programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.     The ICR team rates the relevance of objectives, design, and implementation
arrangements as high. The project’s overall objective remains relevant now as it was at
the time of appraisal. While the country’s health system has seen some improvements in
the last decade during which the project was implemented, several systemic challenges
remain in the health system underscoring that at the time of writing of this ICR, the
objectives of the project remain relevant. The relevance of objectives of the project is
also underscored in the Bank’s own 2007 Health Nutrition and Population Strategy which
prioritizes strengthening health systems 8 . The original project and the additional
financing remain consistent with the FY 2011 CPS for Serbia, which aims to improve
delivery of social services at all levels of Government. The relevance of the AF to the
project is clear in areas of focus of project activities, i.e. on reforms of provider payment
mechanisms at secondary and tertiary hospitals, and complement investments made
through the DILS Project, which supports capitation payment reforms in Primary Health
Care (PHC) level. These are areas that have also been identified by the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), the EC and the ICRC, as areas in need of
support. The areas tackled by the project, though ameliorated by the achievements of this
project, remain major challenges for the sector. At the time of the ICR mission, the PDO
continues to be highly relevant because the health care system: (i) requires continued
reforms to ensure affordable and equal availability and access to basic health care
services for all citizens; (ii) requires more cost-effective services provided in a manner
that ensures quality of health care services; and (iii) needs a financing of health care
model that will ensure fiscal sustainability.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.     The project’s achievement of its objectives is rated Substantial based on the
project achieving almost all of its outcome indicators and because through the project’s
support, capacity to develop a sustainable performance oriented health care system has
been built. The ICR evaluation was based on analyses of outcome and intermediate
indicators and data linked to the development objectives of the project as well as an
evaluation of how project activities were linked to the achievement of the PDO. As will
be demonstrated below, the support of the project has built a solid foundation necessary
for a performance oriented health care system where providers are rewarded for quality
and efficiency and where health insurance coverage ensures access to affordable and
effective care. Achievement of the PDO, that is to assist the Borrower to build capacity to
develop a sustainable, performance oriented health care system where providers are
rewarded for quality and efficiency and where health insurance coverage ensures access
to affordable and effective care, is addressed below.

46.     The project supported investments in analysis, testing and training that led
to the design of a health system that will be based on output models of care
financing, consistent with the Project objectives. This includes capitation for PHC
(supported by DILS) and DRGs for hospitals that was supported by the SHP. The DRG
system is a system that will allow providers of services in hospitals to be paid according
to the types of services that are offered to patients and not on the basis of inputs (e.g. staff,
hospital beds, etc) available in their facilities. In addition to supporting the introduction
of a more efficient system, both the capitation formula for PHC and the DRGs for
hospital care have been designed in a way that a proportion of salaries of health care
providers is directly linked to preventive services provision (quality) and to number of
registered patients and services provided (efficiency).

47.     In support of the development of the new financing system, the Parliament
has adopted MOH Strategy 2010-2015 which endorses these financing reforms. The
project also supported the necessary investments in information technology in the form of
software that will be used in the reporting of services rendered according to DRGs. The
legislation that enables performance based financing in health care is now in place, the
Amended Law on Salaries of Public Servants was adopted by Parliament in Dec 2011.
Together with other accompanying by-laws adopted by the Government in January 2012,
which more closely defines care financing in primary and secondary health care, this
provides the needed conditions for implementation of a performance oriented health care
system. In addition, the project has assisted the government in investing in information
technology, modernizing the information system of health care institutions; and for the
HIF, the project enabled the connection of all its local branches, an important step in
increasing transparency and efficiency of the whole system, both on the provider
payment but also for access to users.

48.    The achievement of the PDO is demonstrated by data on the following indicators
(for more details see the results framework analyses, Section F of the datasheet).

Outcome indicator #1: Hospital master plan and planning standards and guidelines
adopted. The project supported the preparation of a new organizational model for
hospitals which was based on the experience of the 4 hospitals that the project supported.
The project also supported development of a number of guidelines including the IT
Guidelines on Investments; development and introduction of Integrated Plans for Quality
Improvement; Guidelines for reduction of hospital acquired infections; Clinical Pathways
Guidelines; Human Resources Plan which are discussed in the relevant sections below.
Indicators that were added with the approval of the AF, also show that the project did
contribute to the achievement of the PDO. For example, the project supported the
development of standards and guidelines that are used to make decisions on investments
in information technology (AF PDO indicator #1); and the MOH introduces
internationally certified CPGs for clinical pathways (AF PDO indicator #2); and the
project also supported the regular review of performance of hospitals (AF PDO indicator
#3).




                                              14
Outcome indicator #2: Reduction in arrears; reduction in bed numbers and average
length of stay; increase in hospital bed occupancy; reduction in flows of patients from the
area to tertiary care; and increase in use of primary care and outpatient services in the
four general hospitals participating in the project:

49.     The project made satisfactory contribution towards the achievement of a
number of the above KPIs that were intended to measure increasing efficiency of
the health care system. Data show that the number of beds has decreased between 2003
and 2005 and though it increased again in 2010, the overall 2003-2010 trend is one of
decrease. The average length of stay has shown a consistent downward trend from 2003
to 2010, and the mean occupancy rate has increased within the life of the project. Data
also show that the number of hospital discharges has also increased consistently between
2003 and 2010. Health expenditure as a proportion of GDP has remained steady and
seen no significant increase between 2003 and 2010 from 5.3 percent to 5.5 percent. The
one KPI that did not show improvement over the life of the project was the reduction in
arrears held by health care facilities. While the trend was in the right direction between
2003 and 2005 when arrears accumulated over 15 years were paid off, and between 2006
and 2008 which were years of surpluses, this trend reversed in 2010. The lack of
achievement of this KPI is not an indication of unsatisfactory achievement of the PDO
and is more a reflection of an indicator that is out of control of the project and is subject
to economic well-being of the economy as a whole, in reality it is a reflection of a
deficient M&E design or even an overambitious project design that overstated the
objectives of the project.

50.     Other outputs that have contributed to the satisfactory achievement of PDOs
include reconstruction and reconfiguration of large, disconnected and inefficient
hospitals that were supported by the project. For example, the project supported
reconfiguration of buildings housing diagnostic services and reconstruction of a new
Pediatric Department at Kraljevo hospital. The total space of the outpatient polyclinic has
been reduced by about 3000 m2 and three principal buildings of the hospital are now
connected. Similarly in Vranje Hospital, the project supported the connection of ten
wards that were dislocated in ten different and separate buildings; in addition the hospital
had no central surgical block or a central intensive care unit. Valjevo hospital had four
separate hospital sites and in order to decrease costs (for maintenance, utilities, etc) and
increase efficiency (reduce the time required for transport, make services more
accessible), the project supported the reconfiguration of the hospital as well as purchase
of more updated hospital equipment. Work undertaken in Zrenjanin hospital also
involved connecting small and old buildings with an incomplete 10-storey new hospital
that was largely unused. The project’s support led to the completion of the admission
room, pre-delivery room, 4 delivery rooms, post-delivery room, operating theater for C-
sections and patient rooms with 30 beds as well as a neonatology unit for newborns as
well a designated incubators area for prematurely born babies. These and other changes at




                                             15
Kraljevo, have improved patient flows as well as diagnostic support for emergency
services and for PHC 9.

51.    The achievement of the PDO is further demonstrated by data on outputs
related to the following key performance indicators:

i)      Outcome indicator #3: HIF and MOH increase the number of staff trained in
health policy, health finance, or health management, and use their skills in review of the
basic benefits package, the public/private mix in health services, resource allocation and
provider payment systems; and a critical mass of these staff remain in post:

52.      Review of project investments and outputs achieved demonstrate that the
project was successful in creating a HIF and MOH workforce trained in health
policy, health finance and health management that is capable of reviewing the Basic
Benefit Package (BBP), manage resource allocation and designing a new provider
payment system. The project supported the training of over 6, 000 staff between 2004
and 2010; and supported by a Human Resource (HR) policy, the labor force in the health
sector has been rationalized; data show that the number of health sector employees on
Government payroll has continuously been reduced over the life of the project, from
129,506 in 2004 to 114, 432 in 2010. During the life of the project, the HIF has increased
the percent of the insured with complete information in HIF database to 100 percent. The
MOH and HIF have increased their capacity in analyzing the BBP, which is supported by
a legal framework. The project supported intensive management training for management
at the 4 regional hospitals in order to improve the level of awareness of modern health
management practices in public hospitals. Through project supported activities,
institutional capacity of both mid-level and senior managers received training in service
management including in areas of performance, operating costs control, quality of
services, safe and efficient medical waste management. The new standards medical waste
collection and disposal have now been supported for wider introduction around the
country by two EU projects that support similar activities at all levels of health care
delivery. Through the Chamber of Health Institutions of the Republic of Serbia (CHIS)
the project also supported the training of health care institutions managers in areas of
managerial responsibilities, efficiency and cost savings.

53.    The achievement of the PDO is further demonstrated by data related to the
following key performance indicators:

ii)     Outcome indicator #5: MOH, with input from other relevant Serbian health
sector agencies, monitors and analyzes at least annually the revenue, expenditure and
arrears of the HIF and public health care institutions; the distribution of HIF expenditure


9
  In addition to reconfiguration and improving patient flow and support for diagnostic services, the project supported the purchase of
equipment including: ECGs holter, EEG, EMG, defibrillator with monitor, non-invasive blood pressure monitor, ophthalmoscopes,
arthroscope and US unit for urology. biochemistry analyzer, blood cell count apparatus, glucose analyzer, flame photometer, capillary
electrophoresis device, centrifuge, microscopes, operating-ENT microscope, endo-video gastroscope, general surgery operating lamps
and tables, cardiac ultrasound imaging system, hot air sterilizers).




                                                                 16
per capita in different areas and among vulnerable and other population groups (taking
account of risk factors); and out-of-pocket expenditure on health by the population; and
outcome indicator #9: MOH, with input from other relevant Serbian health sector
agencies, publishes regular analytical reports on the performance of the health system and
health sector institutions, using data from enhanced health information systems, and
using the WHO World Health Report 2000 categories and local measures:

54.     A review of project outputs shows that the MOH and HIF have built their
capacity to monitor and analyze revenue and expenditures of health institutions. The
project supported the establishment of the National Health Accounts (NHA) team within
the Institute of Public Health (IPH). The first collection of NHAs was completed in 2006,
conducted in collaboration with international consultants. Follow up rounds of data
collection efforts were undertaken in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Sustainability of the NHA
System is ensured by the fact that since 2008, NHAs have been financed from the
Government’s budget under a line-item budget in MOH. NHAs data collection and
management are wholly under the responsibility of IPH, who are annually commissioned
to produce accounts by the MOH. NHA data is available on the IPH Website under the
Centre for Informatics and Biostatistics of the IPH. In addition, the MOH has increased
its capacity to collect and analyze data on other areas of interest to the sector. For
example, the HIF produces reports that analyze revenue, expenditure and arrears of the
HIF and other public health care institutions, and analyses the distribution of HIF
expenditure per capita in different areas and among vulnerable and other population
groups as well as out-of-pocket expenditure on health by the population.

55.   In addition to the above, the contribution of AF towards the achievement of the
PDO can be traced through the following indicators that were added:

(i)   Standards and guidelines are used to make decisions on investments in
information technology:

56.     The MOH has adapted three sets of Standards for IT investments in PHC
and Hospital Information System, National Coding systems and Minimal data sets.
All investments supported by the project were in accordance with IT standards and
guidelines as described in the MOH IT Rule Book. In addition, the project supported the
development of a national body (ProRec Serbia founded in 2008) that oversees PHC
systems quality labeling and certification, the body is made up of key personnel of the
MOH, HIF, health institutions, software solution providers and Belgrade University. The
project also supported the introduction of a Certified Information Security Management
System in accordance with ISO 27000 in General Hospital Zrenjanin. In addition, a
roadmap and templates that allow users to implement ISMS has been developed.

57.    In addition to support for installation of IT hardware, HIS software, there
was also support for Wide Area Networks (WANs) and infrastructure for data
exchange. This includes scheduling of specialist examinations, access to electronic health
records in hospitals, and the integration of PHC software with Laboratory Information
System (LIS) in referral hospitals. The LIS is connected with analyzers and receives



                                           17
results from analyzers in 20 hospitals 10 and from digital technology that processes
radiological images. Such a web based system allows for data access from different
locations within a medical facility, as well as from outside the institution providing a
basis for telemedicine. The WAN connects over 360 institutions of the health sector
including 18 hospitals and 2 institutes. Investments in IT supported by the Project have
benefitted the development of a database of those insured which provides key data to the
HIF as well as better collection of payroll contributions and allows for improved access
to health insurance. The project also supported the development of a nationwide
framework for medical information system providing the regulation and standards for
PHC and hospital information systems development. The national health care
information and communication infrastructure has been implemented connecting health
care institutions into a single communication structure, thus allowing future electronic
data exchange and better integration.

ii)    MOH safeguards quality of services by introducing internationally certified
Clinical Practice Guidelines for clinical pathways; and Ministry of Health publishes
regular review of performance of hospitals:

58.     The project supported the MOH in establishing the Quality Unit which
helped to spearhead activities in Continuous Quality Improvement, Accreditation,
Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Licensing and CME. The project supported
the establishment of the Agency for Accreditation, which is operational and accreditation
process is going on for 44 health care facilities (dom zdravlja –DZs) -supported by DILS
project and 17 hospitals supported by AF. In addition to setting up the accreditation
office (office space, equipment later to be paid for by accreditation fees), the project
supported the development and implementation of an accreditation program supported by
technical assistance on international best practice in accreditation. The project also
supported training surveyors and quality coordinators; development of standards and
survey procedures; piloting and the roll-out of accreditation standards. So far 15 PHCs
have been accredited and 2 of the 4 hospitals that went through the accreditation process
were accredited. In addition from 2009, 13 secondary and tertiary health care institutions
have been accredited.

59.     In order to further improve on quality and efficiency of health care services,
the project supported capacity building activities. This included training and study
tours for staff in health care centers, MOH, HIF, PHI and other stakeholders in the sector
in development of methodology on Clinical Pathways (CPs) as well as their use in
treatment and management of care. During the life of the project CPs in child asthma,
primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, secondary prevention of cardiovascular
diseases, iron deficiency anemia, depression, diabetes, screening of colon cancer, low

  Hospitals supported by the project: Clinical Center of Serbia - Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Clinical Center Kragujevac -
Surgery (the whole building), Institute for Mother and Child, Clinical Hospital Center “Dr Dragiša Mišović - Dedinje?, general
hospitals in Vrbas, Sremska Mitrovica, Šabac, Požarevac, Jagodina, Smederevska Palanka, Aleksinac, Zaje?ar, Užice, Leskovac,
Petrovac na Mlavi, Surdulica, Gornji Milanovac, Novi Pazar, the Narodni front Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Institute of Mental
Health in Palmotićeva St. in Belgrade.




                                                               18
back pain, myocardial infarction, colon carcinoma, child asthma, normal delivery, stroke,
and cholecystectomy were introduced and evaluated.

60.    The project also supported the development of Continuous Medical
Education. The legal framework, such as the Licensing and CME by-laws, has been set
up and the Medical Chambers have been established. Investments in CME have enabled
the Ministry to launch an examination of HAIs in all 22 institutes of public health and
designed procedures for handling the most frequent HAIs including the use of antibiotics
and procedures for monitoring and preventing HAIs.

61.     It is important to note that since the implementation of the developed and
tested DRG system will only begin later in 2012, the KPI on publication of regular
review of performance of hospitals was partially met. In 2011, a hospital infections
survey and review was conducted for 60 hospitals and the review on hospital
performance published for hospitals participating in the project. This KPI shows partial
achievement because a review based on DRG reporting was not completed due to delays
in adopting DRG by-law. There is however no reason to believe that this will not be
achievable once the DRG system is fully implemented and more data from the system are
collected and analyzed.

3.3 Efficiency

62.     An economic analysis to measure whether the costs of involved in achieving
project objectives were reasonable in comparison with the benefits and recognized
norms was not carried out for the ICR. The PAD included a modest cost benefit
analysis of the project and acknowledged the challenges of taking into account the full
benefits of health system interventions such as those supported by the SHP. It is
important to note that the project restructuring did not include a revised economic
analysis for the restructured project and data that would allow for meaningful economic
analyses was lacking. Description of activities that would lead to efficiency gains, such as
those under paras. 49 and 50 and other data presented in the ICR shows positive trends
towards a more efficient health sector including reduction in bed numbers and lengths of
stay. It is also important to note that the support provided by the project was but a
component of the overall reform agenda financed by the Borrower hence separating the
contribution of the project alone is difficult. This inability to specifically quantify gains in
efficiency does somehow detract from the outcomes performance rating by the ICR team,
which is weighed project relevance, its achievement and efficiency.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

63.    Rating: Satisfactory. The Project’s overall outcome is considered Satisfactory
based on the Project’s significant achievements, its continued relevance, its contribution
towards strengthening Serbia’s health sector program, and making it more accountable
and efficient. Although the project as designed was weak, restructuring undertaken in
June 2005 considerably improved the design and more closely linked activities to the
PDO. In addition while the M&E framework was somewhat weak and remained deficient,



                                              19
the team did make efforts to refine indicators that have been used to monitor the project.
Some indicators were introduced later in the project 11 and with the approval of the AF,
the M&E does provide some way of linking project outputs to the desired achievements.
Data show that most of the key performance indicators were fully achieved, and most
exceeded their targets. Despite the deficiencies mentioned, this is a project that supported
the development of the foundation of a system of care that is more efficient, it improved
the quality of care that patients in the participating hospitals received, from renovated
buildings that are safer for patients and where data is more readily available, and most
importantly it also introduced institutional changes that are highly likely to be long
lasting and difficult to reverse.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.     The SHP and AF to the project mainly tackled systemic issues facing the
sector. While the project identifies some vulnerable groups (see section 1.4) as
beneficiary of improvements in the functioning of the system, it is not easy to attribute
quantitative or qualitative impact on poverty or gender aspects which have been tackled
through specific indicators because none were included in the results framework. The
Bank does however support another project in the sector (DILS Project) that addresses
gaps in access to social services, including health services, faced by the Roma who face
much worse socio-economic conditions than the rest of the population.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.      This project had an extensive focus on strengthening institutions. The above
section shows that the project has been successful in building long term capacity and
institutional development. The project supported training for more than 6, 000 persons,
who are involved in: (i) the monitoring and analyses of revenue, expenditures and arrears
of the HIF; (ii) financial reforms including provider payment reforms and resource
allocation: (iii) preparation and analyses of data from the NHA established at the IPH;
(iv) licensing and accreditation of providers and care facilities; and (v) development,
installation and maintenance of HIS. The project supported a large number of training
activities that are instrumental in the development of a performance oriented health care
system; and has put in place the structure needed for a performance oriented health care
system based on DRGs. Other institutional changes are in the way that IT has introduced
efficiencies in the system, such as those now found at the HIF or at the hospitals
supported by the project. Other institutional changes pertain to quality assurance such as
measures geared at Clinical Practice Guidelines for clinical pathways. The project
supported the introduction of laws and by-laws that are critical to the introduction of
reforms of the health care system. In reality, few of the achievements of the project
would have been possible without significant improvement in the capacity of the sector
staff.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

66.      There has been very close coordination and synergies with the DILS project and
activities financed by the EU (e.g. in hospital waste management and IT), all of which
have resulted in better outcomes for the sector.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

67.      Rating: Modest. Achievements in the area of health sector reform supported by
this project have been reached under a climate of strong overall commitment to financing
reforms not only in the health sector, but in other social sectors that constitute the larger
part of the Government’s budget. At the time of this ICR’s preparation, the country has
just had elections scheduled in the spring of 2012. This is also a time when the country
and the region are still facing the economic crisis. While there is a risk that there could be
weaker commitment to reforms in the health sector, the country’s strong commitment to
EU accession is likely to modulate this tendency. As far as risks to an erosion or reversal
of specific PDO achievements, for example in IT infrastructure, the Government has put
in place a mechanism that will allow for continued funding of IT systems through the
DRG system. In addition, additional support in IT investments is being made by the EU
who in a coordinated manner with the SHP and MOH is supporting an additional 19
hospitals with IT investments. Other investments supported by the project have been
institutionalized and are part of standard health care delivery in the country. In addition,
most of the reforms are now enshrined in laws and bylaws and hence less likely to be
reversed. Sustainability and likelihood of continuation of Bank supported activities can
be found in the Plan of Development of the Health Care System 2010-2015 adopted by
the National Assembly, and the Strategy for the Development of the Informatics Society
in the Republic of Serbia Until 2020, e-Health2015 IT Strategy. Caution regarding the
sustaining of reforms is needed given the new leadership of the Ministry; it is not yet
known exactly what direction the sector will be steered in. This caution in the political
economy of the sector and the country is important given the changes that have been
supported by the project, uncertainties that led to resignation of the PCU Coordinator
after successfully steering the project for years.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

68.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Bank helped to prepare the project by
drawing on lessons learnt from previous engagement in the sector, the country and the
ECA region and was successful in identifying areas of the system that needed reform. For
the initial credit, however, the Bank was not successful in helping to establish the right



                                             21
conditions for implementation, specifically, assisting to put in place principal elements
for project implementation (e.g., administrative structures, capabilities for procurement,
accounting, etc.).

69.    The project was prepared very quickly in order not to lose an opportunity
for IDA eligibility, and therefore missed on opportunities to put in place strategies
for implementation. It also missed an opportunity to put in place a meaningful M&E
system for monitoring implementation and measuring results, for example, there were
shortcomings in the lack of initial baseline data information for indicators and the
unavailability of analysis of data for certain key indicators. While these were later
ameliorated, they do contribute to a less than ideal appreciation of the project's progress
and achievements, of which there are many. Deficiencies identified in the requested QER
were later amended in the restructuring, but this did cost the Borrower and the Bank time
and effort to correct avoidable design deficiencies.

70.     The Quality Enhancement Review raised reservations regarding data and
analyses of the Serbian health system that was provided in the PAD. It raised doubts
as to the achievability of the PDOs should the project proceed as was described in the
PAD at that stage of preparation. The QER panel appreciated reasons for the urgency in
getting the project approved (upcoming expiration of IDA eligibility), but recommended
streamlining the project and collecting more data on the inefficiencies of the health care
system that had not been well articulated at that stage of project preparation.

71.     The panel raised a number of concerns regarding project readiness. These
were that: (i) the PAD described a very ambitious project development objective (to
achieve a sustainable, performance oriented health care system where providers are
rewarded for quality and efficiency and where health insurance coverage ensures access
to affordable and effective care); (ii) the development objectives as stated at that stage of
project preparation were not consistent with specific actions proposed under the project
and would in any case be highly ambitious and unlikely to be achieved in the context of
the proposed investment operation; (iii) the project could not meet the expectation of
achieving a sustainable, performance oriented health care system especially since the HIF
was at the center of challenges to sustainability of health care financing.

72.     Suggestions were made, and some were taken into account, that the
operation should be designed as a stepping stone to better understanding on policy
options for reforming the system. The panel also suggested that rather than aiming to
improve its sustainability, the development objectives should also aim to articulate more
clearly the expectations for improvements in the service delivery area.

(b) Quality of Supervision

73.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. This is a project that required intensive
supervision especially at the initial stages of implementation; after all, this was a country
coming out of conflict and a tumultuous decade. Documentation shows that soon after the
project was approved, the then Minister of Health resigned, and in the environment of



                                             22
uncertainty, a decision was made to concentrate on very few activities during this period
of transition in the Government. While this was probably a prudent approach, this did
introduce significant delays in implementation.

74.     The most important and positive aspect of Bank supervision included the
focus on the PDO. All interviews with stakeholders show that the Borrower greatly
valued the quality of technical dialogue that the Bank brought to the project. The Bank
consistently and diligently carried out procurement and financial management
supervision. In addition, following restructuring the Bank team was very proactive in key
aspects of the project including the background work needed to introduce the DRG
system, the procurement of the right software and licensing rights for this purpose, and in
the introduction of the Accreditation Agency. The Bank team should be commended for
the close collaboration between the teams managing the DILS project that has a focus on
primary health care and the SHP, ensuring complementary of activities between the two
levels of care.

75.    Less positive aspects of supervision included periods where lack of missions
or issuance of Aide memoires. This protracts somewhat from a more comprehensive
account of project implementation, supervision, achievements and lessons.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

76.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. As discussed in other sections, the quality at
entry for this project was less than satisfactory, the Bank team must however be
commended for corrections introduced through restructuring and the close supervision
that enabled satisfactory implementation and steadfast focus on the development
objectives. The quality of technical expertise dialogue was highly satisfactory especially
once the project was restructured implementation sped up. Due to some shortcomings in
initial design, poor M&E design and in supervision in the early stages of project
implementation, Bank performance justifies a Moderately Satisfactory rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

77.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. This was a project that for the most part was
implemented by a Government that was committed to reforms in the health sector, and
one that for the larger portion of implementation demonstrated a long term strategic
vision in the sector. Unlike the Bank team, the Government leadership in the sector
changed a few times and the same Minister of Health oversaw the implementation for
most of the 9 years of implementation. However, not all leadership showed the same
degree of commitment, and some delays experienced towards the end of project
implementation, suggest less than full appreciation of the significance of the reforms that
have been supported by the project. The project suffered significant delays through
delayed approval of contracts which in turn delayed some completion of IT activities.
The role of the MOF in supporting the linkages between the SHP, AF, DILS and
PEDPL3 was satisfactory. The Borrower’s performance in ensuring political and



                                            23
institutional commitment was satisfactory; and while the initial period of implementation
was very slow, it is important to remember that this was a period of political transition for
the Government and it is hard in such an environment to have key Ministerial personnel
in place. This is a process that usually takes time to become settled as is the case in most
post-conflict realities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

78.      Rating: Satisfactory. The satisfactory assessment is justified by the achievement
of planned outputs; timely accomplishment of major project milestones; adaptation to
unforeseen circumstances such as the delays in procurement and contracting of DRG
licensing rights and quick response to requests for information. The performance of the
MOH as the implementing agency was satisfactory. After a period of political instability,
the MOH sustained a continued period of strong leadership and commitment to reforms,
and ensured necessary support to the PCU in the running of the project. In addition, the
PCU performance was also satisfactory. This was an action-oriented PCU and together
with the World Bank team worked effectively to address implementation challenges.
Though financial management was for a short period less than satisfactory at MTR,
implementation progress in general and project management in particular were
consistently rated satisfactory. As with most project of this era, the PCU was established
outside the MOH, and it did allow the PCU to get the project up and running and to have
specialized staff working on various aspects of implementation. This is however an
institutional arrangement that made the project to be seen as operating outside the MOH
and limited as close collaboration between the project and the MOH. This was raised
during the ICR mission as a situation that at times created an atmosphere of distrust
between MOH and PCU especially with the change in MOH leadership in the final
months of implementation. It should be noted that project management was somewhat
strained toward the end of the project with the departure of the long-time executive
director, the need to disburse remaining project funds.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

78. Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The moderately satisfactory performance of the
Government and the satisfactory performance of the Implementing Agency yield an
overall rating of moderately satisfactory according to ICR Guidelines.

6. Lessons Learned

79.    The need for speed in project preparation and a project’s quality at entry
must be balanced. This is a project that was prepared, from identification to Board
presentation, in about 11 months. The project was prepared for a country that was just
exiting a tumultuous period in its history, and was identified when the MOH had no
Minister for Health and approved about a month after the assassination of the Serbian
Prime Minister. While one can appreciate the fact that losing IDA financing was an issue
at stake, the haste with which the project was prepared did contribute to very slow
implementation in the initial years which were a period of political uncertainty. The



                                             24
country was essentially a post conflict country at the identification stage of the project,
more attention to the political economy should have informed the design of the project,
maybe to a much simpler project, and one with more implementation support in place.

80.     The Bank needs to increase its knowledge on matters around licensing of
Information Technology software and licenses in the health sector. This project lost
about 7 months of implementation of DRG activities while issues surrounding the
licensing of DRG classification system were being resolved. While the task team worked
diligently to resolve fiduciary considerations, the whole episode showed the Bank to be
less knowledgeable and more of a hindrance in the process. Since the Bank supports a
large number of clients with HMIS needs, upping expertise in this area is important and
would be beneficial to our clients.

81.    An improperly designed M&E can raise serious questions about overall
quality of project identification and of project design. This is in addition to making
project monitoring a real challenge and making it difficult to demonstrate the
achievements/ failure of a project. The lack of baseline indicators data for KPIs, the
misalignment of KPIs to project activities and the PDO, can bring one to question the
relevance of the project and how specific activities were identified to be the focus of the
project since one needs an analytical base on which to anchor a project. The M&E
framework for this project was not only misaligned but it was also promising to measure
achievements that were not under the influence of the project.

82.     The next Bank supported operation must seriously explore implementation
arrangements that integrates the functions of a PCU within the MOH. The
establishment of a PCU outside the MOH was probably an appropriate decision for the
project at the time when capacity within the MOH was still in development. However, it
is clear that with the increased capacity of the MOH, the Bank and the Borrower must
consider having implementation arrangements that fosters closer collaboration, ensure an
environment conducive to mutual learning and exchange of knowledge, and
implementation experiences between the project coordination team and the MOH. An
arrangement that allows for closer team work and exchange of ideas will facilitate
building of technical expertise more broadly in the sector.

83.    When financial sustainability is a desired goal then closer MOH-MOF-Public
Administration dialogue through the Programmatic Public Expenditure
Development Policy Loan could have further strengthened desired outcomes. It was
overly ambitious for the project to list as one the KPIs, a reduction in arrears of health
care centers without linking this KPI to activities directly supported by the project. It was
also very important to ensure that the team engaged on the PPEDPL more aggressively
and more closely scheduled the PPEDPL actions and prior actions with the
implementation of the SHP.

84.    Long-term engagement of the Bank in Serbia must recognize that health
sector reforms are complex and often take a number of years. This is particularly the
case when they are comprehensive as it is the case in Serbia, where they were addressing



                                             25
financing reforms at all levels of health care, efficiency, quality and resulting in number
of positive outcomes. However, in order to keep the momentum and provide enabling
environment to successful completion of the reforms, the Bank should consider a longer-
term approach in its support through a follow up project.

   Increases in actual cost for project management and M&E against the restructured estimate under the IDA Credit is
due to an additional 22-month extension of the closing date to cover for the preparation period of the AF and the
awaiting period for Parliament ratification of the AF Loan, and the intensity of implementation following the
restructuring of the original Project. As for the discrepancy between the AF appraisal estimate and the actual cost for
project management and M&E, this also reflects the need to accelerate the pace of implementation during the last year
until closing. In addition, critical technical assistance for monitoring and evaluation was required, including field work,
during implementation to collect data, among others, on providers’ performance.

   Increases in total actual project costs reflect exchange rate fluctuation in the SDR (IDA) and EURO (AF Loan) to

Serbia Health Project was approved by the WB’s Board on May 22, 2003 and the loan
became effective on October 10, 2003. Serbia Health Project – SHP and the Serbia
Health Project Additional Financing - SHPAF were focusing on comprehensive reform
process. Thus, the number of activities was large, with constant danger of under financing
and neglecting of some focus areas. MOH bridged this through the coordination of
international aid. Projects implemented and financed by the EU, ICRC and Canadian
government were building strong operational experience which integrated nicely into the
overall reform framework. This framework was mostly the task of the WB financed
projects implemented by the MOH. Both projects were crucial in driving reform of the
Serbian health system. Several factors allowed these projects to achieve good
performance: reliance on local capacities, constant programmatic support from the WB
(including both design and implementation phases), combining different lending
mechanisms to strengthen implementation, good collaboration with other donor activities,
strong administrative foundation. During the preparation phase and in early stages of
implementation, the project relied heavily on international technical assistance. However,
shift was made to try to engage local staff in combination with top individual foreign
experts and advisors. Apart of better utilization of loan funds, the result was creation of a
broad pool of trained local experts that was capable of taking most of the burden during
the rollout phases.

Administrative WB procedures introduced through the loan were instrumental in the
quick implementation of project activities. Even when procedure was deemed lengthy
and complicated, long-term benefit was evident since all tenders were completed without
complaints and delays that usually accompany local Serbian procurement. Financial
management was fully implemented according to the WB procedures, but provision for
some local bookkeeping requirements should be made when staffing the finance unit.

Achieving Project Objectives

Most of the project objectives were achieved. Some achievements were not part of the
results framework (activities described in sections 15 to 41), but were an important factor
in preparing Serbia for upcoming health reforms. Three major achievements of the WB
and MOH that were facilitated through the project could be clearly stated.

Quality of health care and health care management became a clear priority for the health
system in Serbia. The first operational Agency for accreditation in the region has been
established and almost half of the general hospitals went through the process of


                                             34
accreditation. Health financing reform was pushed through the project and foundation
was laid, although this long overdue reform would not have been possible without
technical assistance provided through the project and constant effort exercised through
DPL. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategy for health, prepared by
the project team, was one of first IT sector strategies in Serbia. Standards and
accompanying regulation established for software used in health institutions is
unprecedented in wider region, and it is now used to set an example. Implementation of
the hospital information system (HIS) is done with minimal cost and (in combination
with EU funding) 58% of bed capacities will be covered by IT by mid 2013.

Government and World Bank Performance

SHP was one of the first projects that the WB financed in Serbia. At the beginning, both
partners were ambitious to use the project in remedying problems that were built over the
previous 10-year period. Such an ambition quickly proved to be too optimistic, since
political environment in Serbia didn’t allow health to become a priority and capacities for
policy-making, change and implementation needed time to grow. Also, the project, as
designed, was too ambitious, especially considering the fact that this was the first WB-
financed project in the health sector in Serbia. It lacked clarity in the definition of
activities to be implemented as well as strategy for how to implement activities under
each sub-component. The WB response to these problems was inadequate since 4 TTLs
were changed in just over two years (including preparation, grants supervision and
project design).

From the first quarter of 2005, the WB and MOH strengthened their monitoring activity
and, during the following 12 months, the project was fully up and running and in the
position to regain satisfactory status. During the same period the project was restructured.
While the development objectives, the general architecture of the project and the total
budget remained unchanged, the scope as well as the number of activities was reduced.
The restructuring proved that WB was able to act as a partner and politically and
technically support MOH in finding realistic strategy for improvement of the health
system performance. Agreement reached on restructuring permitted MOH to focus its
efforts on a more manageable number of activities and to enable the project to complete
them in a more effective manner.

In that sense, the MOH was able to build project findings and recommendations in the
new Health Care and Health financing Laws and various by-laws, showing commitment
towards achieving the project goals. In addition to that, the Government increased its
share in the project by 4 million dollars maximizing benefits for the health sector.
Furthermore, the WB and MOH were able to influence conditions for disbursement of
PDPL, thus ensuring that implementation of reforms started by the project would take
place. Beside that, WB directly contributed to enhancing analytical capacity by
conducting of a Baseline Survey of Cost and Efficiency in Primary Health Care Centers
before Provider Payment Reforms that took place in 2008; with intention of repeating the
survey after provider payment changes actually take place.




                                            35
Sustainability

Most of the processes activated by the SHP and SHPAF become standard in delivery of
health care in Serbia. Input from the WB-financed projects is evident in the Plan of
Development of the Health Care System 2010-2015 adopted by the Parliament of the
Republic of Serbia, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Strategy for the Development of the
Informatics Society in the Republic of Serbia Until 2020, e-Health2015 IT Strategy.
However, part of the activities just started or started in a limited number of health
institutions. Some reform breakthroughs are only in the very initial phase after a long
period of training and survival of the early phases of change management. Taking into
account that global economic crisis and further reduction of the health budget as a
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) are limiting investment capacity of the
MOH, it is necessary to ensure additional support for the reform process. Logically, the
focus of this support should be the health financing reform.

1.   Health Services Restructuring

1.1. Hospital Renovation and Equipping

a) Unnecessarily large space (app 4500m2), dislocated diagnostic services and lack of
some medical equipment were the main issue in the Kraljevo Hospital. The main activity
in Kraljevo Hospital, in this component, included reconstruction of the new Pediatric
department and complete vacation of the old Pediatric building. The total space of the
outpatient polyclinic in the hospital was reduced by app. 3000 m2. The three principal
buildings of the Kraljevo Hospital were disconnected, so the construction of an
underground passage was financed from the SHP. Top level of internist building was
reconstructed to accommodate the pulmonary ward and ground floor of the surgical
building was reconstructed to accommodate the diagnostic centre and centre for day
surgery. The newly-established diagnostic centre is now fully functional. Centralized
diagnostic centre increased the efficiency of patient flows and improved diagnostic
support for emergency services and for PHC.

Medical equipment procured for Kraljevo Hospital improved services and ensured faster
diagnostics (US devices, EEG, ECG devices, fiber-optic laryngoscope, ECG halters,
tissue processor and automatic strainer for pathology lab, microscopes) and treatment in
life-threatening conditions (surgical instruments, anesthesiology apparatus, operating
table, video-endoscopy sets).

Vranje Hospital had two main issues: ten wards were dislocated in ten different buildings
without physical connection and it had not had a central surgical block and central
intensive care unit. Immediately after the start of the SHP, minor works included moving
the neurology ward from the old, inadequate building to a larger adequate space with
better working conditions. The result of the moving was evident from the economic point
of view because less money is now used for fuel, electricity and water supply and the
maintenance expenses have been reduced. Major hospital reconstruction in Vranje,
supported by SHP, started with hospital plan for 4 phases needed to reach the intended



                                           36
flow of services, detailed design for the first phase of the construction works,
geotechnical and seismic assessments as well as cadastral survey. It was obvious that
civil works will take more time and resources than envisaged by the SHP and after
restructuring of the project MOH committed its own budget to start with construction of
the new building. This new building, the central surgical block, will be attached to main
complex, with the idea that it will provide better multidisciplinary health care service
(especially for the cases of the most difficult polytrauma patients) as well as better
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of medical equipment.

The equipment procurement for Vranje Hospital included ECGs holter, EEG, EMG,
defibrillator with monitor, non-invasive blood pressure monitor, ophthalmoscopes,
arthroscope and US unit for urology. And second delivery that was mainly for laboratory
and surgical ward included: biochemistry analyzer, blood cell count apparatus, glucose
analyzer, flame photometer, capillary electrophoresis device, centrifuge, microscopes,
operating-ENT microscope, endo-video gastroscope, general surgery operating lamps and
tables, cardiac ultrasound imaging system, hot air sterilizers). They were aimed at the
improvement of the general quality of services (reduced number of patients going out to
other health institutions, improved quality of services delivered and faster proceeding of
diagnostic services). For the needs of urology, gynecology, pediatrics and surgery ward,
the ultrasound probes that had been out of function were replaced. That enabled Vranje
hospital to perform diagnostic procedures to the patients of the aforementioned wards
who had been obliged to go to other institutions (other neighboring health centers, private
clinics, etc.)

Valjevo hospital has four separate hospital sites. Connection of the buildings and
consolidation of these services was proposed as a way to decrease costs (for maintenance,
utilities, etc) and increase efficiency (reduce the time required for transport, make
services more accessible). Hospital reconstruction in Valjevo, supported by the local
fund-raising and SHP, provided space sufficient for consolidation and reorganization of
services in Valjevo hospital. Construction of the new building (pulmology department
with 55 beds) connected to the existing buildings allowed sufficient space for
reorganization of the pathology, cardiology and coronary unit. Rehabilitation of the
hospital included also some minor works: interior modifications of the hospital surgery
block entrance hall and external illumination works. These activities resulted in safer
conditions for staff and patients, improving access and organization of services.

Valjevo hospital had been equipped with old and out of date equipment that required
frequent maintenance. The project supported the purchase of X-ray tubes that had been
overused with an excessively high total number of expositions, thus creating unsafe
environment for the patients. Major medical equipment was procured in two phases. The
first phase of equipment procurement aimed at improvement of general quality of
services, providing ECGs, defibrillators, monitors, for all departments, and
ophthalmoscopes, inhalators and fetal monitors for some departments. The second phase
provided equipment mostly for the new (pulmology) building, improving services of
departments placed there. The second tender also brought some items that are in




                                            37
accordance with the idea of improvement of the service quality for the entire hospital
(syringe pumps, electrosurgical knives, laboratory equipment, etc.).

Zrenjanin hospital was a campus of number of disconnected small old buildings (some
older than 60 years) and unfinished huge 10-storey new hospital that was an empty shell
and in 2003 utilized less than 10%. The initial plan to use SHP to furnish a huge central
sterilization ward in the new hospital building for Zrenjanin hospital was abandoned in
early 2005 since it was impossible to secure the next phase of the investment. Therefore
restructuring of Zrenjanin hospital included rehabilitation of part of the new hospital for
the needs of moving the delivery ward, neonatology and obstetrics from the old buildings
(total surface of 1500 m2). Finalization of this area included admission room, sanitary
pass, pre-delivery room, 4 delivery rooms, post-delivery room, operating theater for
Cesarean Section, nurse stand, patient rooms with 30 beds, neonatology area with 25 beds
for newborn babies, area to accommodate the incubators for prematurely born babies as
well as sanitary and auxiliary premises and communications. Construction works
included purchasing and installation of 2 elevators and mounting of distribution channels
for the 04 floor, where the surgery inpatient ward was planned. The positive results of
moving departments from the old buildings to the new hospital building is evident from
the economic point of view (less money is used for fuel, electricity and water supply and
the maintenance expenses have been reduced). Hospital in Zrenjanin had two rounds of
medical equipment supply, mostly intended for the delivery ward and the neonatology
department. Part of the equipment was intended for diagnostic imaging, coronary and
intensive care unit. Medical equipment provided improvement of the service quality in
the mentioned departments.

1.2. Improving Hospital Management

In the four general hospitals participating in the project, the number of beds and average
length of stay show negative trend that is faster than for other hospitals in Serbia: number
of beds (from 2906 in 2003 to 2312 in 2010) and average length of stay (from 8.56 in
2003 to 7.52 in 2010). Concurrently, the mean occupancy rate and number of discharges
show a positive trend that is also faster than for other hospitals in Serbia; bed occupancy
rate (increase from 62% in 2003 to 71.7% in 2010) and the number of discharges from
hospitals (from 77109 in 2003 to 80427 in 2010).

Through the work of the so-called “Club 4?, made up of top management of 4 regional
hospitals, the project was working thoroughly on improvement of the general level of
awareness of modern health management practices in public hospitals as well as on
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of standards for the secondary level hospitals.
Moreover, that was the way of strengthening the institutional capacity around the country
enabling the training for both mid-level and senior managers (more than 30 of them have
passed a 5-module management course organized by the School of Public Health in
Belgrade). This led to the improvement of functional ability of senior
clinical/administrative staff assigned to 4 designated hospitals to manage their services
more effectively and efficiently e.g. better implementation of key measures to increase
performance, control operating costs and improve quality of services provided at the



                                            38
hospital level. At the same time, working with the same group of managers, the project
has established milestones in the area of building up safe and efficient medical waste
management. The project carried out a needs-assessment/situation analysis and developed
a plan of action by setting up medical waste management teams and organizing a three-
month activity of collecting data on the type and the quantity of medical waste in all 4
pilot-hospitals. Recommendations together with new standards for collecting and
disposing medical waste according to type and origin (the color-coding system) served as
a starting point for the two EU projects that followed later on and worked on upscaling
the achievements all around the country and on all three levels of care. The project
supported the preparation and implementation of an audit of 18 health care institutions
(15 largest hospitals and 3 largest primary health care centers) with a view to help define
key measures to better control and reduce operating costs. It helped streamline the audit
and results showed great improvement in the area of performance and quality indicators,
but real financial audit was not easy to perform due to the bookkeeping procedure.

The project also supported the Chamber of the Health Institutions of the Republic of
Serbia (CHIS) in the light of improvement of performance of managers of health
institutions. Regarding this fact, the draft criteria for assessment of performance of
hospital managers have been developed with the database of available courses and
trainings in health management aiming to map the main area of performance, to highlight
the main responsibilities of managers and to award and motivate the most successful ones.
The improvement of health management was deemed very important in the light of
introduction of new financing models-using the diagnosis related groups system and
capitation payment, by promotion of the model of efficiency and raising awareness of the
importance of making significant savings among health leaders. The energy efficiency
model was also promoted by organizing the meeting and fair which gathered the
managers of all health institutions in the Republic of Serbia. The membership in HOPE
(European Hospital and Healthcare Federation) of the CHIS, achieved also through the
project, is the significant step in exchanging the knowledge and experience with EU
countries. Other activities that have been done: trainings in creation of project proposals
for the EU IPA fund, introduction of trainings in EU health policy for health managers;
supporting the Chamber in obtaining participation in EU FP7 Project, etc.

1.3. Flu Vaccine Production at Torlak Institute for Virology, Vaccines and Sera

Based on strategic documents prepared by European Agency for Reconstruction - EAR
Consultant (Strategy for Developing Torlak Institute for Virology, Vaccines and Sera and
Investment Strategy for Torlak Institute) MOH and WB embarked on investment into
influenza vaccine production at the Torlak Institute, starting from November 2006.
Although the plan indicated an investment of approximately US$ 1 million, the whole
investment divided in three phases was worth US$ 6.5 million (SHP contributed 1 million,
MOH from the budget – US$ 3.6 million, Torlak Institute – US$ 0.8 million and World
Health Organization – US$ 1.1 million). During 2006, SHP directly financed technical
assistance needed to prepare and implement design required to establish production of
influenza vaccine according to good manufacturing practice and purchase of a major
piece of equipment, the centrifuge. Towards the end of 2008, MOH provided the



                                            39
investment needed to start bulk production in 2009. Final stage of investment provided by
Torlak and WHO was used in 2009, when the test production started. The first test was
unsuccessful and, after a change of leadership, Torlak never tried to launch production
again.

2 Health Finance, Policy and Management and Quality Improvement

2.1. Health Finance

2.1.1. Provider Payment Reform

Before the start of the SHP, the Government of Serbia has already expressed its intention
to change payment system for provision of primary health care from input-based system
to system based on capitation. To support that intention and in accordance with PDO,
MOH carried out the initial work to support introduction of capitation through the SHP
project. Comprehensive analyses of different aspects of service provision on primary
level have been completed (legal aspect, payments for quality, unavoidable costs,
contracting, access, copayments, etc.), and a basic structure of capitation formula has
been developed and proposed. Further work on introduction of capitation was continued
by EU funded project with main focus on support to implementation of capitation in
Serbia.

One part of the PDO refers to accessibility of affordable and effective healthcare, where
providers are rewarded for quality and efficiency. Furthermore, by the time the SHP
project started, the Government expressed interest in changing input-based provider
payment system for the secondary and tertiary levels of healthcare provision. In
accordance with all that, a group of SHP project activities was directed towards support
of provider payment reform for hospital care in Serbia. An analysis of the current
provider payment system for hospital care was completed with assessment of different
provider payment options for introduction. That analysis proposed that system of
diagnosis related groups (DRG) should be introduced in provider payment system for
hospitals in Serbia. Afterwards, an analysis of different DRG systems that are in use
worldwide was completed to assess which DRG system would suit Serbia best for
implementation. That assessment was assisted by medical professionals in Serbia, and
Australian DRG system (AR-DRG) was assessed as most suitable. A trial license for the
use of AR-DRG was obtained with all other preparatory work done, and piloting of that
system took place for three months in 2008 in six hospitals in Serbia. AR-DRG system
was piloted as a reporting system only. The results of that pilot were very encouraging,
having all hospitals reporting successfully according to the new system with very high
percent of correct reporting. Furthermore, medical professionals from hospitals showed
high level of satisfaction with the new system, judging that support for reporting that had
been provided to them during piloting was of great help. The key conclusions were that
AR-DRG system was implementable and applicable in Serbia, that training and
continuous support was very important.




                                            40
MOH took activities related to introduction of DRG in Serbia to another level through
SHPAF. After a period of negotiations with Australian authorities and the WB, through
SHPAF, in early 2011, Serbia obtained a license for use of Australian DRG system. After
that, SHPAF supported introduction of components of AR-DRG system into legislation,
primarily through work with experts in different medical fields to adopt, accept and
support necessary legislative changes. These changes are necessary to make AR-DRG
system possible for use first as analytical, and later as a reporting system and finally as
payment system. Furthermore, through cooperation with other central institutions of the
health system in Serbia (RHIF, IPH) MOH through SHPAF project supported
institutional capacity building related to DRG system and its implementation and usage.
The usage of AR-DRG system as an analytical tool would be possible as early as 2012.

2.1.1. National Health Accounts

National Health Accounts (NHA) in Serbia began in 2004 with the support of the SHP. In
2006, the first NHA was conducted with the guidance of two international consultants
and sets of data for 2003 and 2004 were produced. Subsequent NHA rounds followed in
2007, 2009 and 2010. Since 2008, NHA has been entirely government-financed,
supported by a routine line-item budget from the MOH. Currently, NHA falls under the
purview of the Republican Institute of Public Health (IPH), commissioned by the MOH
to produce NHA annually. International consultants do not provide technical expertise
and the work was no longer financed since its transfer to IPH. The project support for this
activity was limited to occasional provision of training for IPH staff and support in
preparing the new Law on Medical Records, which will be instrumental for further
improvement of NHA. Presenting capability to work on NHA and keep step with more
experienced countries, Serbia has been included in the joint WHO, EUROSTAT and
OECD work on “A System of Health Accounts (SHA)? Version 1.0 and Version2.0

2.2. Quality Improvement

2.2.1. Continuous Quality Improvement

a)      Continuous Quality Improvement. The MOH highlighted that health care quality
improvement was one of the key priorities in developing health policy in Serbia. MOH
established the Quality Unit under the project, comprising four components: Continuous
Quality Improvement, Accreditation, Health Technology Assessment, Licensing and
CME. The main goals of the continuous quality improvement component within the
scope of the SHP were: support to the MOH in setting up a continuous quality
improvement system and setting up of effective mechanisms for implementation of
quality improvement policy on the national and local level among all stakeholders.
Project activities at the national and local levels were related to developing and
implementing national quality improvement policy and building capacity of the staff in
four pilot centers. The project used its five-year experience and results in the pilot centers
to lay down the national Strategy, (“Continuous Improvement of Health Care Quality and
Patient Safety? Draft Strategy). The project established the Annual National Conference
on Continuous Quality Improvement.



                                             41
b) Project has supported the National Quality Assurance Committee (NQAC) to shift its
regulatory, oversight and quality assurance role by helping the Committee to carry out a
list of activities such as: i) producing the National Action Plan on Quality Improvement,
ii) Book of Rules on Quality Indicators, iii) public promotion (two National Conferences
on Quality and Patient Safety, iv) development of Integrated Quality Improvement Plan
and conducting 14 rounds of workshops for quality teams from all types of institutions
(all in all, the project has hosted around 500 workshop participants). Integrated Quality
Improvement Plan will serve as a practical management tool to increase hospital
productivity, efficiency and quality of service delivery; v) moreover the project has
supported National Committee for Hospital Infections Surveillance to work on education
and motivation health professionals from IPH and hospitals to work together on
prevention and suppression of HAI. Through the process of Continuous Medical
Education, that covered a network of all 22 institutes of public health and 60
corresponding acute hospitals of different levels of care, the project succeeded in
examination of basic epidemiological characteristics of HAI in health care facilities,
established the most frequent localization of HAI, elaborated the use of antibiotics and
encouraged health professionals to visualize, monitor and carry out prevention and
control of HAI. Results based on the sample of more than 13.300 participants will serve
for improvement of the national strategy regarding collecting data on the prevalence of
HAI. Results have been presented to the top management of all 347 health care
institutions at the national conference on quality improvement and patient safety and,
moreover, the results were presented in the form of a printed publication; vi) in that
sense, the project enabled the campaign entitled Save Your Lives, Wash Your Hands that
covered all hospitals (the project has provided promotional material), also, over 30
hospitals have been actively involved in the celebration of May 5th – WHO Clean Hands
Day.

2.2.2 Accreditation of Health Institutions

a) Accreditation sub-component was designed to support the early phase of establishment
of an accreditation body for health care providers, which over the medium to long term
will continually improve the quality and safety of their services. For the newly
established accreditation body, staff members, office space and office equipment have
been provided and initially financed from the loan on a gradually decreasing scale as
financing of the organization was planned to be gradually taken up from accreditation
fees paid by the providers. Activities supported by the project included development and
implementation of an accreditation program for Serbia and plan for development of the
accreditation body; technical assistance on international best practice in accreditation;
training of surveyors and quality coordinators; development of standards and survey
procedures; piloting and roll-out of accreditation standards; study tours and training
courses. Project objectives were fully accomplished and 16 primary health care centers
(15 received accreditation award) and 4 hospitals (2 received accreditation award) went
trough the accreditation process. From 2008, the Accreditation Agency was also
supported through an IPA-funded project which was complemented by SHP and DILS
activities.



                                             42
b) Support continued through SHP AF from 2009 to 2011 by providing resources
for accreditation of 13 secondary and tertiary health care institutions.

2.2.3. Health Technology Assessment

a)      The project was mainly designed to introduce Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) in the process of decision-making and has managed to build up capacity on how
to use health technology assessment as a knowledge base for improving the quality of
health care. The whole process enabled Serbia to proceed to the institutionalization of
HTA. Through the process of “problem-based learning?, the Project has carried out
several types of trainings and capacity building on health strategies for policy and
decision makers as well as capacity building for Clinical Practice Guidelines and HTA
practitioners. The project has resulted in three HTA reports and a guideline on how to
develop guidelines. Also, during the extension of activity within the same project, a local
group of experts developed the Feasibility Study on Institutionalization of HTA and the
first edition of Rules of Development and Position of Basic Benefit Package in Health
Care System in Serbia jointly with international consultants. During the same project,
Serbia was broadly been recognized and jointly engaged in the preparation of the
Handbook on HTA Capacity Building through the Work Package 8 of the EUnetHTA
Project (2006-2008).

b) The project has supported evidence based principles such as: a) development of new
and update of existing clinical practice guidelines. Based on the guideline on how to
develop guidelines, the newly-established Committee on CPG developed 8 CPGs:
Guideline to Diagnosis and treatment of Lipid Disorders, Guideline for Ischemic Heart
Disease, Guideline to Arterial Hypertension, Guideline Inguinal Hernia Treatment of
Adults, Guideline for the Disorder of the Thyroid Glandule, Guideline for Depression,
Guideline for Lung Cancer, Guideline for Ischemic Stroke. The project supported
implementation of these guideline by organizing 12 rounds of workshops in 4 regional
centers. All workshops were attended by more than 880 participants –various types of
health care professionals of all levels of health care; b) based on policy and decision
making process in the area of medical equipment e.g. the obsolete medical devices
nomenclature has been harmonized with Global Medical Devices Nomenclature (formal
adoption is waiting for the new Law on medical records). Medical equipment inventory
has been initiated: an awareness raising meeting with top management of all 347 health
care institutions resulted in more than 98% of response rate during the next two levels of
trainings among technical staff of all institutions. Namely, 75 trainings with
approximately 25 participants per unit was organized at the county level, the first level
aimed at general audience was organized in the network of county institutes of public
health and advanced level of trainings covering all type of institutions were organized in
all primary health care centers and hospitals in the county capital. The task of inventory
will be given to the National Institute of Public Health for future work.




                                            43
2.2.4. Licensing of Health Professionals and Continuous Medical Education

Using support of the national and international experts engaged through the SHP, in
2005, the MOH drafted the new Health Care Law which, among other reform
innovations, enabled the introduction of licensing for health professionals and
Continuous Medical Education (CME). In the process of establishing five new chambers
of health professionals the SHP supported consultation with more than a hundred
esteemed health professionals and process and preparation of by-laws needed for
regulation of the new bodies and positioning of the CME in the overall health delivery
system. Based on these inputs, MOH published the by-laws in late 2007. Chamber of
Doctors, Chamber of Nurses and Medical Technicians and Serbian Chamber of
Biochemists had their articles of association prepared in 2006, but full implementation
awaited until March 2009, when Health Council was set up and started to accredit CME
curricula.

2.2.5. Clinical Pathways

The key goal is to support capacity building in the area of Clinical Pathways (CP)
development and implementation, as well as the development of methodology of clinical
pathways defined according to EPA guidelines. The project has organized large-scale
seminars with top management of hospitals and primary health care centers, CP
coordinators from the Institutions, MOH, decision makers, the Health Insurance Fund and
the Public Health Institute (2 seminars before the start of work with the pilot institutions -
350 participants were educated). The Project has carried out a two-day seminar with the
health inspection of the MOH, decision makers, the Health Insurance Fund and the Public
Health Institute (130 participants were educated). The project organized study tours to
Slovenia and Hungary with directors and CP coordinators, MOH and the RHIF. The main
aim of the pilot project was to train physicians and nurses in hospitals all working groups
in 18 hospitals on how to prepare, implement and effectively use care pathways in patient
treatment and clinical management (around 1000 participants trained); During the project
institutions developed 3 to 6 CPs: Child Asthma, Primary Prevention of cardiovascular
diseases (CVD), Secondary Prevention of CVD, Iron Deficiency Anemia, Depression,
Diabetes, Screening of Colon Cancer, Low Back Pain, Myocardial Infarction, Colon
Carcinoma, Child Asthma, Normall Delivery, Stroke, and Cholecystectomy they
implemented and evaluated the impact of the regular use of care pathways. They
improved quality and efficiency of health care services provided.

2.3. Health Information System

2.3.1. Support to RHIF
Republic Health Insurance Fund recognized the need to develop a data model and a
functional model for the Database of Insurees (DoI) and a secured private Wide Area
Network (WAN) that would provide infrastructure for the Database of Insurees. Some of
the RHIF branches did not have local databases of insurees, while most of them had, but
they were not homogenous. By 2008, SHP provided establishing of central Database of



                                             44
Insures (DoI) through the process of data migration from databases of 7 local HIFs and
installation of WAN network, which connected 170 HIF locations.

2.3.2. Central Information Service
 The purpose of the Central Information Service (CIS) is to provide information to all
 stakeholders in the health system. Presently, CIS is a database of health resources,
 nomenclatures, classifications, registers etc. It was implemented as web portal and web
 application during the period from 2006 to 2008. Since 2011, through the web application,
 health institutions have updated their resource data, including those on human resources.
 A software module for medical equipment was developed in the first phase of the project
 (2006 – 2008), but it has not become operational yet. After defining/renewing the
 methodology of keeping records of medical equipment, it is necessary to upgrade the
 module for medical equipment in line with the new methodology. The CIS portal
 contains nomenclatures and classifications of interest for the health information system
 (HeIS), like JKL, ATC, ICD 10, IPCP 2 etc. The national IPH hosts this database and
 takes responsibility for storing data, updating, training and support. Further development
 of the Central Information Service will be implemented in phases, where each phase will
 “go live? as it is ready, so that the CIS functionality will grow in time. It is expected that
 further improvement of the CIS will be carried out under the DILS Project in 2012, as a
 support for the Dr Milan Jovanović Batut Institute of Public Health of Serbia.

2.3.3. Primary Health Care Software
SHP provided technical and functional upgrade of existing software in Primary Health
Care Center in Kraljevo. The MOH has the proprietary rights over that application. That
means that, once developed for the first pilot region (Kraljevo), that application will be
offered free of charge to any health institutions which have interest and resources to
utilize them. But, in order to ensure good quality (as hospital information systems), MOH
started to establish rules-standards through appropriate legislation.

2.3.4. Hospital Information System
MOH purchased the LAN network, hardware and the services of development and
implementation of the hospital information systems (HIS) in 4 hospitals under the SHP.
In order to ensure good quality, two hospital softwares were developed, under the same
technical requirements, and implemented - HIS1 in Zrenjanin and HIS2 in Kraljevo,
Valjevo and Vranje. Also, in order to ensure good quality of the purchased items/outputs
and their compliance with the specified requirements (patient medical data, support of
business processes, mandatory reporting) an additional process of quality assessment was
performed as a part of the final acceptance in June 2008. All of the main business
requirements (admission/discharge, inpatient departments, outpatient departments,
diagnostic departments, laboratory and central hospital pharmacy) and the detailed
technical requirements were met, and the overall results of the international quality
assessment for both HISs were satisfactory. Final acceptances for both systems were
performed in June 2008. The MOH holds the proprietary rights over those applications.

Hospital information systems (HIS1 an HIS2) are the results of the SHP (see paragraph
above). SHPAF provided upgrading of both systems according to The Rulebook on more

Detailed Contents of Technological and Functional Requirements for the Establishing the
Integrated Health Information System, issued in November 2009 (see paragraph below)
and implementation in all 20 hospitals. During the project, with the support of ProRec
Serbia, HIS2 (called Heliant) was certified by the EuroRec Institute. Also, the project
provided procurement and implementation of the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
which is connected with analyzers and automatically receives results from analyzers in 20
hospitals 15 and IT equipment for RIS-PACS software for 6 hospitals 16 . Radiology
Information System (RIS-PACS) is state-of-the-art digital technology for processing
radiological images. Basing such a system on web technology allows data to be accessed
from different locations within a medical facility, as well as from remote locations
outside the institution, which is the basis of telemedicine. In the course of 2012, during
the warranty period, all systems (HIS, LIS and RIS) will be integrated.

2.3.5. IT Strategy, Regulation and Standardization
SHP provided creation and adoption of the Regulation named Program of Work,
Development and Organization of the Integrated Health Information System – e-Health
2015 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, Issue No. 55/2009) and Rulebook on
More Detailed Contents of Technological and Functional Requirements for the
Establishing the Integrated Health Information System - IT Rulebook (Official Gazette of
the Republic of Serbia, Issue No. 95/2009). In accordance with Action Plan of the e-
Health2015 program, the first iteration of the entire health care informatization will be
completed by 2015. The compliance of software with the IT Rulebook is mandatory for
existing software solutions, as well as for new ones. Implementation of software in
primary health care, within the DILS Project, is being carried out by each primary health
care centre by purchasing one of the 8 certified software solutions (the solution from
Kraljevo is one of these 8). With the support of SHP projects, ProRec Serbia, association
for standardization of EHR (Electronic Health Record) products, was founded in 2008
and became a full member of a EuroRec Institute (the European Institute for certification
and promotion of quality EHR systems). So, the European standards and requirements
were included in the IT Rulebook.

SHPAF provided implementation of the Information Security management System
(ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27000 in some departments of KBC Dragiša Mišović and
General Hospital in Zrenjanin. The international certification body will perform
assessment of compliance of the Zrenjanin system with ISO 27000. Additional value of
this activity is knowledge and experience regarding ISMS that will be implemented in the


15
  Hospitals included in the project: Clinical Center of Serbia - Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Clinical
Center Kragujevac - Surgery (the whole building), Institute for Mother and Child, Clinical Hospital Center
“Dr Dragiša Mišović - Dedinje?, general hospitals in Vrbas, Sremska Mitrovica, Šabac, Požarevac,
Jagodina, Smederevska Palanka, Aleksinac, Zaje?ar, Užice, Leskovac, Petrovac na Mlavi, Surdulica,
Gornji Milanovac, Novi Pazar, the Narodni front Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Institute of Mental
Health in Palmotićeva St. in Belgrade. The last 4 hospitals are co-financed from SHPAF and IPA projects.

new version of the IT Rulebook (DILS project, 2012). So, the requirements related to the
ISMS (ISO 27000) will become mandatory for all IT and healthcare providers.

2.3.6. Wide Area Network for Health Institutions
SHPAF includes the installation of WAN, the infrastructure for data exchange
(scheduling specialist examinations at the hospital level by selected doctors, access to
electronic health record by a hospital specialist, integration of the primary health care
software with Laboratory Information System which belongs to referral hospital. WAN
connects over 360 institutions of the health sector. Through a joint effort of the MOH
(SHPAF) and the Ministry of Defense, WAN will be also be connected to the Ministry of
Defense Health System that is already on the way of integration with the main health
network operated by MOH.

2.4. Capacity Building and Communication of the Ministry of Health

2.4.1. PR Activities and Patient Information Campaigns
Public relations (communication) in the MOH and overall public health system was
constantly improving thought SHP project. With engagement of local and international
technical support, SHP developed the MOH communication strategy and was
instrumental in supporting implementation of the strategy through following activities:
supporting the PR-Communication Unit (3 persons) that was established in MOH. The
position of the PR officer has been introduced in all 400 health institutions in Serbia,
including IPH and RHIF. In cooperation with American International Republican
Institute (IRI), more than 400 persons passed elementary media and communication
training; Two large-scale public information campaigns were conducted, which pushed
the issue of a patient’s position within the health system towards the top of the agenda:
increasing knowledge about patient’s rights, and improving communication between
patients and health professionals. Other PR campaigns of the MOH (anti-smoking
campaigns, HIV/AIDS, avian flu, the World Health Day, waiting lists, restriction of
patient’s rights in dental services) were all supported by the SHP through provision of
technical assistance; PR staff was also part of the SHP implementation team in order to
provide constant communication activities, increasing the visibility of the project in
public (general and professional). Following increasing media coverage of the health
issues, the public became an important quality control instrument. Better information of
patients helped in raising awareness needed for decreasing out-of-pocket payment and
increasing utilization of “free? health services and increased overall patient satisfaction
with the health care system (measured and controlled by the project PR team).

2.4.2. Health Survey of the Republic of Serbia
The 2006 Health Survey of the Republic of Serbia (the 2006 NHS) was a follow-up
survey of the NHS, 2000, which had been carried out before the democratic changes in
October of the same year. The 2006 NHS pursued practically the same methodology, so
that the results of that study provide a solid foundation to evaluate the effects of the
MOH’s work on the reform, development of the health care system and health protection
and promotion among the Serbian population. The 2006 NHS used a representative
sample of the Serbian population over 7 years of age, at the national level and at the level



                                            47
of six geographical regions: Vojvodina, Belgrade, Western Serbia, Central Serbia,
Eastern Serbia and Southeastern Serbia, as well as at the level of urban and non-urban
settlements. The following persons were interviewed: 6,156 households, 14,522 adults
aged 20+ years and 2,721 children and adolescents aged 7–19 years. The health survey
provided precious data on social and economic health determinants, health status based
on self-assessment of individuals, lifestyles, functional abilities, use of health care
services and expenditures associated with health care.

3. Project Management, Monitoring, Evaluation

a) Initial Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was staffed with Director, Administrative
Assistant, Procurement Specialist and Financial Specialist. The only programmatic full-
time consultants during the first nine months of operation were four field coordinators
and a PR officer. The first year of operation was marked with the fact that Director
resigned after less than six months, leaving PCU without leadership for more than 6
months. This period was also marked with low commitment and disbursement of funds,
establishing unsatisfactory status for the project. From, the beginning of the second year,
PCU was fully staffed and Health Financing and Quality units were set up. Project picked
up pace, especially after restructuring in 2005 and more than 100 contracts were signed.
In terms of implementation, the monitoring unit was reporting on a weekly basis during
the period of intensive implementation while there was an imminent need to secure the
satisfactory status. After regaining the status, the reporting both to the Ministry and the
WB was delivered on a needs basis, without insisting on regularity.

b) The experience and solid work of the unit was recognized by both the GoS and the
Bank and the implementation arrangements were changed in 2009 through establishment
of the Fiduciary Services Unit (FSU) composed of the project finance and procurement
staff. This FSU was additionally staffed and appointed by the GoS to support multi-sector
Delivery of Improved Local Services (DILS) Project 17. Thus, the FSU was successfully
supporting both DILS and SHPAF in terms of procurement, financial management and
overall coordination. Since each ministry was allowed to form its own consultants
implementation team MOH used the same people to implement SHPAF and DILS. All
component coordinators (IT, Quality and Health Financing) were coordinators for both
projects ensuring complementarities and coordination of activities. Monitoring of both
projects was regular in a sense that responsible WB staff was situated in Belgrade and
Sarajevo, allowing intensive communication and consultation. Combined DILS and
SHPAF Aide Memoires were used as reporting documentation. MOH was using
Ministerial Collegiums and standard government reporting as management tools. From
mid-2011, the steering board was established by the new Minister of Health and reporting
was additionally channeled through the conclusions of the steering board meetings.

C. Comments on the Draft ICR from the Ministry of Health

            MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

    COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT FINAL REPORT OF THE WORLD BANK
     REGARDING «SERBIA HEALTH PROJECT» AND «SERBIA HEALTH
               PROJECT – ADDITIONAL FINANCING»

Paragraph 4 – Serious challenge that the system of financing was facing at the
beginning of the project, beside already mentioned, was also a lack of the IT system in
HIF that would enable evidence-based management and functioning of the system. For
instance, there was no Database of Insurees, whose creation and operationalization was
strongly supported by the Serbia Health Project activities.

Subtitle 1.7 Other significant changes – As it was mentioned in the text in paragraphs
16-19, project has been restructured in June 2005. However, during the restructuring
certain ammount of funds have been unallocated. Therefore after restructuring, at the end
of 2005, it has been decided (with World Bank collaboration) that those funds should be
used for the reconstruction of the flu vaccine production line on the Institute for
virusology, vaccines and serums «Torlak». That represented significant change.

Paragraph 33 – It is correct that one of the reasons for Unsatisfactory rating for project
implementation in December 2004 was resignation of the PCU Director. However,
additional problem was that, after that resignation, PCU was without Director for the
following 9 months. That significantly slowed project implementation and made it more
difficult and, in combination with other factors, led to project restructuring.

Paragraph 42 – It is correct, as it is already mentioned in this Paragraph, that
responsibilities for provision of health services are indeed tranferred from State to local
level of government as part of the decentralization process. Nevertheless, that is correct
only for primary health care, and not for all levels of health care, as text in this Paragraph
could be understood. This difference should be clearly underlined in the text.

Paragraph 44 – International Committee of Red Cross should also be mentioned in this
Paragraph next to Canadian International Development Agency and European
Commission, as an organization that identified introduction of capitation as an area that
Serbia needs support in. ICRC project in Kraljevo (2000-2004) through its activities
started work on introduction of capitation through pilot project in Kraljevo Primary
Health Care Center.

Paragraph 48, Outcome indicator #1 – Next to already mentioned guidelines, through
its activities project supported development and introduction of Integrated Plans of
Quality Improvement (gives guidelines for improvement of quality of healthcare and
patient safety in an institution); Guideline for Clinical Practice Guidelines (enables that
CPGs are made in accordance with international practice, what strengthens evidence-




                                             50
based health care provision); Guidelines for improvement of control and reduction of
hospital acquired infections; and Standards for Accreditation.

Paragraph 65 – Next to already mentioned projects, close coordination and synergies
have been achieved with more EU funded projects, like «Support to the Agency for
Accreditation of Health Care Institutions of Serbia», «Health Management Training» and
«Support to Introduction of the National Program for early Detection of Cancer in
Serbia».

Paragraph 66 – It is mentioned in this Paragraph that additional support to IT
investments comes from the EU, that in coordination with MOH, supports certain number
of hospitals through IT investments. That number of hospitals is 19, and not 40 as it is
mentioned in the text.

Paragraph 74 – It is necessary to correct numeration of the Paragraphs, after Paragraph
74

Chapter 6. Lessons Learned – In this chapter there should be added another Paragraph
with comment that European Commission is withdrawing from health projects, and that it
makes continuous and consistent support of the World Bank in health sector in Serbia
ever more important.

Paragraph 73, 72 and 75 – Procurement process that caused the delays mentioned in
Paragraph 75 did not concern the DRG Software, but it concerned a licence (right) to use
appropriate diagnostic related groups classification system (DRG Classification System).
That procurement process took additional 7 months due to solving of the certain issues
that were less about procurement process, but more about format and provisions of the
contract. This same omission (mentioning of the DRG Software instead of Licence for
DRG Classification System) is found in Paragraphs 73 and 72.
