PROYECTO DE RECOLECCION, TRATAMIENTO Y DISPOSICION DE AGUAS

REPUBLICA DOMINICANA
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1. Introduction
The region of Puerto Plata, Sosua, and Caberete is one of the most important tourist destinations in the
Dominican Republic. Known as the North Coast, this area has been largely developed by private
investors and presently contains 197 hotels with a total of 14,698 rooms available. The project area,
Sosua comprises 38% of the regions hotel capacity or 4,425 rooms.
The North coast is generally composed of a combination of rocky (limestone or Karstic) cliffs. Ocean
access is limited to a few beaches located between cliff areas in zones of relatively gentle, low relief.
Geologically, these choice development areas are shallow bays where sand has deposited over the
limestone bedrock. Ground water in these zones is shallow (less than 10 meters depth) and consists
fresh, freatic waters perched above saltwater intruding from the ocean. The composition of sand and
limestone promotes rapid transmission of water in this area and as a result, groundwater rises and falls
with the daily tide. The depth of groundwater varies with the terrain reaching closer to the ground surface
as it approaches the shore.
Development of the Sosua tourism industry began largely in the 1970's with the majority of investment
occurring between 1980 to present. Waste management systems are largely private and local to the
individual hotel sites. As a result public, community services are virtually non- existant.
Typically, the technology employed in Sosua, for the disposal of sanitary wastes reflects older (pre 1970)
technologies. Wastewater management for the majority of the hotels consists of septic systems
discharging to local leaching fields. Depending on the proximity to the coast and the size of the hotel,
discharges often overwhelm the soil capacity to receive these discharges. In many cases, sanitary wastes
percolate to the surface with the rising tide often saturating the surface in the area of the leaching field.
Additionally, the waste discharge load frequently represents a significant volume of discharge water.
Because of the local geology (sand lying above a bedrock base) these discharges represent a potentially
significant source of energy for beach erosion. Water pressure from accumulated discharges, particularly
during the low tide cycle, tend to mobilize deeper sands pushing them off shore. This phenomena seems
to be contributing to beach erosion in the region which is presently considered a critical problem for the
area.
As would be expected, induced development or secondary development in Sosua has followed the hotel
industry. Shops, restaurants, housing and other commercial development has occurred, usually without
benefit of planning or supporting infrastructure. In these cases, wastewater management largely consists
of underground discharges, with or without benefit of septic systems, or surface discharges to river or
ocean receiving waters. In Sosua, these systems serve an estimated 32,000 inhabitants.
Wastewater management needs for the Sosua area have reached critical levels. Infrastructure for both
the hotel investment community and the population in general is urgently needed to reverse the continuing
trends in local resource degradation.
To address the problem, the Government of The Dominican Republic has constructed a wastewater
treatment plant in the vicinity of the International Airport of Sosua. To connect this system with the Sosua

community and provide for the ultimate discharge of waste from the plant, the Government of the
Dominican Republic is seeking a Learning and Innovation Loan from the World Bank. The purpose of this
loan is to connect the Sosua community to the wstewater treatment system and construct a small diameter
submarine discharge from the treatment plant to adjacent marine waters at a depth of 140 meters. This
discharge is designed to provide for ultimate disposition of Sosua wastewaters in a safe and cost effective
manner with minimum associated environmental impacts.
Because of the potential for significant environmental impacts, this project was classified as Category A
under the World Bank environmental classification system. This study was undertaken by the Unidad
Ejecutora del Programa, of the Secretariado Tecnico de la Presidencia of the Dominican Republic. The
principal environmental concern associated with the project is in the construction and operation of the
submarine discharge from the treatment plant.
A total of four alternative discharge sites were considered as part of this study. Three candidate sites
were eliminated due to either cost or potential significant negative environmental impacts. The site
selected possesses a number of desirable characteristics and represents the application of innovative
technology in two respects. First the discharge is a small diameter system. The second is the depth of
the discharge. While originally planed for a depth of 40 meters, the current design calls for the discharge
to be located at a depth of 140 meters.
1.2. Description of the Project
This project consists of three basic parts. These are:
- The design and construction of the waste collection system from the service community to the
treatment plant site.
*  Improvements to the existing treatment plant to remove grease, oils and solids.
*  The construction of the ultimate submarine discharge from the treatment plant.
1.2.1. Collection of Wastewaters
As proposed, the collection of wastewaters from the service community is designed to utilize the existing
collection network to the extent possible. Under this design, a series of connecting pipes will be located to
join the various existing systems to the Sosua treatment plant. Gravity drainage systems will be employed
where possible and the entire system will include the installation of 5 pumping stations. Service will be
connected to the Sosua Airport, The community of La Uni6n, and the community of Sosua. Population
projections for the service area by the year 2020 are estimated at 48,011 local year round residents and a
population of approximately 17,003 tourists. This results in a projected population of 65,014 residents
total. The collection network will serve approximately 83% of the community.
To connect the existing wastewater drainage system to the treatment plant, a series of 10 collecting pipes
will be installed with diameters ranging from 8 to 18 inches in diameter. This system is projected to
consist of approximately 10,247 meters of new collection pipe with the three longest installations serving
the Military base, the Sosua Airport, and the community of La Union or 2,400 m, 1,600 m, and 3,500
respectively.
1.2.2. Pumping Stations
A series of five pumping stations are planned for the project. These are to be located within the network at
the Military Base, Sosua Abajo, Batey Oeste, Playa Sosua, and Terramar. The number of pumping
stations have been minimized through the use of gravity based drainage systems where appropriate.
Pump capacities vary with location with two small pumps being located at the Military base and SosCa
Abajo (14.50 and 20.37 m3/hour). The three larger pumps are to be located at Batey Oeste, Playa Sosua
and Terramarwith pumping capacities of 117.73, 67.72 and 214.59 m3/hour respectively.

1.2.3. Treatment Plant
At this writing, the basic treatment plant has been constructed by the Government of the Dominican
Republic. Under this project, this treatment plant will be improved with the additijon of a pre-treatment
system to include the removal of large solids, installation of micro-strainers for fine solids removal and a
system for the removal of floating solids and grease. Solids collected from the pre-treatment system will
be deposited in the regional solid waste landfill proposed under a different LIL. The design of the pre-
treatment unit will include the installation of an emergency by-pass system to be used, if necessary, during
system maintenance operations.
The pre-treatment system is to be co-located with the existing plant and will discharge through this plant to
the submarine discharge system.
1.2.4. Submarine Discharge
The final part of the wastewater treatment system proposed in this project consists of a small diameter
submarine discharge designed to transmit wastes from the treatment plant to a location due north of the
plant at a depth of 140 meters. In the development of the criteria for this discharge, a series of four
scenarios were considered 4 in the design and location of this discharge.
The submarine discharge planned for this project became the principal focus of this environmental
assessment as this is the one component of the project with potential significant negative environmental
impacts. During the development of this study, the original proposed location for the discharge was found
unsatisfactory as the impacts of its construction and operation affected one of the two important coral reef
systems in the region. As part of this study, alternative sites were examined which resulted in the
selection of the proposed site. A more complete discussion of the evaluation and selection process is
presented in the following sections of this summary.
1.3. Affected Environment
The project location is in the area of Sosua, Dominican Republic. As part of the North Coast tourism area,
the area has been a popular tourist destination for over 30 years. Over this time, the level of tourism
investment has grown and the population of the region has increased as a result of secondary
development As part of the North Coast system, SosCia represents approximately 30% of the region's
tourism investment.
1.3.1. Physical Environment
Physically, the region is a coastal zone composed of a rough, rocky coast with a series of beach
embayments distributed between the coastal cliffs that dominate the area. This structure proceeds
westward from Sosua toward Caberete where the landscape changes in character from cliff coast to
beaches bordered by sand dunes. South of the project area the terrain is initially composed of a flat,
coastal plain for approximately 10 Km where it encounters a karstic ridge system which rises abruptly from
the plain. In general, the area from the mountains to the coast is composed of a series of wetlands
sustained by the freshwater discharge from the mountainous limestone formations. A coastal highway
heading east - west is generally located in the area of a coastal dune system which generally serves to
maintain the wetlands to the south. Development in the area is largely distributed in a narrow belt
between the highway and the coast due to the proximity of the beaches. Land use to the south of the road
is largely agricultural with the majority of agriculture in the form of sugar cane.
In the vicinity of the coast, soils vary in depth lying on a substrate of limestone. Groundwaters are close to
the surface and occur in sandy soils with high transmission rates. Sea level influence on these
groundwaters is strong and groundwater rises and falls with the tide. As waters approach the coast,
saltwater contamination rises rendering these waters unsuitable for consumption.
Winds are predominantly from the northwest and rainfall in the area averages 1,446 mm per year.

1.3.2. Biological Environment
Biologically, the project area is heavily disturbed as human activity has resulted in most of the are being
converted to human uses. There are remnant patches of local plant communities located in the vicinity of
the airport and along stream drainages in the area. These remaining plant communities are also heavily
disturbed. Bordering the project area to the south, between the mountains and the coastal highway are a
series of inter connected wetlands. This area is largely composed of sedges, rushes, and grasses which
grow on a thin soil over lying the ancient beach area. These wetlands are subject to periodic inundation
occurring after rains and with the tidal cycle. Fresh groundwater occurs below the surface and rises and
falls with the tide.
The near shore coast is composed of rocky cliffs dotted with occasional beaches. The marine systems
nearshore are a mixture of patch reefs and rocky coast communities depending on local conditions.
Development and human intervention has greatly damaged the existing reef systems in the region. One
notable exception is the reef located north of the International Airport. This system covers approximately 4
Km. and occurs from a depth of approximately 3 m to 30 m. This reef is one of the two systems important
to the SCUBA industry of the region.
Endangered species in the area are limited to sea turtles which are infrequently found in the project area.
1.3.3. Socioeconmic Environment
Economically, the project area is dominated by the tourism industry. This is the principal source of income
for local inhabitants and provides a significant source of revenue for the Dominican Republic in general.
Other industries in the region include associated commercial development and sugar cane agriculture. By
far, the majority of inhabitants derive their living, either directly or indirectly from the tourism sector within
the project area.
Public health is generally good and the local citizens experience a relatively comfortable standard of living.
Invasion of land and lack of suitable waste management infrastructure (solid waste and sanitary wastes)
continue to present a threat to local environmental quality. This is expected to increase with the
expansion of the tourism investment in the region.
1.4. Evaluation of Project Alternatives
The evaluation of project alternatives largely focused on the location and design of the submarine
discharge.
1.4.1. Waste Transport
Alternatives for the collection system were not considered as the system is to be connected with the
existing system and the pumping stations and location of new connections is dictated entirely by
engineering requirements. Aside from the usual impacts associated with construction, such as noise, dust
etc. No significant impacts associated with the collection of wastes were identified.
1.4.2. Waste Treatment
Several alternatives were examined for the design of the pre-treatment plant to be constructed under this
project. Plant siting was dictated by the location of the existing treatment plant and alternate sites were
not considered. Technology to be employed in the pre-treatment of wastes was examined from the
perspective of
1. Engineering feasibility and costs.
2. Maintenance, operation and sustainability

3. Ability to achieve acceptable discharge standards from both health and environmental
perspectives.
Of the technologies evaluated, consideration was given to advanced technologies and technologies
requiring chemical treatments. These were eliminated form further consideration based on costs and
realities associated with local operation and maintenance of such systems.
Given the construction of the existing plant, treatment alternatives focused on 3 basic options. These
were:
• Alternative 1 - Use the existing UASB plant and install solids and grease removal systems in the
form of a pretreatment facility.
* Alternative 2 - Modify the existing plant to include solids and grease removal capability
* Alternative 3 - Provide treatment for solids and grease and discharge effluents directly, bypassing
the existing UASB.
Alternative 1 was selected as the most cost effective and, because of the improved treatment of wastes
prior to discharge, represented the most desirable option in terms of reductions in discharge contaminants.
Additionally, the no-action alternative was evaluated and found to be unsuitable based on the current
conditions and anticipated future growth for the region. The socioeconomic impacts of a no-action
alternative were considered major and unacceptable.
1.4.3. Final Disposition
Options for final discharge of treated wastewater included the following:
1. Underground Injection
2. Discharge to surface receiving waters
3. Reuse of discharge waters for irrigation
4. Submarine discharge
Local geology and physical characteristics of the area eliminated options 1 and 2 from consideration.
Underground injection is limited to discharge to subsurface soils. Bedrock limestone occurs ciose to the
surface and the local soil/groundwater regime does not have sufficient capacity to accept the projected
discharge loads. Reuse of wastewaters for irrigation is an appealing alternative however there is no
regional demand for such a system. As a result, submarine discharge became the option of choice both
from a cost and management perspective.
Based on this finding, the environmental analysis focused on the submarine discharge. Using the original
engineering recommendations as the basis for the evaluation, a review of the proposed discharge site
revealed the presence of an important coral reef system in the project area. After discussion with the
project engineers, four alternative locations for the submarine discharge developed. The criteria employed
were to identifiy locations which:
1. Minimized or eliminated construction and operation impacts to the reef system.
2. Protected the reef from excess nitrogen and phosphate discharges.
3. Protected beach and coastal areas from excess contamination.
4. Protected waters likely to be used by tourists and citizens from excess bacterial contamination.

5. Minimization of construction costs.
Based on these criteria, four candidate locations were identified within the project area. These were:
1. Alternative 1, Directly north, to a depth of 140 meters from the treatment plant.
2. Alternative 2, From a point at the eastern end of the airport and north to a depth of 40 meters.
3. Alternative 3, From Punta Sos0a north to a depth of 40 meters (west of point 2).
4. Alternative 4, A point at the western end of the airport north to a depth of 40 meters (Calet6n).
In the evaluation of these alternative locations, alternative 3 was eliminated as it crossed the diving reef
and presented possible significant economic and biological impacts. Alternative 4 was eliminated based
on greatly increased costs. Alternative 2 was environmentally acceptable but presented construction
difficulties and slight risks to the reef system.
Alternative 4 was considered best based on costs and biological considerations. Key to the selection of
this alternative was the depth proposed for the discharge. At below 100 meters, this discharge falls in an
area where long-shore ocean currents provide a strong potential for rapid lateral dispersion of discharged
materials. Furthermore, at the depth proposed, the discharge lies below a density gradient and
thermocline restricting the discharge distribution to waters below 100 meters. In summary, the proposed
location (alternative 1) was selected based on the following:
1. Contaminants restricted to below the thermocline and density gradient, below 100 meters.
2. Deep currents carry contaminants away from coastal areas.
3. Dilution is rapid and contaminants likely to affect the only the area immediate to the discharge
array.
4. No significant biological communities exist in the proposed location.
1.5. Recommended Alternative
Based on the evaluation of environmental impacts and engineering constraints, recommended alternative
for sanitary waste management for Sosua is the following:
*  Construct the waste collection system as planned based on the engineering requirements for
transport and location.
*  Install the pretreatment system designed to remove grease, floatable solids and fine solids
and discharge to the existing treatment plant prior to ultimate discharge. Dispose of the solid
residues in the proposed sanitary landfill.
*  Discharge wastes via submarine discharge to a point due north of treatment plant at a depth
of 140 meters.
1.6. Significant Environmental Impacts
Based in the implementation of the proposed alternative, the environmental impacts anticipated are
considered minor. The environmental impacts identified are largely associated with the impacts of
construction, some minor disturbance of the coastal vegetation and alteration of the submarine community
in the immediate vicinity of the submarine discharge pipe. The depth of the discharge array greatly
Pagina- 6



Borrador lnforine Finzal
25 de abril, 1999
eliminates marine biological impacts except in the immediate area of the discharge array. Rapid
dispersion and dilution of the discharge limits this impact.
Construction, operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment system represent the principal
sources of potential negative environmental impacts resulting form the project. Poor construction
promoting leakage of transmission lines, failure of the operator to properly dispose of solids collected from
the system and failure to maintain the submarine discharge in good working order are the principal risks
from the project.
1.7. Mitigation of Impacts and Costs
The mitigation of the environmental impacts associated with this project are largely related to insuring that
the design and construction is adequately implemented, personnel are adequately trained and that the
operation of the facility complies with the project requirements over the life of the project. Based on the
implementation of the recommended alternative, the design and operation of the system, as conceived is
relatively simple. If constructed well, the project will likely present a minimum of maintenance costs to the
operator. The need for preventative maintenance activities is largely limited to servicing pumps, periodic
pipe inspection, and the operation of the treatment plant.
The summary of environmental management costs are presented in the following table. The total costs for
the environmental component are estimated at $313,000 to be expended over the life of the project.
Costs and activities are divided among the Planning and Design Phase of the project and the operational
phase of the project.

2. OBJETIVO Y NECESIDAD DEL PROYECTO
2.1. Objetivo
El Banco Mundial apoya a la Republica Dominicana en la ejecucion de un proyecto de recolecci6n,
tratamiento y disposici6n final de aguas residuales en ia comunidad de SosCia. Este proyecto, financiado a
traves de un Prestamo de Aprendizaje e Innovacion (LIL, Learning and Innovation Loan), permitira
introducir tecnologias nuevas al pals, y sus resultados serviran de base para la implementaci6n de futuras
soluciones de saneamiento en otras zonas turisticas.
Durante los ultimos 30 ahos, la parte de la costa norte de la Republica Dominicana comprendida entre
Puerto Plata y Cabarete ha sido objeto de un importante desarrollo turistico, llevado a cabo
principalmente por la inversi6n de empresas locales y extranjeras. La ciudad de Sosua ha sido uno de los
focos principales de este desarrollo, contando en la actualidad con una oferta habitacional turistica de
mas de 3,000 habitaciones.
Este proyecto contempla la terminaci6n del sistema de recolecci6n de aguas residuales de la ciudad de
Sosuia, el pretratamiento de dichas aguas y su posterior descarga al oceano a traves de un emisario
submarino. Las metas del proyecto han sido definidas en funci6n de sus beneficios ambientales como
sigue: (i)asegurar la infraestructura y la calidad ambiental necesarias para mantener e incrementar la
industria turistica; (ii) asegurar playas libres de contaminaci6n visual; (iii) proteger la salud de los bahistas
asegurando playas limpias de contaminaci6n bacteriana; (iv) asegurar el mantenimiento de los corales; y
(v) proteger la salud pOblica (Farrer, 1998).
2.2. Necesidad del Proyecto
El rbpido desarrollo turistico y urbano en la comunidad de Sosua ha resultado en un servicio deficiente de
recolecci6n y manejo de aguas residuales municipales. Estas deficiencias conlievan el deterioro de la
calidad ambiental de la zona, en particular en terminos de salud publica, amenazando con afectar la
industria que soporta la economia de esta zona: el turismo.
En afos recientes el gobierno dominicano ha hecho inversiones en la construcci6n de un sistema colector
de aguas servidas y de una planta de tratamiento en la zona. Ambas infraestructuras se encuentran en
fase de terminaci6n. El LIL permitira completar y adecuar estas instalaciones, garantizando descargar las
aguas residuales sin causar afectaciones al ambiente en las playas o a la salud de los turistas y de la
poblaci6n en general.
3. MARCO DE REFERENCiA SOBRE LAS POLITICAS, ASPECTOS LEGALES Y
ADMINISTRATIVOS
3.1. Objetivos
Los objetivos principales de este componente del estudio de impacto ambiental son: (I) identificar la
reglamentaci6n ambiental existente sobre descargas submarinas de aguas residuales en zonas costeras;
(ii) identificar las entidades gubernamentales con responsabilidad directa en la gesti6n ambiental de este
tipo de descargas de aguas residuales, 'y (iii) estudiar la estructura administrativa y los recursos de las
instituciones y organizaciones directamente relacionadas con las medidas de prevenci6n y control de la
contaminaci6n ambiental de las descargas de aguas residuales en el medio maritimo.
Como objetivos secundarios del Proyecto LIL2 aunque no menos importantes se pueden mencionar: el
mejoramiento de la situacion sanitaria y la reduccidn de los riesgos higienicos de la poblaci6n que habita
la regibn y de los turistas nacionales y extranjeros que visitan la zona; contribuci6n a la limpieza de las
playas y disminuir la contaminaci6n visual; el mejoramiento y control de ia calidad del agua potable; el
mejoramiento de ia evacuaci6n de las aguas residuales superficiales y de las descargas de origen
comercial y de efluentes industriales.

Borrador Intfornie Fiiial
25 de abril, 1999
Como resultado de este estudio, se formularan recomendaciones orientadas a organizar ylo fortalecer las
instituciones directamente responsables del manejo del proyecto, incluyendo programas de
adiestramiento del personal administrativo y tecnico para aplicar la reglamentaci6n especifica para la
operacion eficiente y eficaz de este proyecto piloto en la Republica Dominicana.
Si bien existen proyectos en ia Republica Dominicana de descarga submarina en el mar (Puerto Plata y
Playa Dorada), la construcci6n, y monitoreo de las operaciones del emisario submarino de aguas
residuales en el litoral costero con las caracteristicas del proyecto bajo estudio no tiene antecedentes en
el pals. En consecuencia, la experiencia institucional y administrativa en el manejo ambiental de este tipo
de proyecto es mas bien escasa o inexistente y habra que implementar la capacidad institucional
necesaria para el desarrollo de las actividades correspondientes
El proyecto debe satisfacer ademas las necesidades ambientales del desarrollo turistico del area para un
horizonte de programaci6n definido preliminarmente hasta el ano 2020.
3.2. Marco Legal e Institucional
La Republica Dominicana tiene una larga trayectoria ambiental que se remonta al an'o 1911 con la
promulgaci6n de la Ley de Policfa a la cual se le asignan funciones de aseo, higiene y ornato de las
poblaciones. Algunos anos despues, en el ano 1928 el pals promulga la Ley 1052 creando el Vedado del
Rio Yaque. Con posterioridad el pais aprob6 leyes, decretos, resoluciones y reglamentos sobre
protecci6n del medio ambiente y los recursos naturales, mayormente en subsectores tales como recursos
forestales, flora y fauna, areas protegidas y otros.
Durante la decada de 1962 a 1973, el pals inicia una segunda fase de su desarrollo institucional del
sector ambiental. El crecimiento industrial incremento la descarga de efluentes contaminantes en casi
todos los cursos de agua particularmente de la capital y en consecuencia las descargas de aguas sin
tratamiento adecuado.
Desde 1962 a 1977 se aprobaron una serie de leyes y decretos que configuran un sistema de manejo
ambiental complejo, de caracter sectorial y circunstancial, diluyendo las responsabilidades institucionales
en una serie de organizaciones con funciones superpuestas y tangenciales.
Entre otras las siguientes entidades y leyes de manejo del medio ambiente y de los recursos naturales
fueron creadas durante este periodo: el Instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (1965); el
Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidricos (1965);1a Ley de Control de la Explotaci6n y Conservaci6n de las
Aguas Subterraneas (1969); el Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos (1970); la Ley que crea la
Corporaci6n de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo (1973); ley de creaci6n de la Corporaci6n
de Acueductos y Alcantarillado de Santiago (1977), etc.
En resumen, a partir de la decada del 50 al 90 se aprobaron alrededor de 38 Leyes, 13 Decretos y 28
Resoluciones relacionadas con la protecci6n del medio ambiente y el manejo de los recursos naturales
del pals. Simultaneamente se crearon innumerables comisiones, comites u otras organizaciones que
compiicaron aun mas el uso racional de los recursos naturales y la protecci6n de la calidad del medio
ambiente.
A partir de 1990, las organizaciones ambientales no gubernamentales, los organismos de asistencia
internacional y las autoridades del pals comienzan a concretizar los esfuerzos para sistematizar en forma
coherente la politica ambiental y la reglamentaci6n pertinente. Gran parte de este notable giro se debe al
desarrollo de la industria del turismo, sector cuya tasa de crecimiento es en la actualidad la mas dinamica
del pais

Borrador lnfornte Final
25 de abril, 1999
Dentro de estos esfuerzos cabe destacar las siguientes leyes, decretos y resoluciones:
• Decreto 112-95 que declara de Interes Nacional ia Protecci6n de Playas y ia Red Arrecifal del
Pais y Prohibe Depositar Basura y Cualquier otro Desecho en las Playas. Crea el Consejo
Costero Marino.
* Ley 542-73. Resoluci6n del Congreso aprobando el Convenio Sobre Prevenci6n de la
Contaminaci6n del Mar por Vertimiento de Desechos y Otros Materiales.
* Convenio para la protecci6n y el desarrollo del Medio Marino en la Region del Caribe
(Acuerdo de Cartagena).
*  Convenci6n de las Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos del Mar, Desarrollo del Medio Ambiente
Marino en el Gran Caribe y
* La Convencion internacional para la Prevencion de la Contaminaci6n desde Barcos (Marpol
73/78)
*  Estos ultimos estan pendientes de ser ratificados por la Republica Dominicana
La mayor parte de estas iniciativas ha sido enfocada a solucionar situaciones y problemas ambientales
motivados principalmente por presiones de desarrollo econ6mico, turistico o industrial, o como respuesta
a ia sobrexplotaci6n de algunos recursos naturales. En otros casos, ha sido la ratificaci6n del pais a
conferencias, tratados y protocolos internacionales y/o regionales de indole ambiental.
En la actualidad la reglamentacion ambiental y los estandares de descarga de aguas residuales mediante
emisor submarino en el litoral costero es in existente. Las normas que podrian ser aplicables al proyecto,
los procedimientos administrativos de las instituciones y organismos sectoriales, provinciales y locales,
asi como sus respectivas responsabilidades en el manejo de proyectos de descarga de aguas residuales
en areas del litoral maritimo es incompleta y fragmentada en "instancias superpuestas unas a otras".
3.3. Reglamentacion Propuesta
La Republica Dominicana no dispone en la actualidad de una ley del medio ambiente que sirva de marco
unico a la polftica ambiental y uso de los recursos naturales del pafs. La reglamentaci6n ambiental
existente se encuentra dispersa en numerosos decretos, leyes y medidas que no establecen competencia
entre las agencias y diluyen la responsabilidad de gesti6n del medio ambiente y de los recursos naturales
en organismos a nivel nacional, sectorial y municipal que dificultan el manejo estrategico del medio
ambiente.
Con fecha reciente cabe mencionar dos (2) iniciativas en torno a la creaci6n de una ley marco o ley
general de protecci6n del medio ambiente y manejo de los recursos naturales: (I) el C6digo de Protecci6n
Ambiental y Calidad de Vida, y (ii) ia Ley General de Recursos Naturales, Protecci6n del Medio Ambiente
y Calidad de Vida.
3.3.1. C6digo de Protecci6n Ambiental y Calidad de Vida.
Este extenso documento (330 articulos) fue sometido en Agosto de 1998 por segunda vez a la Camara
de Diputados para su aprobaci6n. Se ha revisado detenidamente los articulos del proyecto de ley para
identificar disposiciones sobre requerimientos ambientales de proyectos de descargas de efluentes y/o
aguas residuales en el litoral maritimo.
El articulo 31 del Capitulo l1L, indica que es deber del Estado la protecci6n y uso adecuado de los
recursos  acufferos  interiores,  litorales  y  oceanicos  que  constituyen  la  zona  maritima.
Desafortunadamente, no indica cual entidad gubernamental tiene la responsabilidad de establecer las
normas tecnicas que reglamenten esta facilidad ni los estandares de calidad de agua que se descarguen
en el oceano Ser)ala solo que deben ser tratados de acuerdo a normas que establecera la " autoridad

ambiental' que se establezca. En el Capituio XX se le asigna esta responsabilidad a la Comisi6n Nacional
para el Medio Ambiente y se establecen sus funciones, y estructura. Esta entidad fue creada por medio
del Decreto 158-87. La unica menci6n acerca de la disposicion de aguas residuales se encuentra en el
Art. 128 indicando que toda facilidad hotelera, habitacional, deportiva, etc. debe contar con su
correspondiente sistema de disposici6n de aguas residuales. Los siguientes articulos -146 al 148-
establecen el Servicio de Vigilancia, y Custodia de las aguas costeras y la estructura del mismo.
La unica disposicion que establece el proyecto del C6digo de Proteccion Ambiental acerca de la calidad
de las aguas residuales indica que" mientras la Comisi6n Nacional elabore las normas para la Republica
Dominicana se adoptaran los parametros de la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud y del Programa de la
Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente (PNUMA).
3.3.2. Ley General de Recursos Naturales, Protecci6n del Medio Ambiente y Calidad de
Vida
El Secretariado Tecnico de la Presidencia en coordinaci6n con el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para
el Desarrollo, la Comisi6n Nacional para el Seguimiento a los Acuerdos de la Conferencia de las
Naciones Unidas sobre Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo y ia Comision Coordinadora del Sector Recursos
Naturales y Medio Ambiente a traves del Proyecto Capacidad 21 ha elaborado este proyecto de ley marco
ambiental.
Las siguientes leyes generales aprobadas en paises latinoamericanos en proceso de desarrollo han
servido de base te6rica para orientar este proyecto de ley. Estas son: la ley General del Medio Ambiente
y los Recursos Naturales de Nicaragua (1996); ia Ley 81 del Medio Ambiente de Cuba (1997); la Ley
General del Medio Ambiente de Honduras (1993); la Ley Base del Medio Ambiente de Chile (1994); la Ley
sobre Politica Nacional del Medio Ambiente de Brasil (1981) y la Ley # 99 del Medio Ambiente de
Colombia (1 993)
El proyecto de ley establece las definiciones btsicas necesarias para que el sector industrial, turistico y
comercial, el sector profesional y academico y la sociedad civil en general, comprendan y utilicen el
lenguaje apropiado en materia ambiental evitando lenguaje que pueda conducir a errores de
interpretaci6n en el diseno, ejecuci6n y monitoreo de proyectos a los cuales se les exija estudios de
impacto ambiental.
El Proyecto de Ley establece el Sistema Nacional Ambiental y de Recursos Naturales (SINARENA) como
un conjunto de orientaciones, normas, actividades, recursos, programas e instituciones que harian posible
la aplicaci6n, ejecuci6n, implementaci6n y puesta en marcha los principios, politicas, programas,
estrategias, etc. adoptados por los poderes publicos relativas al medio ambiente y los recursos naturales.
El Proyecto de Ley establece ademas el Consejo Nacional de Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente
como enlace entre los 6rganos y entidades del Sector Publico y del Sector Privado y tendra a su cargo la
formulaci6n de la Politica Nacional sobre Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente del Pais. Se transfieren a
la Secretaria de Estado de Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente entidad que seria creada por medio de
este proyecto de ley todas las entidades que venian realizando actividades en el sector del medio
ambiente.
En resumen, se estructuraria de esta manera un organismo rector a nivel nacional con la responsabilidad
y los recursos tecnicos, humanos, administrativos y econ6micos para desarrollar las funciones para las
cuales seria creado.
Con referencia a los requerimientos ambientales de descarga al mar de aguas residuales se indica en el
anteproyecto de ley que estos seran resueltos por la autoridad competente con base en los permisos que
se soliciten en su oportunidad y sera la autoridad la que impondra las condiciones necesarias para evitar
la contaminaci6n. (Capitulo IV, articulos 100 y 101).

Borrador Informe Final
25 de abril, 1999
Finalmente, el Capitulo II de la Contaminaci6n de ia Aguas, en los articulos 146 y 147 delega en la
Secretaria de Estado de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social la aprobaci6n de las descargas y autorizaci6n
previa de operaci6n de acuerdo a las normas y estandares que esta entidad establezca.
3.4. Instituciones con Responsabilidad de Manejo de Descargas de Aguas Residuales
Las instituciones nacionales y sectoriales con responsabilidad en esta materia cabe mencionar las
siguientes:
1. El instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillados (INAPA)
2. La Secretaria de Estado de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social
3. La Secretara de Estado de Turismo
4. La Secretaria de Estado de Obras Publicas y Comunicaciones
5. La Secretaria de Estado de Agricultura. (Subsecretaria de Recursos Naturales)
6. El Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos
7. La Corporacion de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo
8. La Corporaci6n de Acueductos y Alcantarillado de Santiago
9. El Instituto Nacional de Protecci6n Ambiental (INPRA)
A continuaci6n se describen brevemente las funciones, programas y responsabilidades de manejo y
control de calidad de agua potable y disposici6n de aguas residuales de algunas de las entidades
anteriormente mencionadas.
La racionalidad de este ejercicio es la busqueda de experiencia institucional y de disponibilidad de
recursos humanos calificados o potencialmente adiestrables en nuevas tecnicas de monitoreo ambiental
de emisores submarino de descarga de aguas residuales en el litoral costero para participar en el
desarrollo de este Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL).
3.4.1. Instituto Naciona/ de Aguas Potables y Alcantarillado (INAPA)
Creado en el aho, 1965 el INAPA tiene como funciones ejecutar todas las actividades relativas para
proveer a los habitantes de la Repuiblica un servicio adecuado de agua potable, disposici6n y tratamiento
de aguas residuales. Sus funciones incluyen las actividades de construcci6n, reforma, ampliaci6n,
explotaci6n y administraci6n de los sistemas de acueductos y alcantarillados sanitarios y pluviales. El
INAPA no dispone de normativa especifica sobre construcci6n, operaci6n y monitoreo de emisores
submarinos de descargas de aguas residuales en el mar.
3.4.2. La Secretaria de Estado de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social. (SESPAS). Direcci6n
de Saneamiento Ambiental.
Esta entidad es ia responsable de la aplicacion del Codigo de Salud. Supervisa y fiscaliza la calidad de
agua suministrada a los usuarios y controla el estado sanitario de los cuerpos de agua.
SESPAS en colaboraci6n con DIGENOR han elaborado la norma dominicana de aguas residuales
(NORDOM 436) estableciendo los requisitos que deberan cumplir los responsables de las descargas La
NORDOM 436 fue oficializada como norma de emergencia por la comisi6n Nacional de Normas y
Sistemas de Calidad, mediante Resoluci6n 3/91 del 11 de junio de 1991. No existe en la actualidad una
norma relativa acerca de ia calidad de descarga de aguas residuales en el mar mediante emisor
submarino.
Pagina- 12



Borrador Infornze Final
25 de abril, 1999
Sin embargo, el Plan Nacional de Saneamiento, preparado en septiembre de 1997 para el periodo 1997-
2000 seniala la urgencia de reorganizar la Division de Saneamiento Ambiental fortaleciendo la
organizaci6n, desarrollando programas de adiestramiento al personal y descentralizando el analisis de
calidad de aguas de descarga, fortaleciendo los laboratorios regionales a fin de prestar un mejor servicio
a la poblaci6n.
3.4.3. La Secretaria de Estado de Turismo.
Esta instituci6n tiene la responsabilidad de formular y reglamentar la politica y los programas de
desarrollo sustentable del sector turismo del pais. Es importante destacar que el sector turismo es en la
actualidad es sector econ6mico cuya tasa de crecimiento supera al sector agropecuario e industrial. De
acuerdo a la informacion disponible es el sector mas dinamico de la economia y el unico que inserta sus
actividades dentro de la filosofia del desarrollo econ6mico sostenible. (ver: "Propuesta Para una Politica
de Desarrollo Sostenible").Este documento describe sectorialmente las medidas y mejoras de la
prestaci6n de servicios turisticos a fin de hacerlo mas rentable y satisfactorio para los inversionistas y los
turistas que visiten el pals. Es importante recalcar los siguientes aspectos del documento de Politica de
Desarrollo Sostenible: (I) la creaci6n del Consejo Administrativo Costero Marino creado por Decreto con
el prop6sito de formular la reglamentaci6n ambiental del litoral maritimo y del cual SECTUR es miembro,
y (ii) la propuesta de un programa global de educacion ambiental y adiestramiento para hoteleros,
operadores de turismo, transportistas y adiestramiento y capacitaci6n de oficios de apoyo sectorial.
Se debe mencionar que SECTUR ha preparado en cooperaci6n con el BIDIINFRATUR uno de los
escasos documentos existentes sobre requisitos minimos necesarios para solicitud de no objeci6n a
proyectos con fragilidad ecol6gica. El documento establece tres fases para la aprobaci6n de un proyecto,
estableciendo claramente los documentos necesarios de la informaci6n previa y los requisitos de consulta
preliminar, nivel de anteproyecto y nivel de proyecto.
No cabe duda que para efectos del presente ernisor submarino, SECTUR tiene experiencia institucional y
la filosofia operacional apropiada para contribuir positivamente al desarrollo, y monitoreo del proyecto d
emisario submarino. Sin embargo, SECTUR no dispone de reglamentacion directamente relacionada con
la construccifn, operaci6n y monitoreo del proyecto del emisor submarino.
3.4.4. La Secretaria de Estado de Agricultura. Subsecretaria de Recursos Naturales.
Programa Ambiental Costero Marino.
Bajo el marco del proyecto de Manejo Integrado de los Recursos Costeros con Enfasis en las Areas
Turisticas Claves (MIRCAT) y con el apoyo de UNEP y USAID, se ha preparado un primer documento
definiendo elementos basicos de una estrategia de Manejo Integrado de los recursos Costero Marinos
para el desarrollo Sostenible del Sector Turistico.
El capitulo de Definici6n de las Estrategias recomienda tener planes de implementacion de caracter
inmediato, a mediano y largo plazo y fortalecer o " crear ;as instituciones responsables de la
implementaci6n y control de ;a politica ambiental, y otras medidas dentro de esta misma linea de
pensamiento (Paginas 140 y siguientes).
Considera solo tangencialmente medidas de control ambiental de proyectos de descargas en el litoral
costero mediante la tecnica de emisores submarinos.
De particular interes son las recomendaciones orientadas al fortalecimiento institucional de los organismo
ambientales mediante cursos, seminarios de capacitaci6n y adiestramiento en servicio a fin de preparar
recursos humanos calificados para el desarrollo sostenible del pais.
3.4.5. Instituto Nacional de Protecci6n Ambiental. (INPRA)
Este Decreto (216-980 es un buen inicio para detener la tendencia a la fragmentaci6n de las
institucionalidad dispersa asi como las responsabilidades y funciones de la vasta cantidad de
Pagina- 13
I

organizaciones, entidades, comisiones, etc. del sector ambiental Suprime un numero considerable de
Comisiones, Consejos y otras entidades e integra responsabilidades del sector ambiental en un solo
organismo rector de sector ambiental. Como era de esperar, la reglamentaci6n especifica y las normas de
descarga de aguas residuales mediante emisor submarino no estan explicitamente descritas, aunque
seniala algunas funciones relativas a ejercer el debido control de estas actividades( ver articulos g; h; 1; j y
otros)
3.4.6. Otras entidades
La Compania de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo; (CAASD); la Corporaci6n de Acueductos
y Alcantarillados de Santiago (CORAASAN) y el Instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado.
(INAPA) proveen servicios de descarga de aguas negras y agua potable en el resto del pais.
Desafortunadamente estas entidades tienen escasez cr6nica de fondos, baja recuperaci6n de costos de
servicios y mantenimiento y carencia de recursos humanos y tecnicos (principalmente laboratorios de
analisis de calidad de aguas negras de descargas) necesarios para contribuir al desarrollo y monitoreo
del proyecto del emisor submarino en el litoral costero.
3.4.7. ASONAHORES
Esta entidad que agrupa al sector privado hotelero  ha desarrollado sus propios sistemas y
procedimientos en colaboraci6n con SECTUR para proporcionar servicios de agua potable y
alcantarillado en los hoteles- de la zona turistica. Si bien los servicios que proveen en la actualidad son de
car6cter basico para el manejo ambiental, pareceria recomendable estudiar su integraci6n y coherencia
con la politica de desarrollo del sector turistico sostenible preconizada por SECTUR. Especialmente
desarrollando programas de educaci6n ambiental orientados al visitante, agencias de viajes, actividades
de ecoturismo algunas de las cuales son detrimentales para la protecci6n de la riqueza maritima de
corales y habitats maritimos en peligro en zonas costeras.
3.5.   Conclusiones
3.5.1. Legislaci6n y Reglamentaci6n
A pesar de la frondosa legislaci6n y reglamentaci6n del pals ,la actual situacion legal, institucional y
administrativa de la gesti6n ambiental no es adecuada a las expectativas del desarrollo turistico
sostenible, ni garantiza la protecci6n y conservacion del medio ambiente y de los recursos naturales.
3.5.2. Organizaciones y Entidades Nacionales y Sectoriales
La mayor parte de las entidades del sector publico dominicano tienen asignada alguna responsabilidad o
injerencia en el manejo y control de la contaminaci6n ambiental y/o de programas de conservaci6n de los
recursos naturales.
Estas responsabilidades han sido asignadas por decretos, resoluciones y/o leyes sin dotar recursos ni
presupuesto suficientes para desarrollar sus funciones.
Sus respectivos papeles en el diseno, manejo y control sanitario de la descargas de aguas residuales en
la zona costera es inexistente.
3.5.3. Normas de Calidad de Descarga de Aguas Residuales en el Mar
Con respecto a la adopci6n por el pais de normas de calidad de aguas residuales en el litoral costanero,
no parece recomendable la adopci6n de estandares de menor rigidez ambiental.
Por el contrario, si se considera la situaci6n actual del desarrollo turistico asi como el desarrollo
econ6mico e industrial para un horizonte de planificaci6n de unos 20 anos, es de prever que este
desarrollo industrial utilizara componentes de origen importado hasta cuando el pals desarrolle su propia
estructura productiva. Esto quiere decir que ocurriran descargas en el medio maritimo de componentes
Pagina- 14

25 de abril, 1999
quimicos, petroquimicos, metalurgicos y de cualquiera otra naturaleza y origen que en alguna forma se
descargarian en el litoral costero. Si  la existencia de normas de contaminaci6n preventivas, se
contaminarian los recursos naturales del litoral costero en el futuro.
3.6. Recomendaciones
1. Seria recomendable adoptar una legislaci6n ambiental moderna que incluya normas y estandares
de calidad ambiental evolutivos, incluyendo principios tales como "estado de la tecnologia
ambiental" y principios de "prevenci6n ambiental" con incentivos econ6micos para el sector
privado empresarial dentro de limites aceptables de desarrollo sostenible.
2. El costo de una buena gesti6n ambiental preventiva y operacional puede ser recuperable y puede
resultar en mayor apoyo por el sector privado, inversionistas o desarrolladores de proyectos que
la aplicacion de multas o penalizaciones.
3. El marco legal e institucional que se adopte, debe proporcionar los requisitos y normas estandar
para el cumplimiento de las reglamentaciones ambientales generales y las normas especificas de
calidad de descarga de aguas residuales en aguas costeras.
4. Este sistema deberia incluir dos (2 ) categorias de permisos: (1) un permiso de construcci6n para
iniciar un proyecto y (2) un permiso para la operaci6n del mismo.
5. La reglamentaci6n sobre descargas submarinas de aguas residuales en el litoral costero deberfa
ser adecuada a las condiciones econ6micas y ambientales propias de la Republica Dominicana,
tomando en consideraci6n a las utilizadas en paises desarrollados.
6. Hasta cuando se adopte una polftica ambiental integradora y una ley marco que regule todas las
actividades ambientales, los instrumentos minimos de control ambiental que se deben utilizar
son: (a) un sistema de licencias o permisos ambientales; (b) una declaraci6n de impacto
ambiental (DIA); (c) normas de calidad de las aguas residuales recomendadas por la OMS, el
PNUD y la Organizaci6n Panamericana de la Salud. (PAHO)
7. Se recomienda que se inicie a ia mayor brevedad un programa de capacitacion que incluya
adiestramiento en monitoreo de la disposici6n de aguas residuales via emisario submarino. El
costo de este programa deberia ser incluido en el analisis econ6mico de ia alternativa del
proyecto que se seleccione.
4. DESCRIPCION DEL PROYECTO
Los consultores contratados por el Unidad Ejecutora del Programa (UEP), para estudiar dentro del marco
del Proyecto Agua y Saneamiento de los Centros Turisticos, el Sistema de Alcantarillado Sanitario de
Sosua, y la disposici6n final de las aguas tratadas al Oceano Atlantico, mediante un emisario submarino,
entendieron que este proyecto se ajusta al buen desarrollo de un proyecto LIL (Learning and Innovation
Loan), por las razones siguientes:
1. El Proyecto esta muy avanzado en su primera etapa, financiada por el gobierno Dominicano; esta
etapa incluye: Redes de recolecci6n; Acometidas domiciliarias; Registros; Lineas de impulsi6n, y
Planta de Tratamiento (en construcci6n).
2. Se introduciran innovaciones de pre-tratamiento y descarga al mar, que pueden ser usadas en
otros proyectos.
3. El Proyecto sera completado en su diserio, construido y operando con un financiamiento del
Banco Mundial, y una innovaci6n en esta etapa es que sera manejado mediante una concesion al
sector privado.

4.1 Descripcion de las Obras
El proyecto LIL ha sido concebido como el conjunto de obras necesarias para concluir y poner en
funcionamiento el alcantarillado sanitario de Sosua, disenado y parcialimiente construido por el INAPA,
completando el sistema de recoleccion, ahiadiendo lineas de impulsi6n y estaciones de bombeo,
terminando la planta de tratamiento y construyendo un emisario submarino para la disposici6n final.
Ubicado en la vicindad del Aeropuerto Sosua (figura 1), el proyecto contempla, ademas, adecuar las
estructuras para incluir las aguas residuales de la Base Aerea Militar, el aeropuerto de la Uni6n, y el
complejo habitacional del mismo nombre. En el Cuadro 1 se presenta la proyecci6n de poblaci6n en base
a la cual se ha dimensionado el proyecto.

5. CONDICIONES EXISTENTES
5.1. lnfraestructura Existente
La principal actividad econ6mica de la ciudad de Sosua es el turismo, y la infraestructura urbana se ha
desarrollado en funcion de este. El aeropuerto internacional que sirve a la costa norte del pais se ubica
en La Uni6n, a unos cuatro kil6metros de la zona urbana de Sosua. La ciudad cuenta ademas con
servicios urbanos de telecomunicaciones, transporte publico, y atenci6n medica.
*  La principal infraestructura industrial en las cercanias de Sosua es la planta procesadora de
productos lacteos y fabricante de embutidos "Sosua".
*  La ciudad cuenta con una carretera, parte de la red primaria del pais, que la une con las
ciudades de Puerto Plata, al oeste, y Cabarete, al este.
* El servicio de recolecci6n de desechos s6lidos es deficiente, particularmente en la periferia de
la ciudad donde se ubican los pobladores de menores ingresos. Cantidades importantes de
basuras son lanzadas a las margenes del rio Sosua, el cual desemboca en una de las playas
de la ciudad. Otro proyecto LIL proporcionara soluciones a la recolecci6n y disposici6n final
de residuos en la zona.
5.1.1. Agua Potable
El sistema de abastecimiento de agua potable en la comunidad de Sosua tiene como fuente principal los
manantiales de Bella Vista, pudiendo abastecerse tambien del sistema de Puerto Plata, cuya obra de
toma se encuentra sobre el rlo Yasica (al este de Sosua). La industria existente en la zona y algunos
hoteles tienen pozos privados. El sistema cuenta con tres estaciones de bombeo ubicadas ?n la
carretera Sosua - Cabarete, para abastecer las partes altas ubicadas al sur de ia misma. El sistema
suministra unos 120 I/s, lo que resulta insuficiente para satisfacer ia demanda maxima actual. El complejo
habitacional La Uni6n, el aeropuerto y la base aerea militar tiene sus propios sistemas. El primero se
abastece de pozos, y los dos Ciltirnos tienen derivaciones propias de la linea de aducci6n del acueducto
de Puerto Plata.
Segun el informe del proyecto LIL, la carencia de medici6n, poca efectividad en el cobro por parte de
INAPA, y el mal estado de las redes de distribuci6n, resultan en un servicio que si bien es adecuado para
el centro de la ciudad, es intermitente para las zonas perifericas. El estado de las tuberias es tambien el
principal responsable por el deterioro de la calidad del agua que se entrega a los usuarios del sistema.
5.1.2. Aguas Residuales
La gran mayoria de la poblacion de Sosua, asi como los hoteles y la industria, disponen de sus aguas
residuales en el subsuelo mediante pozos filtrantes. En algunos casos estos filtrantes son precedidos por
tanques septicos. En los barrios perifericos de la ciudad puede observarse aguas residuales corriendo por
el drenaje pluvial de las calles. Las edificaciones construidas en las margenes de rios y cahadas en la
zona, con frecuencia disponen de sus aguas residuales directamente a estas. El aeropuerto y la base
aerea cuentan con sistemas de septicos y filtrantes. Para el complejo habitacional de la Uni6n (925
viviendas) se construy6 una planta de tratamiento de aguas residuales la cual se encuentra abandonada,
disponiendose de las aguas crudas en un cahaveral al norte de la ciudad.
5.1.3. Sistema en Construcci6n
El Instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (INAPA) inicio en 1996 la construcci6n del sistema
de alcantarillado de la ciudad de Sosua y su planta de tratamiento. La red de tuberfas consta de
35,178.92 metros de tubos de hormig6n simple, de los cuales se han colocado un 94%, ademas de una
Iinea de colectores principales (2.1 km) en tuberfa de PVC, la cual no se ha construido. Los diametros
varlan de 200 a 600 mm. Tambien se han construido 4.7 km de tuberias de impulsi6n en concreto
reforzado. Se han instalado 2,134 acometidas y 446 cajas de registro.

Borrador Iurfornie Finial
25 de abril, 1999
Este sistema fue diseflado en 1995 por el INAPA para una poblaci6n al 2,025 de 34,729 habitantes
(incluyendo turistas). Este proyecto abarca s6lo El Batey Este y Oeste, Charamicos y Sosua Abajo, por lo
que sirve a un area menor que la considerada por el LIL. El diseno de este sistema incluye ademas
cuatro estaciones de bombeo, aun por construir, ubicadas segun se muestra en la Fig. XX&. Estas
estaciones tendran carcamo de concreto circular, para operar con bombas sumergibles tipo Flygt, con
alimentaci6n eIlctrica de la red publica y generadores diesel para emergencias (las fallas en la energia
electrica son frecuentes en la zona). Los terrenos para la colocaci6n de estas estaciones aun no se han
adquirido.
Al momento de este estudio la construcci6n de la planta de tratamiento del sistema de aguas residuales
de Sos6ia se encuentra paralizada, con aproximadamente un 90% de ejecuci6n de la obra fisica. La
planta es del tipo UASB (reactor anaerobio de flujo ascendente con manto de lodos), y consiste en:
*  Una canaleta Parshall para medicion del caudal de entrada.
*  Pretratamiento con rejilla gruesa y desarenador.
•  Tratamiento biol6gico mediante reactor UASB, dividido en cuatro (4) unidades, con un volumen
total de 5,400 m3, con salida de lodos sedimentados por el fondo (figura 3).
*  Sedimentadores de lodos y lechos de secado.
La planta esta ubicada (figura 1) a 304.8 m de la costa, en las proximidades del aeropuerto de La Union.
El efluente descargarfa a unos 2.5 km al oeste de la Bahia de Sosua, en la costa. En los terrenos donde
se ubica la planta hay espacio suficiente para futuras expansiones.
5.2. Medio Fisico
5.2.1. Descripci6n General de la Area del Proyecto
La ciudad de Sosua se encuentra en la costa norte del pais, a unos 17 km al este de Puerto Plata. Las
condiciones climaticas segun los registros de la estaci6n meteorol6gica del aeropuerto internacional de La
Uni6n (19.750N, 70.5500) se resumen como sigue:
*  Temperatura media anual de 25.5 0C, con mrximas en agosto (27.5 OC) y minimas en enero y
febrero (23.4 °C). Con temperaturas record m8ximas y minimas de 39.80C  y 14.0°C,
respectivamente.
*  Precipitaci6n anual de 1446.2 mm, con maxima de 246.0 mm en noviembre y minima de 41.60
mm en junio.
*  116.9 dias de lluvia por ahoaen promedio.
*  Velocidad del viento con un promedio anual de 10.2 km/h, con direcci6n predominante del Este.
5.2.2. Agua
La principal corriente de agua superficial en el area de estudio es el rio Sosua. Este rio desemboca en la
bahia de Sosua, en el extremo oeste de la playa del mismo nombre. Este rio se encuentra muy
contaminado por el vertido de desechos s6lidos y liquidos. Otras corrientes superficiales en la zona
evidencian un grado similar de deterioro.
La practica comun de disponer de las aguas residuales a traves de pozos filtrantes (al subsuelo), y el uso
indiscriminado de aguas subterraneas por pozos privados han dado como resultado un alto nivel; de
degradaci6n de la calidad de agua en el acuifero en la parte baja de la cuenca de Sosua. Sin embargo,
Pagina- 20



Borrador lizforme Final
25 de abril, 1999
las reservas en la parte alta aun se consideran como una de las fuentes potenciales de agua potable para
la zona, proyectadas al 2,025.
5.2.3. Geologia
Al Sudeste de Puerto Plata se encuentran colinas elevaciones en el lIlano costero, los cuales han sido
considerados como Olistostroma (Nagle 1979). Se reporta tambien (Bermudez 1949) que las rocas a 4
km al Sudeste son igualmente oligocenas, asi como en las regiones de Sosua aparecen estructuras
calizas del Mioceno Medio. Mas cerca de la costa se presentan afloramientos evidentes de calizas
coralinas del mismo periodo, continuando con terrazas costeras Pleistocenas y Recientes. En las zonas
bajas abundan areas pantanosas cuya estructura basal son primordialmente depositos aluviales.
Segun la informaci6n registrada en el Atlas Geol6gico de la Republica Dominicana (Zoppis, 1969), a
escala 1:250,000, en la zona de interes se distinguen tres formaciones. Hacia el oeste del rio Camm
formaciones coluviales heterogenicas, principalmente arcilla. Hacia el norte, dep6sitos lacustres marinos,
principalmente arcillas calcareas, asi como arcillas con arena y grava, en depositos poco profundos sobre
caliza arrecifal. Por ultimo, hacia el este y sur del trea de interes se encuentran calizas karsticas
("Haitises").
5.3. MEDIO BIOLOGICO
5.3. 1. Recursos Naturales
La regi6n de Puerto Plata en la costa Norte de ia RepCiblica Dominicana se encuentra bafiada por el
OcAano Atlantico, quien regula su climatologia regional. Siendo los vientos alisios (soplan desde el
Noreste, Este y Sudeste) y las caracteristicas orograficas los principales controladores del clima. Los
regimenes locales de clima se alternan entre arido y hCimedo, siendo la iluvia orografica predominante en
la region Norte de la isla.
El sitio de La Uni6n se encuentra internandose en los dos complejos ecol6gicos (bosque humedo
subtropical y bosque muy humedo subtropical). La precipitaci6n anual es de 1,565 mm, durante unos 128
dias al ano, lo cual ocasiona graves problemas de erosi6n, cargando asi de sedimentos a los rios y
arroyos (La Uni6n y Forma) alli presentes. Las temperaturas maximas y minimas medias varian entre
19.3 y 38.8 grados centigrados OC, siendo ia media anual de 250C. La velocidad media del viento varia
entre 7.6 km/h en noviembre a 12.8 km/h en julio, la media anual es de 9.8 km/h.
El area de ta costa Norte es una zona continua de acantilados y playas con presencia de estuarios
pantanos costeros y manglares. Las playas arenosas ocupan un 54% de la costa y un 27.2% son
acantilados y 17.9% de manglares (Perfil Ambiental, 1981). Entre las principales playas estan el Malecon,
Long Beach, Sosuia, Playa Dorada, Cabarete, ubicadas en zonas de vida del bosque hCimedo subtropical,
de topografia llana y arenas de grano fino a mediano.
5.3.2. Descripci6n General de la Ecologia del Area
Generalidades sobre las condiciones costero marinas desde Playa Cano Grande y Playa Dorada, hasta
Sosua, Provincia Puerto Plata.
5.3.2.1. Playas Arenosas
Playa Dorada hasta Punta Bergantin
Esta secci6n de costa esta representada por playas arenosas de color pardo de origen mixto (organico
marino y terrigenas), asociadas a pantanos costeros o zonas Ilanas inundables. Geol6gicamente es una
zona inestable de suelos sueltos de origen calcareo, compuesto principalimente por areniscas y pedazos
de conchas de moluscos, asil como de cantos rodados provenientes de las laderas de las montaias y
colinas cercanas. Estas arenas y sedimentos son transportados por las corrientes de numerosos arroyos

y carios que desembocan en estas proximidades, esta asociaci6n de suelo se corresponde al tipo de
cienaga costera ubicada en las inmediaciones del Rio Camu. La regi6n costera de la zona y
especificamente en la seccion de Cafno Grande y Playa Dorada hasta Punta Bergantin, la conforma una
especie de ensenada doble bordeada originalmente en su franja costera por manglares y pantanos, los
que funcionaban reteniendo sedimentos provenientes de las escorrentias originadas por las numerosas
lluvias comunes en esta zona. Todo este arreglo natural permitia que las aguas marinas cercanas a la
costa permaneciesen gran parte del tiempo libre de sedimentos y relativamente claras, estableciendose
en ellas arrecifes de parchos y de franja. Hoy dia no ocurre asi, debido a las numerosas intervenciones
antropicas realizadas en la zona. Se han realizado con el desarrollo turistico cortes de manglares,
canalizaci6n de los canos, y continua descarga de aguas importadas, usadas y ricas en nutrientes hacia
los cauces de los rios y arroyos, a los pantanos vecinos, asi como al subsuelo de la zona en donde se
encuentra una infraestructura hotelera con mas de 7,000 habitaciones y un campo de golf. El manglar
existente se tal6 en parte y en otras zonas se mantuvo como aporte paisajistico, sin embargo apenas
recibe aportes de aguas dulces, ya que las aguas del pantano que antes lo sostenian ahora son
desviadas sin pasar por el.
Punta Bergantin hasta Playa SosOa
Desde la Punta Bergantin hacia el Este se encuentra la desembocadura del Rio Munoz, y luego la
desembocadura del rio Camu y Boca de Cangrejo en donde se encuentra una playa de arena de barra
subsiguiendo a una regi6n pantanosa. Aqui se realiza la pesca de trampas pasivas.
La playa de Sosua es la siguiente unidad de arenas, encontrandose a unos 10 km al Este de ese sitio.
Esta playa esta compuesta por arenas de origen organico arrecifal de color blanco. Playa Sosua est6
orientada hacia el Oeste, protegida asi de los vientos alisios y las corrientes predominantes del Noreste.
En tierra firme esta playa esta bordeada por un bosque muy hmrnedo subtropical, aun con grandes
arboles. Sin embargo el crecimiento de la porci6n de sombra, asi como en la franja de los 6rboles de
Coccoloba sp. (Uva de playa) y Bucida buceras (Gri-gri), se han visto intervenidas por la actividad
humana, negocios y servicios que se ofrecen a los visitantes de este importante destino turistico de la
region.
5.3.2.2. Costa Rocosa
Playa Dorada hasta Punta Bergantin
Este tipo de ecosistema no se encuentra en este tramo costero
Punta Bergantin hasta Playa SosOa
Al Este de la desembocadura del rfo Camu en Cangrejo hasta ia playa de Sosua se encuentran
acantilados costeros de mediana altura formados por terrazas arrecifales de origen coralino, indicando
que no existen escorrentias de agua superficiales en este tramo, permitiendo que se establezcan
ecosistemas costeros de alta energla. Los vientos alisios abaten la zona, impulsando adem6s un oleaje
persistente y fuerte que rompe en estos acantilados rocosos. El ecosistema supralitoral inmediatamente
despues de los suelos rocosos desnudos, se encuentran definidos por gramineas, arbustos y plantas
rastreras de hojas carnosas y vegetaci6n eurohalina como mangles (Connocarpus), contorneados por el
viento, siguiendo luego vegetaci6n hal6fita, junto con cambronales, cactaceas, palmaceas y gramineas
foraneas utilizadas para pastizales. Esta se ha visto alterada e intervenida por la construccion del
aeropuerto internacional de La Uni6n, por el poblado de los Charamicos de Sosua, por el Batey de Sosua,
y por paisajismo en Punta Los Ramos. Tambien en las proximidades del rio Forma y el arroyo La Uni6n
se instala la planta de pre-tratamiento de Aguas Negras de Sosua, en un antiguo potrero propiedad del
Ingenio Monte Llano.

5.3.2.3. Fondos Costeros cercanos a la costa (desde la Ifnea de marea hasta 10 metros de
profundidad)
Playa Dorada hasta Punta Bergantin
Esta zona litoral ha sufrido una gran intervenci6n e impacto por actividades antr6picas. Las praderas de
hierbas marinas (Thalassia testudinum y Syringodium filiformis) han sido retiradas a mano desde el inicio
de la construccion del complejo hotelero, lo cual motiva un proceso de erosi6n el cual aun persiste.
Tambien en esta zona fueron dinamitados cabezos de coral, para permitir la navegacion de botes
recreativos y otras actividades acuaticas dentro del confinamiento de la Bahia Playa Dorada. Esta han
deteriorado las condiciones del lugar. La situacion actual es de alta turbidez, arenas muy m6viles,
arrecifes afectados y muertos, por ende la playa se encuentra desprotegida en proceso de regresi6n.
Tambien existe una intrusi6n de nutrientes al Oeste de Playa Dorada a unos 50 metros de la costa,
enfrente de unos arrecifes de franja, se encuentra un emisor a unos 4 metros de profundidad que
descarga libremente los efluentes de las plantas de tratamiento del proyecto Playa Dorada.
En todo el frente de Playa Dorada se encuentran parches arrecifales en muy mal estado. Se encuentran
conglomerados de corales muertos y cementados in-situ, formando monticulos y a veces pilares los que
se levantan verticales desde el fondo, en algunos casos hasta de 15 metros de profundidad. En la punta
interna de esta ensenada doble se establece un pequeno arrecife de franja, con un incipiente arrecife
posterior, en donde se encuentra Acropora palmata y Porites porites. Este arrecife esta degradado.
Un estudio realizado en 1995 indica que el 20% de los corales estaba vivo, 79.73% muerto, 91.69% del
fondo y estructura base del arrecife esta cubierta de algas compuesta principatmente por Gracilania sp.,
Dyctiota sp., Turbinaria sp. y Codium sp., especies todas favorecidas por la alta cantidad de nutrientes
(nitr6geno y fosfatos), provenientes de la escorrentia de los terrenos cercanos altamente intervenidos por
la accion humana
Punta Bergantin hasta Playa Sosua
En Bergantin desembocan los arroyos Munoz, Boca Nueva y el Cano asi como el rio Camu por lo cual los
fondos aledahos estan compuestos por arenas en condiciones normales de alta sedimentaci6n.
Inmediatamente al Este de la desembocadura del Rio CamOi se inician los acantilados arrecifales de la
Uni6n. Desde ese sitio hasta Punta Sosua se establece en las regiones someras un arrecife de franja,
franqueado por una rompiente de baja densidad y pobre relieve la cual se ubica entre los 5 hasta 25
metros de distancia de la costa, y entre los 2 hasta los 6 metros de profundidad en este lugar domina las
especies de coral esqueletos muertos de Acropora palmata, Porites sp, cubiertos de algas, cuyas ramas
se encuentran colonizadas por algas pardas y zoantidos. En general estas condiciones de deterioro,
permiten que Millepora sp se establezca en todo este frente cementado, el cual se erosiona por procesos
fisicos (oleaje, corrientes) y biol6gico (esponjas, zoantidos, algas etc.) El panorama submarino en las
afueras de Cangrejo es de un fondo duro de alta energia cubierto de algas, con corales esporadicos
(Montastraea complex, Millepora sp.), esponjas incrustantes (Cliona sp.). Algunas especies de peces
juveniles de las familia Sparidae, Carangidae, Muranenidae.
A partir de este lugar hacia el Este, se presenta el arrecife coralino menos intervenido de la regi6n
representando c6mo fueron los ecosistemas costeros marinos cercanos a las costas de todo el litoral de
Puerto Plata.
Entre 2 y 8 metros de profundidad se presenta un llano arrecifal de alta energia  en mucho mejor
condiciones naturales, en donde las colonias de corales crecen dispersas dominando las formas
redondas (Diploria sp.) siendo obvios los erizos negros Diadema antillarum y blancos Tripneustes
ventricosus, asf como la esponja incrustante C/iona sp. (foto) la cual cubre grandes parches. En este
panorama de fondo llano, se encuentran depresiones en el fondo donde se acumulan desperdicios
arrecifales y grietas como fracturas las cuales sirven de refugio de fauna (fotos).

En las profundidades cercanas (desde los 8 hasta 15 metros) el fondo esta representado por un fondo
duro arrecifal conformado por arenisca cementada, y con mayor presencia de fracturas e irregularidades
talladas por las corrientes oceanicas, (aqui son relativamente fuertes). Este sitio es el unico que queda
en toda la zona de Puerto Plata - Sosua en condiciones naturales y menos perturbadas y es la base de la
importante industria del buceo de visita ecoturfstico que se practica en la regi6n.
En la region de Punta Sosua a partir de los 8 metros se continua con una mayor densidad de especies de
corales y octocorales, esponjas y demas fauna bentonica, los cuales crecen esparcidas hasta llegar al
firme de una pendiente que cae hasta los 15 metros, en cuyo talud se incrementa el numero de especies
bentonicas, (fotos) sin formar estructura de canales y surcos. A mayor profundidad entre los 15 hasta los
20 metros, se encuentran grandes praderas de corales blandos, predominando Plexaura sp.,
Pseudoplexaura sp. , y Euniciea sp. , entre otras, (fotos) dominando el crecimiento en el segundo
escalon el cual continua hasta ia base de arenas a los 25 metros de profundidad (fotos). Aqui se
encuentran esparcidas especies coralinas entre monticulos de rocas aislados de tamanio variable (3 hasta
5 metros de alto), en donde se establecen esponjas y otros corales y sirve de refugio a la fauna de peces
y demas.
En el sitio de Sosua se encuentra en un fondo arenoso en cuya porcion central se levanta casi hasta la
superficie una estructura rocosa en donde se establece un arrecife coralino formando asi un parche
arrecifal en buenas condiciones. Sin embargo debido a la gran cantidad de visitantes que recibe esta
siendo degradado por exceso y mal comportamiento de los visitantes, que se paran sobre los corales, los
tocan y matan, lanzan basuras desde botes, las anclas destrozan los arrecifes, en fin, falta un
ordenamiento y protocolo de buenas practicas de visitacion submarina en la regi6n. El arrecife de SosCia
posee las siguientes caracteristicas: Arrecife entre 2 hasta 20 metros de profundidad, emplazado en una
pequena Bahia abierta con orientacion Nordeste, crece sobre una base de arenisca solidificada
(beachrock) ahogada, la cual se evidencia aOn en la costa, como si fuese un dique, en aguas muy
tranquilas. 30% del area de la ensenada con pendiente suave se adentra al mar y en este trayecto en las
partes someras lo ocupa una pradera de Thalassia en condiciones de baja densidad y con muy poca
fauna asociada presente, principalmente debido a la recoleccion por parte de los vendedores ambulantes
(estrellas disecadas, gorgonias, peces guanabanas, etc.), son vendidas a los turistas en los kioscos que
alli se encuentran. Al alcanzar los 4 metros de profundidad y rodeando un promontorio (La Piedra de
SosCia), en un fondo duro rocoso crecen grandes praderas de Octocorales (corales blandos). En la Piedra
de Sosua, se encuentra a 2 metros de profundidad Acropora palmata, Millepora alcicomis, Diploria
clivosa, Dendrogyra cylindrus. Este lugar es visitado con mucha frecuencia por personas que realizan el
snorkel, y continuamente se detienen encima de los corales para descansar del nado (0.5 Km. desde la
orilla). Ya se evidencian deterioro y mortandad de las colonias de coral por esta causa. Las algas poseen
una presencia de 43.25%, y los corales poseen una cobertura de 28.03%, las esponjas incrustantes
6.41%. El resto de fauna principalmente peces se ha visto protegida por las actividades de buceo y
alimentacion artificial que reciben de parte de los visitantes (fotos).
5.3.3. Flora
Para recoger las informaciones mas predominantes de la region se realizara una descripci6n de la zona
segun fue visitada asociandolas a las informaciones recopiladas para la region.
5.3.3.1. Vegetacion Asociada A Las Playas De Arena
Vegetaci6n Terrestre: Zonacion
Este patron varna dependiendo de las caracteristicas del substrato, contenido de sal, elevacion del suelo y
el clima. Es frecuente que en las playas protegidas (ensenadas cerradas o protegidas por arrecifes
coralinos), la zona pionera esta ausente y el bosque costanero se encuentra cerca al mar.
Zona Pionera - Consta de plantas como lpomea pes-caprae, Sporobolus virginicus, Carnavalia
maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Portulacca spp., etc.

*  Zona Arbustiva - Tiene plantas de menos de 2 metros de altura. La uva de playa Coccoloba
uvifera es caracteristica de esta zona y esta ampliamente distribuida por toda la costa. Su
sistema de raices sostiene la arena dandole mayor estabilidad al suelo.
*  Zona Arb6rea - La vegetaci6n es de unos 5 metros de alto. Exhibe una gran diversidad de
arboles, arbustos, enredaderas y hierbas capaces de tolerar salinidades altas y fuertes vientos.
En general, la vegetaci6n de las playas arenosas marinas se caracteriza por plantas hal6filas. Muchos de
las especies son cosmopolitas, como por ejemplo lpomoea pes-caprae y el genero Camavalia. Estas
plantas cosmopolitas aparecen asociadas con plantas nativas.
Vegetacion Acuatica
La vegetacion marina asociada al sustrato arenoso esta formada por algas y hierbas marinas. Estas
plantas forman parches en la zona submarina o pueden liegar a constituir praderas extensas, compuestas
por:
Familia Potamogetonaceae
1. Halodule wrightii (Ascherson)
2. Syringodium filiforme (Kiitzing)
Familia Hydrocharitaceae
3. Thalassia testudinum (Banks, ex Konig)
Esta especie es la mas comunmente encontrada. Esta planta se desarrolla en aguas llanas y tranquilas
del sublitoral donde el substrato es blando pero puede crecer en areas con oleaje y substrato de arena
gruesa. Se encuentra asociada a otras dos faner6gamas marinas, Halodule wrightii y Syringodium
filiforme. Ambas especies poseen hojas mas estrechas que la de la Thalassia y en ese sentido se
encuentran en desventaja a] compartir la luz. Estas especies funcionan como estabilizadoras del
substrato para que Thalassia se establezca, pero esta, al tener un crecimiento rapido y vigoroso, domina
y reduce las poblaciones pionera. Las praderas marinas cumplen una importante funci6n ecol6gica: sirven
de albergue, proveen alimento a peces e invertebrados comercialmente importantes o desempenan
funciones ecol6gicas esenciales al medio ambiente. Este ecosistema sirve como estabilizador de
sedimentos en la costa ayudando a evitar la erosi6n de la misma. Su sistema radicular forma una red
compleja que compacta los sedimentos orgAnicos e inorganicos, evitando la resuspension de los mismos
y la erosi6n del fondo.
Flora En Las Costes Rocosas
La costa rocosa comprende zonas litorales de substrato s6lido expuestas a la acci6n del mar; recibe el
impacto de los vientos, el oleaje y las corrientes marinas. Generalmente las aguas son muy agitadas y
estan fuertemente iluminadas. El litoral rocoso se caracteriza por la disposici6n de los organismos en
bandas horizontales debido a la existencia de un limite entre el agua y el aire que se mueve verticalmente
con las olas y mareas. La zonaci6n en el litoral rocoso presenta una distribuci6n de los organismos de
arriba a abajo de la manera siguiente:
*  Zona Supralitoral - La vegetaci6n en esta zona esta ausente, excepto en los pequenos pozos que se
forman en los huecos de las rocas donde pueden aparecer las algas verdes Ulva, Cladophoropsis y Dasya
rigidula entre otras.
*  Zona intermareal - Es un area expuesta ai aire durante la bajamar y cubierta durante la marea
alta. Los organismos estan sometidos a periodos de desecacion constantes. Los generos mas
comunes son: Chaetomorpha media, Sargassum rigidulum, Turbinaria turbinata, Padina sp.,
Enteromorpha flexuosa, Bryopsis pennata, Laurencia obtusa, Valonia ventricosa . En los lugares
de mucha exposici6n al aire y de alta energia, la flora esta representada por rodoficeas calcareas

incrustantes Bryothamnion sp. En el litoral rocoso protegido las algas mns comunes son: Ulva,
Enteromorpha, Padina, Dyctiota y Dictyopteris. Ciadophoropsis.
Zona Infralitoral - Esta zona esta constituida por rocas siempre bajo agua y se corresponde a las
caracteristicas variables de los fondos circundantes (arenas, cascajos, arrecifes) y las
correspondencias de las condiciones de nutrientes, turbidez y calidad de agua reinantes en el
sitio.
Vegetaci6n Terrestre
La vegetaci6n que crece sobre la plataforma costera de rocas coralinas con una elevaci6n entre 0-20
msnm es de muy poco desarrollo por la escasez de suelo. El estrato herb6ceo es pobre y casi siempre
predomina la Zamba pupila. Existe una abundancia de epifitas y son frecuentes las cactaceas
arborescentes en zonas muy aridas. Es un bosque con arboles de crecimiento muy lento.
Especies caracteristicas:
*  Arboles - Krugiodendron ferreum, Coccoloba diversifolia, Bursera simaruba, Bumelia obovata, B.
salicifolia, Ateramnus lucidus, Metopium toxiferum, M. brownei, Eugenia spp., Guaiaum sanctum,
Erythroxylm spp. Canella winterana, Ziziphus rignoni, Capparis spp., Mastichodendronfoetidissimum.
•  Arbustos - Psychotria nervosa, Hamelia patens, Picraamnia pentandra, Randis aculeata,
Chiococca alba, Amyris elemifera.
*  Lianas - Serjania polyphylla, Smilax populnea, Vanilla spp., Hylocereus undulatus.
*  Hierbas - Zamia pumila.
*  Epifitas - Tillandsia balbisiana, T. fasciculta, T utriculata, Achmaea undicaulis, Rhipsalis baccifera,
Brughtonia domingensis.
La vegetaci6n varfa segCun la zona de vida donde se encuentra.
5.3.4. Fauna
5.3.4.1. Fauna Asociada A La Playa Arenosa
Las playas de arena son pobladas por organismos adaptados a un cambio abrupto y constante de
ambiente a causa de las mareas. Para protegerse del oleaje se han desarrollado mecanismos de fijacion
muy variados.
Zonacion
*  Zona de Alta Playa - El organismo dominante es el cangrejo fantasma Ocypde albicans. Entre
las aves estan siempre presentes los playeros y playeritos de la Familia Charadiidae,
principalmente.
.  Zona Estran - Esta ocupada por los crustaceos decapodos tales como Hippa, Albunea, y
ocasionalmente por la almeja Donax reticulatus.
*  Zona de Playa Submarina - En esta zona dominan los erizos irregulares: los del genero Mellita y
Clypeaster. Tambien son caracteristicas de este ambiente las estrellas de mar Astropecten spp. y
Luidia spp. Las almejas Codakia orbicularis, Tellina fausta, Pinna carnea y Atrina rigida son
comunes en sustrato arenoso, particularmente en las areas cercanas a las hierbas marinas.
Tambien se encuentran los cangrejos nadadores (Portunidae) Callinectes omatus, Arenaeus
cribarious y el cangrejo Calappa flammea. Este uiltimo cerca de la zona del arrecife coralino.

Los peces bent6nicos como los lagartos Synodus spp., [as rayas Dasyatis americana, Urolophus
jamaicensis y los lenguados (Bothidae) son comunes en el litoral arenoso. El pez sapo Phrynelox scaber
y los peces murcielagos Ogcocephalus spp., las especies de Lophius spp. y Brotula barbata se
encuentran en sustrato arenoso, pero son raros.
S6lo dos especies de anfibios pueden encontrarse en las playas: Bufo marinus y Osteopilus dominicensis
Reptiles Terrestres
Se han reportado 32 especies de reptiles terrestres en las playas arenosas (Informe SEA-DVS, 1990) y
existen 4 especies de tortugas marinas que visitan las playas de arena en la regi6n:
NOMBRE CIENTIFICO                              NOMBRE COMUN
Chelonia mydas mydas (Linnaeus)               Tortuga verde
Eretmochelys imbricata imbricata (Linnaeus)    Carey
Caretta caretta caretta (Linnaeus)             Caguamo
Dermochelys coriacea coriacee (Linnaeus)       Tinglar
Avifauna
El Departamento de Vida Silvestre (1990) informa que 21 especies se alimentan en las playas, la mayoria
del Orden Charadriformes y 8 especies anidan en las playas (Charadius alexandrinus y Charadius
wilsonia y las gaviotas Larus atricilla y Sterna dougallii). Stema antillarum solamente se reproduce en las
playas. El caracolero Haematopus palliatus y el querebebe (C. gundlachil) prefieren tambien la playa para
reproducirse.
5.3.4.2. Praderas De Hierbas Marinas
El ecosistema de hierbas marinas sostiene una fauna muy diversa y abundante. Algunos peces se
alimentan directamente de las hierbas como Sparisoma radians del mismo modo que los invertebrados
como los lambies, (Strombus spp. y Cassis spp.), erizos (Diadema antillarum, Tripneustes ventricosus y
Lytechinus variegatus) y algunos nudibranquios. Pero los mayores consumidores vertebrados son la
tortuga verde (Chelonia mydas), que se alimenta de Thalassia, y el manat[ Trichechus manatus. Muchos
peces carnivoros merodean las praderas de noche, como por ejemplo, los de las familia Lutjanidae,
Pomadasyidae y Holocentridae.
Es importante mencionar otros invertebrados que se encuentran con frecuencia en este ambiente. Entre
las esponjas, Chondrilla nucula, Haliclona compresssa y Tedania ignis; los antozoos estan representados
por las anemonas, Condylactis gigantea y pequenas colonias de corales Manicina areolata y Oculina
diffusa, Acropora palmata, Porites spp., Favia fragum, etc. y los moluscos por los bivalvos como Pinna
carnea, Modiolus modiolus y muchas otras especies de gaster6podos. Entre los equinodermos, ademas
de los erizos arriba mencionados, abundan los holoturios Holothuria mexicana, y ia estrella de mar
Oreasterreticulatus. Los cangrejos nadadores y los majidos abundan en las praderas.
Costa Rocosa
*  Zona Supralitoral - Predominan los moluscos gastropodos del genero Littorina y Nerita junto
a Tectarius muricatus formando grandes poblaciones. Ademas aparece el quit6n
Acanthopleura granulata. El grupo Littorina esta formado por varias especies, entre las mas
frecuentes estan: Littorina ziczac, Littorina angustior, Littorina lineolata, Littorina meleagris,
Littorina mespillum y Nodilittorina tuberculata.
*  Zona Intermareal - Los mitilidos del genero Brachiodontes forman racimos asociadas a la
zona de Enteromorpha y las almejas Isognomon se encuentran en areas donde existe

influencia de aguas duices. Los poliquetos son muy frecuentes en esta area y los cangrejos
grapsidos, Grapsus grapsus, Plagusia y otros.
Zona Infraliforal - Se encuentra dominada por el erizo rojo Echinometra lucunter que forma
enormes poblaciones entre los huecos que 6l mismo construye Los moluscos Astrea tuber,
Livonna pica, Leucozonia nassa, Thais deltoidea, son muy frecuentes y abundantes; tambien
Murex pomum, Acmea antillarum junto a pequenios holoturidos. Los crustaceos estan
representados por el cangrejo Grapsus grapsus que recorre con gran rapidez todo el litoral,
los cangrejos ermitahos (Clibanarius tricolor, Clibanarius antillensis, Clibanarius cubensis,
Calcinus tibicens) y otros. Entre la vegetacion tambien se encuentran los cangrejos Eriphia
gonegra y los majidos Mithrax sculptus, Mithrex forceps, Microphrys bicomutus, Metopaulias
depressus. Ocasionalmente se observan los porcelanidos Petrolisthes polita, Petrolisthes
quadratus y Porcellana sayanna. En rocas sueltas generalmente se encuentran los quitones
pequehos del genero Ischnochiton y Ceratozona squalida y las estrellas fragiles. Los peces
del litoral rocoso son en general pequerlos como Ophioblennius atlanticus, otros son de
habitos solitarios como las morenas. Muchas especies se sujetan a las rocas a traves de un
disco formado por las aletas ventrales.
Zona De Estuarios
Los humedales (salitrales, pantanos, etc.) estan tambien intimamente asociados a los estuarios,
enriqueciendo sus aguas. La alta productividad y los numerosos habitats que alli se forman convierten
estas areas en zonas de desove o de viveros para peces e invertebrados. Los principales recursos
pesqueros son los camarones (Penaeidae), cangrejos terrestres (Gecarcinidae) y peces deportivos como
el sabalo y comerciales, lisas, mojarras, lenguados, etc. Los invertebrados estan generalmente
representados por especies de cangrejos Cardisoma guanhumi y Ucides cordatus, los cangrejos violines
Uca spp, y el cangrejo ermitaro Coenobita clypeatus. Los cangrejos del g nero Callinectes utilizan los
estuarios para el desove, asi como los camarones de agua dulce de las familias Palaemonidae y Atyidae.
Arrecifes Coralinos
Los corales hermatipicos son animales modulares, siendo el p6lipo ia unidad fundamental. Los p6lipos
contienen dentro de sus tejidos algas simbioticas (zooxantelas) las cuales se nutren de los productos de
excreci6n del polipo y a su vez asisten al polipo en el proceso de deposici6n de carbonato de calcio como
resultado de la fotosintesis. Bajo condiciones de "tensi6n" estas algas pueden eliminarse y los corales
aparecen blancos (blanqueamiento), un problema de la Oltima decada que esta ocurriendo en toda la
regi6n tropical del planeta. Los corales hermatipicos necesitan para un desarrollo 6ptimo: aguas
transparentes, para la facil penetraci6n de la luz solar, temperaturas c6lidas, entre 20 y 25°C. y
salinidades estables de 30 %D. Ademas, las colonias mejor desarrolladas se establecen en aguas de
pocos nutrientes (condiciones oligotr6ficas). Cuando las colonias de corales encuentran las condiciones
apropiadas para establecerse y crecer, forman los arrecifes de coral, los cuales poseen formas
especificas adaptadas a las condiciones locales fisiograficas, oceanograficas y ecol6gicas del lugar.
En el area de estudio de Puerto Plata predominan los parchos y los arrecifes de franja o costeros (desde
Cangrejo hasta Punta SosCia. Los arrecifes de Parches son plataformas aisladas o discontinuas de las
formaciones de corales de franja. Pueden desarrollarse detras o delante de los arrecifes de barrera, o en
recodos protegidos de la costa (SosCia, Playa Dorada, etc.). En general las condiciones del fondo esta
formado por arenas finas donde vive un gran numero de gusanos cavadores los cuales crean monticulos
muy conspicuos. Es frecuente encontrar estrellas de mar, Astropecten, Linckia guildingi, holotOridos
grandes, y moluscos como Aplysia, etc. y en ella se establece una vegetaci6n formada por hierbas
marinas: Thalassia, Syringodium y Halodule junto a las algas propias de las praderas de hierbas marinas.
En las zonas mbs profundas el paisaje submarino puede estar representado por gorgonias y corales
blandos. Los corales petreos son escasos dominando las formas redondas como Diploria strigosa,,
Diploria clivosa, Millepora alcicomis, Milepora complanata, Porites asteroides, Porites sp. y Agaricia
agaricites. Son frecuentes pequeias colonias de Acropora palmata y M. complanata.

En las lagunas arrecifales y regiones protegidas del oleaje, predominan fondos blandos arenosos y de
hierbas marinas o parchos de algas. Estas son areas de alimentacion y albergue de peces arrecifales,
juveniles, y algunos adultos residentes y grandes depredadores, los cuales visitan las lagunas
transitoriamente para alimentarse. Entre ellos las sardinas como Harengula pensacolae, colirubia Ocyurus
chrySurus, la barracuda Sphryraena barracuda, Hemiramphus brasiliensis. La fauna asociada esta
formada por gorg6nidos y abanicos de mar. Ademas se encuentran otros invertebrados bent6nicos entre
los cuales se destacan los erizos, estrellas fragiles, langostas y muchas especies de cangrejos y
moluscos.
En parte de interfase con el aire, se denominan lianos arrecifales. Esta sujeta a oleajes fuertes, rapidas
corrientes y una gran iluminaci6n, los corales mas comunes en esta zona son: Porites porites, Porites
asteroides, Porites furcata, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea, Favia fragum, Diploria clivosa y
Diploria strigosa. En algunos casos como en la costa Norte (incluyendo Playa Dorada) las algas pueden
sustituir los corales en esta zona formando promontorios de algas denominado arrecife de algas (algae
reef).
La zona de rompiente es la mas conocida y visible del arrecife, es aquella que recibe directamente el
impacto del oleaje y las corrientes. A partir de la superficie del agua, dominando el paisaje, se encuentra
el coral de fuego (Millepora spp.) y los zoantidos (an6monas coloniales). Inmediatamente despues se
establecen las grandes colonias de Acropora palmata y Montastraea annularis quienes conforma la
estructura basal de la zona de rompiente. Aqui ademas se incorporan Pontes asteroides y una variedad
de octocorales y esponjas crecen junto a los corales Agaricia sp.
A mayores profundidades ia diversidad de especie aumenta y se genera un intrincado ambiente en donde
prosperan una de las mas alta concentraciones de seres vivos que se conoce para cualquier ecosistema
del planeta. En estas condiciones se establecen cadenas e interrelaciones ecol6gicas de importancia
local, sectorial y regional con implicaciones no tan solo biologica sino tambien ecol6gicas. Por eso los
arrecifes de coral han sido identificados como uno de los principales ecosistemas que benefician el
hombre y la sociedad con funciones de servicios bio-econ6micas de este ecosistema los que ofrecen
proteccion a los ecosistemas costeros, y cuando estos han sido destruidos o gravemente impactados,
(ver caso de Playa Dorada), se acentua el proceso de erosi6n de las playas. Los corales petreos y los
organismos asociados al arrecife, son los principales formadores de arenas de un gran numero de las
playas dominicanas.
5.3.5. Especies En Peligro De Extincion
Solamente especies de tortugas marinas que frecuentan las playas arenosas para su reproducci6n
pudieren ser consideradas en este acApite, porque los efectos de los desechos s6lidos al ser mal
dispuestos, o ser vertidos en la ruta costera del transporte pudiesen Ilegar a las playas y a los mares
aledanos impactando las mismas.

Chelonia mydas
Caretta caretta
Eretmochelys imbricata
Familia Dermochelidae
Dermochelys coriacea
5.3.6. Wcbitats Criticos
Los ambientes especiales de pantanos de Playa Dorada, y el estuario del Rio Camu y Arroyo Cangrejo.
Tambien el Arroyo La Uni6n, los cuales pueden ser afectados por el nivel de contaminantes de las
descargas del emisario. En especial Los arrecifes de coral de Punta Sosua y del aeropuerto La Union.

Estos adernas pudiesen ser afectados por los procesos de instalacion de las tuberias a ser instaladas en
este lugar.
5.3.7. Areas Protegidas Cercanas
Parque Nacional Litoral Norte, Ley 95 del 1971, Parque Nacional Loma Isabel de Torres de 793 m de
altura, creado por decreto No 2125 de 1972, el Monumento Natural Cabarete y Goleta convertido en el
Parque Nacional El Choco con 75 km2 por el decreto 309-95 y administrado por la Direcci6n Nacional de
Parques, y el Corredor Ecol6gico via turistica Santiago- La Cumbre- Puerto Plata establecidos por el
decreto 233 de 1996. Ninguno de estos se encuentra en el 6rea de influencia directa del proyecto.
Otras Areas Especiales
Los arrecifes coralinos protegidos por decretos presidenciales (decretos 112/95, de 1995, el 318 de 1986,
y el 1728 de 1976), asi incluye los de Boca Nueva - Boca de Arroyo Cangrejo y enfrente al Aeropuerto La
Uni6n, as[ como los de la Punta Sosua.

5.4.1. Aspectos Sociales
5.4. 1.1. Estructura de la Poblaci6n
La poblaci6n para el municipio de Sosua se estim6 para el afio 1998 en 32.070 habitantes, equivalentes
a] 11% del total de la poblaci6n de la provincia. (Ver Cuadro 5).
La ciudad de Sosua constituye el segundo ncileo poblacional, de la provincia estimandose en 17,959
habitantes, equivalentes al 56% de la poblacion total del municipio. De esta ultima se estimo que el 51%
es femenina y el 50% masculina.
Por otra parte la emigraci6n de la poblaci6n se considera baja, pero la migraci6n se considera alta para la
zona en vista del atractivo como polo turistico.
El municipio de Sosua abarca 288.20 kil6metros cuadrados y comprende 3 secciones con 38 parajes.

5.4.1.2. Educaci6n
La provincia de Puerto Plata es en la regi6n norte una de las provincias que posee mas centros
educativos en el pals con 420 centros de diferentes tipos a enero de 1999.
Pagina- 30



Borrador Inforime Fi,tal
25 de abril, 1999
Del total de centros de la provincia, al municipio de Sosua corresponden 43 centros educativos
equivalentes al 10%. De estos a su vez 33 son centros educativos del tipo pOblico y 10 del tipo privado.
En el nivel de educaci6n inicial en el municipio de Sosuia en el afio 1996-97 existian 1,749 alumnos
registrados mientras que en el nivel de educaci6n basica se registraron 7,100 alumnos.
5.4.1.3. Salud
La Provincia de Puerto Plata cuenta con un hospital publico a nivel provincial , con facilidades de
laboratorios , cirugia e internamiento. Cuenta ademas con 8 Subcentros de salud con facilidades de
consulta, a raz6n de 1 por cada municipio, y 24 Clinicas Rurales y dispensarios urbanos.
La provincia cuenta al ano 1997 con 406 rmndicos y 50 enfermeras en los Centros de Salud de SESPAS,
IDSS, Centros Clinicos Privados, ONGs y FFAA.
En el municipio de Sos0a existen un Subcentro de salud en el pueblo de SosCia y 4 Clinicas rurales en
todo el municipio.
5.4.1.4. Elementos de la poblaci6n susceptibles a riesgos especiales.
En el caso de Sosua la poblaci6n de mas alto riesgo actualmente es la poblaci6n marginal de 1a ciudad de
Sosta y de las comunidades de las zonas rurales donde las condiciones del agua servida son precarias
y asi mismo la disposici6n de excretas. Esto unido al problema de la contaminaci6n de aguas de rios y
arroyos y su uso sin adecuado tratamiento determina problemas de enfermedades diarrelcas agudas en
nifios menores de 5 anos, asf como enfermedades transmitidas por vectores.
En la situaci6n actual la disposici6n de aguas servidas por los hoteles del area es realizada por la vla
superficial al traves de drenes naturales y por la via de los acufferos subterraneos, que finalmente son
vertidas al mar. En vista del extraordinario crecimiento de las instalaciones hoteleras y del aumento del
volumen de ia disposici6n de estas aguas, tambien aumenta el riesgo de enfermedades de ia piel y otras
enfermedades a los usuarios de las playas, por ia cual desde el punto de vista social, urge este proyecto
de saneamiento de las aguas utilizadas en esta zona.
5.4.2. Aspectos Econ6micos
5.4.2.1. Descripci6n de Sectores de la Econom!a
En terminos de uso de la tierra en el area costera del municipio de Sosua la actividad turistica esta
desplazando la actividad ganadera cuyas tierras estan sin uso en un proceso de transicion al uso
turistico.
En consecuencia como actividad sectorial el turismo se ha constituido en la principal actividad estimada
en un 70 % dejando en un segundo piano a la actividad agroindustrial y Comercial con un 25%. En un
tercer lugar subsiste la actividad ganadera, en algunas areas dispersas y en las areas mas alejadas de
Sosua y Cabarete dentro del Municipio de Sosua con un 5%.
5.4.2.2. Turismo
La zona de SosCia disponfa al inicio del ano 1999, de 74 hoteles, igualando en numero a la ciudad de
Puerto Plata y sus areas cercanas. Sin embargo siendo en gran parte hoteles pequenos, el nOmero de
habitaciones que alcanza a 4,425 constituye la mitad del numero de habitaciones con relaci6n al area de
Puerto Plata que dispone aproximadamente del mismo numero de hoteles.(Ver Cuadro 6). Por otra parte
Sosua y Cabarete en conjunto disponen del 47% del numero de habitaciones.

En sosua el 51% de los hoteles tienen menos de 30 habitaciones y el 30% de los mismos entre 30 y 70
habitaciones. Por otra parte el periodo de mayor desarrollo fue el 1980-1990 con el establecimiento del
41% de la capacidad instalada actual. (Ver Cuadro 7)

Los hoteles se disponen a todo lo largo de la Costa a partir del Sector del Batey Este, contiguo a ia playa
de SosCia. Este sector, antigua colonia de los Judios, hoy se ha convertido en el principal nucleo turistico
para la dotaci6n de los servicios de apoyo al sistema, En el lado Oeste de la playa de Sosua, se
encuentran en menor cantidad algunos hoteles y el sector poblacional de los Charamicos que tambien
posee los tradicionales servicios comerciales a la poblaci6n.

del total de la zona turistica Susua-Cabarete. (Ver Cuadro 8).
En la zona costera del ,rea de influencia del proyecto la actividad ecoturistica mas importante realizada
es la de buceo en arrecifes coralinos. El sistema coralino de esta costa es un atractivo turistico que esta
siendo explotado, existiendo por lo menos tres breas de buceo identificadas y 25 empresas que se
dedican a ofertar este servicio turistico. Se estima que esta actividad con las visitas de 40,000 aficionados

La localizaci6n del emisario submarino en Punta Sosua significaria no solamente una perdida economica
directa en terminos de ingreso y de empleo sino tambien en terminos indirectos de la imagen de la
actividad turistica por la repercusion de la perdida de un atractivo ecoturtistico de fama internacional.
Por otra parte como actividad turistica marina estt ampliamente desarrollado el paseo en grupos en botes
de vela desde Playa Dorada a Sosua, incluyendo una empresa que se dedica a la observacion del fondo
marino del ecosistema coralino.
5.4.2.3. Industria
En el sector del area de Sosua, de los tres segmentos industriales identificados, de agroindustrias, zonas
francas e industrias locales, se destacan solamente las agroindustrias. De estas ultimas existen en el
poblado como resultante de ser originalmente un asentamiento agropecuario de inmigrantes judios de ia
decada de 1940, dos grandes industrias pecuarias las cuales abastecen tanto el mercado local como
regional y nacional. En el mismo sector del Batey de la ciudad de Sosua se encuentra la compania
industrial lechera que produce quesos y otros productos lacteos, mientras que la compaAia industrial
ganadera localizada en las afueras del poblado sobre la carretera a Cabarete produce embutidos de
diferentes tipos. Ambas industrias pecuarias mercadean sus productos en ia marca "Sosua" y poseen
ademas un supermercado para mercadear localmente sus productos y otros productos de calidad
demandados por los turistas.
Existen en la zona algunas pequefias y medianas agroindustrias que tambi6n se dedican a la producci6n
de Yogur y quesos frescos blancos, algunos de reconocida fama regional las cuales se observan en un
estado de decadencia por la falta de suministros de materias primas a precios competitivos.
Las dos grandes agroindustrias han podido subsistir en vista de tener acreditadas una marca reconocida
y obteniendo la materia prima de regiones aledaSas. La Agroindustria de lacteos recibe la materia prima
en un 40% de toda la regi6n costera de Puerto Plata y el restante 60% de las zonas costeras de las
provincias cercanas.La Agroindustria de carnes y embutidos recibe ia materia prima principalmente de las
provincias de la region del Cibao Central.

5.4.2.4. Agricultura, Ganaderia Y Pesca
La actividad agricola de ciclo corto en el municipio de Sosua es practicamente inexistente y la ganaderia
que era la actividad mas importante esta siendo desplazada por el Turismo. En la secci6n de Sabaneta
de Cangrejos al Oeste del pueblo de Sosua que comprende el paraje del mismo nombre y el paraje de la
Uni6n, solo quedan vestigios aislados de la actividad. Asi mismo en los parajes del Higuero y la
Atravesada ,ai Este del pueblo de Sosua pueden apreciarse los potreros abandonados y en proceso de
parcelaci6n urbana turistica. Sin embargo en la Seccion de Sabaneta de Yasica el mas alejado del
pueblo de Sosua, se realiza una intensa actividad ganadera de doble prop6sito, convirtiendola en la
principal area de abastecimiento de leche y carne para la zona turistica.
En la parte montahosa de la region a todo lo largo de la costa que va desde Puerto Plata a Cabarete,
ademas de la actividad ganadera existen plantaciones cafetaleras y Cacaotaleras, y una zona boscosa
en el area frente a Cabarete.
En la actualidad existen dos asentamientos campesinos ganaderos en la zona de Sosua, uno en la
comunidad de Bella Vista, en la parte montaFiosa, frente a la ciudad de Sosua y otro en el paraje de
Sabaneta de Yasica, cerca del pueblo del mismo nombre, los cuales benefician a 362 familias.
En el caso de la actividad pesquera, Sosua solo dispone de una area de desembarco donde operan 23
yolas en el sitio conocido como Rio Mar, en la desembocadura del rio Sosua. Esta actividad constituye el
43% de la producci6n total pesquera de este tipo de embarcaci6n, de Puerto Plata y Sosua, la cual
dispone de cuatro areas de desembarco con un total de 53 yolas. (Ver Cuadro 9). El pescado capturado
es distribuido principalmente a los pequenos restaurantes y los consumidores locales.

5.4.2.5. Comercio
El sistema de distribuci6n comercial basado en detallistas locales y en Mayoristas en Puerto Plata,
permite el abastecimiento de productos alimenticios y no alimenticios. Los hoteles en diferentes tamaFr->s
y tipos se abastecen ademas del comercio mayorista en la ciudad de Santiago y de los representantes de
casas distribuidoras en Puerto Plata y Santiago.
5.4.2.6. Tasa de Empleo y Descripci6n de la Fuerza Laboral
Dentro del sector formal de la economia de la regi6n, el sector hotelero turistico de Sosua juega un papel
importante, proporcionando un estimado de 5,000 empleos directos y 12,000 empleos indirectos. ( Ver
Cuadro 10).
Sin embargo en la poblaci6n marginal de Sosua el componente del desempleo o necesidad de empleo es
bastante alto alcanzando el 49% para los pobres del tipo 1. (Ver Cuadro 11). Este se estima influenciado
en el alto crecimiento de la poblacion para la region, la cual a su vez esta influenciada por la migracion a
este polo de desarrollo turistico, de personas provenientes del area rural y de otras regiones cercanas.

5.4.2.7. Potencial y Direcci6n del Crecimiento o Cambio
De continuar la tendencia y la practica de politica econ6mica actual sobre la regi6n basada en el
desarrollo del sector turismo, es de esperarse que este continuara tomando en el futuro el liderazgo de
crecimiento en la zona de Sosua.
Se estima por lo tanto que el numero de habitaciones aumente de 4,425 a finales de 1998 a 6,500
habitaciones para el aho 2,01 0.
En el aspecto pesquero de ia regi6n Costa Norte, el numero de embarcaciones dedicadas a la pesca
costera se mantiene estancado e incluso el numero de barcos de pesca mar afuera, ha disminuido
notablemente desde la decada de 1980.
En el caso de la actividad pesquera en Sosua se espera que se mantenga el numero de yolas y de
cambiar la politica actual se esperaria que se aumente, considerando tambien que el proyecto con el tipo
de emisario submarino a ser establecido, evitara la contaminaci6n y no entorpecera las actividades
pesqueras.
6. IMPACTOS AMBIENTALES
6.1. Impactos Ambientales Provocados por la NO Acci6n
Los impactos ambientales provocas por la no acci6n son significativas y negativas. La necesidad para el
mejoriamiento de la capacidid del manejo sanitario de las aguas saneatario de la regi6n de Sosua es
crucial para el desarrollo regional futuro. Tambien, la falta de la infrastructura para su manejo he
Pagina- 35



Borrador Informe Final
25 de abril, 1999
provocado condiciones regionales que afectan la ecologia del sistema de recursos marinos y salud
humana que no pueden continuar sin impactos negativos de la economia regional. Especificamente, los
impactos anticipados por la implementaci6n de la no accion son la siguente:
•  Contaminaci6n de fuentes de agua superficial y subterranea.
*  Contaminaci6n de las playas.
*  Peligros para la salud, tanto de los turistas como de los residentes en Sosua.
*  Afea el paisaje.
*  Deterioro del turismo.
Por estas razones, la selecci6n de la no acci6n opcion fue eliminada de consideraci6n.
6.2. Alternativas Consideradas
6.2.1. Alternativas de Tratamiento
Para el tratamiento de los residuos previo a la descarga submarina el proyecto ha considerado tres (3)
alternativas, cuyas caracteristicas se resumen en el Cuadro 12. De estas, los consultores responsables
de esa parte del proyecto (Weinberg, Juanic6, & Friedler) proponen implementar la primera (Alternativa 1)
por las razones siguientes:
1. Proveera un buen tratamiento a las aguas residuales antes de su descarga al mar.
2. Hace uso de una planta ya existente y recien construida, con bajos costos de operaci6n y
mantenimiento.
3. Es mas econ6mica que la opcion 2.
4. Su ejecuci6n es mas ficil que la opci6n 3. En general esta opci6n parece ser la mSs
adecuada desde el punto de vista ambiental.

6.2.2. Alternativas de Disposicion Final
Los consultores sefnalan que la descarga al mar mediante el Emisario Submarino, es la uTnica via hallada
para la disposici6n de las aguas residuales, ya que otras opciones no son viables en Sostja, por las
siguientes razones:
*  No hay acuifero con las caracteristicas adecuadas para hacer infiltraci6n o inyecci6n.
*  No hay humedales u otros cuerpos de aguas superficiales, adecuados para recibir aguas
residuales tratadas.
*  No hay demanda para el uso de aguas residuales tratadas en irrigacion.
Debido a las impactos que esta alternativa de descarga puede tener sobre los ecosistemas costeros
marinos, se ha realizado un analisis mas profundo de los impactos potenciales en la construcci6n e
instalaci6n de esta infraestructura en particular. En este sentido se han analizado cuatro altemativas para
la ubicaci6n de esta infraestructura (ubicada en figura 4):
*  Frente a la Planta de Tratamiento (Bahia SosC2a) (Altematativa Recomendada)
*  Ensenada al SE Punta SosCua, final de la Pista de aternzaje Aeropuerto La Uni6n (Bahia
Sos6a)
• Punta Sosua
=  El Calet6n (at centro de la pista de aternizaje Aeropuerto La Uni6n)
6.2.3. Descripcion Del Lugar YActividades Ejecutadas En Cada Slfio Alternativo
6.2.3.1. Frente a la Planta de Tratamiento (Bahia Sosua) (Alterantativa Recomendada)
Esta ubicaci6n fue la primera opci6n recomendada por los estudios de ingenieria realizados por los
consultores del proyecto. Esta ubicaci6n fue objeto de analisis posteriores mas detallados debido a la
sospecha que dicho emisor pudiere convertirse en un potencial contaminante de ia Bahia Sosuia y el
balneario de Sosua ubicado a unos 2 km a Este. Para tales fines se ejecutaron levantamientos
batimWtricos y analisis oceanograficos puntuales y detallados, los que sirvieron de base para preparar
modelos de dispersi6n de los efluentes del emisor, siguiendo los estandares de California.
En visita al sitio desde un bote se nota que la interface con el mar ocurre en un acantilado rocoso de
unos 2 a 3 metros de altura, el cual cae abruptamente hacia unos 5 metros de profundidad en agua.
movidas por oleaje (0.5-1.5 m) de fondo y en parte influenciado por el viento predominante del NE. El
fondo inmediatamente le corresponde a una franja estrecha de roca arrecifal, erosionada y cubierta
por algas, corales dispersos y octocorales; denota una alta energla. A unos 50 metros de la costa el
fondo cae hacia mayores profundidades abruptamente en un fondo arenoso, en donde se intercalan
monticulos rocosos (mogotes), que constituyen los refugios de fauna y en donde se realizan buceos
deportivos.
SegOn los datos batimetricos consultados y la posici6n del arroyo la Uni6n, aparenta que la zona se
corresponde al firme de un canon submarino, el cual posee una abrupta orografia y alcanza los 200
metros de profundidad a los 1,000 m de la orilla.
En la visita al lugar se observa que el arroyo La Uni6n, el cual drena los lixiviados del vertedero Ia
Uni6n y el antiguo vertedero (no saneado) que se encuentra en la margen oeste del puente que lo
cruza al nivel de la carretera, arrastran basuras plasticas que se depositan en las inmediaciones. No
se tomaron datos de calidad de aguas.

Borrador Informe Finzal
25 de abril, 1999
De acuerdo a la bathymetria preparada por Ocean Survey, existe una profundidad de 160 m dentro
una distancia de 1 km norte la planta propuesta (figura 5). Tambien existe una termoclina y gradiente
de densidad entre 80 y 120 m de profundidad.
Como parte de la evaluaci6n de este opci6n, un modelo de dispersion fue utilizado para pronosticar la
distribuci6n de los contaminantes anticipados de la construccion del emasario submarino a la
profundidad de 140 metros. Los hallazgos de Dr. Roberts, presentados en el anexo 1, indican que el
nivel de dispersion reliazado con este desino sera aproximadimiente 100:1 inicialimiente a la
profundidad de 138 metros. Tambien, de acuerdo de este modelo, la dispersi6n de los contaminantes
no pueden cruzar la gradiente de densidad y seran entrapados bajo la profundidad de 80 metros.
En la construccion de este modelo, el Dr. Roberts usando parametros muy conservadores y sin
considerar majoramientos de la despersion por corrientes de la mar. Como consequencias, el nivel
de diluci6n realimente sera mas alto que los hallazgos monstrados por el model. De acuerdo de este
model, los impactos ambientales anticipada desde la implamantaci6n de este opcion deberia minimo,
no significante y no afectan el uso humano del area ni las sistemas imortantes ecologicamiente del
irea.
Como una ultima exercisio de seguridad, le considerada la remota posibilidad que la dispersion de los
contamanantes pueden cruzar la gradiente de densidad y sigue haste el supericio. En este caso, el
nivel de dilucion anticipado sera 1000:1, una cantidad considerablemente bajo normas
internacionales para la protecci6n de salud humano y recifes coralinas.
Se recomienda la utilizacion de este lugar.
6.2.3.2. Ensenada al SE de Punta Sosua, final de la Pista de aterrizaje Aeropuerto La Uni6n
(Bahia Sosu2a)
Esta es una pequenia ensenada orientada al NE, en donde el acantilado se eleva entre 0.5 a 1 m
sobre el nivel del mar. Segun las informaciones obtenidas, recogidas del Dive Master de ia empresa
de buceo deportivo SeaPro de Puerto Plata, este sitio profundiza abruptamente en un fondo arenoso
alcanzado los 20 metros de profundidad a escasos 100 metros de la costa en un fondo arenoso hasta
pasar Punta SosCia y se continuan en la periferia y al Este del arrecife de Punta Sosua, hasta
alcanzar profundidades que no son aptas para el buceo.
Para alcanzar este punto se debe realizar una infraestructura bordeando la costa desde la planta de
tratamiento hasta ese punto de unos 2 km., enfrentando la topografia y impactando el bosque costero
en este lugar. Para Ilegar a este lugar no se requiere cruzar la pista de aterrizaje, asi como por estar
en el margen de la Punta Sosua, la disposici6n de tuberias del emisor pudiera construirse al margen
del sistema arrecifal de Punta SosCia, hasta alcanzar las profundidades y distancias apropiadas que
segun el modelo evite la interacci6n con el arrecife y los visitantes (buceo turistico). Esta acci6n
ademas impactarfa ambientalmente la vegetaci6n y ecologla de ia costa en 2 km. Se tendria que
excavar con compresores la roca, construir un camino de acceso para la obra, establecer
campamentos de operaci6n, construir puentes de tuberias (by-pass) en el arroyo La Uni6n, ademas
de que alargaria dicha tuberia a unos 1,000 metros adicionales, o sea que en comparaci6n con el
sitio propuesto #1, se considera que se adicionan 3,000 metros de tuberea aproximadamente, mas 2
km de obras en la costa en suelos rocosos arrecifales con los subsecuentes impactos ambientales
durante la obra y encareciendo el mantenimiento futuro para estas infraestructuras.
6.2.3.3. Punta SosCua
Lugar alternativo propuesto por el proyecto, a partir de una observaci6n primaria de la direcci6n y
frecuencias de las corrientes marinas y el viento. Tambien se consider6 la batimetria marina mas
suave de la zona. Se realizan posteriormente levantamientos batimetricos y analisis oceanograficos
puntuales, se prepara un modelo de dispersi6n de dicha descarga a traves del emisor segun lo
dise ado y estandares de California, y se realiza un buceo de inspecci6n de la zona para comprobar

las condiciones ambientales del sitio. Dicho buceo se disefi6 para realizarse desde los 28 metros de
profundidad hasta la costa, siguiendo un rumbo 1800 S, y segtin la localizaci6n eje del estudio
oceanogrAfico realizado con anterioridad al buceo. En este reconocimiento visual se encontr6 que la
regi6n arrecifal se caracteriza por ser un arrecife costero de alta energia en buenas - excelentes
condiciones ambientales y altamente visitada por los buzos (buceo turistico) de la regi6n (desde
Puerto Plata hasta Cabarete). La descripci6n de la misma a partir de los 28 metros de profundidad, es
como sigue:
*  Zona de deposici6n compuesto por arenas de granos medianos a finos con algas, esponjas y
octocorales dispersos como principal caracteristicas ambientales.
•  En esta misma profundidad y dispersos se encuentran monticulos de rocas de areniscas
consolidadas (3 hasta 15 metros de di6metro), cubiertas de corales, esponjas, gorg6nias y
algas, refugio de peces.
*  Desde Is 24 metros hasta los 16 metros, se encuentra un talud (zona de refuerzo arrecifal)
cubierto (>25%) de octocorales, y cobertura de >15% de corales, en excelentes condiciones
de crecimiento. Este talud posee una orograffa irregular dendroica con direcci6n N.
*  En los 16 hasta los 10 metros se encuentra un canal de arenas gruesas con particulas y
subproductos de los procesos erosivos normales arrecifales. La capa de arena es poco
profunda. En hondonadas se encuentran concentraciones de desperdicios arrecifales en
donde se acumulan y sirven de substrato apropiado para el establecimiento de fauna
bent6nica.
•  A partir de los 10 metros hasta la misma costa (acantilados) se inicia un piso duro y piano con
fracturas, grietas y hondonadas (grutas) en donde se establece una comunidad dominada por
octocorales algas y esponjas. En estas fracturas y otras irregularidades se refugian especies
de peces y los erizos negros de pCas largas. En esta porci6n aparecen canales transversales
y hondonadas en donde se acumulan restos de corales, principalmente de colonias de formas
redondeadas.
Se considera que cualquier acci6n de obras en este sitio adem6s de alterar las condiciones de
vegetaci6n costera al igual que la propuesta para el sitio #2, tambidn incluiria la alteraci6n del trafico
del aeropuerto, ya que debe atravesar la pista. Tambi6n y mas importante impactarla negativamente
el arrecife de coral de Punta Sosua, asi como disminuye su calidad. No se recomienda realizar esta
obra en el lugar ya que impactarA el arrecife y la industria de buceo turistico de la regi6n
6.2.3.4. El Calet6n (al centro de la pista de aterrizaje Aeropuerto La Uni6n)
Este sitio se ha establecido como alternativa a las anteriores si se desea mantener la profundidad del
emisor a los 40 metros. Sin embargo se encuentra ubicada 2 km al Oeste, y conlleva a impactar una
amplia region de vegetacifn costera que representa en la actualidad la inica representativa de la
vegetaci6n costera tipica de la regi6n y que no ha sido alterada por el desarrollo turfstico y ganadero.
El sitio no fue inspeccionado por buceo debido a que es influenciado por el Rio Cami y ia turbidez es
media a alta, lo cual indica que naturalmente el arrecife (si alli se encontrase alguno) estarla reducido
por los efectos acumulativos de la sedimentaci6n del Rio Camu.

bosque costero que
sobrevive en la regi6n, el
cual, ademis de su valor
natural intrinseco, es el
principal atractivo para la
industria de buceo de la
zona.
6.3. Resuimen de la Alternativa Recomendada
Como resultado de la evaluaci6n impactos ambientiales, la alternativa recomendada comprende los
siguentes componentes:
*  Utilizar la planta existante, tipo UASB
*  Construir la unidad de pre-tratamiento para la removacion de grasas y solidos antes de la
discarga a la UASB.
*  Construir el emasario submarino desde el UASB para la disposicion final en la ubicaci6n en frente
de la planta de tratamiento (Bahia Sosua) y ubicar ia red de descarga en el mar a la 140 m de
profundidad. Este punto sera aproximadamente 570 m norte de ia planta de tratamiento.
*  Construir la red de recoleci6n de acuerdo de los requirementos de la ingeneria del sistema y
utilizar medidas apropriadas para la mitigacion de los impactos ambientales directos en su
construci6n.
En la selecci6n de este opci6n, los impactos ambientales negativos seran limitados a impactos directos
que resulten de su construccion y cumplimiento con las normas de operacion sobre el largo plazo.
6.4. Impactos Ambientales del Proyecto y Medidas de Mitigaci6n
El proyecto tiene el potencial de impactar tanto el medio fisico como el biol6gico y el socioecon6mico. Sin
embargo, al considerarse estos impactos en las fases de planificacion y diseno es posible implementa,
medidas de mitigaci6n que garanticen la factibilidad ambiental del mismo.
Dentro de la concepcion del proyecto, las Estaciones de Bombeo, la Planta de Tratamiento y el Emisario
Submarino, aportan los mayores riesgos de impactos ambientales negativos, que se perciben
mayormente durante la etapa de construcci6n y operaci6n.
El impacto mas significativos de este proyecto sobre el medio biol6gico es el siguiente:
*  Posibles afectaciones a los arrecifes de coral y a la biodiversidad costero-marina, como
efecto de la construccion y operaci6n del emisario submarino. Esto tiene ademas impactos
indirectos en la industria turistica de la zona.
En este sentido, los principales tensores identificados para el area de estudio son:

Borrador Informe Final
25 de abril, 1999
Playa Dorada hasta Punta Bergantin - Los ecosistemas coralinos en esta zona se
encuentra grandemente degradado debido a los votiumenes de sedimentos y nutrientes que
recibe desde la desembocadura de los arroyos y del rio Camiu. Tamrbi6n se debe notar que la
gran actividad humana que se realiza en la zona ha modificado la topografia del fondo, creando
corrientes que tienden a concentrar estos efectos sobre ia Punta Bergantin afectando los
arrecifes que alli se encuentran.
Como medidas de control para esta zona se recomienda:
*  Readecuar los flujos de agua en la zona para restablecer la funci6n del pantano, de forma tal que
permita retener los sedimentos que alli se descargan.
•  Reubicar el emisor submarino de Playa Caro Grande (Playa Dorada) hasta los 40 + metros de
profundidad, de forma tal que se reduzca el aporte de nutrientes que aparentemente queda
confinado en la fisiografia de Playa Dorada.
•  Rolocar boyas de amarre para botes.
0  En la secci6n del arrecife del aeropuerto, el llano arrecifal pocas personas lo visitan debido a
que es muy somero y de aguas movidas. Ademas no posee acceso desde tierra. El arrecife
profundo es un lugar preferido por la industria turistica regional. Solamente los efectos de la
pesca indiscriminada con arp6n que todavia los pescadores locales utilizan, asi como los
efectos de anclaje, y buzos que todavia tocan los corales son causas que origina tensi6n
sobre este sitio.
En Sosua, la cantidad de buzos SCUBA que visitan este sitio es de unos 200 dia. Algunos de ellos son
transportados por botes que navegan desde Puerto Plata y anclan encima de el. Ademas las colonias de
coral, esponjas mas vistosas son utilizadas por fot6grafos para sacar fotos de los turistas. Esta acci6n por
lo general implica que las personas se agarren, se sienten e inclusive se paren sobre estas estructuras
vivas. Porciones muertas de estas colonias son evidentes. La sedimentaci6n es un proceso que tambien
ha empezado a comprobarse. Un fino sedimento ha empezado a generarse producto de las actividades
de deterioro que estan realizando sobre la Piedra de Sosua. A la mortandad de los corales que alli ocurre,
ocasiona que el sedimento se distribuya alrededor del arrecife a 10 metros. Segun los lugarehos la
turbidez es mucho mas frecuente en Sosua hoy que en el pasado. Otro gran problematica presente es la
sobre pesca. En SosOa debido a la gran demanda de pescado y ia tradici6n de prepararlos en tarantines
en la playa, todo tipo y tamafio de peces son capturados con arp6n. Se han diezmado grandemente la
poblaci6n de depredadores mayores y disminuido notablemente la poblacion de herbivoros. Tampoco
estan presentes los erizos.
Como medidas generales de control para esta zona se recomienda:
*  Declarar esta zona como area recreativa controlada bajo jurisdiccion de co-manejo, entre la
Secretaria de Turismo - ASONAHORES -ONG- PESCADORES- Dept. de Recursos Pesqueros
/Sec. Estado Agricultura.
*  Establecer un patr6n de visitaci6n controlado para el arrecife de coral de la zona.
*  Prohibir la pesca de arp6n en todo este tramo.
*  Instalar boyas de amarre para botes de visita en toda la zona y en especial en los sitios de buceo.
Dentro de los impactos potenciales en el medio fisico cabe destacar el impacto en la calidad de las
aguas, tanto subterraneas como superficiales. Este impacto podria ser netamente positivo con respecto a
la situaci6n actual siempre que se implementen las medidas de mitigaci6n consideradas.
Desde el punto de vista socioeconomico existen potenciales impactos al paisaje que podrian repercutir en
la industria turistica de la zona, ademas del incrernento en el riesgo de accidentes y problemas de transito

durante la construccion. Tambien tendria un impacto importante en la economia de la regi6n el posible
deterioro de los corales frente al aeropuerto de la Union, por ser este la principal atracci6n de la industria
del buceo en la zona.
En el Cuadro 14 se resumen los principales impactos identificados, asi como las medidas de mitigaci6n
necesarias, y el momento (etapa del proyecto) en que estas deberan de implementarse. En el Cuadro 15
se discuten los principales aspectos del entorno que pueden impactar negativamente el proyecto,
indicandose las medidas a tomar para prevenir posibles efectos adversos.
Como puede observarse en estos cuadros los impactos identificados son, en general, mitigables. Sin
embargo para garantizar la aplicaci6n de las medidas de mitigaci6n sugeridas y de practicas adecuadas
de operaci6n de las facilidades, es necesario establecer un sistema de seguimiento y control, amparado
en clausulas contractuales especificas.
7. PLAN DE MANEJO AMBIENTAL
El proposito del Plan de Manejo Ambiental para el Proyecto de Descarga Submarina de Aguas
Residuales es definir las entidades, responsabilidades y recursos de las instancias participantes en el
proceso de construcci6n, desarrollo y monitoreo del Proyecto.
7.1. Responsabilidades de Entidades del Gobierno Nacional
Como se indico anteriormente, (ver Capitulo 3 de este Informe) las responsabilidades administrativas y
t6cnicas de proyectos de naturaleza ambiental se encuentran dispersas en una vasta gama de
instituciones a nivel nacional entre las cuales se deben mencionar:
* Instituto Nacional de Proteccion Ambiental
- Secretaria de Estado de Agricultura
- Secretaria de Estado de Obras Publicas
•  Instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado
• Secretaria de Estado de Turismo
- Secretaria de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social
* Corporaci6n de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo
* Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos
7.1.1. Supervision
En igual forma, la legislacion ambiental existente a nivel nacional y sectorial, asi como de la experiencia
institucional y los recursos tecnico administrativos para formular, supervisar y monitorear proyectos de
descargas de aguas negras se encuentran dispersos en una multiplicidad de decretos, resoluciones,
ordenanzas y medidas que diluyen y atomizan la responsabilidad institucional de las instancias
nacionales.
En la actualidad la inexistencia de una politica ambiental de caracter nacional o marco legal unico, asi
como de reglamentaci6n especifica sobre el desarrollo y manejo de descargas submarinas de aguas
residuales en el litoral maritimo es practicamente inexistente lo cual contribuye a debilitar ia
responsabilidad del las agencias gubernamentales a nivel nacional.

De los organismos anteriormente mencionados la Secretaria de Estado de Salud Publica y
Asistencia Social, el Instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado, la Secretaria de Estado
de Turismo, la Corporaci6n de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo, el Instituto
Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos y la Secretaria de Estado de Agricultura, serian, en la
actualidad, las entidades que tendrian responsabilidad institucional para ejercer tareas de
supervisi6n del proyecto de Descarga Submarina de Aguas Residuales.
Sin embargo, considerando las caracteristicas tecnicas del proyecto del emisario submarino y
sobre todo la intenci6n que se tiene de replicar este proyecto en otras regiones del pafs, deberia
considerarse un programa acelerado de informaci6n y adiestramiento sobre el proyecto orientado
al sector publico y organizaciones no gubernamentales.
7.2. Responsabilidades de Entidades del Gobierno Local.
A nivel local y regional los Ayuntamientos de Puerto Plata, Sosoa y Cabarete tienen
responsabilidades de control, supervisi6n y seguimiento de programas de saneamiento
ambiental. Carecen en la actualidad de recursos humanos tecnicamente calificados y de
presupuesto adecuado para ejercer el las operaciones de supervisi6n del proyecto de descarga
de aguas negras.
Para contrarrestar estas serias limitaciones podrfa crearse a nivel local y regional unidades
t6cnicas ambientales en los municipios de destino turistico, desarrollando programas de
capacitaci6n acelerada del personal que seria especialmente reclutado para ejercer tareas de
supervisi6n y seguimiento de las operaciones de proyectos de saneamiento ambiental y uso de
los recursos naturales. Un programa basico de manejo ambiental mediante seminarios, talleres,
mesas redondas, y videos, entre otras actividades, seria altamente recomendable.
Un programa de capacitaci6n acelerado del personal a nivel local tanto municipal como
perteneciente a las agencias sectoriales debera incluir adiestramiento ambiental al menos sobre:
(I) el concepto de desarrollo sostenible; (ii) reglamentaci6n vigente de control y monitoreo de
todos los proyectos de saneamiento ambiental en la region - manejo de desperdicios s6lidos;
descarga de aguas residuales particularmente el tratamiento de las aguas negras antes de la
descarga ( se prepararan manuales para este prop6sito) y otras operaciones de disposici6n final
de desperdicios.
7.3. Necesidades Institucionales Para Ejercer Supervisi6n
Un breve estudio de la autoridad legal y de la capacidad de las instancias gubernamentales a
nivel local y nacional pone en evidencia la necesidad de disponer la organizaci6n de un
mecanismo alternativo que permita la ejecuci6n y supervisi6n del proyecto.
Por otra parte la aprobaci6n dentro de un corto plazo del anteproyecto de la Ley General de
Recursos Naturales, Protecci6n del Medio Ambiente y Calidad de Vida, y o del C6digo de
Protecci6n Ambiental y Calidad de Vida no parece probable. El Codigo ha sido rechazado en dos
oportunidades por la Camara de Diputados y al parecer no existe consenso aun sobre el
articulado, funciones y estructura organizacional del proyecto.
El anteproyecto de ley General de Recursos Naturales, Protecci6n Ambiental y Calidad de Vida,
preparada bajo los auspicios del Programa de Desarrollo de la Naciones Unidas, al parecer esta
para consideracion por el Congreso Nacional.
Esta situaci6n conduce a que en el corto plazo la ejecuci6n del proyecto de descarga submarina
de aguas residuales no disponga de un marco legal ambiental ni de reglamentaci6n especifica en
esta materia.

7.4. Supervisi6n del Proyecto de Descarga de Aguas Residuales
Como se indico, la responsabilidad especifica no esta indicada en la reglamentacion existente. Si
bien existe reglamentacion general sobre descargas en zonas costeras, esta reglamentaci6n se
encuentra dispersa en varias instancias lo cual dificulta en vez de facilitar la tarea de supervision
del proyecto antes, durante y despu6s de la ejecucion del mismo. Por otra parte la
regiamentacion acerca de norrnas de calidad de aguas que se descarguen en el medio maritimo
no parece adecuada a la condicion ambiental del pals. Se ha argumentado que las normas
americanas (EPA) no serian apropiadas, ademas de tener un costo demasiado alto para el pa[s
en la situacion actual. Esta situacion conduce a buscar alternativas viables de supervision a fin
de ejecutar el proyecto a la mayor brevedad.
7.5. Plan de Ejacuci6n Alternativo
Una posibilidad es implementar un arreglo intersectorial a fin de ejecutar el Proyecto de
Descarga Submarina de Aguas Residuales, asignando a una Entidad la responsabilidad
temporal de supervisi6n tecnica del Proyecto. Dada la importancia de este proyecto y sobretodo
por ser pionero en la Republica Dominicana se sugiere una organizacion ad-hoc para desarrollar
el proyecto Esta Entidad estaria conformada por:
*  un representante de la Secretaria de Estado de Turismo
*  un representante de instituto Nacional de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (INAPA)
*  un representante de la Secretaria de Salud Publica
*  un representante de la Asociacion de Desarrollo de Sosua
*  un representante de ASONAHORES
*  un representante de los Ayuntamientos de la zona.
Este Comite de Supervision del Emisor Submarino, tendria el proposito de ejecutar las acciones
necesarias para desarrollar el proyecto desde su iniciacion hasta la entrega del proyecto
terminado al operador del mismo.
La organizacion propuesta tiene el proposito, por una parte de coordinar las acciones
destinadas a la aprobacion rapida por las entidades gubernamentales de las licencias para
ejecutar el proyecto y por otro maximizar los recursos humanos, tecnicos y la experiencia
institucional existente en las organizaciones mencionadas. Este Comite Tecnico de Supervisi6n
estaria compuesto por profesionales calificados de las instituciones mencionadas.
El Comite tendria autoridad legal temporal y cesaria en sus funciones una vez completada la
ejecucion del proyecto transfiriendo sus funciones y responsabilidades a la institucion que
establezca la Ley Ambiental una vez aprobada por el Congreso de la Republica y promulgada
por el Poder Ejecutivo.
7.6. Conclusion
Desde luego esta no es la unica alternativa viable para la ejecuci6n del Proyecto del Emisor
Submarino pero tiene la ventaja para el Estado que representa un menor costo administrativo y
permite maximizar el uso de los recursos humanos que trabajan en las instituciones
anteriormente mencionadas, asi como la experiencia e informaci6n disponible.

8. Implementacion de las Medidas de Mitigaci6n y el Plan de Manejo Ambiental
En general, las medidas de mitigaci6n propuestas para el proyecto forman parte de la operaci6n
normal del mismo o se enmarcan dentro de las buenas practicas de ingenieria (ver Cuadros 14 y
15), y por lo tanto no conllevan costos adicionales a los considerados para el proyecto. Sin
embargo, para garantizar que estas medidas sean incorporadas en el proceso de diseno,
durante la operaci6n y clausura del relleno, es necesario establecer medidas de control, algunas
de las cuales se reflejaran en los documentos contractuales y terminos de referencia de la
concesi6n. Otras conllevar6n un seguimiento y monitoreo de las labores del concesionario desde
el punto de vista de los requerimientos ambientales y sociales del proyecto. El Cuadro 16
presenta los costos asociados con la implementaci6n de estas actividades.
8.1.   Elaboraci6n del Contrato de Concesi6n para el Sistema de Recolecci6n,
Tratamiento y Disposicion de las Aguas Residuales.
Se considera necesaria la contrataci6n de una consultoria especializada para elaborar los
terminos de referencia del contrato mencionado. Como elementos basicos de esta consultoria
deben considerarse:
*  Una revision del marco legal de la RepCublica Dominicana particularmente en materia
de concesion y ejecucion de proyectos de ingenierfa ambiental.
*  La definicion clara de las condiciones para la operacion del sistema, durante el
periodo de duracion del contrato, y el cumplimiento estricto de los estandares de
calidad ambiental de este tipo de proyectos, particularmente aquellos senalados en
el Cuadro 14. En particular debera garantizarse la prestacion del servicio a todos los
habitantes con calidad y a un costo razonable, tomando en cuenta los distintos
niveles de ingreso de la poblacion.
8.2. Estructuraci6n del Consejo Tecnico
Para la creacion y puesta en funcionamiento del Consejo Tecnico sugerido en el acapite 7.5 sera
necesario que este personal tecnico este adecuadamente establecido y capacitado al momento
del otorgamiento de la concesion. Ademas, sera necesario establecer la Ifnea base ambiental
incluyendo la caracterizacion ecologica detallada de la zona, con la que se compararan los
resultados de los muestreos de calidad ambiental posteriores.
Este Consejo sera el responsable, al menos al inicio del proyecto, de vigilar el adecuado
funcionamiento del mismo, incluyendo la implementacion de las medidas de mitigaci6n
recomendadas. De manera especifica debera: (1) monitorear la calidad del agua, (2) vigilar el
funcionamiento de ia planta de tratamiento, sistema de alcantarillado y bombas, (3) garantizar
que se da un adecuado mantenimiento a todos los elementos del sistema, (4) vigilar que los
empleados y obreros que operan el sistemas trabajen en un ambiente seguro, y (5) garantizar la
calidad del servicio, sirviendo de enlace entre los usuarios y el operador.
Se contempla el establecimiento de un laboratorio regional para el monitoreo de la calidad del
agua. Este laboratorio seria inicialmente administrado por el Consejo Tecnico, pero podria pasar
posteriormente a ia autoridad competente una vez se hayan definido por completo las normativas
y reglamentaciones ambientales correspondientes.
Para realizar estas funciones se ha estimado una suma de U.S. $140,000.00, por la duracion del
proyecto, mas U.S. $55,000.00 para fines de capacitacion y equipamiento.

Re:  Sosua Marine Wastewater Disposal Options
Oceanographic data have now been collected along two possible Sosua ouffall
alignments. Bathymetric data at the alignment originally proposed, in Sosua Bay,
showed the bottom topography to be much steeper than initially thought. The
depth at 800 meters from shore is in excess of 190 meters and the depth of the
proposed diffuser, 40 meters, was reached only 235 meters from shore.
Discharge this close to shore would probably result in transport of the wastefield
to the local beaches. As a result, only preliminary Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP) data were obtained at this site, and attention was moved to an
alternate alignment, about 2 km to the West. This alignment runs from Point
Sosua near the LA Airport. Twenty-five days of current meter data were obtained
from an ADCP moored at 49 meters depth 978 meters offshore along this
alignment. Modeling of the fate and transport of effluent were then done using
this oceanographic data. The results are given in Roberts (1999).
The cost of the onshore portion of the wastewater conveyance scheme to Point
Sosua was subsequently found quite high, however, and so the original
alignment was reconsidered.
Density profiles were obtained along the original alignment at four stations (see
Figure 3 of Roberts, 1999). The deepest station, labeled 2.00, is 785 meters
offshore in 190 meters water depth. Six STD (Salinity, Temperature, and Depth)
profiles were obtained at this station over a period of about ten hours on January
13, 1999. The density profiles computed from these measurements are shown in
Figure 1.
It can be seen that a sharp density change occurs at depths that vary between
about 80 to 120 meters. This is caused by the deeper water being both colder
and more saline than the surface waters. The density difference across this
sudden change is as much as 1 a-unit (1 kg/rM3). The location of the density
jump moves slowly up and down, possibly due to internal waves. Such a strong
density change would trap sewage discharged beneath it, and vertical mixing
across the jump would be very small.
To test the behavior of sewage discharged below this density jump, preliminary
simulations were made with the mathematical model NRFIELD. The diffuser was
assumed to be 70 meters long and the average flowrate equal to 0.43 m3/s.

These are the same as assumed in Roberts (1999). Because we have no data
on currents at these depths, current speeds were taken to be zero. Actual
currents would increase dilutions over those simulated here. The results for a
discharge at 140 meters depth are shown in Table 1.

1628          347            84
It can be seen that all profiles result in high dilution and deep plume
submergence. For these assumptions, the minimum depth of discharge to
achieve an initial dilution of 100:1 is about 138 meters. Because of the strong
stratification, the plume will not mix upwards to the surface nor will it impact the
local beaches. In the unlikely event that the stratification is too weak to maintain
plume submergence, the dilution at the surface will be very high, in excess of
1000:1.
Recommendations
Discharge of wastewater along the originally proposed alignment would appear
to be an excellent environmental option. Discharge into water about 140 meters
deep would result in high dilution and deep plume submergence. No impact on
the local beaches or surface waters would be anticipated. A depth of 140 meters
occurs about 570 meters offshore.
This site should therefore be considered further. Additional oceanographic data
should be collected to confirm these preliminary findings. This would include
further STD profiling and ADCP measurements at about 600 meters offshore
along the original alignment.
