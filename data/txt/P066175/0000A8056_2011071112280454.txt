                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project restructuring and additional financing is expected to deepen and consolidate reforms initiated under the SIAF project geared to increase public
                         sector efficiency and transparency at the central and municipal levels in the areas of public finance planning, management, and control by strengthening the
                         processes and systems and supporting the institutionalization of these processes and systems through the transfer of ownership to the relevant institutions.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR summarizes the main issues and findings from the project's closing mission held on June 20 and 21, 2011, and reports on the indicators' final values at the closing of the
                         project. The ISR also presents some updates on the project's indicators following a restructuring agreed with the government during the previous Bank supervision mission in
                         November 2010.

                         Overall implementation is moderately satisfactory. Most of the project's indicators were achieved or partially achieved.
