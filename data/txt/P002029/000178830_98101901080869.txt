NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
WESTERN STATE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Federal Military Government (FMG) has requested Bank assistance
to finance an oil palm project in Western St:ate. This report appraises a
nucleus estate/smallholder oil palm project for which a US$17 million loan
is proposed. Nigeria's agriculture is primarily domestic market oriented.
Output: of staple foods, animal products, palm oil, cotton fibre aind a sub-
stantial part of groundnut production - together accounting for about 90%
of agricultural production - is entirely consumed in the country. In 1973-74
agrictulture contributed about 41% of value-added and provided employment for
around 70% of the labor force. However, agriculture is growing more slowly
than overall GDP, and its contribution to GDP is falling and is now 41% com-
pared with 65% in 1960.
ii.       The long-term strategy of FMG is t:o transform agriculture from its
present low technology semi-subsistence character to a modern, market oriented
sector with greater regional specialization.  This will necessitate providing
incentives to encourage farmers to expand olltput and raise productivity and
ensuring that the necessary technology, inputs and infrastructure are available.
The domestic market currently absorbs all of Nigeria's palm oil production now
estimated to be static at around 550,000 tons per annum. Demand projections
indicate that domestic consumption could reach 825,000 tons of palm oil by
1985, and additional production of nearly 275,000 tons per annum would be
required by then if Nigeria is to avoid becoming a major importer. About
125,000 ha of new plantings of high yielding oil palms would be needed to meet
the projected shortfall. The project described in this report aims at contri-
buting to the above objectives by (a) applying improved technology through
the use of high yielding material, husbandry practise and modern processing
facilities, (b) increasing rural employment and thus redistribut.Lng income
and (c) expanding production to meet the increased demand for palm oil.
iii.      The project would be carried out over 9 years (1975-1983) and would
involve planting about 6,000 ha of nucleus estates and 4,000 ha of smallhold-
ings. The smallholder program would be implemented by the proposed Smallholder
Management Unit (SMU); grant/credit in cash and kind to meet establishment and
maintenance costs would be channelled to smallholders through the SMU working
in conjunction with the registered cooperatives and, if applicabLe, the Western
State Farmers' Union (WSFU); 148 km of earth roads in the smallholder areas
would be improved to all-weather truckable standards; Nigerian sitaff and the



- ii -
smallholders would receive technical and management training at selected
institutions. The proposed Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC) would plant the
6,000 ha of nucleus estates; construct one central mill; expand another
central mill; and establish a fruit collection system capable of handling
the total production from estates and smallholders.
iv.       Project costs over the nine-year development period (1975-1983) are
estimated at N 22.4 million (US$34.0 million).  The Bank loan of US$17 million
would finance 50% of total project costs; it would be equivalent to all foreign
exchange costs (US$11.9 million) and 23% (US$5.1 million) of local costs. The
remainder of the project costs would be financed by the State Government
(US$16.4 million or 49%), and by the smallholders (U[S$0.6 million or 1%).
v.        Vehicles, fertilizers, insecticides:, polybags, tools, and wire net-
ting valued at about US$2.8 million would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines for contracts
over US$25,000. The oil mills-civil works and equipment--valued at about
US$5.3 million would be procured through a single responsibility contract
through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines, Contracts for buildings,
office equipment, and road construction valued at about US$1.7 million are
not suitable for international competitive bidding because of their size and
location.  Contracts for buildings and road construction would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank,  Contracts under US$25,000
and for office equipment would be procured after inviting quotations from at
least three suppliers.  A major part of project costs would be for smallholder
labor, salaries, training and the operating expenses of SMU, valued at about
US$3.0 million and estate labor, land acquisition, salaries, operating
expenses and NIJAL's management fee valued at about US$7.2 million, none
of which would be suitable for any form of competitive bidding.  The
services of expatriate staff and consultants would be obtained on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Domestically manufactured goods
would be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable import duties, which-
ever is lower, when comparing bids with those of foreign manufacturers.
A 7.5% preference for domestic civil works contractors would apply.
vi.       At full maturity in 1988 the combined estate and smallholder project
would produce annually about 25,300 metric tons of palm oil for domestic con-
sumption and 5,750 metric tons of kernels for export. Valued at the Bank's
price forecast for palm oil in 1985 current terms (US$757 for palm oil and
US$504 for kernels), the annual net foreign exchange savings/earnings are
estimated at US$18 million.
vii.      Based on a fresh fruit bunch price of N 20 per ton, smallholder
net income from 2 ha of oil palm would start at N 70 (US$106) in the first
year of production, rising to N 298 (US$453) during the loan repayment period
and thereafter would average about N 370 (US$562) in maturity.  The returns
per manday employed would rise rapidly from N 1.3 (US$2.0) in the first year
of production to an average of N 4.5 (US$6.8) during the years of loan repay-



- iii -
ment and N l;.2 (US$9.4) thereafter. This compares favorably with a current
rural wage rate of N 0.7 per manday. In addition, smallholders income would
be augmented by bonuses from mill revenue surpluses.
viii.     During the establishment period thLe project would create 8,300 man-
years of employment. At full maturity the estates would employ about 700
laborers. Based on an average farm size of 2 ha about 2,000 farmers would
benefit. Thus, with an average family size of 6 - 7 persons, about 18,000
people would benefit.
ix.       The estimated economic rate of ret:urn is 18.9% for the smallholder
component and 18.7% for the estate component.
X.        On the basis of the assurances obtained during negotiations, the
project would be suitable for a US$17 million Bank loan, for a period of
20 years including a five-year grace period on principal.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Military Government of N:Lgeria (FMG) has requested a
Bank Loan to help finance the planting of high yielding oil palms in its
Western State. This report appraises a project that would establish 6,000 ha
of nucleus estates and 4,000 ha of smallholder plantings as Phase 1 of a
program establishing 19,000 ha of high yielding palms.
1.02      The first Bank Group loan for agricultural development in Nigeria
was the Western State Cocoa Project (764-UNI) in 1971 which was followed by
a loan for the Second Cocoa Project (Loan 1045-UNI) in 1974. The Bank is the
Executing Agency for the Nigerian Agricultural Bank Project financed by UNDP,
which became effective in March 1973. A rice project, three agricultural
development projects, and a livestock project have been approved by the Board
in December 1974, and an irrigation project and a rubber project have been
appraised and are being processed. The first cocoa project is proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.03      The project was identified in November 1972 and prepared by a Bank
mission in March 1973. This report is based on the findings of a Bank appraisal
mission, composed of Messrs. J. Bevan, M. Crowe, R. van der Lugt (Bank), and
A. Bergan, J. Bogaerts, Osman Farruk, C. Hartley and C. Redfern (Consultants),
which visited Nigeria in November/December 1973 to appraise three palm oil
projects in the Western, Mid-Western, and East: Central States. Details of
features common to all three projects are in a supplementary report, entitled
Supplementary Annexes to the Nigerian Oil Palm Projects Appraisal Reports
(474a-UNI).
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      General.  The 12-State Federal Republic of Nigeria covers about
930,000 kmT and provisional results of a recent census indicate a population
of 80 million, growing at about 2.6% annually. About 41% of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), estimated at N 6.5 billion (US$9.9 billion) in 1973/74, is
generated in the agricultural sector which employs some 70% of the labor force.
In 1972, total domestic exports amounted to US$2.1 billion of which petroleum
represented about 82% (US$ 1.8 billion). The main agricultural exports are
cocoa and groundnut products. In 1972 all agricultural exports were valued
at US$295 million or 13% of all exports. Currently, the value of food and
beverage imports is estimated at the relatively low figure of aboul: US$2.6
per capita annually. Dairy products, wheat, and sugar are the principal food
imports.
2.02      Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture, including livestock, forestry and
fishing, is the most important sector in terms of output and employment; pro-
vides all but a small proportion of the nation's supply of food; and is a
significant earner of foreign exchange. Nigeria's agriculture is primarily
domestic market oriented. Output of staple foods, animal products, palm oil,



- 2 -
cotton fibre, and a substantial part of groundnut production f-ogether account-
4ng for over 90% of agricultural production - is entirely consumed in the
country. However, agriculture is growing more slowly than overall GDP, and
its contribution to GDP is falling and now is 41% compared with about 46% in
1971 and about 65% in 1960. While agricultural production has been. hampered
by short-term factors, such as drought in parts of the north in 1972/73 and
1973/74, the poor performance of the sector reflects agricultural and rural
developmerLt programs that generally are inadequate in terms of physical extent
and quality0
2.03      Because of Nigeria's wide range of ecological conditions agricul-
tural activity, while varied, is highly specialized by region and function.
Thus the rain forest zone, covering Western, Mid-Western, East Central, South
Eastern ar.d River States, is characterized by relatively high rainfall and
cultivaticn of most of the tropical tree crops. Of the most important, cocoa
is dominant in Western State; oil palm, mostly wild, grows throughout but
with marked concentration in East Central and South Eastern States; and rubber
is most important in the Mid-Western State. Cassava, yams, and cocoyams are
the main food crops of the rain forest zone followed by maize and rice. The
middle belt of the country, which includes the Kwara and Benue Plateau States,
and the southern portions of the North Western, North Central, and North
Eastern State, constitutes an intermediate savannah zone (the Guinea Zone)
well-suited for arable agriculture. Sorghum and pulses are t.he principal
crops, but there are also sizeable acreages under root crops, groundnuts, and
cotton.  The dry savannah zone (the Sudan Zone) of the far ncrth, encompassing
Kano State and the northern parts of North Western, North Central, and North
Eastern States, produces most of Nigeria's sorghum, millet, cowpeas, cotton,
and groundnuts. This northern area, unlike most of the rest of the country
is tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis free and the main cattle raising area of
Nigeria.
2.04      The long-term strategy of FAG is to transform agriculture from its
present low technology semi-subsistence character to a modern, market oriented
sector with greater regional specialization. This will necessitate providing
incentives to encourage farmers to expand output and raise productivity and
ensuring that the necessary technology, inputs, and infrastructure are avail-
able to permit farmers to respond to such incentives. There are several con-
straints to implementing this strategy and these include: transport and dis-
tribution bottlenecks; inadequate machinery for planning, coordinating and
implementing a national policy for rural and agricultural development; insuffi-
cient experienced manpower particularly at senior management level; and short-
ages of improved seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, credit and other farm inputs.
The project described in this report would remove these constraints in so far
as the oil palm subsector in the Western State is concerned.
2.05      Oil Palm Production.  Oil palm grows throughout Southern Nigeria
but the center of palm oil production is the three eastern States. Approxi-
mately 90% of production is from semi-wild oil palm groves operated by small-
holders. These groves cover about 2.5 million ha and produce around 2.5 tons



- 3 -
of fresh fruit bunches (ffb) per ha which yield about 200 to 225 kg of palm
oil and around 135 kg of kernels. Total Niger:ian production is estimated-
at about 550,000 tons of oil and 300,000 tons of kernels. Exports of palm
oil, which were valued at N 22 million in 1966, are now being displaced by
domestic demand. Demand projections indicate that domestic consumption could
reach 825,000 tons by 1985 and thus require production of an additional
275,000 tons per annum by that time if Nigeria is to avoid importing palm oil.
About 125,000 ha of new plantings of high yielding oil palms would bie needed
to meet the projected shortfall. The three oil palm projects in Western,
Mid-Western, and East Central States that have been appraised by the Bank (see
para 1.03) would produce about 100,000 tons of palm oil when at full maturity
in 1990.
2.06      Institutions.  The main institutions involved in the project would
be the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, (MANR), the Western Oil
Palm Company (WOPC), the cooperatives, and possibly the Western State Farmers
Union (WSFU) (See Annex 1). Participation of WSFU under the projecl: - if
proposed by the State - would be under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, 1/ and assurances to this effect were obtained (see para 4.09).
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
3.01      The project areas are situated in the Okitipupa Division Ln the south-
east of the state.  The Iyansan nucleus estate and the eastern smalLholders
area (the eastern area) lie east of Okitipupa, and the other estates and small-
holders area to the south and west of Okitipupa (the western area), see Map
10966.
3.02      Climate.  Mean annual rainfall at Okitipupa is 2,385 mm (93.9 in).
There is a marked dry season from mid-November to early March and the mean
annual water deficit is estimated to be 320 mm. Annual sunshine is estimated
to be about 1,800 hours, and mean annual temperature lies between 26° and 27°C.
For West Africa conditions are relatively good for oil palms.
3.03      Vegetation.  Over 50% of the Iyansan area is estimated to be in forest
with 11% under food crops and the remainder in. bush fallows at various stages
of regrowth. In the western area population density is much higher and the
vegetation consists principally of wild palm groves with densities up to 150
palms per ha and food crops. Eupatorium odoratum 2/ is present in all recently
cleared areas.
3.04      Topography.  The greater proportion of the Iyansan area is flat to
gently undulating land between 61 and 76 m abcove sea level, although to the

east a.,rd south the area becomes dissected by streams flowing towards the
Siluko River.  The western area is dissected by streams which run south and
east      ds the Oluwa river; in its northern and western sections the land

. , A   Soils. Typically soils are of great depth, free-draining, with
% r ci: ent increasing with profile depth.  They are classed into soil series
S.c:co-: .tng to their clay content, and the best series for oil palm cultivation
are ;el 1 represented in both areas.
3.06      Population. The main source of employment is farming, which involves
an estimated 70% of the total population of the Division which in 1973 was esti-
mated at 350,0000 1/ The population of the project areas themselves is estimated
at 280,000 and wit:h an average rural household size of about 6 to 7 persons,
they inclide some 30,000 farming households. There should be no serious prob-
lem in obtaining sufficient labor for both estate and smallholder development
in the western project area.  In the eastern area there are very few people
living in or around the proposed lyansan estate site but the estate should be
able to attract labor from other areas to the south and east, and the rate of
smallholder development proposed for Phase I (1,000 ha) is consistent with
apparent present labor availability along the Ibgotu-Akotogbo road which would
be the axis for smallholder development.
3.07      Land Tenure.  Generally land is vested in the various communities
with any transactions controlled by the head of the community in consultation
with the chiefs and elders. Land may be given (though unrecorded) by the
community to an individual as his personal and disposable property. Alterna-
tively, land may be given by the community to a family 2/ under the provision
that the head of the family may transfer it outside the family only with the
consent and sanction of the community elders. Although title to land is gen-
erally unrecorded, family and individual rights are usually well known and
accepted within the community. In general the traditional system provides
adequate security of tenure for the planting of permanent crops by natives of
a community, though not necessarily for outsiders. There is increasing tendency
towards individual ownership in some areas and in these tenancy on land belong-
ing to absentees is common; for the project, however, the aim would be through
the selection process (para. 6.04) to restrict participation to smallholders
who are directly engaged in farming and assurances to this effect were obtained.
3.08      The Public Lands Requisition law provides for the acquisition by
Government of any land for the public use. Such acquisition may be by volun-
tary transfer or by compulsory acquisition with payment of reasonable compensa-
tion. In general compulsory acquisition is effected through gazetting and
requires little time. The State usually gives land to other government
1/   Projection based on November 1963 census figure of 276,000 and applying
an annual growth rate of 2.6%.
2/   "Family" usually means the extended family and may include several
generations.

entities under lease agreements. It would be a condition of effectiveness
that the Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC) had taken possession under a 99-year
lease of all lands acquired by the State for conveyance to WOPC to enable it
to develop the project estates. Smallholders would plant their oil palms on
land now owned by them or for which they have rights of usufruct.
3.09      Farming Systems in the Project Area.  The size of smallholder farms
in the area varies considerably, but according to recent Government surveys
the average area cultivated in food crops (mainly maize, yams, and cassava) per
farming household is about 1 hectare. Farming is based on a bush-fallow rota-
tion of about 7 to 10 years. Only a few farmers own livestock (mainly goats),
but most grow some tree crops and exploit wild oil palm groves. Seasonal
credit is scarce and costly, modern inputs are rarely used, and yields are
low. Apart from food crop surpluses sold at local markets, the main cash
crop is wild oil palm and family incomes including the value of household
consumption are between N 200 - N300 per year.
3.10      Communications.  A good hardtop road links Ibadan and Lagos with
Okitipupa. Tlowever, while the western project area is served by a dense net-
work of secondary roads radiating from Okitipupa the eastern area is cut off
from Okitipupa by the river Oluwa which can, at present, only be crossed at
a point 20 kilometers north of Okitipupa. The River Otu is an even more
formidable obstacle and supplies for the already established Omi-Orisa estate
have to be carried by barge from Okitipupa (see Map 10966).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project area is well suited to oil palm, labor is not a con-
straint and an oil palm project comprising nucleus estates and smal:Lholder
outgrowers is feasible. Linking a nucleus estate with smallholder develop-
ment offers -advantages in the spheres of employment, extension, and processing.
The employment opportunities on the nucleus estates would provide a regular
source of income for members of the surrounding smallholder community. The
technical experience gained by members of the smallholder community working
in the estates--under well supervised conditions -- should, through the process
of diffusion, serve as a valuable extension factor in the smallholder planting
sector of the project. To attain the high level of efficiency possible in a
large central mill, a continuous and adequate supply of ffb is needed. With
regular supplies from a nucleus estate, the risk of large variations in mill
throughput due to fluctuations in output from smallholdings is considerably
reduced.



4.02      The project, involving planting some 10,000 ha of oil palm, would
be carried out over nine years (1975 through 1983) and be Phase I of a program
scheduled to plant about 19,000 ha of oil palm during the petiod 1975 through
1986. The Nigerian Joint Agency Ltd. (NIJAL) under a managenment contract with
the Western State Government has already established 5,100 of estates since
1969. (See paras 6.09 and 6.10, and Annex 2).
4.03      The project would comprise:
Smallholders:
(a)  creating a Smallholder Management Unit (SMU) within the
Western State Ministry of Agriculture (MANR) to implement
the Smallholder program;
(b) planting about 4,000 ha of oil palm on smallholdings;
(c)  improving about 148 km of earth roads to facilitate
all weather collection of ffb from smallholders;
(d) operating a grant/credit scheme for smallholders;
(e) training staff and smallholders at selected institutions
and through in-service courses;
Estates:
(f)  planting about 6,000 ha of nucleus estates to be operated
by the Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC);
(g) the construction and operation of two palm oil mill.s by
WOPC to process estate and smallholder production;
(h) establishing a fruit collection system to be operated by
WOPC for estate and smallholder production.
B. Detailed Features
4.04      Details of the phasing of the project planting program are at
Annex 2.
Smallholders
4.05      Smallholder Management Unit (SMU).  SMU would have its headquarters
in Okitipupa and be responsible for appraising smallholder applications for
credits and grants, and for supervising the technical and financial services
involved in the field establishment and post maturity stages. Details of
SMU's structure are given in paras 6.02-6.06 and in Annex 3.



4.06      Smallholder Planting.  Some 3,000 ha would be planted in the western
project area within a 30-km radius of Okitipupa, and 1,000 ha east of the Oluwa
River. To facilitate ffb, collection, plantings would be restricted t:o areas
within 600 meters of a road usable by 7-ton trucks all year round. Details
of planting and maintenance procedures are in the Supplementary Annexes
(Supplement 1).
4.07      Road Improvement.  No major realignment of roads is anticipated but
paved and earth roads need upgrading. The fruit collection road network (shown
on map 10966) is 239 km of which 67 km is paved roads. The paved roads would
be upgraded (filling potholes, clearing ditches, reshaping shoulders, and some
resurfacing) by the Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT). This work is esti-
mated to cost N 100,000 (US$152,000); this amount is not included in the
project costs, as it would form part of MWT's routine expenditure in 1975 and
1976. The cost of improving 148 km of earth rcads 1/ is included under the
project and would be carried out by contractors under the supervision of a
road engineer in SMU.  Also included under the project is the rebuilding of
500 m of a 2-lane paved street in Okitipupa to provide access to the oil mill.
MWT would become responsible for the maintenance of all fruit collection roads
once they have been upgraded. Annual maintenarLce costs are estimated at
N 60,000 (US$91,000).  Details are in Annex 4.  Assurances were obtained that
in the project area MWT would improve the paved roads, and would take over and
properly maintain all fruit collection roads ornce they have been upgraded.
4.08      Grant and Credit Scheme.  Producer prices for palm oil destined for
the export market have been maintained well below world prices since the
Second World War, and Marketing Board surpluses generated in this way have
been used in other sectors of the economy (para 7.04).  Consequently, until
the very recent disappearance of palm oil surplus to domestic needs there
has been very little incentive for farmers to plant even high yielding improved
oil palms, and the industry has stagnated. In the early 1960s an oil palm re-
habilitation scheme was introduced in the Eastern Region (now East-Central,
Rivers, and South-Eastern States) under which the problem of incentives was
overcome by providing smallholders with grants consisting of cash payments,
planting material and other farm inputs for new planting/replanting oil palm.
Under the project somewhat different arrangements would be used to reflect
currently much higher palm oil prices and grants in kind and credits in cash
would be provided to farmers.  Combined with fair producer prices (see paras
4.16, 7.07 and 7.09) this should provide adequate incentives for farmers to
plant palms that take nearly four years to come into bearing and produce
revenue.
4.09      The project would provide grants and credits to smallholders plant-
ing, or ceplanting, a minimum of 1 ha and a maximum of 10 ha. One hectare
1/   The remaining 24 km of earth roads are around Omi Orisa estate, and would
be upgraded by the estate as part of the ongoing estate development plan.



- 8 -
is the smallest unit that is considered practical to administ:er under the proj-
ect, while at maturity more than 10 ha would require the average extended farm
family to hire labor for its oil palm and food crop cultivation. Participating
smallholders would be required to be members of a registered cooperative society
or the Western State Farmers Union (WSFU). The WSFU was first established in
1969, has limited assets and personnel and consequently might never play a
significant role in the project. However, if properly organized, staffed and
funded in a form satisfactory to the Bank WFSU could play an active role. None-
theless, the FMG with the assistance of FAO is instituting a major program for
the development of farmers cooperatives. In view of this, even should WSFU
not materialize as a viable component of the project, there should be no prob-
lem in finding sufficient numbers of farmers who are members of registered
cooperatives.  Project farmers would be required to sign agreements with SMU
and their cooperative or WSFU (if applicable) relating to the amount and
use of grant/credit. Assurances were obtained that these arrangements would
be employed and that the terms of the agreements would be acceptable to the
Bank.
4.10      The total costs of clearing, planting and maintaining oil palms until
they enter into production four years later are estimated in constant 1974
terms at about N 330/ha. SMU would distribute: (a) as a grant, and in kind,
palm seedlings, cover crop seed, wire netting, fertilizer and chemicals to a
value of about N 170/ha; and (b) as credit, in cash, N 100/ha. for payment of
labor (see Supplementary Annexes, Supplement 10). The credit would bear interest
at 9.5% and have a term of 13 years from planting including 7 years grace during
which interest would be capitalized. The smallholder would contribute the ba-
lance of about N 60/ha in the form of labor and hand tools. Monthly repayments
would be calculated on a per ha basis and deducted from the proceeds of each
smallholder's ffb sales. In constant 1974 terms monthly repayments by the small-
holder would amount to N 3.00 per ha (interest at 9.5%) and the cooperative or
WSFU would repay to SMU N 2.50 monthly (interest at 7.5%). The loan agreement
between SMU, the cooperative or WSFU, and the smallholder would include an
undertaking by the smallholder to sell his ffb to the central processing mill.
See paras 4.17, 5.06, and 6.06.
4.11      Training.  Technical training would be provided for Senior Officers,
Nursery Staff, Field Staff and smallholders. A training schedule and cost
estimates are given in Annex 5, Table 7. Where training facilities are not
available staff would be trained elsewhere in West Africa and for some more
senior officers possibly in the Far East. Funding for the latter possibility
is included in project costs.
4.12      Senior Officers (Agricultural Officer (AO) or above) would be given
6-months training in planting techniques and management on large-scale oil
palm development schemes or commercial estates using appropriate husbandry
standards. Agricultural Assistants (AA) designated to supervise nurseries
would receive special training for twelve months in nursery techniques so as
to cover a complete schedule of nursery operations from the germinated seed
stage to field planting. Field staff (Agricultural Assistants) would be given



- 9 -
a 2-3 months intensive course in modern planting techniques at the Nigerian
Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) followed by 2-3 months practical train-
ing in the supervision of field operations on existing estates. In addition,
all field staff would be trained in smallholder appraisal and grant/credit
supervision procedures. Smallholder training would be developed on a group
activity basis and would include (a) outlining application/appraisal procedures
and conditions of loan agreements, (b) demonstration of specific planting prac-
tices, and (c) short course of 1- to 2-day duration.
Estates
4.13      The estate component of the project wqould be carried out by the pro-
posed Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC). The organization and management of
WOPC is described briefly in paras 6.07 through 6.11 and in more detail in
Annex 3.
4.14      Planting Program.  WOPC would expand Igbotako estate by 800 ha,
develop a new estate west of the river Oluwa by planting 1,200 ha and at
Iyansan by planting 4,000 ha (See Map 10966).  Arrangements for the acquisition
of land for the estates are described in para .3.08. Details of the planting
program are set out in Annex 2. The project provides for infrastructure and
housing needed at the estates. Labor is not a constraint and new land would
be cleared by hand, using chain saws. Eupatorium weed would be eradicated
after clearing and before establishing the covier crop. NIFOR would provide
oil palm seeds which would be of wilt-tolerant varieties, if required. WOPC
would establish a nursery on each estate, and fertilizers would be applied at
rates recommended by NIFOR following foliar analysis. Details of p]Lanting and
maintenance procedures are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 1).
4.15      Palm Oil Processing Mills.  A palm oil mill was completed at Okiti-
pupa mid-1974. Owned by MANR, the mill has an initial capacity of 20 tons/
hour and is designed for expansion to 60 tons/hour. At full maturity in 1988,
project production of ffb would be some 115,000 tons; and production from the
estates already established by Government would be some 59,600 tons. In total
96,000 tons-would be produced west of the river Oluwa, and 78,600 east of the
river. The build-up in required mill capacity for the existing and project
plantings would thus be:
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984 onwards
--------------…tons ffb/hour-----------
Western area (existing mill)          20     20      20     20      30
Eastern area (new mill)               10      10     10     10      20
Under the project the Okitipupa mill would be expanded to 30 tons/hour capacity
and a new mill would be built at a site to be selected between Omi-Orisa and
Iyansan estates. WOPC would undertake to engage consultants acceptable to



- 10 -
the State and the Bank to prepare the design and tender specifications for the
new palm oil mill. Assurances to this effect were obtained. The undertaking
would also be incorporated in the subsidiary loan agreements between the State
and WOPC.
4.16      Confirmation by SMU and the Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (see para 4.19) that WOPC mill development proposals were
in line with the project's overall production program would be a condition of
disbursement for investments in the mill and fruit collection system (para
4.18). In addition assurances were obtained that WOPC would adopt a pricing
formula for the purchase of ffb from smallholders determined, in accordance
with principles acceptable to the Bank, by a Price Policy Committee, which
would be established not later than 1980, and which would comprise represen-
tatives of the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture, the Registrar of
Cooperative Societies, WOPC, SMU, Marketing Board, NPMC, AIC and the Small-
holders. See Annex 3.
4.17      SMU would be responsible for ensuring that an acceptable percentage
(to be agreed with WOPC) of the estimated production of smallholders ffb was
delivered to the mills. Any financial losses incurred by the mills of WOPC
as a result of deliveries falling below this figure would be made good to WOPC
by the State Government. Assurances to this effect were obtained.
4.18      Fruit Collection System.  At full maturity in 1988 annual smallholders
production would be about 40,000 tons, about one fourth from east of the river
Oluwa, and the remainder from west of the river. During the peak month about
200 tons oE ffb would have to be collected each day. West of the river Oluwa
the participating smallholders would be within about 30 km of the Okitipupa
mill, and east of the river about 16 km from the eastern area mill. The maxi-
mum distance that smallholders would have to carry bunches to a roadside pick
up point would be about 600 meters. The bunches would be heaped in nets on the
road side to await collection, and the smallholders would be informed well in
advance of the timetable for the delivery of nets and the subsequent fruit
collection. The bunches would be loaded on to trucks by rear mounted cranes
fitted with scales that would register the weight of the smallholder's fruit
at the pick-up point. The smallholder would be given a receipt showing the
weight of the bunches collected, the grade and the price. At full maturity
about 75,000 metric tons of ffb would be produced at the project nucleus estates.
During the peak month about 375 tons would have to be collect(ed each day from
these estates. The fruit collection system on the estates would essentially
be the same as that used for smallholders, using nets and cranes with built-
in scale to weigh the fruit bunches of individual harvesting teams. For de-
tails see Annex 4.
Evaluation and Research
4.19      Evaluation and Research is an important feature of all three oil
palm projects (para 1.03). The Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit of the Federal Department of Agriculture would be responsible



- 11 -
for monitoring and evaluating the project. All evaluation and research has,
however, been costed as part of the Mid-Western State Nucleus Estate/
Smallholder Oil Palm Project, processed concurrently with this project, and
details can be found in appraisal report, No. 497a-UNI.

Physical contingencies comprise 12% of the cost of civil works for the oil mills
and 5% of other costs. Price contingencies calculated over base costs and
physical contingencies allow for: compounded increase in the costs of (a)
civil works, buildings, and houses, of 18% in 1974, 15% in 1975, and 12%

annually.
Financing Arrangements
5.03      The financing plan has been discussed and agreed with the Federal
and State Governments and takes account of FMG's decision that each State
will be responsible for the balance of project costs. The financing plan

costs and be equivalent to all foreign exchange costs (US$11.9 million) and
23% (US$5.1 million) of local costs. The loan would be for a period of 20
years, including a five-year grace period on repayment of principal and
would be onlent to the State Government on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank. The remaining project costs would be financed by the State
Government (US$16.4 million) and smallholders (US$0.6 million).
5.05      The State would onlend part of the Bank loan and make its own
contribution totaling US$27.0 million, to WOPC at a rate not less than the
Bank's lending rate, 1/for a period of 20 years including a nine year grace
period for repayment of principal. The State Government would use the re-
mainder of Bank loan and its own contribution totaling US$6.4 million to
finance SMU (US$3.6 million), and grants (US$1.8 million) and credits (US$1.0
million). Credits made to smallholders would be channeled through the coopera-
tives and WSFU branches (if applicable), which in consideration for their
guaranteeing smallholders' loans would receive a 2% interest spread (see
para 4.10). From its own funds the State Government would make an equity
contribution to WOPC (not part of project costs) estimated at (see Annex 10,
Table 1) N 250,000 (US$400,000), to cover working capital in the development
period.
5.06      During negotiations assurances were obtained that the terms and
conditions of the subsidiary loan agreements between FMG and the State Govern-
ment as well as the terms and conditions of the loan agreement between the
State and WOPC would be acceptable to the Bank. Signing of these two
subsidiary loan agreements would be a condition of effectiveness. Subscrip-
tion to WOPC's equity by the State Government during the development period
would be in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank and the State,
and assurances to this effect would be obtained during negotiations. Assur-
ances were also obtained that the terms and conditions of the loan agreement
between SMU, cooperatives or WFSU (if applicable), and smallholders would be
acceptable to the Bank. It was agreed that from the date of the ending of
loan negotiations retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 would be made
mainly for employment of key personnel and for nurseries.
Procurement
5.07      Vehicles, fertilizers, insecticides, polybags, tools, and wire net-
ting valued at about US$2.8 million would be procured through international
competitivie bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines for contracts
over US$25,000. The oil mills-civil works and equipment--valued at about
US$5.3 million would be procured through a single responsibility contract
through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for buildings,
office equipment, and road construction valued at about US$1.7 million are
not suitable for international competitive bidding because of their size and
location. Contracts for buildings and road construction would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
1/   For calculating purposes an onlending rate to WOPC of 9% was assumed.



- 15 -
local procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts under US$25,000
and for office equipment would be procured after inviting quotations from at
least three suppliers. A major part of project costs would be for smallholder,
labor, salaries, training and the operating expenses of SMU, valued at about
US$3.0 million and estate labor, land acquisition, salaries, operating expenses
and NIJAL's management fee valued at about US$7.2 million, none of which would
be suitable for any form of competitive bidding. The services of expatriate
staff and consultants would be obtained on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference
or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower, when comparing bids with
those of foreign manufacturers. A 7.5% preference for domestic civil works
contractors would apply.
Disbursement
5.08      The Bank loan would be disbursed over nine years from 1975 through
1983 (see also Annex 6) to cover:
(i) 75% of grants and credits to smallholders, totalling N 0.8
million (US$1.2 million);
(ii) 40% of SMU's costs totalling N 0.6 million (US$1.0 million);
(iii)  50% of the costs of WOPC's estate development totalling N 3.3
million (US$5.0 million).
(iv) 50% of WOPC's investment in the palm oil mills and fruit
collection, totalling N 1.8 million (US$2.7 million).
An unallocated amount of N 4.7 million (US$7.1 million) would cover contin-
gencies on the above items. Any surplus loan funds after completion of the
project would be cancelled.
5.09      Disbursements of the Bank loan would be against import documen-
tation, contracts, and certified records of expenditure. For disbursements
made against certified records of expenditure, documentation would not be
submitted for review but would be retained by SMU and WOPC for scrutiny by
Bank supervision missions.
5.10      In order to achieve a prompt and efficient flow of funds the follow-
ing procedures would be used:  SMU would prepare reimbursement claims under
the signature of its Manager and Controller of Finance. These docutments would
be countersigned by the State Ministry of Finance who would submit t:hem to the
Federal Ministry of Finance for onward transmission to the Bank. WOPC would
prepare reimbursement claims under the signatures of its manager and chief
accountant.
Accounts and Audits
5.11      SMU would prepare annual budgets usinlg cost estimates in t:his
report as a base amended where necessary to reflect changes in costs and
project development policies.  Such budgets would be submitted to the Steering



- 16 -
Committee for approval.  SMU would thereafter establish, on a. monthly basis,
cash flow statements indicating costs, revenues and additional capital require-
ments. Such monthly statements would be submitted to the Steering Committee
for monitoring but project management would be authorized to operate on such
monthly budgets unless officially informed to the contrary by the Chairman of
the Steering Committee.
5.12      On the basis of the approved SMU budget, the State Government would
make annual budget allocations to cover its own contribution to project costs
as well as any additional funds required to bridge the gap between expendi-
ture and disbursement of the Bank loan. Assurances were obtained from the
State Government that a project bank account would be opened with a bank of
their choice, and that SMU would have full access to funds within the
limitations of the approved annual budget. It would be a condition of loan
effectiveness that such account had been established and funded.
5.13      WOPC and SMU would:  (i) keep records adequate to reflect, in accord-
ance with consistently maintained sound accounting practices, their operations
and financial position; (ii) have their accounts audited by a firm of auditors
acceptable to the Bank; (iii) submit copies of their audited accounts and the
auditors' report thereon to the Bank within four months of the end of each
financial year; (iv) cause the reports of the auditors to be of such scope
and detail as the Bank may reasonably have requested; and (v) furnish such
other information concerning their accounts as the Bank may reasonably have
required.
VI.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      Project implementation would involve:  the Smallholder Management
Unit (SMU), and the Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC).
Smallholder Management Unit
6.02      General.  SMW would be responsible for the smallholder program.
The unit would have a high degree of financial and administrative autonomy
and be a component of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
(MANR). It would be a condition of effectiveness that SMU had been establi-
shed and its senior management positions filled.  A steering committee, chaired
by the Pernanent Secretary of MANR, and comprised of representatives of
relevant Government agencies would be responsible for determining SMU policy
and approving development/operational programs and budgets. Details of the
SMU's structure and operational procedures are given in Annex 3. A consulting
firm acceptable to Government and the Bank would be engaged to set up a system
of mechanized accounts that would meet the needs of the smallholder project
and assurances to this effect were obtained.



- 17 -
6.03     M4anagement Structure and Staffing.  Ihe structure of SMU is outlined
in the Chart attached to Annex 3. The SMU would be headquartered at Okitipupa
and be staffed primarily with personnel now employed by MANR or recruited
especially for the purpose in Nigeria. However, the technical and financial
complexity of the project will demand well qualified and experienced staff
(see Annex 3, para 7), and if suitably qualified Nigerians were not available
to fill the SMU senior management posts, staff for these posts would be
recruited internationally. Assurances were obtained that SMU would be esta-
blished in a form satisfactory to the Bank and that it would be adequately
staffed at all times; that SMU's Steering Committee would have been established
not later than 90 days after loan effectiveness; and that senior management
positions of SMU would be filled by qualified persons acceptable to the Bank
and upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
6.04      Operational Procedures.  Notices calling for applications from
smallholders and giving details of the scheme would be publicized through
such media as local newspapers, radio and public administration offices.
To facilitate the efficient employment of field staff, particularly in the
year of planting when the heaviest intensity of farm visits is required, a
system of zonal development would be used. Thus in any given year applications
for participation would be restricted to specific zones within the project
area. Any shortfall in applications from a primary zone could be catered for
by having an adjacent reserve zone from which applications could be requested
but only accepted in the event of there being a. shortfall in the primary zone.
Applications would be called at the beginning cf January of the year preceding
the year of planting and the closing date would be the end of March in the
same year. On receipt of the application, the smallholdings would be inspected
by SMU staff to obtain details of vegetation, topography, soil type, size of
holding, the composition of the family labor force available, and, in consul-
tation with the cooperatives or WSFU (if applicable), the credit status of
the farmer. Applications would be approved by a Planting Authorization
Committee (PAC) composed of the SMU Manager as chairman, the Controller of
Field Operation, the Controller of Finance and a representative of the
cooperative societies.
6.05      SMU staff would provide technical supervision and advice and ensure
in particular that: (i) if Eupatorium infestation covered more than 30% of
the area, the weeds were cleared before an application was approved, (ii) all
old palm trees were felled before new planting/replanting, and (iii) in order
to prevent encroachment into the root systems area of palms, no intercropping
would be permitted in the new plantings/replantings of palms. Assurances
were obtained that maintenance of suitable husbandry standards including
those specified above would be a condition of smallholder participation in
the project.
6.06      Purchase of Smallholder ffb.  Every two weeks the mill would provide
SMU with a schedule of ffb purchased, and amounts due to smallholders, and



- 18 -
credit the SMU account with the appropriate funds. SMU, after deducting loan
repayments due to the State Government, would pay the balance due to each
cooperative or WSFU branch (if applicable) in respect of its members. The
cooperatives or WSFU branch (if applicable) after deducting the interest
spread would distribute the balance to its members (see para 4.10). The
cooperatives or WSFU (if applicable) would guarantee the repaLyment of the
loan by their members.
The Western Oil Palm Company Ltd.
6.07      A new limited liability company, the Western Oil Palm Company Ltd.
(WOPC), wculd be formed to be responsible for the estates, oil mill, and
fruit collection components of the project and also for completing the imple-
mentation of an ongoing oil palm project in the Okitipupa Division. Two
other companies would be directly involved: the Western State Agricultural
Investment Corporation (AIC) of which WOPC would be a subsidiary and a manage-
ment agency, the Nigerian Joint Agency Ltd. (NIJAL).
6.08      AIC was established by an edict on October 1, 1973 to further "pro-
jects for improved production and development of all forms of agricultural
operations in the State." The edict provides for the transfe!r to AIC of all
agricultural undertakings of the Western Nigeria Development Corporation and
Western State Agricultural and Industrial Investment Corporation. AIC expects
to have a high degree of autonomy with regard to; for example, dropping un-
profitable projects, fixing salary levels to attract suitable staff, and
encouraging private participation in its projects. The principles on which
AIC is organized are sound; it is, however, too early to make any assessment
of its performance.
6.09      NIJAL is a Nigerian company, formed by Nigerian, British and
Malaysian interests, which manages a number of oil palm and rubber estates
on behalf of State Governments.  It has experienced Nigerian and expatriate
staff and gives emphasis to the training of young Nigerian graduates. It
also provides good technical links with the latest oil palm and other agri-
cultural developments in Malaysia.
6.10      In 1968 the Western State began a project to develop three estates
with a total area of 6,075 ha in the Okitipupa district over the period
1969-72. So far, 5,100 ha have been planted and a processing mill has been
completed end-1974. Failure to pay compensation promptly has delayed land
acquisition.  In general, however, the management of the estates, provided by
NIJAL under a 20-year contract, has been satisfactory. The project has been
directed by a holding committee, with no fiscal or legal form, appointed by
the Executive Council of the Military Governor and has been funded from the
Western State budget.  The assets and liabilities of this project, together
with its staff, will be taken over by WOPC.
6.11      The Board of Directors of WOPC, would be appointed by the office
of the Military Governor, and would include representatives of AIC and of



- 19 -
the Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Finance, and Economid
Planning. Senior management would comprise: (a) General Manager; (b) Estate
Managers; (c) Oil Mill Engineers; (d) Chief Accountant; and (e) Company
Secretary.  Management would continue to be provided by NIJAL; the existing
contract, which is generally satisfactory, would be modified to meet: the
requirements of the proposed project. The proposed organization is summarized
in the Chart, attached to Annex 3. It would be a condition of effectiveness
that WOPC had been established and that arrangements acceptable to the Bank
had been made for the management of the projecl:. Assurances were obtained
that senior management would have qualifications and experience and would be
appointed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, ]FARMER BENEFITS,
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS TO GOVERNMENT
Yields and Production
7.01      Nucleus estate and smallholder oil palms would begin yielding in
the fourth year after planting. At full maturity the nucleus estates are
expected to yield 12.5 tons per ha. Smallholder yields are estimated lower
at 10 tons per ha reflecting anticipated lower field maintenance standards.
Oil to ffb extraction rates are assumed to rise from 16% in the first year
of harvesting reaching 22% at full maturity; the weight of kernels is esti-
mated at 5% of ffb. These yield estimates and extraction levels are generally
in line with those experienced with equivalent planting material uncder similar
ecological conditions in West Africa.
7.02      At full maturity in 1988 the project would produce annually about
25,300 tons of palm oil and 5,750 tons of palm kernels. The nucleus estates
would produce about 65% total output and project smallholders the balance
(See Annex 7).
Markets and Prices
7.03      In 1970, production of palm oil in Nigeria was estimated l:o be
about 490,000 tons of which all but 9,000 tons was consumed in the domestic
market. This is in marked contrast to earlier years when exports were con-
siderable: for example, in 1960 production was 545,000 tons and exports
189,000 tons. Based on an expected population growth rate of almos;t 3%
per annum, a projected per capita income growth of 3% per annum and an income
elasticity coefficient for palm oil of 0.5, household consumption of raw oil
should increase at roughly 4.5% per annum until 1980, reaching a toltal of
690,000 tons in 1980, or about 8.8 kg per capita. During the early 1980s
per capita consumption can be expected to level off, and domestic consumption
should increase at about 3.25% per annum. This would result in a projected
domestic consumption about 810,000 tons by 1985. Wdhen the total estimated



- 20 -
demand for palm oil from local processors, such as manufacturers of margarine
and soap, is added, the aggregate domestic demand in Nigeria is expected to be
around 700,000 tons in 1980, and 825,000 tons in 1985. The projections indi-
cate that by 1985, and without a major oil palm development program, there
will be a shortfall of around 275,000 tons of palm oil that will have to be
supplied through imports.
7d04      The Western State Marketing Board (WSMB) is authorized, under
current legislation, to purchase all palm oil and kernels offered for sale.
This is a 'Legacy from times when Nigeria was a major exporter of palm oil
and kernels.  Under the old arrangement WSMB bought whatever oil was sur-
plus to domestic requirements and exported this through the Nigerian Produce
Marketing (ompany (NPMC).  The amounts of oil available for export in the
Western State have declined rapidly in recent years and are now nonexistent.
As there is almost no domestic market for palm kernels or for palm kernel
products (palm kernel oil and cake), the great bulk of these continue to be
exported through the WSMB and NPMC.  As the Marketing Board functioned in the
past as much as a taxation mechanism as a price stabilization agency, it has
jealously guarded its rights to purchase palm oil surplus to domestic needs.
In particular it has tended to treat the production from oil palm estates as
being in the latter category. In recent years, however, it has permitted
estates to sell oil on the domestic market although it would appear to retain
the power t:o purchase their oil. Given this situation assurances were
obtained that WOPC would be permitted to sell its palm oil produced under
the project: freely on the domestic market. This assurance is required to
ensure thai: WOPC and the smallholders would receive full market value for
their production.
7.05      Domestic prices of palm oil have risen considerably during the last
few years. Thus the average wholesale price of special grade oil in Ibadan
rose from about N160 per ton in 1971 to about N 200 per ton in 1972 and about
N 240 in 1973. Significant seasonal price variations result .in average
December-January prices of palm oil being nearly 50% higher than the average
April-May prices. Because of the increase in prices for palm oil, smallholders
have also obtained higher prices for their ffb, although it should be remem-
bered that presently smallholdings have very low yields.
7.06      The Marketing Board purchases virtually all palm kernels offered
for sale and until recently farmers received about N 47 per ton; however,
FMG announc:ed that the price for the 1974/75 period would be N135/ton.
Kernels were normally exported unprocessed but in recent years there has been
considerably increased investment in kernel crushing operations in Nigeria.
The project: would sell kernels ex-millgate either for export or for sale to
local crushers.
7.07      In calculating the project's benefits a value for palm oil equi-
valent to an import substitution price for oil has been used. This is based
on the Bank's projected world price of US$495 per metric ton cif Europe in



- 21 -
1980. Palm kernels have been valued at an export parity price of N 120 per
ton based on the Bank's world price forecast of US$330 per ton cif Europe in
1980 (see Annex 8).
Farmer Benefits
7.08      It is expected that most farm families in the project area would be
able to plant and maintain 2 ha of oil palm without a significant reduction
in their current farming activities. On such a. typical planting of 2 ha all
developed at one time, production would begin in the fourth year from planting
and full bearing would be reached in the eighth year.  Over the four-year
establishment period the farmer would receive a. gross return 1/ from the cash
element of the grant/credit equal to about N 0.60 per manday worked; the
current unofficial farm wage rate is about N 0.70.  A farm budget is given
in Annex 9.
7.09      Assuming a farmgate price of N 20.0 per ton of ffb, the gross return
(in constant 1974 terms) from 2 ha would start at N 70.0 in the first year of
production (Year 4), rising to N 298.0 during the farmer's loan repayment
period (Years 7 - 12) and thereafter would average about N 370.0 in maturity.
These returns compare favorably with those obtainable from alternative tree,
or food crops, even where improved management and planting material are used.
After establishment a 2-ha planting would require between 50 and 70 mandays
a year for maintenance and harvesting, and gross returns per manday would rise
rapidly from N 1.3 in the year of first product:ion (Year 4) to an average of
N 4.5 during Years 7 - 12 of loan repayment ancL N 6.2 thereafter.
7.10      Official data on smallholder farm incomes is sketchy.  However,
gross returns on existing smallholdings are estimated to be in the region of
N 200 to N 300 per year including N 100 - N 200 value of foodcrops consumed
by the household. Thus, under the project a minimum planting of 1 ha of oil
palm capable of generating a gross return of N 185 per year, when mature (see
Annex 9), would represent a very substantial inicrement to farm incomes in
the area.
7.11      Participating smallholders would receive a bonus when the mill's
receipts for palm products exceeded the full cost of fruit collecticin, pro-
cessing and financial charges for the smallholclers' component of mill through-
put. The bonus would be distributed half-year]Ly through the cooperative
societies or WSFU branches (if applicable) according to smallholders' fruit
sales to the mill over the period. With the l:Lkely increase of palm oil
prices in Nigeria over the project period these smallholder bonuses are
expected to be substantial.
1/   Gross return is return to management, labor, and capital.



- 22 -
Financial Returns to WOPC
7.12      The projected WOPC cash flow is at Annex 10, and is expressed in
constant (1974) terms. The effects of inflation on both inflow and outflow
have been calculated using the price contingencies described in para. 5.02
for project costs, a 7% compounded rate for other costs, and the Bank's
international inflation index for the value of benefits.
7.13      The annual cash balance during the project period 1975-1983 ranges
from about N 35,000 to N 3.3 million in constant terms and from about N 8,000
to N 7.2 million in current terms. Accordingly, no liquidity problems are
expected and any temporary seasonal shortfalls should be readily covered by
normal overdraft facilities. After 1984, when loan repayment begins, there
is a rapidly increasing positive net cash flow in each year. This rises in
constant terms from N 3.3 million in 1984 to N 5.7 million in 1990, and in
current terms from N 7.7 million to N 19.9 million. These figures take no
account, however, of company tax, dividends or bonus payments to smallholders,
none of which can be meaningfully estimated at this range because of difficul-
ties in forecasting future levels of taxation, price trends and WOPC policy
with respect to new capital development projects. The repayment period of
the loan, however, makes allowance for these factors and the cover for debt
service is considered adequate in the early years of amortization, and ample
afterwards.
Financial Implications for the State Government
7.14      The State Government's involvement in the project is threefold (a)
it holds 100% equity in WOPC which should be highly profitable (see para 7.13)
with a cumulative surplus in current terms of about N 170 million 1/generated
by 1994, the final year of loan repayment, (b) it subsidizes the smallholder
scheme by providing grants during the oil palm establishment phase, fertilizer
subsidies, and the normal extension services that apply to small farmer agri-
cultural activities throughout Nigeria, and (c) it lends and onlends funds to
WOPC, which should give it some interest income. Through this scheme (see
also Annex 11) it is estimated that during the development period, the State
Government would have to meet annual cash deficits in current terms ranging
from N 300,000 (US$450,000) to N 2.0 million (US$3.0 million). During the re-
payment period the State Government would have annual surpluses ranging from
N440,000 (US$670,000) to N 780,000 (US$1.2 million).   Annual surpluses are
due to WOPC's loan repayments to State, which are substantial, and to the fact
that the smallholder component is relatively small. By 1994 (last year of
loan repayments) deficits would have accumulated to N 2.2 million (US$3.3
million). The State would receive no direct revenue contribution from small-
holder oil palm production as there would be no Marketing Board price differ-
ential or produce sales tax, consequently the costs of this scheme would be
defrayed against general State revenues. Federal policy with respect to the
distribution of mineral oil revenues basically aims at meeting overall financial
1/   Prior to allowance for depreciation and reserves, and payment of taxes,
dividends and bonuses to smallholders.



- 23 -
deficiencies in State revenues that are considered justifiable and would in-
clude any incurred as a result of the smallholder oil palm project. On the
other hand, the State would be in receipt of substantial dividends from WOPC
(see para 7.13).
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The direct benefits from the project would be the increase generated
in palm oil and kernel production which is estimated at 25,300 tons of palm
oil and 5,750 tons of kernels annually at maturity in 1988 and therfeafter.
The economic rate of return is estimated at 18.9% for the smallholdier component
and 18.7% for the estate component of the project. Assumptions used in computing
the rate of return are given in Annex 12. Project life is taken as 30 years.
Costs are detailed in Annex 5, yields in Annex 7, and prices in Annex 8. Labor
costs are shadow priced at 65% to reflect its average opportunity cost in the
project area and foreign exchange is shadow priced at N 1.00 = US$1.27 compared
with the official exchange rate of N 1.00 = US$1.52 (a premium of 20%). If
labor and foreign exchange are not shadow priced the rate of return is estimated
at 16.4% for the smallholder component and 15.9% for the estate component.
8.02      As is usual when project benefits occur after a long development
period, the rate of return is relatively insensitive to changes in costs and
benefits (Annex 12, Table 3). A 10% increase in cost accompanied by a 10%
decrease in benefits gives rates of return of 16.1% and 15.8% for smallholders
and estates respectively. A 20% increase in costs and a simultaneous 20%
decrease in benefits reduces the rates to 13.2% and 12.8%.
8.03      Project palm oil production would substitute for imports that
otherwise would be required and kernels or kernel oil would be exported.
Treating palm oil production as foreign exchartge savings and kernel produc-
tion as foreign exchange earnings, and using t:he Bank's price forecast in
current 1985 terms (for palm oil US$757 per metric ton and for kernels
US$504 per metric ton) annual net foreign exchange earnings/savings at full
maturity (1988 onwards) would be about US$18 million.
8.04      The project would sustain and develop an industry that at full
maturity (1988 onwards) would generate annually incremental net economic
benefits of N 5.3 million (US$8.1 million) in constant 1974 prices. During
the establishment period the project would create 8,300 manyears of employ-
ment (3,100 manyears for smallholder field est:ablishment and 5,200 manyears
for estate field establishment). At full maturity the estates would employ
about 700 laborers and about 2,000 smallholders would participate in the
project. Assuming an average family size of 6 - 7, some 18,000 people in total
would benefit from the project.



- 24 -
8.05      The project has a number of largely unquantifiable benefits.  In
particular, it would demonstrate the feasibility of a well supervised agri-
cultural scheme. It would form and strengthen an agricultural extension
service which would be able to handle further phases of the oil palm program
or use its experience for diversification into other crops. The cooperatives
would be strengthened through their participation in the project both organi-
zationally and financially. The institutional framework estalblished under the
project should ultimately facilitate the provision of credit not only for oil
palm planting but also for other crops grown by the farmers. The improvement
of roads under the project would benefit not just project farmers but the
whole farm community of the project area through such effects as more public
transportation, easier access for farm products to markets, greater availabil-
ity of goods and services to project area and lower transport costs.

IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Among the agreements reached were the following principal points:
(a)  the project would confine the grant credit scheme to smallholders
planting, or replanting, a minimum of 1 ha and a maximum of
10 ha. Smallholders would also be required to be members of a
registered cooperative society or WSFU (if applicable) (para. 4.09);
(b)  WOPC would adopt a pricing formula for purchases of ffb from
smallholders determined, in accordance with principles acceptable
to the Bank, by the State Price Policy Committee, which would be
established not later than 1980 (para. 4.16);
(c)  any financial losses incurred by the mills as a result of the
smallholder failing to deliver their produce to any of the
palm oil mills under the project up to the annual targets
agreed between SMU and WOPC, would be made good to WOPC
by the State Government (para. 4.17);
(d)  smallholders would sign a loan agreement with SMU and their
cooperative or WSFU (if applicable),, and the terms and conditions
of this loan agreement would be sat:isfactory to the Bank (paras.
4.09, 4.10, and 5.06);
(e)  the terms and conditions of the subsidiary loan agreement
between FMG and the State Government: would be acceptable to
the Bank; and also that the terms and conditions of the
subsidiary loan agreement between the State Government and
WOPC would be acceptable to the Banlc (para. 5.06);
(f)  SMU would be established in a form satisfactory to the Bank
and it would be adequately staffed at all times; and its
Steering Committee would have been established not later than
90 days after loan effectiveness (para. 6.03);
(g)  senior management positions of SMU would be filled by qualified
persons acceptable to the Bank and upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.03);
(h)  WOPC's General Manager, Chief Accountant, Company Secretary,
Estate Managers and Oil Mill Engineiers would have qualifications
and experience and be appointed on terms and conditions accep-
table to the Bank (para. 6.11); and
(i) WOPC would be permitted to sell its palm oil produced under
the project freely on the domestic market (para. 7.04).



- 26 -
9.02      Condition of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a) WOPC has taken possession, under 99-year lease, of all lands
acquired by the State for conveyance to WOPC to enable it to
develop the project estates (para. 3.08);
(b) subsidiary loan agreements acceptable to the Bank had been
signed between FMG and the State Government, and the State
Government and WOPC (para. 5.06);
(c) the State Government had established and funded a project
bank account (para. 5.12);
(d) SMU has been established and its senior management positions
filled (para. 6.02); and
(e)  WOPC had been established and that arrangements acceptable
to the Bank had been made for its management (para. 6.11).
9.03      A condition of loan disbursement for investment in the mills and
fruit collection system would be that confirmation had been received from
SMU and the Tree Crop Section of MEU that WOPC's mill development proposals
were in line with the project's overall production program (para. 4.16).
9.04      It was agreed that from the date of ending of loan negotiations
retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 would be made mainly for employ-
ment of key personnel and for nurseries (para. 5.06).

NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
WESTERN STATE
State Institutions 1/
1.        Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  The Ministry
is responsible for planning and executing agricultural programs with,in the
State. In the past, in the absence of effective planning and coordinating
at the Federal level, each State planned its own development, seldom looking
beyond its borders. Little or no consideration was then given to comparative
economic advantage as seen from a country-wide basis and hence no regional
specialization could develop. But ecological zones, water catchment: areas,
drainage basins and natural forest stands were part of the natural environment
before state boundaries were formed.  State plans therefore do not necessarily
reflect the best allocation of resources for the nation as a whole. There
was and still is unnecessary duplication of efEorts and the effectiveness of
scarce resources (mainly trained manpower since at present funds from mineral
oil are available in ample surplus) is therefore reduced. However, FMG and
the States recognize this problem and are taking steps to improve machinery
for planning and coordinating agricultural development on a country-wide
basis.  The proposed Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit (details are in the Supplementary Annexes - Supplement 4) is especially
designed to further this as far as tree crops are concerned.
2.        There are adequate numbers of experienced staff in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, to enable MANR to carry out the project.
3.        The Cooperative Miovement will play an important role in the project.
Only members of cooperatives (or the Western State Farmers' Union) 2/ can
participate in the project, and credit facilities would be provided through
SMEJ in conjunction with the cooperatives (or W'SFU, if applicable). A loan
agreement would be signed between the farmer, 3SMU7, and the cooperati.ve (or
WSFU, if applicable). Experience gained by the cooperatives (or WSFU, if
applicable) in channeling credit to the farmers for oil palm development would
establisn a sound basis for providing seasonal credit to farmers both for oil
palm and other crops.
4.        The cooperative movement 3/ consists of primary societies., secondary
unions, and five apex organizations: (i) the Association of Nigerian Coopera-
tive Exporters; (ii) the Cooperative Supply Association; (iii) the Cooperative
1/   Federal Institutions are described in the Supplementary Annexes to the
Nigerian Oil Palm Projects Appraisal Reports (Supplement 3).
2/   If organized, funded, and staffed in forms satisfactory to the Bank.

of Second Cocoa Project, Nigeria (Annex 3 and 4).



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Union of Western Nigeria Ltd.; (iv) the Cooperative Investment and Trust
Society; and (v) the Cooperative Bank. The movement is regulated by the
Cooperative Societies Division of the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives.
5.        Details on the number of primary societies are presented below:
Cooperative Societies in Western State
Number      Membership
Produce Marketing Societies                          830         60,000
Thrift and Credit Societies                        1,400         35,000
Crafts, Building and other Societies                 300         20,000
Total                                         2,530       115,000
6.        Primary Produce Marketing societies are members of unions, which
in turn are members of the Association of Nigerian Exporters (ANCE).  ANCE
is organized on the cooperative pattern, and its main aim is to function as
a central marketing agency for its members' products. Initially ANCE was
the Marketing Board's sole licensed buying agent for the whole cooperative
movement, but now member unions that are large enough register also as
licensed buying agents and take direct advantage of the buyirg allowance.
Part of the allowance is passed on to the primary societies. ANCE provides
other services (such as transport, storage, and marketing of products not
controlled by the Marketing Board) also. It is responsible for the develop-
ment of cooperative marketing organizations, and represents t:heir interests
at governmlent level.  Cocoa is the main commodity handled, but palm kernels,
rubber, coffee and copra are also traded.
7.        Credit and banking services are provided by the Cooperative Bank of
Western Nigeria and the Cooperative Investment and Trust Society. Both orga-
nizations have the same Board and Manager, but the Cooperative Bank is a full-
fledged commercial bank under the Banking ordinance, while the Cooperative
Investment and Trust Company concentrates on longer-term lencding.
8.        In 1965, the cooperative movement realized that it was advantage-
ous to purchase inputs needed by its members in bulk and directly from
foreign producers. Unions and societies formed a new cooperative society,
the Cooperative Supply Association (CSA), to collect all the societies'
orders for farm inputs and purchase these in bulk. CSA covers the whole
State through a network of district and field units. It is t:he biggest
importer of farm chemicals in Nigeria, and also assists cooperatives from
other states in purchasing their farm inputs.
9.        All apex organizations, unions, and primary societies are members of
the Cooperative Union of Western Nigeria. Therefore, its total membership
exceeds 100,000. The Union maintains an audit unit which ensures a permanent



ANNEX 1
Page 3
control of all,accounts in each society, union, or association. This unit
operates satisfactorily and the Registrar of cc,operatives also uses its
services.
10.       The Cooperative Societies Division of the Ministry of Trade and Co-
operatives, controls and regulates the cooperat:ive movement, using legislation
provided by the Cooperative Societies law (1953), and subsequent regulations.
The Division is headed by a Registrar. The Registrar's consent is needed for
cooperatives to grant loans to nonmembers and t:o borrow outside the cooper-
ative movement. The Division registers societies; supervises societies,
unions, and associations; and approves balance sheets and allocation of bonuses.
11.       New societies undergo a probationary period of approximately one
year before registration. After applying for registration, new primary so-
cieties are supervised and audited by the Cooperative Societies Division.
Registration is granted whlen the Registrar is satisfied that cooperative
legislation is being correctly applied, and at least 10 members have paid their
minimum share.
12.       The cooperative movement is well establishied in the Western State.
With the aid of SMU, cooperatives 1/ will be able to participate in the
channeling of credit and the distribution of payments for fruit collected.
The cooperatives 1/ would also guarantee the repayment of the loans, and an
interest spread would be provided to cover the risk.
13.       The Western State Farmers' Union (WSFU). 2/ After Nigeria's independ-
ence, numerous organizations were hastily formed to represent the interests of
the farming conmunity. M4ANR made many attempts to unify the various groups
into one association but did not succeed until 1969 wqhen WSFU was officially
launched. WSFU is an apex organization which esmbraces farmers' grouLps at
village level, through the divisional levels (based on administrative divisions)
to the general assembly, which consists of representatives of all divisional
unions.
14.       The main objective of WSFU is to promote and safeguard the economic
and social interests of Western State farmers and fishermen, mainly by orga-
nizing multipurpose cooperative societies, that would group farmers for pro-
ductive purposes, collective purchase of farm inputs, and marketing of pro-
duction. WSFU would also represent farmers' interests with the government
and with the the State's public or private institutions that deal wiLth the
agricultural sector.
15.       WSFU has not yet actively attempted to organize multipurpose co-
operative societies. Its management and administrative abilities were not
1/   The same applies for the Western State Farmers' Union if organized,
staffed, and funded in forms satisfactory to the Bank.
2/   For details on WSFU see Report 282a-UNI, Appraisal of second Cocoa Pro-
ject, Nigeria (Annex 3).



ANNEX 1
Page 4
strong in the first years of operation. Furthermore, the strong support of
MANR, although WSFU is independent, gives the impression to the farmers that
WSFU is government controlled.
16.       MANR has proposed (as under the Second Cocoa Project 1/) that WSFU
should play the same role under the project as the cooperatives. But before
WSFU's participation in the project, it would have to be better organized,
staffed, and funded, and to have a legal status comparable with that of the
cooperatives.
17.       State Marketing Board.  Details on the Marketing Boards and the
Western State Marketing Board are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement
12).
18.       The State Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT) is responsible for
the building and maintenance of roads. Under the project, earth roads would
be upgraded by a road unit under SMU, but subsequent maintenance would be the
responsibi:Lity of MWT (for Road program see Annex 4).
19.       The Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC).  A new limited liability company
would be formed to carry out the estate part of the project. It would also
take over the existing estates. WOPC would be formed as a subsidiary of the
Agricultural Investment Corporation (AIC). AIC, wholly governlment owned, was
formed in 1973 to carry out projects in agriculture.  The present government
owned nucleus estates are managed by the Nigerian Joint Agency Limited (NIJAL),
a Nigerian company formed by British and Malaysian interests (for details
see Annex 3).

The original goal was for NIJAL to plant 6,070 ha.  The short-fall
of 954 ha is mainly due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient land.
3.        The project is phase 1 of a program ultimately scheduled to plant
around 19,000 ha of oil palm. NIJAL's program encompassed a little more
than 5,000 ha, the project will plant 10,000 ha and in phase 2 another
4,000 ha of smallholder plantings will be established.

NIGERIA
NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
WESTERN STATE
Organization and Management
1.        Project implementation would directly involve three organizations,
namely:
The Smallholder Management Unit - which would be responsible for
implementing the new planting/replanting program for smallholders;
The Western Oil Palm Company - which would be responsible for
new planting/replanting the nucleus estates, constructing and
operating central processing mills and establishing a small-
holder fruit collection system; and
The proposed Federal Department of Agriculture's - Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (MFU) 1/ - a section of which would be re-
sponsible for monitoring and evaluating progress in tree crop
projects and assisting in planning future development programs
for the sector.
A. Smallholder Management Unit (SMU)
General Objectives
2.        A Smallholder Management Unit (SME) would be established to imple-
ment the smallholder replanting program.  The SMU would have a high degree
of financial and administrative autonomy and would report to the Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources (1MANR). A Steering Committee comprised
of representatives of relevant Government agencies would be responsible for
determining SMU policy and approving development/operations programs and
budgets.  When establishing the SSU, a consulting firm acceptable to Govern-
ment and the Bank would be engaged to set up a system of mechanized accounts
that meets the needs of the smallholder project:. The same firm would be
asked to advise on the type and venues for training the staff required to
operate the system.
3.        SMU would have its headquarters in Okitipupa and would be staffed
primarily with personnel either seconded from MKINR or recruited elsewihere
1/   For details on MEU see Supplementary Annexces (Supplement 4).



A JNE, 
Page 2
in Nigeria. It must, however, be emphasized that the technical and financial
direction of the tree crop projects will require well qualifled and experi-
enced staff.  SMU would be responsible for appraising newit plpnting/replanting
applications and providing the technical and financial services involved in
the field establishment and post maturity stages.  The plant .ng techniques and
standards to be followed by SMU would be those agreed with ItLe proposed Tree
Crop Section of IEU and the relevant Federal Research TIstitutions.
The Steering Committee - Its   mosition and Functions
4.        The Steering Committee would be comprised of the following:
i)   Chairman - Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources;
ii)   Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance or his representative;
iii)   A senior representative of the Cooperative Division. of the
Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives;
iv)   A senior representative of the Ministry of Economic Development
and Reconstruction;
v)   A senior representative of WOPC;
vi)   A representative of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture;
vii)   The Manager of SMU - who would be Secretary;
viii)   The Chief Agricultural Officer.
The Chairman would be authorized to co-opt up to three additional nonvoting
members to the committee and during the road improvement period, a repre-
sentative of the Ministry of Works and Transport would be so co-opted. A
quorum would require 6 voting members and in the event of a tie, the Chair-
man would have a casting vote.
5.        The Committee would meet quarterly, and its principal functions
would be to:
i)   determine policy;
ii)   appoint tne Manager, Controller of Field Operations, and
the Financial Controller, for which Bank concurrence would
be required;
iii)   review the organizational structure (see Chart attached to
this Annex) of the SMU, including terms of staff employment;



ANNEX 3
Page 3
iv)   approve the annual development/operational programs and
budgets;
v)   review quarterly progress reports and approve any program
amendments; and
vi)   approve the annual report and accounts.
Management Structure and Staffing
6.        Management Structure.  The basic management structure is outlined
in the Chart attached to this Annex, the main divisions of function being:
i)   headquarters staff directing and supervising the technical
and financial services being operated by the field staff
liaising closely with the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
of the Federal Department of Agriculture in evaluating ongoing
and planning future programs, establishing training programs
for staff and farmers;
ii)   financial control, including budget preparation, control of
smallholder grant/credit and fruit payment accounts, internal
audit and general administration;
iii)   the field staff responsible for the distribution and
subsequent appraisal of applications, supervision of grant/
credit services, providing extension and other services to
the farmers.
When WOPC's central processing mill establishes a fruit collection system, the
field staff will need to liaise closely with the mill to ensure that the small-
holders both understand and utilize the system. Deductions for loan repayments
would be made from the value of fruit purchases. The SMU Financial Controller
would be responsible for calculating: (a) the loan repayments due to the State
Government; (b) the balance to be passed on ta the Cooperatives; and (c) the
part of that balance to be distributed to the individual producers in payment
for fruit sold to the central mill.
7.        Staffing.  The project's technical and financial direction would
require suitably qualified and experienced staff, recruited internationally
if necessary. Middle level technical and administrative positions would be
filled by professional or senior technical graLde officers recruited from
within the State or from other States in Nigeria. Lower level field and
administrative staff would be recruited from existing Government agencies
or the private sector. Details of the numbers and phasing of professional
and technical staff requirements are given in Annex 5, Table 5.
8.        The Manager.  The chief executive of SMU would be delegated full
responsibility for implementing the replanting program. He would be directly



ANNEX 3
Page 4
--sponsible to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture through
tne Controller of Agricultural Services. The person appointed should have
professior,al qualifications in agriculture and at least 10 years experience,
5 of which, should have been in a senior administrative position.
The Controller of Field Operations.  Would be responsible for organ-
:2Ying and directing the technical aspects of the program, including nursery
work, appraisal of applications, supervision of planting and maintenance in
the immature and mature stages. He would also be responsible for organizing
i--service training for all levels of field staff. The person appointed
should have had at least 8 years experience of tree crop planting (oil palm,
cocoa or rubber), preferably at a senior management level with a commercial
organization.
105       The Financial Controller.  Would be responsible for the general
administration of the SMU and all project financial controls and procedures.
This man would need to be a well qualified accountant with at. least 8 years
experience at senior management level preferably in agro-industry.
Operational Procedures
110       Operational procedures are described in the Supplementary Annexes
t'Supplement 9) and the grant/credit procedures are detailed in Supplement 10.
Iain
12.       Technical training at all levels will comprise a very important
sector of project activity. To ensure an effective start-up in 1975, inten-
sive training in selected spheres such as nursery and field planting tech-
niques will need to be started as soon as possible. The type of training
involved can be divided into four basic categories: Senior Officers, Nur-
sery Staff, Field Staff, and Farmer Training. A schedule and estimate of
the cost of training are given in Annex 5, Table 7.  More details are in
the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 11).
B. The Western Oil Palm Company (WOPC)
Background
13.       In 1968, the Western State began a project to develop three estates
of 2,025 ha each in the Okitipupa district over the period 1969-72. The
project has been directed by a holding committee, appointed by the Executive
Council of the Military Governor and comprising a Chairman from the Ministry
cof Agriculture and Natural Resources and members from the Western Nigeria
Marketing Board and the Ministry of Finance. Management has been provided,
under a 20-year contract, by the Nigerian Joint Agency Ltd. (NIJAL) (paras
29-35).



*.NNEX 3
Page 5
14.       This initial project was expected to be completed in 1972.  How-
ever, failure to pay land compensation promptly has made it difficult to
acquire additional land and has slowed down implementation. So far, nearly
5,100 ha have been planted, of the 6,075 ha originally planned. In addition,
the management has reported that labor shortages have led to inadequate con-
trol over Eupatorium and rodents, with consequent losses of planting material.
15.       Each estate is run by an Estate Manager, who is supervised by
visiting agents from NIJAL's Head Office in Lagos. Basic accounting records
are maintained on each estate; the accounts are completed by NIJAL in Lagos
and audited before being submitted to the Holding Committee. A sutmmary of
the 1972-73 accounts is at Table 1. NIJAL also prepares investment programs
and budgets which have to be approved by the Holding Committee.
16.       In 1970-71 the Holding Committee awarded a contract to a French
supplier (Speichim) to establish palm oil mill at Okitipupa. The mill was
being built under the supervision of a consulting engineer who also prepared
the tender specifications and was completed end-1974.
Western Oil Palm Company
17.       A new limited liability company, the Western Oil Palm Company Ltd.
(WOPC), would be formed to take over the existing estates and processing mill
as well as to implement the fruit collection and mill components of the pro-
posed project. It is intended that WOPC would be formed as a subsidiary of the
Agricultural Investment Corporation (AIC), which is wholly owned by the State
Government (paras 24-28).
18.       The Board of Directors of WOPC, which would be appointed by the
office of the Military Governor, would include a representative of AIC and
of the Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Finance, and Economic
Planning. The Board would be responsible for matters of policy and for the
appointment of senior management. The senior management would comprise:
(a) General Manager; (b) Estate Managers; (c) Oil Mill Engineers; (d) Chief
Accountant; and (e) Company Secretary. Management (and training) would con-
tinue to be provided by NIJAL; the existing management contract, which is
generally satisfactory, would be modified to meet the requirements of the
proposed project.
19.       Under the project, a new mill would be constructed in 1980, to
serve the eastern part of the project area and the existing mill at Okitipupa
would have its capacity extended by 1984. The mills would process production
from the estates and smallholdings.
20.       The fruit collection system would be organized in close coordination
with SMU.  A Transport Manager, under the Oil Mill Engineer, would be re-
sponsible for organizing fruit collection and recording deliveries by in-
dividual smallholders as weighed and graded at the loading points. This in-
formation would be transmitted to SMU for payment to farmers after deducting
loan repayment.

21.       Under the subsidiary loan agreements with the State, WOPC WOLLLd
undertake to construct and operate a central mill and fruit collection system
capable of handling the production of the areas replanted under the smallhoider
component of the project.  Prior to any funds being channelled to ',,PC 'or mill
and fruit collection development, S,'U and the Tree Crop Section of the ze&-ral
Department of Agriculture's Monitoring and Evaluationr Unit would confirm
that WOPC proposals were in line with the crop production scheaules or IS-Q's
planting program.
22.       When purchasing fruit from smallholders, the central mill wouid
adopt an agreed pricing formula as determined by the State Price Formulation
Committee (see below). WOPC would also channel the cash dle on fruit pur-
chases to SMU where deductions for loan repayments would 'e made prior to
handling over the balance to the cooperatives for distribution to the farmers.
23.       On the other hand, SMU would be responsible for seeing that a-
acceptable percentage (to be agreed) of the projected crop production leveis
are attained and that the smallholders participating in the program sell their
fruits to the central mill.  This latter factor should he covered by  lh&  oan"
agreement between the smallholder and SM1U.  However, in the event of it vt-
ving difficult for SMU to take over the management of defaulting smallhlder
plantings, any financial losses by the central mill that could be clearly
demonstrated as having resulted from smallholder crop shortfalls would have
to be made good from State Government funds. It must, however, be emphasized
that the underwriting of such losses by Government would not be permitted to
be used as a means for WOPC to cover up inefficiency on the part of its
central mill management.
Agricultural Investment Corporation (AIC)
24.       AIC was established on October 1, 1973 under an edict signed in
May. The objective of AIC is "to designate or formulate and carry out or
cause to be carried out approved projects for improved production and devel-
opment of all forms of agricultural operations in the State." In addition,
the edict provides for the transfer to AIC of all agricultural undertakings
of the Western Nigeria Development Corporation and Western State Agricul-
tural and Industrial Investment Corporation.
25.       The Corporation itself consists of a chairman and six member
(analogous to a board of directors) appointed by the Military Governor.
The General Manager, Chief Accountant and Executive Head of the Investment
Department are the official members of the Corporation. The Secretary of
the Corporation and other heads of departments (Agriculture, Marketing,
Internal Audit) are appointed by the Military Governor on the reconnenda-
tion of the members of the Corporation.
26.       The projects being taken over by AIC include oil palm, rubber and
cocoa plantations and a cattle ranch. At the time of appraisal, the valua-
tion of the assets and liabilities taken over had not been completed and no
opening balance sheet was available.



N-NEX 3
Page 7
27.       Among the reasons for the creation of AIC was the desire of the
State Goverrment to improve the financial poEsition of its agricultural in-
vestments. AIC expects to have a high degree of autonomy with regard to,
for example, the discontinuance of improfitable projects and fixing salary
levels to attract suitable staff. AIC would welcome private participation
in its projects, but would retain at least a 51% interest.
28.       The principles on which AIC is organized appear to be sound; it
is, however, too early to make any assessment of its performance.
Nigerian Joint Agency Limited (NIJAL)
29.       NIJAL is a Nigerian company with its head office in Apapa.  It was
originally formed as a management agency by various British and Mailaysian
interests who were developing rubber plantat:Lons in Nigeria. Most: of these
plantations were and are partnerships between overseas companies and State
Governments. NIJAL also manages Government-owned oil palm estates on be-
half of State Governments.  The Board of NIJAL provides links, through its,
British members, with the latest oil palm, rubber, and other agricultural
developments in Malaysia.
30.       NIJAL is staffed with both Nigerian and expatriate staff who have
considerable agricultural and accountancy experience and, here again, as
more projects are undertaken the executive staff increases.  Considerable
emphasis is given to the training of young graduates from Nigerian Universi-
ties and Agricultural Colleges and those approaching the position of Estate
Mlanager are usually sent abroad for some months to widen their experience.
31.       Currently NIJAL are Managing Agents for:

ANNEX 3

32.       Early in 1972 NIJAL's parent company WAJAL was taken over by
INVESTECO. Up to that time NIJAL's activities were restricted to managing
existing estates in which there were majority overseas holdings and the devel-
opment of the Western State Oil Palm Project at Okitipupa with its large pro-
cessing mill. NIJAL has for many years been actively encouraging Federal
and State Governments to rehabilitate and develop new oil palm projects.
33.       Since the takeover by INVESTECO, NIJAL's interests and activities
have broadened not only in the agricultural sector but other aspects of
Nigeria's fast developing industries. INVESTECO and NIJAL are engaged in
promoting new projects and new companies, these presently include: New
Nigeria Development Company Limited (NNDC) which, with its Head Offices in
Kaduna, was formed by the Governments of the six Northern States for promoting
commercial projects. NNDC has joined with INVESTECO and NIJAI, in setting
up a new company in Kaduna, called Northern Agricultural Promctions Company
Limited (NAPC). NIJAL has seconded a General Manager and a Planning Officer
to NAPC, who also engage INVESTECO as consultants. NAPC is intended to pro-
vide the missing link in commercial agricultural development in the North
i.e., a management and planning structure in which State Government, the
Nigerian Agricultural Bank, the Federal Government, and private investors
may have confidence.
34.       NIJAL and INVESTECO are also working on a plan to pool the overseas
private shareholdings in four rubber companies into a Nigerian holding com-
pany (Oban not included) to be called Agricultural and General Investments
Limited (AGGIL). AGGIL will be managed by NIJAL as an investment company to
attract private and other investors into agricultural development projects,
including expansion of the rubber estates, new oil palm projects if the ques-
tion of market price is settled, and projects promoted and managed through
NAPC in the North.
35.       NIJAL has just completed a Feasibility Study for an Oil Palm Devel-
opment in Kwara State and has been engaged by the University of the Ife to
undertake a Feasibility Study of a Proposed Commercial Farm of some 6,000
acres at the University.
- C. Price Policy Committee and Fresh Fruit Price Calculation
Price Policy Committee
36.       A Price policy committee would be appointed and would comprise:
(a) Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Finance - Chairman;
(b) Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture;
(c) Registrar of the Cooperative Societies or his representative;



ANNEX 3
Page 9
d General Manager of the WOPC or a senior representative;
(e" Manager of SMU - Secretary;
(f) Representative of the Marketing Board;
(g)  Two representatives of smallholders;
(hE Representative of NPMC; and
(i)  A senior representative of AIC.
The comm:,ttee w¢ould determine a purchasing price formula which WOPC would
be obliged to apply in calculating the price it. would pay for ffb.  Using this
formula TROPC from month to month, or other suitable time span, would announce
a price -.o be paid for ffb.  Any departure from this formula would be referred
back to .he Committee prior to implementation.
Price Calculation
37.       The price paid per ton of ffb would be determined from the revenue
received for the palm oil and kernels produced from a ton of ffb after allow-
ing for the costs of fruit collection and processing, including depreciation,
taxes anc. finanlcial charges. The financial charges would be adequate to pro-
vide a reasonable return on the required capital investment, which return
would be sufficient to cover interest charges, and margins for building up
reserves and paying dividends to the Company's shareholders. The return on
capital 7rould be measured on the basis of a percentage of net revalued fixed
assets pLus a resonable allowance for working capital; this percentage would
be agree-l by the price policy committee within a suggested 10% - 15% range.
Depreciatcion oJn fixed assets would be taken on a straight line basis for
shortlived assets, such as those used for fruil: collection; for longer lived
assets, such as the mill, it is suggested that a more appropriate basis
would be an allocation over output processed compared to the estimated pro-
cessing capacity of the mills over their estimated remaining useful life.
Having deducted these costs, calculated on a cost/ton basis, from the re-
venue received from the sale of one ton of produce, the price per ton of
products net of all costs is known. This would be the base price.
38.       Applying the appropriate extraction rate of products to bunches to
this base price the price per ton of ffb can be calculated.  Extraction rates
applied would be related to the mill's previous three months processing re-
sults. Having determined an ffb purchase price, discount rates would need to
be determined in order to take account of different grades of fruit. Further
details are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 12).
39.       Any profits in excess of the agreed return on capital would be
distribut:ed to the smallholders in the form of cash bonus at the end of, say,
each half-year.  The amount paid to the individual smallholders being pro-
portiona: to the quantity of fruit sold to the company over the period con-
cerned.

1.        At full ma£urity rn 1988 pro4zct output is estimated at 55,000 tons
of ffb in the area west and 60,000 tons of ffb in the area east of the river
Oluwa. liowever, in both areas, there are estates run by NIJAL and at full
maturity these estates are estimated to produce about 41,000 tons of ffb in
the western and about 18,600 tons in the eastern area.  Table 1 gives details
of production and also shows project production as a percentage of overall
production that will be processed in the mills.
2.        Total production of ffb is therefore estimated at 96,000 tons of
ffb in the western and 78,600 in the eastern area.  Maximum monthly peak pro-
duction is estimated at 12.5% of annual production. This percentage is arrived
at based upon a study of the production history of Ajagbodudu estate in the
Mid-Western State. Peak monthly production at full maturity is therefore
estimated at around 12,000 ton in the western area and around 9,800 tons in
the eastern area. Assuming 500 working hours in a month, mill capacity required
would be about 24 tons/hour in the western and about 20 tons/hour in the eastern
area.  An ultimate capacitv of 30 tons/hour in the western and 20 tons/hour
in the eastern area is proposed. The main figures are summarized below:

Since the project is the first phase of a larger program, it might be neces-
sary to increase the capacity of the mills in the next phase of the program,
and therefore mills should be designed so as to allow for expansion.
3.        One new mill would be constructed in the eastern area and t:he
existing mill in Okitipupa would be expanded. Phasing of the mill capacity
(more details are in table 2) is as follows:

4.        From the first year of production, project output will be processed
in the new mills. It is however assumed that in the eastern area, production
of Omi-Orisa (estate established by NIJAL) will be sold to local processors,
or processed elsewhere from 1976 until 1979.
5.        A mill has been built in Okitipupa.  The contract between Speichim
and the Western State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources was signed
on July 20, 1972 and the mill was completed by end-1974. The Okitipupa mill
has an initial capacity 20 tons/hour and the capacity can easily be expanded
to 30 tons/hour in a single production line. I'he mill has the necessary pro-
vision for installing a second 30 tons/hour line in the same building. No
final site for a mill has been selected in the eastern area but the mill would
be built between Omi-Orisa and Iyansan estate. When selecting this mill site
it is essential to ensure a reliable and adequate supply of water as well as
a good access road for fruit collection and the evacuation of products.
6.        Estimates of mill investment costs are given in table 2 and are
based upon an analysis of (a) the Okitipupa mill contract and (b) the Hinvi
oil mill contract between Usine de Wecker and Sonadar, in Dahomey. These
cost figures reflect investment for mills to be commissioned in mid-1973.
In order to reflect end-1973/beginning 1974 pr:ices, the costs of equlipment
have been increased by 10% and the costs of civil works by 12% (Annex 4,
table 14). 1/ Estimates of operating costs are given in table 3 and 4.
Estimates of operating costs of the Okitipupa mill before 1980 are given
in table 5.
7.        Project costs include all costs -- civil works, equipment, and
housing -- for the oil mill in the eastern area and for the expansion of
the Okitipupa oil mill from 20 to 30 tons per 'hour by 1984.

Smallholder Fruit Collection
11;       At full maturity in 1988, the total production of ffb from the
project snallholders in the Western State would be about 40,000 metric tons.
About one-fourth would be produced east of the river Oluwa and the rest west
of this river. During the peak month (assuming 12.5% of total annual produc-
tion) about 200 tons of ffb would have to be collected each day (assuming
25 working days a month) from the smallholder areas. From the first year of
production (1980), fruit bunches collected from the smallholders would be
delivered either to the Okitipupa mill, or to the new mill east of the river
Oluwa.  West of the river Oluwa, smallholder areas lie up to a maximum of
about 30 lcms from the Okitipupa Mill and east of the river, if the mill is
built half way between the Omi Orisa and lyasan estates, the mean distance
from the smallholder areas will be about 16 kms. A single stage system of
fruit collection using 7-ton tipper trucks with rear mounted hydraulic crane
with built-in weighing scale is considered suitable for both west and east
of the rivrer Oluwa.
12.       It is estimated that each tipper truck could make about 4 trips in
a 10-hour working day (night loading being considered impractical) and haul
about 28 metric tons of ffb. At this rate the total peak month requirements
at full mELturity are estimated at 10 tipper trucks, 10 net delivery units,
and 400 nets. These estimates include the necessary reserves. The equipment
would be apportioned between the western and eastern areas. The total cost
of smallholder fruit collection are given in Table 6.
Estate Fruit Collection
13.       At full maturity in 1988 about 75,000 metric tons of ffb would be
produced at the project estates in the Western State. About two-thirds of
this quantity would be produced at the Iyansan estate east of the river Oluwa



ANNEX 4
Page 4
and the balance would be produced at the estate west of the river Oluwa and
the expanded Igbotako estate; these estates are situated about 26 kms, and
36 kms respectively from the Okitipupa Mill.  Assuming that 12.5% of the total
annual output would be harvested during the peak month and assuming 25 working
days a month, about 250 metric tons of ffb from the lyansan estate and 125
metric tons of ffb from the estate west of the river Oluwa and the expanded
Igbotako estate would need to be collected each day.
14.       It is estimated that during a ten-hour day each truck on an average
would be able to make five trips from the estates to the mills and transport
about 35 metric tons of ffb.  At this rate, in order to transport the peak
harvest at maturity, estate fruit collection would require 13 tipper trucks
with hydraulic cranes and built-in scales, 11 net delivery units and about
440 nets. These estimates include the necessary reserves. Fruit bunches
collected from the estates west of the river Oluwa would be delivered to the
mill at Okitipupa and those collected from the lyansan estate east of the
river Oluwa would be delivered at the proposed mill.  The total cost of
estate fruit collection as outlined above is given in table 7.
15.       Fruit collection from estates already established by NIJAL will
be financed from WOPC's own funds and not under the project. Using the
same cost assumptions as for the project estates, estimates of fruit collec-
tion costs of estates already established by NIJAL are given in table 8.
C. Road Improvement Prograim 1/
Introduction
16.       The Western State has a well developed communication system consist-
ing of about 12,500 km of roads, 600 km of railways, and domestic air trans-
port provided by the Nigerian Airways. There is a small airstrip near
Okitipupa that can be used by small aircraft. The 600 km of single track
railway within the Western State is operated by the Nigerian Railway Corpora-
tion. It is an important link in the export of products from the north, but
does not play an important role in the transportation of products inside the
State because of the extensive road network and the relatively short distances
to the port. The rivers, including the river Oluwa, play an important role
in the transportation sector, especially in the coastal area where road con-
struction is inhibited by natural obstacles such as river deltas and swamps.
17.       The road net work consists of 655 km of Federal "A" roads; 2,300 km
of "B" roads; and about 9,500 km of earth roads.
1/   More details are in the Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 7).



ANNEX 4
Page 5
Project Area
18.       The road network in the project area is different east and west of
the river Oluwa. A good hardtop road links Lagos and Ibadan with Okitipupa
although this road needs expansion to the millgate (0.5 km). West of the
river Oluwa there is a dense network of secondary roads radiating from
Okitipupa. At Okitipupa the Oluwa river varies in width from 50 to 75 meters
and there is no bridge. At present the only crossing of the Oluwa river is
possible 20 km north of Okitipupa. There is a paved road from there to Irele.
After Irele the paved road changes into a track and the track changes into
a footpath just before Shabomi. The river Otu, although nowhere more than
50 meters wide, is surrounded by large swamp areas. There are no bridges
over the river Otu and the only way to cross it is by canoe. All equipment
for the Omi Orisa estate, already established by NIJAL, has been transported
by barge to the estate. This way of transport has been found quite feasible
and it is assumed that the same method of transport will be used for the
development of the Iyansan estate and the surrounding smallholdings. It is
likely that project development will induce a more or less regular ferry
service between Okitipupa and the landing side near the Omi Orisa estate.
Cost of Reconstruction
19.       The upgrading of earth roads to the standards discussed in the
Supplementary Annexes (Supplement 7) would be done by contractors under
the supervision of a road engineer and his staff. Costs, including de-
preciation, are estimated as follows:
(a) N 675 per km for improving an existing earth road to
truck standard.
(b) N 725 per km for a new earth road to truck standard.
Administration of the Construction Program
20.       The supervision of the earth roads program would require experience
and skills which are in short supply in Nigeria. Neither the Ministry of
Works and Transport nor the consultants in the State (whether local or foreign)
appear to have wide experience in building and maintaining all-weather earth
roads. However, the timber companies, which construct such roads for ex-
traction purposes, have personnel with adequate qualifications.
21.       A road engineer would be engaged to organize and supervise the
road construction program, assisted by two supervisors and two clerks. The
road engineer should have wide experience in the construction of low-cost,
all-weather earth roads and would preferably be recruited frcm the timber
exploiting companies.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
22.       It is estimated that of the 239 km of fruit collection road,s involved
in the project, 148 km of earth roads need to be improved: 90 km need to be
improved to truck standards and 58 km need to be newly built. Under the
project 500 m of a 2-lane paved street within the town of Okitipupa to
provide access to the oil mill would also be rebuilt.
23.       As only 148 km of roads have to be rebuilt, a construction team
under a road unit in the SME could complete this work in little over a year.
However, the capital cost of equipment for such a team could not be recovered
in one year. Therefore, it would be more economical to execute the work witn'i
local contractors with experience in earthworks and with the necessary equip-
ment. A unit price contract would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding among prequalified contractors. It would be the task of the road
engineer to prepare the tender documents, supervise the bidding procedure
and award the contract. Since the contractor's overheads and profits are
not included, the cost figures (para. 19), should be increased by about 25%.
24.       The contractor's work will be supervised by the road engineer.  He
will prepare the monthly statement on the work executed and certify the final
statement after completion of the work. From the monthly statements a 10%
retention money will be deducted and paid to the contractor when work has
been finished. The contractor should, before he starts his work, provide for
at least a 5% performance guarantee.
The Road Network
25.       The road network needed for the 4,000 ha smallholder project is
shown on map 10966 attached to this report. It has been assumed that plant-
ing will be confined to areas that lie within 600 meters on each side of the
collection road. It is further assumed that only 12.5 ha per km of paved
road and 20 ha per km of earth road will be used for planting palm trees
under the project.
26.       The total length of the road network used for smallholder fruit
collection is 239 km; 178 km west of Okitipupa and 61 km east of the Oluwa
and Otu rivers. In the western area there are 67 km of paved roads and
111 km of earth roads, all of which need upgrading. In the eastern area there
is a need to improve 61 km of tracks to earth roads, of which 37 km would be
done under the project and 24 km around Omi-Orisa would be developed by the
estate.
27.       Based on the above assumptions, the total hectarage of smallholder
plantings that could be developed along this road network is:

Estimated Cost of Road Improvement Program
28.       Eight hardwood bridges within the project area are in poor condition
and need repair. This involves re2ewing of deck and beams. The repair cost
has been estimated at N 80.- per m of deck. The project costs also include
rebuilding of 500 m of a 2-lane paved street within the town of Okitipupa.
The present road leading to the oil mill is in a deplorable condition and
has to be rebuilt in view of the heavy flow of vehicles entering and leaving
the mill during the full operation.
29.       The costs 1/ of the road program are detailed in Annex 5, table 7
and summarized below:
1/   Costs of supervision by road supervision team of SMU not: included.
Supervision costs amount to N 22,080 over the road development period.

Yields on already established NIJAL estates
1.        The supplying (figures on supplying obtained from NIJAL are given
below) together with fire damage in some areas and failure to control
eupatorium and cercospora has set estates back.

1969 plantings at Igabotako gave 1.92 tons/ha in January-June
1973 but very little fruit came in later during the year.  Ilutitin/Ikoya
1969 fields gave 1.67 tons/ha over the same period although 2.5 tons/ha was
achieved in some fields.
2.        Based on these data the yields and extraction rates for the NIJAL
estates are estimated as follows:

Millgate Values of Palm Oil and Kernels
1.        For the purpose of this project the economic and f:inancial prices
for palm oil and kernels have been calculated using the Bank's world market
price projections for 1980. These projections are as follows:
Projected Prices for Palm Oil ($/MT)

Palm Oil
3.        It has been assumed that without the proposed projects Nigeria would
be a net importer of palm oil by 1980. The projections indicate that by 1985
the net deficit would be around 275,000 tons of palm oil.and most of this
deficit would have to be supplied from Malaysia. The Ivory Coast would be
able to supply part of this deficit but it is umlikely that the cif price
would be much below the Malaysian price. It has further been assumed that
palm oil imported or produced by the project would be sold in or around
the large urban markets of Western Nigeria, such as Ibadan. Implicit in
this assumption is that the rural markets of Western State would be fully
supplied from alternative sources. It is probable that the northern parts
of this State would also be the markets for the project and this would re-
sult in higher economic and financial millgate prices since (a) the transport
from port to the market would be higher, and (b) the transport from the mill
to the market would be less than projected with Ibadan as the market. Hence
the price estimates tend to be on the conservaitive side. Furthermore projects
would be in full production after 1985 and the forecasted price for 1985 in
constant 1974 terms is substantially higher than the 1980 price.
Kernels
4.        For the purposes of the economic and financial millgate prices it
has been assumed that kernels will be exported at a projected 1980 price
of US$330 per metric ton. The charges included are based on what is cur-
rently expected to be the role of the Marketing Boards and NPMC, where the
Mill can bypass the Marketing Board and sell directly to NPMC and hence
avoid any Marketing Board commission.
5.        With the rapid expansion of kernel crushing industries from 2 mills
at present, with a combined crushing capacity of 110,000 tons per annum, to
about 7 - 9 mills with a capacity of 350 - 400,000 tons, provided all pre-
sently projected investment programs materialize (nearly all joint enter-
prises with State participation), it is probable that a large proportion
of kernels would be processed locally and exported as kernel oil. ;Ln that
case the export price for kernel oil would be obtained and given efficiency
in the crushing operations the added value for Nigeria would be higher.
Therefore taking the export prices for kernels is again a conservative es-
timate.

NUCLEUS ESTATE/SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM PROJECT
WESTERN STATE
Calculation of the Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity' _Aalysis
1.        The annual costs and benefits used in calculating the economic
rate of return to the project are given in Tables 1 and 2 and a summary of
the sensitivity analysis in Table 3.
(a) Project Life
The life of the project is assumed to be 30 years and no residual
value is attributed after that period. Planting would be completed'
by the end of 1980. Production would commence in 1980, and all
areas would be at full maturity by 1988;
(b)  Project Costs
The costs are those shown in Annex 5 but with the following
adjustments:
(i) price contingencies are omitted;
(ii) identifiable taxes and duties are excluded, namely, import
duties on vehicles and equipment and certain fEarm inputs
and indirect taxes included in operating costs.
(iii) labor is shadow priced at 65% of the estimated financial
cost (smallholder labor 70 kobo and nursery and estate
labor N 1). The shadow wage rate reflects a wgeighted
average of economic wages in both peak and slack seasons;
(iv) the official foreign exchange rate does not reflect exactly
the domestic value of a unit of foreign exchange because
of taxes and subsidies. Therefore a shadow exchange rate
N 1 = $1.27 has been applied instead of the official rate
of N 1 = $1.52. This implies an estimated overvaluation of
the Naira of about 20%:
(v)  for the purpose of division of mill expenditure between
nucleus estate and smallholder projects, the respective
fruit production at ful' development has been taken as a
percentage of total fruit processed. This percentage
has been applied for division of mill investments.
(Annex 4, Table 1);



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(vi) similarly for the division of mill recurrent expenditure
the same percentage as above--on:Ly calculated on annual
basis--has been used (Annex 4, Table 1);
(vii)  the cost of the Tree Crop Section MEU has been dis-
tributed between oil palm, rubber and cocoa projects
on the basis of 50%, 25% and 25% respectively. Since
there are three palm oil projects, the 50% share has
been apportioned between projects and also between the
smallholder and estate components on the basis of ha
planted;
(viii) physical contingencies (at 5% over all costs) have been
included during the project period (1975-1983).
(c)  Benefits
(i) Yields and production estimates are given in Annex 7;
(ii)  economic prices have been based on the Bank's price projec-
tions for palm oil and kernels. The price projections are
$495 per u'etric ton of palm oil in 1980 ($300 in constant
1974 terms) and $330 per metric ton of kernels in 1980 ($200
in constant 1974 terms). The economic millgate prices for
palm oil (N 237.3) and kernels (N 120.4) are given in
Annex 8;
(iii)  the value of project palm oil is; treated as foreign
exchange savings (import substitution) and the value
of kernels as foreign exchange earnings;
(iv) only project production has been taken into account
and thus output from NIJAL's existing estates has not
been included;
(v) no additional benefits due to road development are taken
into consideration.
2.        Based on these assumptions the econotmic rate of return is 18.9%
for the smallholder component and 18.7% for the estate component. A 10%
increase in costs with benefits unchanged reduces the rate of return to 17.6%
and 17.3% respectively. As usual, where project benefits occur after a long
development period, the rate of return is relatively insensitive to changes
in costs and benefits (Table 3). Even in the case of costs increasing by 20%
and benefits decreasing by 20% the economic rate of return is 13.2% for the
smallholder component and 12.8% for the estate component.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
3.        Without shadow pricing of labor and foreign exchange, the economic
rate of return is 16.4% for the smallholder component and 15.9% for the estate
component.
4.        The rate of return for the whole project, combining the estate and
smallholder components, is 18.8%.
