OVERVIEW
The Kenya Power Company (KPC) intends to construct a hydroelectric facility by
detng water from the Sondu river In Westem Kenya through a power house. An
Ernvronmental Impact Assessment (ElA) for the project was prepared. The present
Lstudy presents the results of supplemental socioeconomic studierrequired to
comprete the EIA.
The population of the project area Is estimated at 55.400. The project development
will be on land which is owned by local residents and used for subsistence farming
purposes. The majority of the households live on their plot of which the average size
Is around 2 hectares. In some cases, however, the plot is too small for subsistence
purposes.
The attitude of the local residents towards the project is very positive, as evidenced
by the high turn-out at the public meetings, and the responses provided to the
Consultants.
A total of 191 plots (estimated 1,700 people) wil be directy affected in the reservoir
and discharge channel areas, of which 48 wDi lose more than 50% of their area. 36 of
the affected plots will be bisected by the discharge channel. In addition some 62
temporary and 52 permanent houses will be affected.
Other negative impacts anticipated include loss of eamiings of the ferry owners.
exposure of residents to the danger of faDing into thedischarge channel, the
importation of undesirable sociocultural habits into the project area, possible
interference with the Koguta forest and the abandonment of an important secondary
school.
A number of positive benefits are expected, the most defnite and significant being an
estimated 402 new unskilled jobs available to residents of the project area for a tour-
year period. This will double the number of job opportunities in the area. The locally
spent earnings of the immigrant labour combined with the total earnings of the locally
recruited labour wDi represent a 15% increase in the local economy, and locally spent
money is expected to total to Shs 48 million per annum in a cash economy of
Shs 109 million per annum, an increase of 44%. Thus the multiplier effect for local
trading and the small business sector will be very high.
In addition, improvements to the road network will provide a significant benefit to the
local residents; between 50% and 100% improvement in productvity is anticipated for
plots in the reservoir area as a result of better access to markets.
The residents are keen for the project to go ahead, so that they can enjoy the positive
benefits and because they are looking forward to the second, irrigation phase of the
project They will cooperate in regard to possible relocation or land loss, so long as
adequate compensation is given. In the case of plots reduced less than 50% this
means cash compensation. In the case of plots reduced more than 50% It means
land-for-land, or cash plus the guarantee of a suitable plot



The residents are generally unwillng to move out of the area altogether, and the
ruiber of plots likely to come up on the open market may not be sufficient.
Fuerrnore, the residents exhRibit some degree of mistrust of officialdom, and do not
hae a strong background of community organisation and development In view of
this, Xt  Consuitarts have made a numbe of recommendations designed to facilitate
the dilogue between the community and the project proponents?o limit the number
of families obiged to relocate and to rnnimise the disnjption to other plot owners:
An NGO should be approached to assist Mte arrangements and negodating of
compensation, land redistribution, establishing management guidelines for the
labour camp, posioning of fences and bridges for the discharge channel etc
and other social issues arising ftwm implementation of the project
The Consultants consider fat installaton of satisfactory insttudonal arrangements
consttutes the single most important factor in resolving any potential negative
impacts of a socioeconomic nature.
The alignment of the discharge channel should be adjusted if possible, to
minimise the number of bisected plots. In additon, a land redistributon
exercise should be conducted wi the residerts to ensure that as many
whole plots as possible can be retained, and spoil banks shoLdd be avoided
as far as possible. It is expected that removal oet 7e spoil banks will reduce
the number of households earmarked for poternial relocation from 48 to 25,
and the redistribLtion exercise will reduce it s4 furher.
In order to minimise as far as possible the relocaton of residents to locations
outside the project area or adjacent sub-locatfons, the Ministry of Lands and
the Disrict Development Committee should be approached with a view to
making some new land available to accommodate relocated families.
In order to avoid the dangers and problems of uncontrolled abstraction of
water from the discharge channel, a gravity feed community uater project
should be inslled in the dischrge channel ame for human consumption and
livestock.
In addition a number of recommendations are made regarding forest protection.
cleanng of the reservoir area the dumping of waste material. rehabilitation and health
control.
The Consutnts are satisfied that i these recommendations are implemented. the
project can be Implemented in a satisfactory and fair manner, with no residernts worse
off than they were before, and with a significant net positive benefit to the project
area, which has for many years suffered from an almost total lack of development

INTRODUCTION
The Kenya Power Company (KPC) Intends to construct a hydroeletric facgfty in
Westem Kenya by diverting water from the Sondu River through a power house at the
base of Nyandach escarpment An Environmental Assessment for the project was
prepared by Nippon Koei Company Umited. (Detafled Design and Preparation of
Tender Documents for Sondu/Mirlu Hydropower Project Environmentl Impact
Assessment Data Book (5),w July 1991). KPC decided that supplemental
socioeconomic studies were required to complete the Environmental Assessment
following which an additional study was carried out: 'Sondu-Mlriu Hydroelectric
Project Supplemental Socioeconomic Studies' - RPS International, August 1993.
The 1991 study focused primanly on the sectors where the gratest impacts of project
operation were expected, notably water, health and land use. The 1993
socioeconomic report was based on:
i)    A baseline survey, in order to be able to assess positive and negative impacts
based on:
a)    Household interviews;
b)    Data collected from local officials, inkt#itions, public meetings and
other residents in the locality $
c)    Published data.
ii)   Reld studies of the number of households anc. people affected by the creation
of the reservoir and access road, and the discharge channel:
iii)   Maps showing the location of the affected plots, including dwellings which may
have to be replaced or reocated;
iv)   Public meetings held with the community at large:
v)   214 household interviews
vi)   The affected people's views and attuudes. regarding the issues of relocation.
compensation and project benefits;
vii) An analysis of project benefits
viri)  an estimaion of land vadues, in order to be able to indicate the financial
implications of a compensation programme, and to reinforce the calculations of
project impacts on the lcal economy.
The present report combines both of the above studies to form an integrated EIA
summnary of the project. It has been compiled by RPS International Limited for
Nippon Koei Company UmWed

2    BACKGROUND
The power system of Kenya Is composed of the following six entites:
The Kenya Power Company LimIted (KPC),
The Kenya Power & Ughting Company Limited (KPLC),
The Tana River Development Authority (TRDC),
The Kero Valley Development Authority (KVDA),
The Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA), and
The Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA).
The KPC, counterpart agency of the Sondu/Mlriu Hydropower Project, and other
entitles, own generating facillties In the national power system, but actual operation
and maintenance of the facilities are carried out by the KPLC under the management
agreement
The country is divided into five regions in terms of the power supply, is Nairobi,
Coast, Rift Valley, Westem and Mt Kenya regions as shown In DWG-02.
KPLC. which is a 60% government-owned entity, cordinates the national power
network, purchases power in bulk from the KPC, TRDC and TARDA, and distributes
power to consumers. Besides, the KPLC is importing,energy from Uganda through
the Lessos substation via the intermediate Muhoroni iwitching station.
Total installed capacity of the generating facilities was 735.6 MW In the country as of
30 June 1990, as listed below:

Total            735.6             603.7             3,148.0
Hydropower plants share 67% of the total installed capacity, 79% of the tactal
effective capacity and 80% of the total annual energy production. Imports from
Uganda are equivalent to about 6% of energy production in the country.

On the basis of the power demand forecast, a planting-up study was carried out to
seek the least cost sequence in the long term plan to 2010. The result of the study
revealed an optimum installation sequenceamprising the Sondu/Miriu hydropower
plant with an installed capacity of 60MW and commrssioning time in 1997 (net
Appendix II).
The draft final report entitled '1990 Interim Update of the National Power Development
Plan 1991 to 2010' prepared in April 19g9 recommends the Sondu/Miriu project for
commissioning in the mid-1997 in the recommended generation development plan in
Kenva.

3         PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Sondu-Miriu Hydroelectric Project is a river diversion projecLwhich will creete a
small impoundment behind a 18 metre high intake weir. An intake structure will divert
the river Into a tunnel which joins with the main powerhouse via a headrace tunnel
and penstock. Pressure in the tunnel is regulated by a surge tank located on the
crest of the Koguta Forest escarpment.
Compensation water wvill by-pass the weir to maintain adequate flow (0.5w? /sec) in
the river below the weir.
After passing through the powerhouse the water is retumed to the Sondu/Miriu river
along a 4.5 km long outlet channel. The channel has trapizoidal section of concrete
lining, bottom width of 2.5 m connects the tailrace to the outet near the gorge of the
Sondu river. The channel, which runs in westward direction along the foot of the
escarpment, releases the maximum of 40rw? sec used for the power generation to the
Sondu river.

4         BASELINE STUDY
4.1       TooaqraDhv. Physical and Climate
The project area lies mainly within the former Nyakach Division of Kisumu District
The altitude vanes from around 1,250 m to 1,500 m. Mean annual maximum
temperatures range from 2S C to 30'C, and mean annual minimum temperatures from
9gC to 18C. Mean annual rainfall at nearby Papondoti is 712 mm.
The project area can be divided into two physiogamphic regions; the lowlying almost
level delta region adjacent to Lake Victoria, and the upper region part of the Sondu-
Miriu River catchment zone. The two regions are separated by an escarpment
(Nyakach Escarpment) and partly the Koguta Forest Reserve which lies in West
Koguta Sub-location of West Nyakach Location. The vegetation in the delta region is
largely grass, shrubs and natural trees incduding acacia and other semi-arid species in
the drier parts. Koguta Forest Reserve, which is unsurveyed. covers a substantial
area and is planted with cedar and casuarina trees The headrace tunnel will be
surfacing on the edge of this forest as well as the surge tank. The sois are a mixture
of sandy clay and murram types.
The upper region. in which the reservoir and access rorad will be located. receives
more rain and the vegetation is thicker and broadly sililar in species to that in delta
region. The soil is mainly red with pockets of murram and clay rypes.
The Sondu-Miriu River is the major river on the region and is a source of domestic
and livestock water. It is an alternative source of water for the population limng in the
delta region. especially in the drought period. Like all the other rivers in the district
the Sondu-Miriu flows into the Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria.
The reservoir lies on pre-cambrian intrusives. which are mainly granite rocks
etending across the escarplnent. The discharge channel will lie in a more recent
colluvium occurring from wash accumulation.
4.2       Hydrology and Water Quality
Efforts were made to investigate which. if any. intemational agreememts oresenr.
govem the use of water flowing into Lake Victoria with particular reference ti vne
project:
1)   The Ministr, of Water Development and the National Waler Conservation and
Pbeline C ororation have no knowledge of any such agreements.
2)   The United Nations Environmental Programme, Section of the Environmental
Law has no records of a Nile Waters AgreementL
3)   The Lake Basin Develoament Authority's official position is that Kenya is not
bound by any international agreements and only Kenyan legislation applies.
The LBDA noted that there has been a recent meeting of some of the riparian
states to discuss the River Nile but Kenya was not party to these talks.
4)   The Ministry or Foreign Affairs has no knowledge of any new agreements or
other treaties relating to the use of water entering Lake Victoria.



8
5)   The Attomev General's Office. Treaties and Agreements Department is aware of
the Intemational Nile Waters Agreement which concemns the White Nie and
was signed by Kenya. Uganda. Tanzania. Sudan and Egypt. and govems,
among other things, the usage of inflows into Lake Victoria Their information
is that this agreement was signed in the 1920's and expired 'in the 1980's'.
6)    Copies of the original Agreement could not be found in either the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs or the Attomey General's Office.
7)   The Embassy of Eavot have no information regarding any agreements solely
between Kenya and Egypt but do have some correspondence and other
indirect information on agreements made since 1890's about various
international agreements concerning the River Nie and Lake Victoria.
Information on water quality in the Sondu/Miriu River is very sparse and some of it is
of dubious reliabiity. What is available is sumrnarzed in Appendix I. These results
are based on very few samples so variations due to season and time of day of
sampling are not revealed. These data should therefore be regarded as indicative
rather than definitive and treated with due caution.
These data do not indicate excessive pollution of the rver at present; all parameters
recorded are within acceptable limits.
4.3       Biological
As mentioned above. the vegetation in the delta region is grass, shrubs and natural
trees including acacia and other semi-arid species in the drier parts. The escarpment
incorporates the Koguma Forest Reserve. which contains cedar and casuarina trees.
The intended reservoir area is at present lightly to moderately covered with scrub and
a few larger nature trees. Most of the land is under subsistence cultivation of annual
crops consisting mainly of maize, beans and cassava
The area is densely populated. and contains no reserves for wildlife.
Two important and potenftiy har,mful free-floating aquatic weeds are known to exis:
in the lower Sondu/Miriu and Lake Victoria; these are Pistia (the Nile Cabbage) and
Azolla (the water fern). Neither of these two species are known to exist in the Upper
Sondu above the weir ste.
Fisheries are based principally on Lake Victoria The extent of fshing activity in the
Sondu-Miriu is unknown; upstream of the township is in any case in Kalenjin territory,
and these people do not traditionally catch or eat fish. The District Development Plan
nonetheless highlights the potential of Nyakach Division for fish farming.
4.4       Protected Areas
Development projects which involve the construction of roads, reservoirs or irrigation
schemes pose a threat to the continuing well being of the environmertL Areas which
may be inundated, graded or levelled during construction may contain natural and
man-made resources of considerable cultural and economic value.



9
Awareness of the potential destructon of objects and sites of historical, cultural or
archaeological importance in Kenya resulted in the gazetting of the Antiquiies and
Monuments Act In 1963. The Act defines and seeks to protect objects of
archaeological, palaeotological and historical interest from damage or destruction.
However, there are no protected areas In the project area, apart from the Koguta
Forest, and no game parks or national parks.
4.5       Socioeconomic
4.5.1     Project Area
The proposed project lies within sbc sub-locations, which taken together can be
regarded as consdtiung the project area so far as socioeconomic impacts are
concemed. The area so defined encompasses al of the directly affected households.
and defines the area regarded as local' so far as the residents are concerned in their
desire that unskilled project jobs should be reserved for localr residents. It is
considered that those households indirectly affected are also contained well within the
project area.
4.5.2     Population and Land Use
The population of the project area in 1993 is estimated at 55,400. The population
density in the sub-ocations in which the project wl p6incipally lie is 400-500 people
per sq km, the density in the sub-locations containing the reservoir being somewhat
higher than in the sub-locations containing the discharge channel.
The project development will be entirely on land which is used by local residents for
agrcultura and residential purposes. All of the land to be acquired is privately owned
by individual households.
Plot sizes vary from a fraction of a hectare to around 4 hectares. with a few reaching
in excess of 12 hectares. The average plot size is 2 hectares.
4.5.3     Settlement and Lund Tenure Pattern
The project area has been settled for a long time; it is not a recent settement
scheme. The earliest dates of settlement mentioned by respondents was 1907 in the
reservoir area, and the 1930's in the case of the discharge channel area.
Not all of the households live on their plot In the case of the discharge channel area.
the proportion lMIg on their plot is around 90%: In the case of the reservoir area the
prportion is rther lower. In many cases t was apparent to the Consultants that the
plot concerned is not the only plot owned by the household: several of the
households own other plots, often outside the project area This is not surprisIng, as
many of the plots are in fact too small for household subsistence. In other cases,
households own other plots within the project area There are several examples of this
in the discharge channel area. to which some families migrated from the river area
near the proposed discharge point due to flooding of their plots. The original plots
have, however, been retained, so far as the Consultants were able to ascertain.



10
The mapping of the project area is not entirely satisfactory. The Govemment cadastral
fmps are cleary marked as not being valid for legal purposes; only 5% of
respondents actualy hold the legal title document to their plot, and only 3% had
acquired maps or plans showing the location of their plot. There re no beacons in
place. Not surprisingly, very few owners have borrowed money using their land as
security. For the reasons given, the survey and mapping carried out by the
Consultants, whie meeting the stated objective, cannot be used as a legal basis for
finalising individual compensation claims. In all cases it is a statutory requirement for
Govemment surveyors to establish plot boundaries at the time of the subdivision or
transaction.
4.5.4     Local Economy and Income Levels
The vast majority of households in the project area live off the land, seoling their
surplus production, if any. in the local markets. There is very little fonmal sector
employment in the area. However, a small but significant proportion of the
householders also engage in small-scale business activities such as fishing, basket
weaving or pottery, although in many cases interviewees were reluctant to reveal such
supplementary forms of income generation.
Food crops commonly grown are millet. groundnuts. cassava and maize. Almost all of
the households keep livestock a typical livestock owning pattern is two cows. three
goats. five sheep and ten chickens.
Respondents were reluctant to declare cash income except for a very few cases,
which were insufficient as a basis for estimaion.
The Consultants instead estimated total value of produce by multiplying production by
commodity price, regardless of whether or not there is any surplus sold in the local
markets. Using this method, households in the reservoir area are estimated to be
typically producing agricultural produce valued at around Shs 53.000 per annum.
Given an average plot size of around 2 heecares. this implies an average income from
crops equivalent to Shs 26,500/halannurm
In the case of the discharge channel area. the estimate is Shs 33.600,iplot. annum or
Shs 16.800/ha/annum.
Some households also have a business income. which in some cases reaches several
hundred thousand shillings per annum. When added to the value of agricultural
production, this brings the effective mean household income from crops and business
to around Shs 60,000 per annum, presenty equivalent to USS750 per annum.
These income levels, while of the expected order of magnitude, could be slightly
exaggerated, due to the assumption on the part of most residents that the team were
there to negotiate individual compensation claims. It should be noted that they
represent gross, not net income (ref 4.5.9)
4.5.5     Infrastructure and Services
The communication network in the project area is poor, which limits the growth of the
small trading centres. None of the roads are tarmacked, and several are almost
impassable in places during the wet season. The Consultants noted that this situation
corstitutes a marked disincentive far the plot owners to grow fruit and vegetables for
the markets.



Of pmrtiar concern is the water situation The Sondu-Midu river Is the main source
of water for all purposes When there Is a shortage, residents walk to Lake Victoria to
collect water, a distance of up to 6 km. Part of the project area was provided with an
(incomplete) water supply system, but it appears to seldom operate.
There Is no electicty supply In the project area. The nearest point of power supply is
at Sondu. some 20 km from the proposed reservoir area.
There is no telephone service in the project area.
4.5.6     Education. Sanitation nd Health
The area is well provided with primary schools; attendance, as in Kenya generally, is
very high at almost 100%. Secondary schools. as is also typical in Konya are fewer.
there being five in the project area: The notable characteristic in respect of the
facilities in the project area is the poor access to some of the schools, and the
generally low standard of the faciities themselves, the exception being Thurdibuoro
School.
There are three health centres and a dispensary in the project area; by far the
commonest cause of morbidity is malaria. There is no Upblic sewage system in the
area; households have individual pit latrines. -
It should be noted that in the case of bilharzia the presence of the bilharzia snails
does not necessarily mean that the diseases is also present data on the out-patient
morbidity (Table 2.2) from Kisii. Klsumu and South Nyanza Districts suggests a low
incidence of the diseases in these Districts. However, although the morbidity statistics
indicate that bilharzia is not a significant disease in the project area, surveys shown
that the vector snail Biomohalari ofeifleri is present in Sondu River above the weir site
and this could transmit Schistosoma mansoni. Also present is Lmrnnaea natolensis
which is the intermediate host of the liver pamsite Fasciola hepati
The mosquito Anopheles cambia; is also present in the Project area as is a high
incidence of malaria.
The project area lies within a high HIV orevalence area, estimated to be well in excess
of the national level                and possibly considerably more. Some
parts of Nyanza Province Area reporting HIV infection rates of over 20%. The present
5 year plan for AIDS control in Kenya is focused principally on preventing the further
spread of the epidemic by getting individuals to make use of knowledge about AIDS
to change their behaviour
4.5.7     Community Acites
There is a general lack of community collaborfation in development projects in the
area: there is a marked absence of village-evel projects such as water schenes, roof
catchment, cattle dips etc. despite the long-standing nature of the community. An
atmosphere of some degree of mistrust of local officialdom was notable in the area of
the proposed discharge channel, altough the turn-out for the Consultants' public
meetings was very high, and was commented on by the Admiknltion officials.

4.5.8     Perceived Problems
Respondents were asked to name the three most pressing sodoeconomic problems.
The following table sets out the five issues most frequently raised, together with the
percentage of respondents mentioning each issue.

Soil Erosion                            66%                 76
Other problems were noted by a small number of people. such as lack of telephone,
livestock diseases and lack of electricity.
The difference in the response pattem between the two areas reflects:
(i)   The easier access which the reservoir area has to water;
(iji) The easier access which the discharge channel area has to the facilities on the
main road;
(iii) The soil erosion problems of the sloping land of the reservoir area-
4.5.9     Land Values
A detaled study of economic land values is beyond the scope of this stLdy.
However, as an indicator of likely compensation requirements and as a check on
declared income levels, It is a useful parameter to esfimate. The Consultants have
therefore carried out some basic calculations using data gathered during the survey:
i)    Economic Value
In the reservoir area, the typical value of crops which can be produced was
estimated above at around Shs 26,500/ha/ann. Allowing addItional Income
from livestock, the farmers' time and a transport cost component due to the
distance from the main road, then based on a 2 hectare plot, the estimnate of
effective net income per hectare is Shs 17,600/ha/ann. The NPV of the land
based on a 25 year period and a 20% discount rate Is Shs 87,078, which can
then be adopted as a rough estimate of land value to an owner-occupier
subsistence farmer.



14
In the discharge channel area there is only one wet season, and the land is
less fertile, so agncultuml production Is typically lower than in the reservoir
area. In this case the average annual net income is estimated at Shs
9,200/ha/ann, which yelds a NPV of Shs 45,518.
ii)    Nominal Market Value
Land in this area does not change hands very often. Nonetheless, from
speaking to property agents and officials in the area, the nominal market value
of the land is generally considered to be Shs 12,000 - 15,000 per acre in the
discharge channel area, and around Shs 20,000 - 25,000 per acre in the
reservoir area. In terms of hectares, this is equivalent to Shs 30.000 - 45,000
per hectare in the discharge channel area, and Shs 50,000 - 75,000 per
hectare in the reservoir area.
iii}   Summary
These results may be summarised as follows:
Location            Economic      Nominal Market
Value        Value-
(Shs/ha)     (Shsnha)
Dischavge Channel    45.518       30.000 - 45.000
Reservoir            87,078       50,000 - 75,000
These land value figures generally follow the pattem found elsewhere in Kenya,
that land values to owner-occupier subsistence farmers are somewhat higher
than typical market values. Government "guideline prices are not shown here.
but they are normally below nominal market prices.

5         BIOPHYSICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.        Kouta Forest
Some disturbance to the Koguta Forest is inevitable during the
construction of the surge tank but with care this impact can be
minimised. Material excavated during the construction of the surge tank
shaft, adis and headrace tunnel will have to be disposed of and the
Koguta Forest seems the most likely location for the dump. Permission
for dumping will doubtless be required from the Forestry Department.
Examination of the proposed location of the surge tank on large scale maps coupled
with field observation suggest that although the tank is sited within the official
boundary of the Koguta Forest few trees will be affected. The tank site area appears
to be already badly degraded and most of trees in the site are introduced softwood
varieties.
Perhaps less obvious. but more crucial. will be the impact of improved vehicular
access to the forest afforded to firewood collectors. loggers and charcoal bumers by
the access road. The probable extent or magnitude of this encroachment cannot be
assessed and it is uncertain how it can best be mitigated other than by closing the
road below the forest with a suitable barrier.
5,.2      Submerged Veqetation
The decay of submerged vegetation can lead to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.
and the release of plant nutrients into the water. The additional nutrients released into
the water can be a blessing, however, since they may stimulate plant and algal growth
in the reservoir which sLjtains some fish species: on the other hand too much
nutrient in the water may cause eutrophication and produce undesirable quantities
and species of algae or aquatic weeds which may then become a nuisance and
detrimental to potable water supply.
In the present context it seems that neither deoxygenation or eutrophication are likely
to occur in the reservoir to any great extent because the flow of water through the
reservoir will be sufficiently high to ensure that dilution. downstream transportation
and reoxygenation wil prevent such adverse conditions developing.
Submerged trees which remain standing in the reservoir can interfere with fishing by
snagging nets and entangling other fishing gears to the overall detriment of the
fishery: in contrmst such trees will simultaneously benefit the fishery by providing
refuge for the fish and fertilizing the water as described above.
In the long term, if trees are not removed, they will ultimately decay and may become
uprooted. They may then pose a hazard to the Project by blocking the intake
structure to the headrace tunnel with unpredictable but deleterious consequences.



16
5.3        Aau&c Weeds
Should free floating aquatic Weeds gain access to the upper reaches of the Sondu or
the reservoir conditions may or may not prove favourable dependir.g upon the extent
of water level fluctuations produced by peak power generation operitions. If
favourable condtions prevail in the weir, either species might develop nuisance
population levels especially In the drier months when river flow is insufficient to carry
them over the weir. At this time they would be washed out from the reservoir with the
compensation flow. Neither plant Is likely to cause significant operatlonal problems
by passing through the turbines. The quantitIes shredded are likely to be qulte small,
as the reservoir is a small run-of-the-river reservoir, not a storage reservoir.
Overall it seems unlikely that the development of aquatic weeds In the reservoir will
pose significant problems to the Project or become serious health hazards by
harbouring disease vectors such as snails or mosqultos. The potential Impact of
aquatic weeds on the Project is therefore assessed as insignificant and no design
features are required to mitigate the problem.
5.4        Fisheries
Fish tagging experiments are currently underway at the Sangoro Riverine Laboratory
but no recapture data are available at the time of Writiig. No fishery statistics are
available for the Sondu/Miriu river above the Odino Rgls so the importance of the
fishery cannot be assessed. However, it is considered that the falls effectively blocks
fish migration from Lake Victoria to the project site, so no additional impact from the
weir is expected.
So far as fishery in the reservoir is concemed, several of the fish species known to
inhabit the lower Sondu are known to have adapted successfully to conditions created
in the new reservoirs elsewhere in Kenya. These include the important food fishes
belonging to the 'tilapia' group, and the catfishes (Clariidaae). In the Sondu/Miriu
reservoir the possibility exists for the fishery to be further enhanced by artificial
stocking of the reservoir with fry produced at the Sangoro Rivenne Laboratory
What is uncertain in the present situation at the Sondu weir site is the natuJre anc teie
effects of the drawdown of water level which will occur in the reservoir Whetner me
fluctuating water level ;will stimulate or retard fish production and assist or hinder
fishing methods is unclear. However, since fishing in standing Oake) waters is
generally more efficient, easiet. and less dangerous, and the fish more plentiful than in
river fisheries, the reservoir fishery most likely wil provide an important and improved
local benefit.
The reservoir fishery wil also offer altemative employment for those ferry operators
made redundant by the pedestrian and vehicular crossing point afforded at the weir
site. Since several of the ferrymen are already part-time fishermen on Lake Victoria
they would not need to learn new skills. The number of fishermen that the new
fishery will be able to support will. however, be very few, perhaps only iwo to three at
mosL



17
5.5       WmLeQuU*v
Changes in water quality attributable to the implementation of the Project will be
minimal since this Is essentlally a water diverslon project with no long term storage of
water. Retention of water In the reservoir will be too short to allow 4ignlficant
alteration of water. Retention of water In the reservoir will be too short to allow
significant alteration of chemical, physical or biological parameters on a permanent
basis.
After closure of the welr the only Immediate long term Impact will be the reduction of
the suspended solids load in the river below the weir through sedimentation in the
weir, with concomitant decrease in turbidity. Since this sift will be returned to the river
below the weir during periods of high water discharge when turbidity is naturally very
high the Impact is unlikely to be detectable.
Some temporary changes in water qualty are to be expected during the Immediate
post-filling stage of the reservoir development when nutrients are leached from
Inundated vegetation and soils. The impact of nutrient release is not expected to lead
to serious or long lasting adverse effects on water quality. Similarly any
deoxygenation resulting from decay of inundated vegetation will be minimized by the
last flow of water through the reservoir.
Water quality may be degraded. however, by secondary consequences of project
implementation. For example should human settlement increase in the vicinity of the
reservoir chemical and biological contamination of the water is to be expected
especially if the reservoir is used for livestock watering and domestic ablutions. Water
in the outlet channels from the main powerhouse may be affected in the same way.
Pollution of the water by organic matter including livestock and human wastes is
highly probable with associated increase in water-bome disease.
5.6       EvapOration and Seeve_e
Since the surface area and capacity of the regulation pond are small (0.5 km2 and 1
million m3), water losses via evaporation and seepage are judged to be negligibie
comparing to the discharge of the Sondu river.
5.7       Lake Victoria
Even I an active agreement does exist concerning the use of water entering Lake
Victoria. the impact of the Project on water quality, volume and timing of water flows
will be negligible.
There will be no detectable adverse water quality effects on Lake Victoria or the River
Nile.
5.8       Cultural. Mineral and Fish Spawning Sites
Sections of the Act which relate to the Project are given verbatim in the Annex
attached to this section. Only the main points of the Act as they affect the project are
highlighted below:



18
1)    The Act is concemed only with sites and objects of interist which are already
known and have a protected status. Enquiries at the National Museum,
Department of Archaelogy (Dr lKriama), have not revealed indications that any
protected sites are located within the area to be effected by the Project.
2)    The Act does not contain any section instructing those development projects,
which have the potential to disrupt or destroy sites or objects of interest to
conduct ground surveys to establish the presence or absence of such objects
or sites as defined in the Act, prior to commencement of the Project.
3)    The Act does, however, lay down procedures in the event of the discovery of
such sites or objects by persons or groups of persons not officially engaged in
exploration for such sites and issued with the appropriate exploration licence.
These procedures are contained in section 8 (1) of the Act along with penalties
for infringement of the Act.
There are no known cultural sites or mineral resources which will be lost by
implementation of the project The relatively short section of the river which will be
converted from flowing to standing water is unlikely to contain unique fish spawning
sites. The inevitable loss of some spawning sites and reduction in fish production in
the river will be compensated by the creation of new sites within the impoundment
and the development of a small reservoir fishery. ;
5.9        Bird and Wildlife Habitats
The new reservoir with shoreline and drawdown floodplain zones will provide new
habitats for a wide variety of wildlife and especially birds which wil compensate for
habitat destroyed by inundation and the conversion of some 5 k0ometres of river from
running to standing water. Afforestation of the reservbir catchment for soil
conservation purposes would provide further habitat for birds and wildlife.
5.10      Construction Impacts
Identifiable impacts are soil erosion during the construction of the weir and its access
roads and those originating in the temporary construction camp which may include
water and soil pollution from the camp wastewaters outflows. These impacts will be
temporary and can be mitigated by conventional preventive measures.
5.11      Reduced Silt Load
The construction of the weir wil inevitably influence the silt load carried by the Sondu-
Miriu but since most of the silt collected by the desilting basins will be retumed to the
river below the weir during the periods of high discharge the loss of silt to the system
below the weir will be minimal.
A reduction in current velocity and discharge volume due to water abstraction, might
lessen the carrying capacity of the river, and more silt may be deposited in the lower
Sondu-Miriu before it reaches the delta region. Some slight erosion of the outer
perimeter of the delta by wave action from the lake may therefore result However,
these effects are expected to be very minimal.



19
5.12      Hvdro0"i
Forty (40) cubic metres of water per second will be abstracted at the Sondu/Miriu
weir for power generation for a period of eight day-time hours each day. For the
remaining 16 hours the river inflow will either refDi the reservoir or spill into the River
Sondu below the weir.
The abstraction and diversion of this volume of water (1 .1 x 1Omn9/day) is unlikely to
be a major problem for much of the year when the mean monthly discharge of the
river greatly exceeds 40m0 /sec or 3.46 x 106/day. Only during February and
possibly January and March the daily demand for water generation will exceed the
daily flow, and at this time draw down from the Sondu reservoir could be used to
supply the compensation flow. At this time a flow will be produced in the river below
the weir.
The Water Act does not give an explicit guidance to determine the amount of river
maintenance flow, indicating that the MOWD is responsible to monitor the appropriate
allocation of river maintenance flow, when water diversion schemes are planned.
According to MOWD. the standard criteria to determine. the amount of river
maintenance flow is based on the following three-categories:
1)   To guarantee the amount of existing water absiraction rights of the
downstream reaches,
2)  .In addition to (1). to release water for the domestic use of riparians, the
amount of which is equivalent to 95% dependability discharge in the river flow
duration curve.
3)   In addition to (1) and (2). to release 30% of the amount of (2) for aquatic lives.
In case of SondufMiriu Hydropower Project, the amount of river maintenance flow
becomes 5.43mJ /s for (3).
The areates. effect of abstraction will be experienced when the volume diverted to the
powerhouse represents a large portion of, or exceeds the total discharge; at such
times the tuming on and off of the 40nr /sec wAll be noticeable and produce a pulsed
flow in the river below the weir and outlet channel of the rmain powerstation.
A possible adverse impact of reduced dry weather flow lies in the fact that at this time
the several river channels through the delta region wil contain insufficient water for
the velocity to prevent growth of scrub and bush within the channels. If this growth is
not cleared before the river rises during the rainy season this vegetation will
encourage flooding. This is already happening to a certain extent and blocking of the
channels is now blamed for the recent (April 1990) very extensive flooding in the
delta. In the past, such clearance was performed manually each year but this
practice has now been discontinued.
The volume of compensation water discharged from the weir is expected to be
sufficient to adequately provide for all domestic water use demand during all seasons,
and provide a surplus to properly dilute and disperse pollutants and to help maintain
open river channels through the delta as a flood amelioration mechanism.



20
Aeratin of the water through the spillway or through the cornpensation water channel
(if suitably designed) will be beneficial in maintaining a high level of dissolved oxygen
in the river below the weir. This wil boost the self-cleansing capacity of the river and
its ability to combat the deoxygenating effects of organic pollution which may result
for communities and livestock livng in the catchment above and below the reservoir.

6    SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT
6.1       Agricultural and Residential Plots
Socioeconomic impact studies were carried out to identity the extent of the expected
impact in the project sections of most concem: the reservoir access road and
discharge channel. Similar findings may be assumed to relate to the Work Camp
area In the case of the power station, the issues conceming Thurdibuoro Secondary
School are covered in Section -
The definition of a direcrly affecred plot is one which will lose some part of its area to
the land acquisition shown in the mnaps of the discharge channel and the
reservoir/access road.
Every household which was available and wiling to be interviewed was met either in
personal or group meetings.
Those who were not interviewed fell into one of the following categories:
(i)   Those who were not available in the locality:
(ii)   Those who were in the locality but who could not be traced (eg at a funeral);
Ciii) Those who do not dwell on the plot, but own it as an absentee farmer (in some
cases the Consultants were nonetheless able to interview a worker);
The number of directly affected plots is as follows:
Discharge channel:                             76
Reservoir & Access Road:                      115
TOTAL                                         191 plots
Of the 191 directly affected plots. 100% (191) were covered by physical inspection.
noting key features. In total. 214 plot owners or their representatives were interviewed
153 of these were plots directly intersected by the proposed development The
balance of 61 plots were adjacent. nearby or otherwise indirectly affected. or were in
a position to substitute for the owner of a directly affected plot for purposes of the
survey.
The popu!ation density in the project area is high, at 400-500 people per sq km. and
all the land taken up by the project constructions is utilised by farmners With 193
directly affected plots, and with a typical household size of 9 persons, this means a
directly affected population of around 1.700 people.



22
-6.1.1    LIand Loss
Not all of the plots are seriously affected in terms of land loss. In the discharge
channel area, the breakdown is as follows:
% Loss       <25%    25-49%      50-74%       75-99%        100%  Total
No of Plots  47       11         10           3             5      76
In the reservoir and access road area. the breakdown is as follows:
% Loss       < 25%    25493%     50-74%       75-99%        100%  Total
No of Plots  67       18         6            2             22    115
The total affected plots is then as follows:
% Loss       <25%    2549%       50-74%       75-99%        100%  Total
No of Plots  114      29         16         _               27    191
6.1.2     Buildings Affected                           -
Land loss is not the only direct impact Some plots have buildings (houses) which will
have to be demolished. either because they are standing partly or wholly within
proposed project structures. or they are so close as to make their use impractical:
Reservoir Area-      24 plots. containing 22 permanent and 22 temporary
houses.
Discharge Channel Area: 20 plots, containing 30 perrnanent and 40 temporary
houses.
6.1.3     Bisected Plots
32 plots will be bisected by the discharge channel. of whiCh 1E woulc "nave s__s ar.ta
pieces on either side. rendering them very difficult to utilise.
6.1.4     Access Affected
20 of the direct impact plots will also be cut off from direct access to the river for their
livestock, for which the proposed bridges will be necessary.
6.1.5     Crops Affected
Since all of the plots are used for agricultural purposes. the entire area is liable to
support crops, depending on the rotation system employed. and the time of year. At
the time of the survey, some planting was going in the Discharge Channel area. It is
not possible to state what specific crops will be in place at a point in the future when
the project commences. since there are virtually no permanent crops in the area. This
can be assessed at the time of the land acquisition. From the data presently
available, the Consultants have assessed typical production levels for a typical mix of
crops for the plots concemed. The value of this typical annual crop production is Shs
26,500/ha in the case of the reservoir area, and Shs 16,800/ha in the case of the
discharge channel area.



23
6.2       Other negative imnacts
Other expected negative impacts perceived by the local people are:
6.2.1     Loss of earnings for the ferry owners as a result of the proposed bridge over the
weir
There are 12 households operating the Ferry, which, according to the owners. earns a
gross income of Shs 159.000 CUSS 2.000) per year. Taking into account the value of
labour and maintenance costs. it is estimated that each family has an average net
income from the business of Shs 552 per month. The NPV of this net income stream
over a 25 year period at 25% is Shs 32,778 for each of the concemed families.
6.2.2     Interference with access, by the discharge channel
24%a of the respondents in the discharge channel area mentioned this problem. It will.
however. be largely resolved by the incorporation of several bridge3 as part of the
discharge channel construction.
6.2.3     Danger posed to children and livestock by the discharge channel, which the
residents had been led to believe would be undergrdund.
5016 of the respondems in the discharge channel arqa mentioned this problem. which
arises because there is private land on both sides of the discharge channel. The only
solution would appear to be to fence the sides. to align it as close to the forest as
possible, and to wam the residents of surges in volume.
Another safety issue. not mentioned by the residents. is that although fishing in the
reservoir should be safer than traditioa3 river fishing. and also more efficient and
productive. a potential dainger exists of boats and fishermen being swept over the
weir during periods of high discharge.
The anticipated fluctuation in water level in the Sondu intake reservoir caused by the
daily variation in discharges will also produce some minor negative impact on public
safety.
Between the weir and the discharge into the river. the water level in the nver wil fall
as power generation commences and nse again when it ceases at about 8.00 pm
Thus in this section the danger as the weir rises occurs at a time when few people will
be at risk along the river and the hazard is therefore less.
A similar slight hazard exists in the section of the river. in the delta region below the
out-fall of the additional power station. This is because the fluctuation of the river flow
will begin in these sections in mid-aftemoon (about 3.00 pmn) when the local residents
will me making use of the river and they may be caught in the river when the surge
comes. This fluctuation of the river flow w1l continue until the evening (about 10.00
pm).



24
6.2.4     The division of land into two parcels
30% of respondents in the discharge channel area mentioned tNi problem. The
extent to which it tdnders the plots impractical to farm will depend on the number and
positioning of the bridges. However, even wth bridges provided, the bisection will still
be a problem for most of the plot owners, particularly as almost all of the plots in the
discharge channel area are residential.
6.2.5     Health Issues: Water-borne Diseases
Several of the respondents in the reservoir area expressed concem about malaria.
This topic came up in group meetings, where it was not appropriate to have a 'show
of hands'" so no percentage figure can be attached to the response. The provision of
standing water to which people and their livestock have access does generally
increase the incidence of water-bome infective diseases and also water related insect
vector diseases. However. the probabirity is that because of the fluctuating water
level which will be produced by the intermittent abstraction of water for power
generation combined with the short residence time of water in the reservoir.
conditions in the reservoir wll not be particularly conductive to the establishment of
water-based or water-related vector species. Any increase in the exposure to health
hazards due to the Project is assessed as of minor significance and no design inputs
are required to mitigate such problems.
Changes in water level are. in fact recognised and recommended as a semi-effective
management technique for the control of the snail vectors involved in the transmission
of bilharzia. It is less cear what effect changing water level would have on other
vectors especially mosquito larvae. As noted above the very swift passage of water
through the reservoir (about a 6 hour renewal time) will mitigate potential disease
problems by flushing out pathogens and vectors.
Some water wil flow permanently through the weir in al but the driest periods of the
year and this could create suitable habitat for the larvae of the fly Simulium which is
the insect vector for the eye disease onchocerciasis. This disease is not however.
wvdely spread nor common in Kenya and is therefore. not regarded as a serious
problem although Simulium is known to occur in the Upper Sondu Miriu River In the
outpatient morbidity statistics tor Kisumu. Kisii and South Nyanza Districts
onchocerciasis is not listed but since total of many different eye diseases in general
varies in incidence from 2 to 2.9% the portion of the total caused by onchocerciasis is
by inference judged to be extremely low.
In relation to the Sondu/Minu Project the adverse impact of the Project on promoting
river-blindness is considered to be very low and no engineering design is required to
mitigate this potential.
6.2.6     Possible Denial of Access to the Reservoir
This concern was raised by people in the reservoir area, who regularly draw water or
take livestock to the river banks. It is understood that access Aill not be prohibited.



25
6.2.7     Impact of Immigrant Workers
Some residents in the reservoir area expressed concern about possible importation of
disease. crime and unacceptable cultural habits into the area. It is also likely that
these wil be significant permanent increase in population, for which social services.
such as medical, need to be provided.
6.2.8     Sand Mining Business
No residents mentioned this issue. As far as can be established, very litte sand
mining takes place in Sondu/Miriu river because the sediments deposited in the lower
reaches contain high proportions of fine silt and mud which miakes it unsuitable for
construction work Also, the Sondu/Miriu is usually too deep and fast flowing even in
the dry season for the sand to be extracted either safely or economically.
Sand mining is thus generally confined to the srnaller temporary stream channel to
the north of the Sondu where better quality, mud free and drier sand be mined.
Although limited sand mining is carried out in the vicinity of Nyakwere Bridge the
scale of the operations is so small that impacts of the project are assessed as
negligible.
6.2.9     Quarries. Borrow Pits and Waste Dumps
No residents mentioned in this issue. Quarries, borrow pis and waste dumps are
potentially hazardous sites from a public health and safety point of view. Quarries
and borrow pits should be left in a safe condition to avoid physical injury and also
provided with adequate drainage to prevent the formation of stagnant pools which
can become foci for water-related diseases.
Of particular concem will be the evacuation of ardund 130.000mr of bedrock from the
head race tunnel.
6.2.10    Thurdibuoro Secondary School
The construction of the powerhouse and its associated structures. including the
tailrace. the irrigation canal junction and the outdoor switchyard will require the
acquisition of approximately 2.5 hectares of land. The site selected partially covers
the area presenly occupied by the Thurdibuoro Secondary School. The powerhouse
residential compound will require another 8 hectares located to the northeast of the
powerhouse site.
Although the site for the main powerhouse does not directly affect the existing school
buildings these buildings will become unusable because of their very close proximity
to the powerhouse and because the school wodld be deprived of its playing fields.
The secondary school will therefore have to be abandoned and re-built elsewhere. As
a consequence of relocation, existing school staff housing will become redundant and
also require replacement. It is understood that this matter has already been
addressed by KPC. and is not examined further here.
This school which is variously called Thurdibuoro or Bogoa school is a secondary
mbeed day school for 200 - 250 pupils; It was founded by the former local Member of
Parliameit, Mr Odiek Miguda. who is now Chairman of the Board of Govemors. The
school is a govemment school with substantial local harambee supporL



26
Much of the present school is of very recent construction: a govemment sponsored
laboratory is in the final stages construction and is already in use and a new four
classroom harambee block was commissioned at the beginning of 1990. The rest of
the school although older is well maintained and in good repair; puantities of books
and laboratory apparatus were in evidence. This is not a run-down ramshackle
upcountry school but a quality school in which the local community have invested
heavily and for which they feel considerable, and justfiable pride.
In addition to the main schod buildings the site also contains housing for the head
deputy headmaster and two or three other buildings. One of these is a self-catering
dormitory block for any students who wish to board.
According to local sources. there may be resentment and possible resistance to the
suggestion that the school should be relocated elsewhere. even in a better site school
is provided to replace the existing buildings.
Clanism in this area is strong and since this is a Koguta clan school it should remain
in the dan territory and even within the right sub-can location: it could not easily go
to Sangoro. for example. even though it is also Koguta land because this would place
the school in another sub-lans territory.
It is believed that the local clan will lose considerable fface' or prestige if the school is
summanly demolished and moved elsewhere and forahis reason alone they may
resent any efforts to relocate the school. It should arso be realised that although this
is actually a govemment school the local clan are said to regard it as their own since
they have contributed so much to its recent progress. development and success.
However, in the Chiefs opinion the local support and eagemess for the Project was
such that they would accept the removal of the school. should this prove necessary
and unavoidable. especially if it were not moved too far. He also affirmed that
because the school is a govemment school the Board of Govemors would. in any
case. abide by any govemment decision regarding its future
6.2. 11    AIDS
As mentioned in Section 4.5.6 the project is within a high HIV prevalence area The
impact of immigrant labour could be to spread the virus further afield rather than to
bring it into the area, by unsafe sexual practices. There is no policy in Kenya of
mandatory HIV testing. and since contract employees come under the jurisdiction of
the contractor, and not KPC. it will not be possible to institute mandatory testing. In
any case, the contractor would not have AIDS counselling facilities available.



27
6.3       Positive imoacts
The positive impacts are expected to be:
6.3.1     The jobs created by the construction of the project
The labour cost of the project construction was estimated to be USS 10 million.
equivalent to Shs 255 m0llion in March 1991, which was calculated by taking a
percentage of construction costs, translated into local currency @ Shs3o=USS 1.00
The rate is now Shs8O=USS1.00. The assumption is that the number of labourers will
remain unchanged. This would suggest an increase of 167% in the Kenya shilling
rates, which is considered to be unrealistically high. An increase of 100% over the
former (1991) rates is provided for, to apply to the four year construction period
without further inflation.
883 slilled labour @ Shs 400/day, or Shs 1 20.000/ann. totalling Shs 106 million
402 unskilled labour @ Shs 220/day. or Shs 66.000/ann. totalling Shs 26 million
(The rates include social costs)
It is expected that the unskilled labour will come largdy or wholly from the project
area. and the skilled labourers wil be migrants from other areas. Thus the impact on
the project area in terms of employment opportunity will be 402 unskilled jobs for an
average duration of four years. It is estimated that there are around 325 regular wage
eamers in the project area. This means that for four years. the job opportunities for
local people wiDl be doubled by the introduction of the Sondu-Miriu project
6.3.2     The boost to the local economy
With around 6.500 plot/households in the project area. eaming on average around
Shs 60.000 per annum per family. (cash eamings and value of agricultural production
combined). the gross earnings in the project area are of the order of Shs 390 million
per annum. of which Shs 109 million. or 28%. is estimated to be cash eamings. The
additional locally spent earnings by the immigrant labour force combined with the
total eamings of the local component of the labour force will total Shs 58
milion/annum, represent a 15% increase in the local economy,
Locally spent money is expected to totail to Shs 48 million in a cash economy of Shs
109 million. an increase of 44%. Thus the multiplier effect for local trading and small
business sector wil be very high.
6.3.3     The improvement to the road network
The road improvement will have the greatest impact on the residents of the reservoir
area. who presently have dfficulty in marketing their produce. which is a disincentive
to grow cash crops. It is estimated that there could be a marked increase in
productivity of the reservoir plots as a result of road improvements; judging from their
inspection of the plots and the discussions with the plot owners. the increase could
be of the order of 50 to 100%. This food would be sold largely to the conract workers
during the construction period. so is included in the figures above. A permanent
increase in productivity would depend on the standard of maintenance of the
improved road after completion of the project

6.4       Reidents' attitudes and resoonses
6A.1      General
The attitude of the residents towards the project is very positive, as evidenced by the
high tur-out at the public meetings convened by the Consultants, the responses
given during the interviews and the degree of cooperation by local administration
officials. The residents were very keen to be involved in project implementation and in
discussion of mitigating measures and compensation issues. In general, the residents
see the project as a long-awaited boost to the development of the area, and have
high expectations of the ultimate impact particularly in providing job opportunities and
irrigation, which they had been led to believe would be a key component of the
project
The Consultants had to explain that the first phase of the project, as presently
designed, would not include an irrigation component Nonetheless, the residents were
stll generally positive in their attitude, although disappointed that the expected benefit
of irrigation would not be immediately available.
Throughout the survey, it was found that the local residents expected to be able to
abstract water from the discharge channel.
6.4.2     Relocation                                  a
The residents in the reservoir area are united in a common view, that relocation is
acceptable, if absolutely necessary, on two conditions:
-    That compensation is adequate to actually buy alternative land;
-    That the relocation will be to a site within the general locality of the project
area.
95% of the respondents agreed with this viewpoint. 6% stated that relocation would
be unconditionally unacceptable. and requested realignment of the project
development in the event that their plot is seriously jeopardised.
However, in the discharge channel area, ondy 40% of the respondents agreed with this
view point: 32% stated that they were not opposed to relocation in principle, but that
they doubted whether land would be available. The remaining 28% were against
relocation, and appealed for realignment of the channel. or exemption on the grounds
tht the owner was widowed, etc.
6.4.3     Land Acquisition
Residents' attitude to the question of land acquisition (ie where the majority of the plot
is unaffected) is that it is quite acceptable. provided the compensation is adequate.
(99% for the Reservoir area; 80% for the Discharge Channel area.)
6.4.4     Mode of Compensation
The discussion with the residents dwelt at some length on the mode of compensation
preferred. The majority would prefer cash compensation for land lost the
compensaton to take into account the following:



28
6.3.4     The bridge over the weir
This would be a permanent improvement for residents south of the reservoir as it
would reduce their transport costs of taking their produce to mafret - le. they would
not have to pay for the ferry. This would mean that they would have a slighlfy higher
gross margin on their produce. thereby Increasing thelr effective Income. The Impact
on the total project economy is, however, too small to be significant.
Positive impacts perceived by the residents but whieh may not necessarily be
realistic were:
6.3.5     Use of dam water for irrigation (53% for Reservoir area; 64% for D.Channel
area)
6.3.6     Fish farming (18% for Reservoir area; 10% for D.Channel area)
6.3.7     Introduction of a potable water scheme (17% for Reservoir area; 54% for
D.Channel area)
This benefit would arise only if it is specifically provide.
6.3.8     Introduction of electricity to project area (negligible for Reservoir area: 12% for
D.Channel area)                             iF
In fact there will be no provision of electricity for the local residents. within the project
6.3.9     Improved Facilities
The introduction of the large labour camp will require new facilities such as a clinic.
which is likely to remain after construction has been completed.

(I)   Land ferdity
(IE)   Scarcity of alternative land
(ii)   Developments on the land
(lv)  The resultant social disruption
The percentages giving this response were as follows:
Reservoir area:       94%
Discharge channel:    72%
It will be noted that In the case of the discharge channel area. this response was not
unanimous. In fact 22% of the respondents requested 'land for land'.
Only 6% of the reservoir area residents and only 2% of the discharge channel area
residents suggested development assistance as a component of the compensation
package.



33
Recommendaton (A):
The discharge channel should be reetigned to pass along the
common boundary of the plots in the area, as far as possrDle, to
minimise the number of bisected plots. There should then be a
land redistributon exercise carried out jointly with the residents
and the local authorites to rearrange the plots so that adjacent
bisected halt-plots can be recombined to provide a whole plot on
one side of the channel.
Recommendatfon (SJ:
The projecr contains several spoil banks, which are responsible
for the loss of several plots or part-plots. The possibility should be
inves.igated of reducing this impact by dispensing with spoil .
banks as far as possible. This will involve ascerraining wih the
local residents an appropriate and economic location to deposit
the materiaL.
Recommendatian (CJ:
Remaining parts of plots owned by relocated households can be resold
to households which have losr pieces for whicfl they have accepred
cash compensation.
The loss of a house is not regarded in itseff as a qualification for relocation.
The loss of income-eaming agricultural land is the critical issue, not the loss
of e house, which can be relaively easily replaced.
8.3       Compensation
The term 'compensation" is used here to mean payment of cash to plot owners who
wil lose less than 50% of their plot.
Recommendation ViJ
in cases where less than half the plot is lost, cash compensarion
should be made available, at not less than the suggested
economic value of Jand, and not less Man the market price
prevailing at the time of project construcrion.
111 plots wll lose up to 25% of their area: 36 will lose 2549%. The majority of the first
category plot owners will be happy to receive cash compensation. and stay where
they are. However. those of the remaining 36 plot owners who wil lose more of their
plot and who are in the discharge channel area are worried about the availability of
land. because plots in this particular area seldom come onto the market, and because
of the lower quality of the land, the loss of even part of the plot is serious for the
owner. In practice it may be possible to get the owners to accept cash as
compensation, but without a viable piece of land, the money may soon be spent. and
the family become destitute. Adoption of Recommendation (B) regarding spoil banks
and Recommendation (C) regarding sale of remaining pieces to owners seeking
replacement of small pieces of land will go some way to addressing this category, but
there will be some for whom relocation wil be a better option.



32
8.    MITIGATING MEASURES
8.1       Local Attiudes
The information gathered by the Consultants was collected in meetings conducted in
line with the referenced W'rid Bank Operating Directives. in which the residents were
encouraged to express their views and concems regarding the planned projects. The
overall reaction is definitely positive. They want the project, as soon as possible.
There are, however, some issues to be bome in mind in planning the land acquisition
prngramme:
-    In line with the World Bank Operating Directives, and consistent with good
environmental management
Invoiuntary settlement must be minimised:
Displaced people must be able to at least restore their former living
standard;
-    The residents are. in general, determined to stay-in the area. in expectation of
the benefits which the project is expected to bring. and particularly the next
phase, which is expected to incorporate an imgriation component
-    The amount of land in the area likely to be available on the open market will be
quite limited, especially if the local people anticipate an increase in value of
their plots as a result of the project.
-    There are a number of anticipated negative impacts which will need to be
addressed.
8.2       Relocation
191 plots will lose some land to the reservoir, access road and discharge channel.
From ,he discussions with the plot owners. it became clear that plots losing 50% or
more of the land would be regarded as totally lost. and the owners would expect to
be able to be provided with a replacement plot or the money to acquire one. In other
words. a land for land' arrangernent would be exoected. It may at first appear that for
the very small plots, even a small loss might render it uneconomic. However, the very
small plots. which are found in the reservoir area. are in any case too small for
household subsistence purposes. ie the owners usually are not living on the plot. 46
of the households wil lose 50% or more of their plot, and are therefore to be
regarded as potential relocation cases. Of these, 27 will be totally inundated or
acquired. In addition. 18 plots will be bisected by the discharge channel. There is
scope for a few plots to be bought privately in the reservoir area from households
Irmng elsewhere. However, the free market in the project area is unlikely to provide
plots to meet the needs of more than 60 households aWl at the same time, particularly
if the other project sections all create a similar number of displaced households. It is
therefore recommended that the problem be reduced by the following measures:



35
8.6       Domestic Water SuDDlV
Recommendation (GJ:
i                              in view of the expectations of the residents in terms of an
irrigation component, and in view of the problems which wiO
inevitably arise from people entering the discharge channel to
abstract water, a community water scheme for drinking water,
livestock and possibly kitchen gardens should be estblished for
the area between the forest and the main road. The Minist,y of
Water Development or an NGO should be approached to design a
simple gravity scheme which can be managed by the communify
organisation mentioned above.
8.7       Ferry Operations Comoensation
Recommendaidon IHI:
ff there is to be a bridge over the weir, the terry operators should each
be compensated wiM a sum of money equal to the NPV of their
expected earnings, to enable them to set up an'altemative small
business.
8.8       Safety
Recommendation (I:
Special attention should be paid to the adequacy of the proposed
fencing of the sides of the discharge channel, and to the issuing of
waamings about flucruaing warer levels
8.9      Institutional Arrangements
Recommendation (JJ:
With the assistance of the NGO, the community organisation should be
approached to discuss and agree wth the community the following:
-     A code of conduct for residents regarding access, abstaction and
fouling of the reservoir;
-     A code of conduct regarding management of the labour
camp, including fencing.
-     The positioning of the bridges over the Discharge Channel
-     Advice to the community on minimising the risk of
exposure to malaria;
-     Advice to the communiy regarding the present and future
possibilites of
-     Use of the Work Carnp Clinic



34
There wil be some marginal cases where the loss of even 20-25% of the plot will
make the household's agricultural production insufficient for subsistence purposes. A
few of the discharge channel households are likely to fall into this category. Such
cases may have to be categorised as relocation cases, but in must instances the
attraction of the project area for the four years of construction wil encourage the
owners to request cash compensation, and stay where they are. possibly starting a
small business or buying a piece of land outside the project area with the money
received.
The loss of a building. comes into this 'compensation' category. In all, there are 114
houses directly affected for which compensation will be required. on 44 plots.
Implementation of the recommendations on spoil banks will reduce this number
significanely
8.4       Availability of Land
It is expected that by adopting the recommendations above. the number of
households for whicn new plots will need to be found will fall from around 50 to
around 30. However. given that an additional number w11 be associated with other
project sections such as the penstock etc. this reauirerjient may be too great to be
met by the open market. During the survey. the Consuftants did not come across
additional land within the project area available for-acquisition as subsistence plots.
The following recommendation is therefore made: "
Recommendation (fi:
The Minisry of Lands and the District Develooment Commirtee
should be aDDroached ro study the possibility of making available
new land adjacent to or near the project area to accommodare
relocated families.
8.5       Institutional Arrangemefts
The Consultants noted that there is lite track record of communit 1evetoc'eT
activites in the area. a high degree of clan loyalty and some degree o! rrn,S:
local administration officials. Based on this. and on recuests mace cunn; :-e
meetings with householders. and in view of the recommendation beiov reca-ctn; a
water scheme. the following recommendation is made:
RecommendatFin (F):
For purposes of arranging and negotiating compensation, land
redistibution and other mitigating measures such as the
positioning of bridges etc. an NGO should be approached to
assist the communiry to set up a community organisation, and to
assist the cornmuniry in planning and liaising with KPC. Since
there are no NGO's operating in the area, a national NGO such as
Acton Aid is recommended. The Consultants consider that the
establishment of satisfactory institutonal arrangements is the
single most important factor in resolvng any potential negative
impacts.



37
8.15     Heeth
RGecommendation (PJ:
During the construction stage the greatest imoact is fikely to occur in the
workers construction camp where large numbers of people wi7l be crowded
together. Hlere preventatve prophylactic treatment should be provided in
conjuction with spraying of hostels with persistent insecticides. Immigrant
workers should also be provided with mosquito nets
All immigrants to the area who work on the prohylactc drugs to protect them
from malaria which is holoendemic (vey severe) in the Sondu area. In
addi2ion, since the Anopheles mosquito which transmits malaria in the project
area bites mainly at the night the provision and use of mosquito nets ar night
would help to significantly reduce the spread of this disease among those
who have no natural immunity.
The base camp manager should also ensure that suitable breeding sires for
mosquitoes in the base camp and its immediate surroundings are eliminated.
it is considered essential that these camps are-provided with adequare
sanitation and water supplies to prevent the outbreaks of communicable
diseases among the construction workers. Th;ese facilities need to provide
not only for the officials camp residents but also for the camp followers.
Post-construction impacts on health in the project area are likely to be minimal
but any water retaining features such as borrow pits, quarries, blocked drains
or culverts should be drained or filed in to reduce al small unnecessary
water bodies to a minimum.
As mentioned in 6-2.11. contract employees come under the jurisdiction of the
contractor. not KPC. and do not fall within any legal instruments for mandatory testing
for HIV. Given the policies set out in the National Aids Control Programme of Kenya.
and mainly discussed AIDS in the context of the Sondu/Miriu project with officials at
the National Aids Control Programme. consultants consider that an AIDS education
and information programme wil be most appropriate.
Recommendeaton QiJ:
It is recommended that an AIDS education and information programme for the
project construction period be estblished by joint agreement between the
National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), the District Intersectoral AIDS
Committee (DIAC) for Kisumu District the NGO assisting with community
issues and the work camp management Advice and material can be made
available by the NACP under the second 5-year medium term plar for AIDS
control, 1992 - 1996.



36
- Irrigation
-     Fish farming
-     Electrification
It is considered that by providing the planned bridges. the inconvenience of the
discharge channel in interfering with access to the lake will be more than
compensated for by the benefits of the road improvements and the multiplier effect of
the introduction of 400 jobs into the area
8.10      Koquta Forest
Recomraendation (K):
The surge tank access road will allow easier access to the forest for wood
cutters and collectors with possible adverse effects as well as being a direct
impact in its own right By foliowing existing paths and tracks this impact can
be minimised. The area of the forest affected by tMe surge rank is already in
poor condition and some efforts to reforest the area would be beneficiaL To
reduce these effects a barrier across the road to prevent vehicular access is
recommended.
8.11      Submerged Vecetation
Recommendation (Li:
Vegetation which would decay underwater should be removed, and salvaged
where ,ossible for timber for resale or firewood.
8.12      Dumping of Waste Material
Recommendation (MI:
Waste materials should be disposed of in an environmentally and socially
acceptable manner with due regard for saterv and aestMetics. Any dumDpng in
the Kogura Forest will require Forestry Department approvaL
8.13      Aauatic Weeds
Recommandation (1)1:
Should free-floating aquatic weeds be found in the reseroir the indivdual
plants should be destroyed before they have time to establish the substantial
populations. Mechanical or manual removal of Pisia would be possible While
chemical means might have to be employed for Azolla.
8.14      Rehabilitation
Recommendation (OJ:
After construction. and spreading of overburden, etc those areas of forest
wohich have been damaaed should be rehabilitated and reDlanted.

9         MONITORING
The expected impacts of the Sondu-Miriu project are not such as to require an
extensie monitoring programme. The principal areas to be covered are:
i)    Social
Monitoring of the outcome of relocation cases, for a period not exceeding five
years, consisting of annual checks, leading to corrective action i necessary.
The most important check will the first in liaison with the NGO concerned, to
give assistance if necessary in the purchase of altemative land if this has been
a problem.
iil   Biophysical
Water quality samples at the reservoir and the outfall of the discharge channel,
and liaison with the local fisheries research station on fish spawning and
migration though the small discharge channels, and changes in migration
pattem upstream of the weir.
