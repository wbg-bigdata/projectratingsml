SUMMARY
1. This Restructuring Paper introduces changes to the above-mentioned project, which
include: (i) an extension of the Closing Date from December 30, 2011 to June 15, 2012;
(ii) an amendment of the description of Component 3; and (iii) the adjustment of targets
of two indicators. The proposed changes are necessary to enable the project to reach its
objective and ensure the completion of remaining activities.

PROJECT STATUS

2. The most notable achievements of the project are in the areas of equitable access to
education: (i) Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) rose from 93 percent in 2005/06 to 110.6
percent in 2009/10 for primary education; and (ii) the percentage of female students
increased from 44.4 percent in 2005/06 to 46.3 percent in 2009/10. This expansion has
been supported by the construction of classrooms and latrines and should also help
achieve the end-of-project targets of 112 percent GER and 47.5 percent of female
students.

3. Despite these positive developments, primary education completion rates, repetition
and drop-out rates did not register the same improvements. Primary Education
Completion Rates (PCR), for instance, declined slightly from 65 percent in 2005/06 to 64
percent in 2009/10 (compared to the targeted 72 percent) but girls’ PCR increased from
54.3 percent in 2005/06 to 57.3 percent in 2009/10. The reason for this overall decline
can be explained in part by the rapid increase in enrollments but also by the persistent
high repetition and dropout rates. The dropout rate was particularly high in Grades 1 and
6 (superior to 19 percent) compared to 4.9 percent and 7.6 percent in the other grades.
The Grade 6 rate seems to be due to poor performance in the primary education exam,
while Grade 1 rate points to the lack of teachers and poverty of some parents as the main
reasons.

4. To counter these trends described under para. 7, the government implemented a
school feeding program in the poorest areas, recruited additional qualified teachers,
provided intensive in-service teacher training, increased inspectors and education
advisors visits to teachers, and increased the supply of textbooks.

5. Implementation Progress (IP) is rated Satisfactory, progress towards achieving the
project development objectives (PDO) Moderately Satisfactory, and the objectives of the
project remain achievable, if the project is granted an extension. Project implementation
is in compliance with the covenants in the Grant Agreement and implementation entities
are compliant with the Bank’s financial management requirements.


                                           4
6. The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.10 paragraph 3 on Closing Dates,
namely that (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of
the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory and (iii) the
Recipient prepares a specific action plan acceptable to IDA to complete the remaining
activities under the project. Project implementation is in compliance with the covenants
in the Grant Agreement, and implementation entities are compliant with the Bank’s
financial management requirements. There are no outstanding audit reports or interim
financial reports from these entities and no irregularities have been found.

PROPOSED CHANGES

7. As mentioned above, the Restructuring Paper proposes to extend the closing date,
amend the description of Component 3, and modify two indicators which will not be fully
met by the end of the project:

8. Extension of the closing date: The proposed extension would allow the project to
complete the following activities, which are crucial to the full attainment of the PDO: (i)
construction of schools, latrines and literacy centers that experienced delays due to heavy
rain, affecting the number of project beneficiaries and percentage of females; (ii) literacy
activities for which the signing of the contracts with some NGOs is finally underway,
affecting the number of people to pass an initial or post-literacy training; (iii) teacher
training, affecting the number of additional qualified teachers; and (iv) the establishment
of a computerized framework for a subsequent full Information Management System.

Components

9. Changes to Component 3: Given the upcoming closing date and the prospect of
another Global Partnership for Education (formerly EFA-FTI) grant, the team proposes to
modify the following activities under Component 3: (i) excluding from the current project
the external evaluation of the efficacy of certain pedagogical interventions; and (ii)
reducing the number of activities related to the setting up of the entire Information
Management System (IMS) to those which can be realistically achieved within the
extension period, namely the putting in place of a computerized framework.

10. The decision to exclude from the current project the external evaluation of the
efficacy of certain pedagogical interventions (in-service training for teachers,
reinforcement of the inspectorates and learning material to school) was taken because the
remaining time would not permit for a meaningful assessment. Some of these key
interventions only started being implemented in April 2011, so progress should be
measured as part of the new project which is under preparation. The new operation is
expected to be financed by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) but the
preparatory process is still in its very early stages and no details have been discussed.
However, delivery of the new operation is expected for the end of FY13.

11. Because of delays component three will only include the establishment of the
computerized framework for the IMS (which will be the basis for developing a full-
fledged IMS as part of the new project) and the 2010/2011 school year census,
undertaken with the support of National Institute of Statistics. This census will be
                                             5
important to get better quality baseline data for the coming years, especially in light of
the new project under preparation.

Results/indicators

12. Modification of one PDO Indicator (Primary Education Completion Rate) and one
Intermediate Indicator (Implementation of an Information Management System): Based
on the difficulties encountered in terms of completion rate discussed above, the end-of-
project target will be adjusted downward from the current 72 percent to 68 percent total,
and from 65 percent to 60 percent for girls. Furthermore, delays in the IMS would make
it impossible to reach the proposed end-target “Purchase of Equipment and Staff training
completed?. Therefore, the new target is defined as “A computerized framework is in
place?. The attached Results Framework (Annex 1) includes these proposed
modifications.

13. Given that these reduced activities represent what can be realistically achieved
within the next five months, it was agreed that the external evaluation and establishment
of a full IMS would be part of the new project. The proposed changes, however, do not
require any modifications to the project development objectives, the safeguards category,
the design or scope of the project, or the financing mechanism.

                      Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for the Benin - Education For All-Fast Track
   Initiative Program (P110576; TF091947-BEN) will be
   extended from December 31, 2011 until June 15, 2012. The
   purpose of this extension is to: (i) complete activities
   currently under implementation and crucial for attaining the
   project development objectives; (ii) amend the description of
   Component 3; and (iii) adjust the targets of two indicators.



2. The most notable achievements of the project can be found
   in the areas of access to and equity in education; (i) the
   Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) rose from 93 percent in
   2005/06 to 110.6 percent in 2009/10 for primary education;
   and (ii) the percentage of female students increased from
   44.4 percent in 2005/06 to 46.3 percent in 2009/10. This
   expansion has been supported by the construction of
   classrooms and latrines underway and should also help
   achieve the end-of-project targets of 112 percent GER and
   47.5 percent of female students.



                                12
3. Progress can also be noted in the following areas: (i) the
   target for the number of pre- and primary school student
   receiving at least one meal per day has been surpasses
   (121,000 compared to 110,000); (ii) pre-school GER target
   surpassed its end-of-project target by 0.3 point (10.3 vs. 10);
   (iii) the number of direct project beneficiaries is likely to meet
   its target; (iv) in-service teacher training target of 16,000 will
   be surpassed according to end-of-project projections; (v) the
   proportion of teachers visited by the inspectors and
   education advisors increased (6 percent in 2009 vs 59
   percent in 2010) and (iv) number of people who pass a test
   in initial literacy or post-literacy training will likely exceed final
   target of 51,000.



4. The short extension would enable the project reach its
   objective and ensure the completion of the following
   activities: (i) complete construction of schools, latrines and
   literacy centers delayed due to heavy rains; (ii) undertake
   literacy activities for which the signing of a contract with an
   NGO is now underway; (iii) increase the number of additional
   qualified teachers; and (iv) establish a computerized
   framework for a subsequent full Information Management
   System. The completion of these activities is critical for
   achieving the PDO indicators as well as the project
   intermediate indicators.



5. In terms of disbursements, out of the US$76.1 million of the
   Grant amount, US$62.3 million have been disbursed (81.8
   percent of the total amount). Given the significant progress
   made, the project is poised to achieve 100 percent
   disbursement of Grant proceeds if granted a short extension.


                                     13
6. Implementation Performance is rated Satisfactory, progress
   towards PDO achievement Moderately Satisfactory,, and the
   objectives of the project remain achievable, if granted an
   extension. The proposed restructuring will not entail any
   change in: (i) PDO, (ii) the safeguards category, the design
   or scope of the project, or the financing mechanism.



7. This will be the second and last extension of the project.
