   Section 1: Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

   Context at Appraisal

   Country Context

1. Located in West Africa in the Gulf of Guinea next to Nigeria, Benin is a small nation
   with a per capita income of US$540 in 2006. A poor country, it was ranked 163 out of
   177 countries according to the 2006 Human Development Report. The country’s
   population of 7.6 million was characterized by rapid demographic growth (3.0%) and a
   young age structure: in 2006, the 0-14 year age group represented 44% of the total
   population.

2. Benin launched its first Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2003 laying out a strategy for
   private sector-led growth, strengthening governance and institutional capacity, human
   capital development, and participation of the poor in the development process. The
   World Bank supported this strategy with three PRSCs (PRSC 1-3). With regard to
   education, these PRSCs emphasized increased access, completion, and quality in the
   basic education program, as well as improving efficiency in the management of basic
   education services. Concrete measures addressed curriculum revision, teacher training
   and recruitment, and classroom organization, as well as education demand (through
   targeted programs for girls and the poor).

3. Under the leadership of President Dr. Thomas Boni Yayi, elected in March 2006 (and
   reelected in 2011), Benin has embarked on a series of reforms with a development
   strategy designed to modernize public services and provide a competitive environment
   for the private sector. Government has acknowledged the factors constraining the
   economy from reaching greater growth: a lack of competitiveness, an undiversified
   economy subject to external shocks, and a need for quality basic services to raise the
   caliber of human resources.

   Sector Issues

4. In 2006, the Government endorsed a Ten-Year Education Plan (Plan Décennal de
   Développement du Secteur de L’Education – PDDSE) that provided the framework for
   achieving agreed education outcomes, using a common set of measurable benchmarks to
   track progress and harmonize donors’ commitment to predictable long term financing.
   The main objectives of the Government’s strategy included: (i) improving service
   delivery to increase access, equality, retention, and learning achievement in basic
   education, the promotion of girls’ education, and the training and recruitment of qualified
   teachers; (ii) strengthening the governance and efficiency of the education system
   through a better management and redeployment of teaching staff, more efficient
   financing and management of schools, and better academic and administrative support;
   and (iii) re-orienting post primary education and training in order to better respond to the
   skills needs of a more diversified economy.




                                                1
5. Preparatory studies showed that substantial progress had been made in primary education
   over the course of the years prior to the project. This progress is captured by increased
   access, with GER for primary improving from 90% in 2002 to 93% in 2006, and the
   percentage of female students rising from 42% to 44.4% in the same period, as well as
   vastly improved school completion rates (from 47 to 65% between 2002-2006 for all
   students, and 34-54% for girls). Additionally, the repetition rate dropped, from 21% of
   public school students in 2003/4 to 16% in 2005/6. These advances resulted from, among
   other things, regular budget increases for the sector, the hiring of new teachers in
   accordance with PRSC targets, and measures to ensure no school fees at the primary level.

6. Despite this progress, Benin continued to face difficulties regarding equity in access and
   quality of education. National figures masked significant disparities, by sex, geography
   and income level, due partly to the uneven distribution of human and material resources
   among schools. Furthermore, students’ mastery of programs was weak, and data from
   2004/5 learning assessments put Benin among the worst performers in the sub-region
   (average math grade for fifth graders was 32.6; average French grade was 28.2). The
   reasons for this include: (i) the use of under- or unqualified teachers, often paid by
   parents at the community level (community teachers comprised 36% of all teachers in
   2005-6); (ii) the deterioration of the student-teacher ratio from 40 in 1992-3 to 47 in
   2005-6; (iii) textbook-student ratios that fell short of targets (1.16 in 20065-6); (iv) lack
   of school inspection and performance monitoring; and (v) poor infrastructure (30.8% of
   schools made of non-permanent materials). These problems, which characterized the
   entire system, are especially relevant for girls, children in rural areas, and above all, the
   poor. Poverty remains the primary hindrance for children in accessing and completing
   primary education. The illiteracy rate remains high, especially among women and in poor
   areas, and adult education programs face severe problems of quality. Finally, the GER in
   pre-school (public, parochial, and private) was a mere 3.6% in 2005-6, with none but the
   wealthiest children having access. To get a clearer picture of these quality-related issues,
   a learning assessment of students was to be undertaken in 2009 1, and repeated in 2011, to
   assess the progress made.

7. The system was also beleaguered by issues of poor management. Implementation
   capacity in the Ministries of Education – notably budget execution – was weak, and there
   was no functioning information management system or school map. As a result, there
   was little performance monitoring at school or student level, and teachers were
   inefficiently distributed: in 2005-6, for example, 40% of schools had student-teacher
   ratios that were either below 40 or above 70. Given the growth rate of the teaching staff –
   1500 new teachers being hired every year – human resource management was becoming
   an increasingly critical issue.

   Rationale for Grant

8. On the basis of the Government’s March 2007 application, the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund
   Strategy Committee approved, in May 2007, a USD 76.1 million grant for Benin for the
   period 2007-2009. Benin’s application to the Fund followed endorsement of the
   Government’s PDDSE by local education donors (December 2006). During the
   endorsement process, some members of the donor group (DANIDA, AFD, and KfW)
   expressed interest in pooling their funds with those of the Catalytic Fund and moving
   toward sector budget support. The rationale behind this decision was that it would
   improve the efficiency of their support for the PDDSE, while also reducing transaction
   costs for Government, in line with the Paris Declaration of 2005.

9. The general objective of the FTI/FCB program is to contribute to the Government’s
   program for ensuring education for all by 2015, while the greater goal of the program is,
   by strengthening the education system, to contribute to enhancing the value of human
   capital and so lay the foundations for medium- and long-term economic growth (SCRP
   Pillar 3).

    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
10. “The proposed grant will contribute to expanding equitable access to pre-school and
    primary education and to supporting the development of literacy programs, while
    improving quality and retention at primary level as well as the management of the sector.?

   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
   and reasons/justification

11. In the second restructuring that extended closing by 6 months, from Dec 31, 2011 to June
    15, 2012, though no changes were made to the PDO, changes were made to component 3.
    Given the imminent closing, the team proposed to modify the following activities under
    Component 3: (i) exclude from the project the external evaluation of the efficacy of
    certain pedagogical interventions; and (ii) reduce the number of activities related to the
    setting up of the entire Information Management System (IMS) to just those related to
    putting in place a computerized framework.. As a consequence, only one was kept, the
    establishment of the Information Management System (IMS). In addition, one PDO
    indicator was modified, the primary education completion rate, which was adjusted down
    from 72 to 68% and from 65 to 60% for girls. One intermediate indicator was modified as
    well, the implementation of an information management system, the indicator being
    changed from “Purchase of equipment and staff training completed? to “a computerized
    framework is in place.?

   Main Beneficiaries

12. The total number of beneficiaries is given as 1,750,000 as of SY 2010/2011, 48.24% of
    which are girls. This figure is given in the latest 2012 GoB statistics (see Annexe SE 4:
    Situation des indicateurs du programme FTI-FCB). As no breakdown is given, one must



                                                3
   infer that this figure represents all primary students. However, since there are other
   beneficiaries, the following table summarizes beneficiaries of each project component.
                                                    Beneficiaries

   Component 3      The 454 Ministerial staff directly benefitting from technical capacity
                    strengthening, including those who were to set up the computerized
                    framework.

   Original Components
13. The project was divided into three main components: (1) Improving Access, Equity, and
    Retention; (2) Improving Quality of Teaching and Literacy Training; (3) Improving
    Management and Steering of the System. There were 12 subcomponents as follows:

14. Component 1. Improving Access, Equity, and Retention (US$48 million) by: (i)
    constructing, rehabilitating, and equipping educational infrastructure (more than 2000
    pre-school and primary classrooms, 45 literacy centers, and 12 alternative education
    centers), (ii) providing literacy training for girls and women, and developing national
    programs for girls’ education and for children with special needs; (iii) supporting an
    experimental program for alternative accelerated education for overage children; (iv)


                                                4
    extending multi-grade teaching and the use of sub-cycles; and (v) developing new
    primary school canteens.
15. Component 2. Improving Quality of Teaching and Literacy Training (US$18.7
    million) by: (i) supporting implementation of programs based on the ‘competence
    approach’; (ii) strengthening the qualifications of teachers and management personnel
    with training and support to training institutions; (iii) introducing, on an experimental
    basis, national languages into the education system; (iv) purchasing and distributing
    textbooks, teachers’ guides, and school supplies for pre-school and primary school; and
    (v) improving literacy by elaborating new programs and materials, training literacy
    trainers and personnel, and providing literacy training to 52,000 adults using the ‘faire-
    faire’ approach (contracting out to NGOs).

16. Component 3. Improving Management and Steering of the System (US$9.5 million)
    by: (i) improving pedagogical and institutional management with the use of student
    learning assessments, results-based management systems, and external evaluations of the
    efficacy of certain pedagogical interventions; and (ii) building management capacity
    within the PDDSE structures in order to improve the sector’s planning, programming,
    procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation capacity, and putting
    in place an information management system with a school map.

   Revised Components

17. The project was restructured twice: In June 2010, a level two restructuring took place: the
    closing date was moved to December 31, 2011, and, though the PDO of the project
    remained unchanged, some components (considered unachievable) were dropped, and the
    excessive number of PDO indicators (14), which made it difficult to assess progress
    towards the achievement of the PDO, were reduced to six. These were more focused and
    closely aligned with project components.

18. In December 2011, the closing date was extended by another six months to June 15, 2012,
    and, though the PDO remained the same, changes were made to component 3. Given the
    imminent closing, the team proposed to drop all unachievable activities. As a
    consequence, only one was kept, the establishment of the Information Management
    System (IMS). In addition, one PDO indicator was modified, the primary education
    completion rate, which was adjusted down from 72 to 68% and from 65 to 60% for girls.
    One intermediate indicator was modified as well, the “Implementation of an Information
    Management System?, the indicator being changed from “purchase of equipment and
    staff training completed? to “a computerized framework is in place.?

    Other significant changes

19. During the first restructuring, the program was “refocused on the activities which
    contribute significantly to the achievement of the PDO and can be realistically achieved
    by the new closing date in order to reduce complexity and facilitate implementation.?
    (from ISR sequence No.6). While the changes involved the introduction of two new
    activities (the direct support to school operating costs and to nutrition assistance



                                                5
   programs), five others were eliminated (which would nevertheless continue to be covered
   by the program). 2

   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   Section 2. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20. Project Preparation. Relevant counterparts in government worked closely with the
    Bank and partners to prepare this project. Adequate participatory processes were in place.
    Four factors can be cited in this context:

21. The background analysis supporting the project was good: the rationale for Bank
    intervention was sound, lessons learned from earlier projects were incorporated 3 , and
    thorough assessments of the Government’s FM and Procurement capacity were carried
    out, both by Bank entities and by the EFA/FTI Catalytic Fund Office. While several
    important caveats were placed on the government’s capacity in these two important
    domains, the systems were judged to be ‘adequate’, provided there was training and
    certain conditions were met (those in the conditions of effectiveness) 4.

22. Assessment of project design: The objectives were sound and perfectly in line with
    government goals, the MDGs, and the programmatic approach agreed on by all donors in
    Benin. The three project components were appropriately identified. With the amount in
    question (US$76.1million from the Bank alone), the WB project, as part of the larger
    harmonized program, was meant to be ambitious and include a number of activities in
    many education sub-sectors. However, what was not easy to anticipate was how this
    project would be received and acted upon by a Government that was understood to have
    weak implementing capacity, poor inter-ministerial coordination, and no experience of
    such sizeable projects. Critics might claim that the project design was in fact too complex,


   2
     The activities no longer included in the project are the following: (i) a national program for girls education
   and children with special needs; (ii) the experimental program for alternative accelerated education for
   overage children; (iii) the extension of multi-grade teaching and the use of sub-cycles; (iv) the introduction
   on an experimental basis of national languages into the education system; and (v) the provision of
   textbooks.

   3
     Some of these lessons related to the use of project management agencies for construction, and the
   adoption of decentralized approaches for teacher training and canteens.

   4
     The conditions for effectiveness included: A ministerial decree establishing the program management unit
   is signed, and the unit is fully staffed and operational; Conventions that are fully satisfactory to all donor
   partners are signed with the agencies to be used for school construction; an Operations Manual is validated
   by the Government and donor partners; The Designated Account is opened at BCEAO; Evaluation of the
   agencies proposed for school construction (for the agencies that have not yet been evaluated); The recipient
   has recruited the independent auditors for the program; The Joint Financing Agreement has been signed by
   Government and all donor partners. PAD, p.13.




                                                          6
   calling on many actors to work in coordination and including too many activities to be
   carried out in the relatively short time frame of three years.

23. Adequacy of government commitment. Before the elections, the Government worked
    closely with donors to prepare the project; after it, however, the new government did not
    re-engage on this project -- at least not at first and not quickly enough. Only as the end of
    the project came into sight, did the Government seek ways to expedite all activities.

24. Assessment of risks. A number of risks were clearly and correctly identified in the PAD
    (p.11), all of which, but one, were rated as substantial; however, the measures put in
    place to mitigate them did not always succeed. These risks included the risk of political
    reorganization in ministries, the involvement and interaction of four ministries, weak
    financial management, weak (in procurement, financial management, and monitoring and
    controlling budget execution), weak absorption capacity of external funding, and weak
    capacity to monitor the quality of education and effectiveness of education activities.
    While measures were given to mitigate these risks, it takes great foresight and experience
    to establish successful measures. The risks to this project were great enough that these
    provisions should have been better planned, more realistic, and achievable.

   Implementation

25. Implementation was slow to begin. Once underway though, significant progress was
    made. On the side of government, exogenous factors, such as a change of government as
    the project began, and endogenous factors in the form of weak capacity of various sorts,
    would explain this; on the side of the Bank, one might fairly contend that the Bank did
    not do enough to assist the government in finding corrective measures to overcome many
    of the preliminary obstacles encountered. After all, delays of more than 12 months, at the
    outset of an operation, to allow a counterpart to put into place the relevant units, systems,
    and organizations that are needed is neither practical nor realistic given the project’s
    initial timeframe (of three years), and becomes the responsibility of government and
    donors. That said, the Bank did show great determination in assisting government in
    resolving the procedural difficulties of various sorts that arose. At one point, for example,
    the Bank solicited the help of Benin’s President’s office to help move the agenda forward.

26. To be fair, significant disbursements (more than 70% for infrastructure) were made
    during the first year, but from the state budget instead of the project budget, and these did
    not align with accepted procurement procedures. As a result, these missteps caused
    government confidence to drop and commitment to implementation to falter. It took some
    time for stakeholders to correct these initial false starts.

27. During the period covered by the first three ISRs, overall project implementation was
    rated as Satisfactory. The author of this ICR must concur however with the manager’s
    conclusion in the third ISR that this rating was unacceptable, given that no disbursement
    had begun, and so the rating should have been Unsatisfactory. In 2007, at the outset of
    the project, all those in government who had been involved in the design of the project
    were replaced following the national elections of 2006. Institutional memory was lost.



                                                 7
28. The new members of government were not familiar with the project design or
    requirements and poor inter-ministerial coordination and weak capacity persisted. In
    addition, the creation of the Program Management Unit, one of the conditions for
    effectiveness, took time to staff and was at first misunderstood; it was believed to be an
    implementing agency, but its role was in fact to leverage government.

29. Other difficulties became apparent. The government began construction activities without
    first obtaining the necessary non-objections from the Bank, a course of action which was
    deemed to be out of line with acceptable procurement procedures. This misstep sapped
    initial confidence and took some time to overcome.

30. It was only in the second quarter of 2009 that disbursement began, amounting to
    approximately 28% of the total, a figure that would remain unchanged until mid-2010,
    during which time the rating given was Moderately Unsatisfactory. The reasons for this
    slow disbursement lie in the (i) excessive number of small activities, (ii) procurement
    related delays, and (iii) weak capacity in the ministries concerned. It was at this point that
    ‘project at risk’ status was conferred on the project in ISR 4 and 5.

31. The Bank and borrower found ways to overcome these challenges. As a result, in June
    2010, restructuring was approved which allowed the project closing date to be extended
    to December 31, 2011. No mid-term review was carried out because of this. After being
    at 32.6%, disbursement then began to rise slowly in Q3 and Q4 of 2010 and it was in
    early 2011 that it finished by climbing steadily. It reached 61% by the end of August
    when the rating improved to Moderately Satisfactory. By the end of 2011, as
    disbursement hit 81.8%, a second restructuring was approved to allow closing to be
    moved back six months in order to allow as many activities as possible to be completed.
    By project close, 91.7% had been disbursed, a disbursement figure that has climbed to
    98% (as of November 2012) as committed activities finish. Many reasons could be cited
    for this improved disbursement, but one important one was that all government units had
    begun to work well together. The rating was downgraded in the final ISR to Moderately
    Unsatisfactory because key indicators of quality and retention, which had already been
    downgraded at the second restructuring, were not met considering the SY 2010/11
    statistical data.

   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32. M&E design in the context of pooled funding mechanisms. In keeping with the FTI
    principle of donor harmonization, donors in Benin agreed to enter into a pooled funding
    mechanism to finance this program. This was one of the strong points of the project.
    Unlike other donors, 5 the World Bank insisted that attribution be possible -- that
    whatever FTI funds had financed remain identifiable entities distinguishable from others.


   5
     Other donors are not in a position to distinguish what their contribution has been spent on, except in the
   broadest terms of categories, and can only state their contribution as a percentage of the total program
   expenditure.



                                                         8
   In addition, appropriate indicators for the FTI project components had to be developed,
   which became a subset of the greater SWAP program indicators. 6 So, all intermediate
   indicators are specific to this project. These were not meant to detract from the greater
   program nor defeat its purpose – and, by all accounts, they did not -- they simply had to
   be in place to respect WB procurement standards.

33. Delays and M & E design. Delays have slowed the monitoring and evaluation of the
    project, 7 with the result that statistics are not as up to date as possible. Delays at the
    outset of the program were also unfavorable to the project’s intended M&E design. Two
    national student assessments were meant to be carried out in 2009 and 2011, but the 2009
    national student assessment had to be cancelled because the supervising directorate was
    not in a position to manage it, thereby leaving only the 2011 assessment to be carried out.
    The 2011 results constitute nevertheless a strong baseline for the follow-up project.

34. Ideally, education data needs to be more precise, able to reflect individual student-,
    teacher-, class- and school-level variables. Without this, the impact of the project on
    outcomes cannot be determined accurately; only a broad outline of its impact can be
    inferred. For a more in-depth discussion see section 3.5 below. Clearly, interventions that
    aim to improve quality must be monitored closely.

   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35. Safeguard Compliance. The project was rated ‘satisfactory’ in two areas -- compliance
    with the safeguards OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary
    Settlement -- a rating that did not waiver over the course of the project. The overall
    safeguard compliance was rated in this way because the mitigation measures planned in
    the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) had been implemented
    in sites visited during the supervision missions. In addition, the environmental audit was
    also rated in this way because the PNDCC and the Contract Management Agencies in
    charge of school construction had also taken measures to comply with the ESMF. An
    environmental audit was nevertheless requested (and is underway as of December 2012)
    to give an overall assessment. No other safeguard was impinged upon by the project.

36. Fiduciary Issues. Project supervision has regularly shown that the project’s financial
    management arrangements have been adequate and are compliant with the Bank’s
    financial management requirements. There have been concerns regarding weak
    procurement and so capacity building training was recommended and provided through
    workshops and conferences. This weakness was due to a number of factors: (i) in this
    project, procurement was carried out by education units who were not at first familiar
    with typical Government project management or FTI procedures, which caused


   6
     In this context, it is important to distinguish between ‘project’ which refers to the FTI project, while
   ‘program’ refers to the larger FTI/FCB program.

   7
       Delays of up to 8 months were reported in ISR #10




                                                           9
   significant delays 8; (ii) poor inter-ministerial communication and coordination caused
   delays and bottlenecks (dossiers sent between Ministries, for instance, were not easily
   traceable); and (iii) complications caused by missing staff or staff turnover related to
   intergovernmental staff rotation. The WB team remained flexible in the face of these
   challenges by restructuring the project twice to try and refocus the project on essentials
   and to extend deadlines so that the implementing agencies could overcome accumulated
   delays.

37. Audits and Disbursements. Audits were carried out as defined in the Grant Agreement.
    They were qualified, but with qualifications only related to delays in accounting.

   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38. A follow-up GPE project is currently under preparation, and will be informed by the
    recommendations and evaluation of this ICR. The proposed components will continue to
    address access, equity, and retention, though more focus will be placed on sustaining and
    continuing to improve quality of education services. The follow-on grant would consider
    a simple project design, realistic objectives and results and implementation arrangements
    that better reflect the capacity constraints in the sector. The success of the programmatic
    approach, the work with other donors, deserves to be continued and strengthened.


   Section 3: Assessment of Outcomes

   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39. The project has highly relevant objectives not only in term of current country strategies
    (as expressed in the Government’s 10 year action plan), the MDGs, with regard to the
    Bank’s CAS and PRSPs, and the donor community’s programmatic approach.

40. The project design exhibited several strong points: it incorporated a common pool
    funding mechanism that was successfully implemented, encouraging donor
    harmonization and minimizing the government’s transactional costs; it adopted, as well,
    the FTI program and procedures that, once understood and used, lent a structure and
    framework to the implementation of activities. If the design could be faulted, it would be
    that the design did not lend itself easily enough to implementation. It needed to be better
    streamlined in order not to contribute to delays. Given that the government had never
    worked on such a scale in this sector before, the design had to make more realistic
    assumptions about the adequacy of government capacity. Adding a complex layer of
    activities to an already busy bureaucracy turned out to be more than challenging.




   8
     As many as 41 steps were reportedly required to obtain approval and disbursement on an activity using
   traditional Government procedures. The Fast Track procedures curtailed the number of steps significantly,
   but the two systems co-existed poorly together.


                                                      10
41. If the implementation of this project proved to be onerous at first, the drive towards
    restructuring by the Bank and the borrower allowed the project to find a way to overcome
    these challenges: by many accounts, the restructuring was a success and many activities
    were ultimately achieved.

   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42. The Development Objectives of this project – “to contribute to expanding equitable
    access to pre-school and primary education and to supporting the development of literacy
    programs, while improving quality and retention at primary level as well as the
    management of the sector? – were achieved in very great measure. Almost all indicators
    were met. This was in part thanks to the restructuring of the project in 2011, which
    extended the closing date of the project by six months (from December 31, 2011 to June
    15, 2012) thereby allowing more components to be finished, and through the revision of
    component 3, most notably the elimination of certain elements of it that were no longer
    believed to be attainable, as well as their indicators.

43. Overall results for the sector were positive, as significant progress was made. After
    the second restructuring, there were eight indicators, some with revised targets, selected
    to measure achievement of the PDO: number of direct project beneficiaries, female
    beneficiaries (given as a percentage), number of people to pass a literacy test (initial or
    post literacy), number of female students in school as a percentage, primary education
    completion rate (total population/girls), GER for pre-primary, GER for primary, and
    repetition rates. The results can be seen as follows:

44. As we have seen, the project included three major sets of activities related to improving
    (1) access, equity, and retention; (2) quality of pre-school and primary education and
    literacy training; (3) management and steering of the system. For a complete review of
    the project components, sub-components, and activities completed, please see Annex 2.

45. Component 1. The overall goal of this component was to improve access to and equity
    and retention in the sector. Of the US$ 56.3 million reserved, US$55.6 million was spent.

46. Access. Improvement in access was to be measured by the revised indicator for student
    enrollment in primary education. Access indicators outpaced the targets set in the
    Government’s ten-year action plan: the gross enrolment rate (GER) in pre-school
    increased from 4.5% in 2006/7 to 12.3% in 2012, surpassing the 11% target, while the
    GER in primary education reached 119.72% in SY2011/12, which surpassed the target of
    112%. It is estimated that the annual average growth rate of students in the primary cycle
    was 5.2% between 2006-7 and 2010-11, an increase of 0.3% from the period 2000-01 to
    2005-6 when it lay at 4.9%. It is highly likely that the project contributed to this increase.

47. It might be thought that improved access to pre-school and primary was achieved through
    the construction of 2613 additional classrooms, (a figure, incidentally, that bettered the
    final project target of 2191). This may not necessarily be the case: most new classrooms




                                                 11
   simply replaced semi-permanent classes (open-air lean-to constructions) that were
   already on-site at schools, so students simply enjoyed more permanent structures. 9

48. Equity. Plans were in place to target several populations: girls, the poor, as well as
    illiterate adults. Girls’ participation in primary school increased from 44.4% in 2007 to
    48.24% in 2012. 10 The building of latrines and the provision of school feeding would
    have most likely encouraged families to send more girls to school. Provision was also
    made to offer literacy training for girls and women and to develop programs for girls in
    national languages: at project end, 28,940 were enrolled in such programs for a target of
    29,200.

49. Access to education for the poor has improved throughout the country, generally
    speaking, albeit with some exceptions. The northern regions still face some difficulties: in
    the province of Alibori, for instance, the GER was 62% in 2008/09 – over 40% below the
    national average – and had only climbed marginally by project end. Socioeconomic
    disparities – while still substantial – have narrowed in recent years, with access to
    education increasingly democratized. 11

50. Access to literacy centers was accomplished by building 45 literacy centers with 45
    blocks of 2 unit latrines.

51. Retention. Retention was to be measured by three indicators: repetition, drop-out and
    completion rates. Repetition rates remained high through the course of the project and in
    fact increased at one point before dropping somewhat at project end: from 7.5% in
    2006/07, it jumped to 16.4% in 2011, to finish at 12% -- 2% above the final target of 10%.
    Increases in access rates from lower socio-economic groups without improvements in
    quality could account for this, one might speculate. Dropout rates remained high as well,
    14.4% in 2010/11.

52. Changes in completion rates were modest, though they spiked at the end. At baseline (SY
    2005/6), the rate was 65% of which girls’ completion rate was 54%. The final project-end
    target was adjusted down to 68% (girls 61%) from 72% and girls 65%. In 2010/11, these
    had not been reached, and yet in the final year, the results were positive, the final rate
    given being 71.5% (girls 65.8%). So, the general rate improved by 6.5 points and the girls’



   9
     The question to know how many new constructions replaced ‘lean-to’s’ – whether this figure was
   recorded is not clear.

   10
     It would be interesting to know what the rate of girl’s participation before the project was. To what extent
   did the project help in any way?

   11
      In 2000/01, poor children were five times less likely to finish primary school and start secondary school
   than their wealthier counterparts; in 2005/06, this was between 2.5-2.8. No figures are available at project
   end. See World Bank (2009) Le Système Educatif Béninois: Analyse Sectorielle pour une Politique
   Educative Plus Equilibrée et Plus Efficace. Washington, DC: World Bank



                                                        12
   rate by 11.8%. Understanding the general stagnation in the overall completion rate during
   most of the project is a matter of speculation, as is the spike at project end. It could be
   due, potentially, to the high repetition and drop-out rates, problems which may have
   appeared as a consequence of increased access without increased quality and which could
   not be addressed adequately in the short term of this project. On the other hand, it could
   be that the improved completion at the very end of the project revealed that measures
   were beginning to have some impact.

53. Another measure taken by the project to help improve retention was the school feeding
    programs that served 121 000 students in the country’s poorest areas, exceding the
    110,000 student final target. In addition, the building of permanent classrooms – to
    replace lean-to’s -- probably improved retention, as well. Although a more in-depth study
    is needed to demonstrate this, it is likely that permanent constructions, since they better
    shelter students during inclement weather (during the rainy season), would promote
    retention. The same could be said of the 486 new blocks of latrines, as well -- that better
    sanitation facilities promote retention as well.

54. Component 2. The overall objective of this component was to improve the quality of
    pre-school and primary education and literacy training. Of US$14.1 million, US$14
    million was spent.

55. Quality was to be measured by the national assessments of 2009 and 2011. The 2009
    testing could not be performed, however, and the 2011 results were considered weak. 12
    Instead, primary completion rates were used as an indicator of quality instead, although
    they too were disappointing (see above in section on retention).

56. Quality was also measured through intermediate indicators for improved teacher and
    management personnel training. Progress was made on these counts: the training of 9979
    community teachers to pass the CEAP exam was carried out (7971 passed) and 46,196
    teachers benefitted from in-service training (on, in part, competence-based pedagogical
    approaches).

57. A greater number of qualified teachers -- up from 51.3% to 55.1% -- were hired to
    stabilize the student-teacher ratio at 47.9 to 1 in an attempt to maintain quality in the face
    of increasing access rates. An increase in the number of inspectors and education advisors



   12
      The 2011 assessment results, considered weak, were the following: the combined scores in Math and
   French were 40 out of 100 for 2nd year primary students (CM) and 31.85 out of 100 for 5th year primary
   students (CP1). These results could not be compared easily to any other test. Hence the disappointment
   related to the dropped 2009 test. The precedent international evaluation done by the PASEC group in
   2005/6, for example, rated students in terms of being in difficulty. The scores for Benin were 38.5% and
   44.8% of students faced difficulties in Math and French at the end of the primary school cycle -- a level
   which placed Benin at the next to last spot in the regional rankings, only ahead of Chad.




                                                       13
   was also noted, with the proportion of classes visited by the inspectorate reaching 65.9%
   in 2010/11 (target 40%).

58. Further, the purchasing of learning material by pre-school and primary school was
    accomplished through the transfer of subsidies to 8059 schools (reported government
    figures).

59. Literacy was to be tackled by elaborating new programs and materials, training literacy
    trainers and personnel, and providing literacy training to 52,000 adults using the ‘faire-
    faire’ approach (by contracting out to NGOs). As it turns out, the training was in fact
    completed for 107,401 adults.

60. Component 3. The aim of this component (for which US$5.7 million was devoted) was
    to improve the management and steering of the education system as a whole. Two major
    sub-components were planned, one to do with improved management and one with
    improved capacity.

61. As far as the first sub-component is concerned, the aim was to improve pedagogical and
    institutional management with the use of student learning assessments and results-based
    management systems. Two intermediate indicators reveal that the student learning
    assessment of 2011 was (i) put in place and (ii) then rolled out. Another intermediate
    indicator shows that the proportion of classes visited by the Inspectorate rose to 65.9%
    above the project target of 40%, which is a very strong result. The only shortcoming is
    the implementation of the computerized Information Management System, which at
    project close had not been put in place, though the preliminary framework was.

62. Building management capacity within the PDDSE structures in order to improve the
    sector’s planning, programming, procurement, financial management, and monitoring
    and evaluation capacity, and putting in place an information management system with a
    school map was the second sub-component. While annual work plans, an operations
    manual, training of 454 central ministry staff in particular technical knowledge and skills
    (as the intermediate indicator discloses), and other tangible outputs can indeed be
    identified, the actual management structures and systems that were put in place for the
    project remain to be perfected. Procurement and FM capacity training was also carried
    out and the rating given to them was satisfactory but the position of these two vital
    activities in the project activities cycle remains somewhat problematic.

63. In conclusion, all indicators were met and it is highly likely that in terms of impact the
    project contributed significantly to the achievement of the overall project -- and indeed
    program – objectives (as it represented approximately 75% of the program budget
    US$76.1 million out of just over US$100 million). Clearly, a significant influx of non-
    recurrent budget has had a positive effect in the sector.

   Efficiency

64. The internal efficiency of the system has improved modestly over the course of the
    project for several reasons. On the one hand, government spending increased, as did


                                                14
   access to schooling and yet, on the other, repetition rates did not decrease (until the end)
   and drop out remained high. Several activities of the project stand out nonetheless for
   their cost-effectiveness.

   Recurrent and non-recurrent Expenditure increases

65. At the outset of the project, in 2006, Benin spent 3.8% of GDP and 18.03% of total
    government expenditure on education (9.6% of total government expenditure on primary).
    By 2010, according to UIS figures, public expenditure on education had risen to 4.5% as
    a percentage of GDP and 18.2% of total government expenditure (10.5% total
    government expenditure on primary).

66. During the period 2006-2010, current expenditure in education represented 16.7% of the
    state’s resources, a figure which is below that the threshold of 20% recommended by the
    Fast Track Initiative.

67. The influx of non-recurrent expenditure was exceptionally elevated. Donors played a
    critical role in Benin’s education reform, with aid to the sector increasing steadily, from
    an annual average of $49 million per year in 1999 and 2000 to $83 million per year in
    2006 and 2007, topping out at over $100 million for the combined FTI/FCB program. It
    is certain that this trend cannot continue.

68. Unit costs. In 2006, fees were abolished for all students in primary and pre-primary
    school, leading to a surge in first grade enrolment. Fees were replaced by block grants
    paid to schools. However, these are frequently insufficient to cover costs: parents must
    pay for schoolbooks and uniforms, and frequently contribute to school-related
    construction projects.

69. According to figures to be released in the latest RESEN, the unit costs per child per year
    of primary schooling have gone up from 45,4 thousand in 2006 to 49.8 thousand in 2010
    (figures given in 2010 constant CFAs), which corresponds to a rise from 13.1% to 13.5%
    GDP per inhabitant over the period. 13

70. What is troublesome is the suggestion that, upon closer study, one can find little
    difference between pre-and post- project results in the allocation of resources (i.e.
    teachers to school, and so on) on levels of student achievement: there seems to be no
    correspondence between the two. 14 In other words, the rise in unit costs has not been
    accompanied by a rise in student performance.

   Internal Efficiency

71. As access increased, important measures were taken to maintain and improve the quality
    of education (through teacher/student ratio, teacher training, acquisition of materials, and
    so on). However, the repetition rate rose from 7.5% in 2006/07 to 16.4% in 2011 (and
    was as high as 19% in grade 2), closing at 12%, above the final target of 10%. The
    dropout rate remained high. Completion rates for the total student population remained
    below targets during most of the project -- until the very end.

72. Taking into account the cumulative frequency of repetition and drop-out in the primary
    cycle leads to a global coefficient of internal efficiency of 52.8 15 in 2010/11. This means
    that just less than half (approximately 47.2%) of the resources mobilized for this level of
    education are in fact wasted. The situation has thus worsened since 2006-07 when one
    third (approximately 32.2%) of the resources mobilized were wasted and when the global
    coefficient for internal efficiency stood at 67.8. However, that said, there has been some
    improvement in the SY 2011/12 considering the PCR has risen to 71.6%.

   Cost effectiveness through decentralization and the use of the private sector

73. Several project activities stand out for their cost effectiveness. While most activities were
    implemented following Government procedures, three that did not -- in (i) construction,
    (ii) school feeding program, and (iii) the training of the teachers – were much more cost
    effective.

   (i) For the construction of classrooms, 28% of the works were carried out using a CCD
        approach which offered the least unit cost in the country and which, in addition, was
        fastest. Other construction was delegated to two Contract Management Agencies
        (CMA), also offering faster building times, but their unit construction cost was
        comparable to that of construction carried out by the Ministry. However the
        additional fees of the services provided by the CMA and the firms recruited to
        supervise the works increased the unit cost.
   (ii) The school canteens were run by community mothers with a unit cost of US $ 0.25
        per meal, a unit cost that was significantly less than the cost incurred using public
        canteens run by the administration.
   (iii)For teacher training, an agreement was reached with the government to use per diem
        meal rates of US$5 instead of the usual US$30, given the number of teachers
        involved. This was a cost savings that drove expenses down considerably.

   In conclusion, despite these successes, the efficiency of the project can only be rated as
   modest.

   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

74. The overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is meant to reflect two
    contrasting aspects of this project. On the one hand, the project was relevant because it
    was aligned with the government’s overall education program and the PDOs were in fact
    achieved; on the other, the project efficiency was modest -- largely due to two factors: (i)
    the internal efficiency of the system remained generally weak and (ii) implementation,
    extremely slow to begin, was beset with delays.

   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

   Poverty

75. There are many key indicators to analyze the evolution of poverty. The latest RESEN
    2012 (Rapport d’étât sur l’éducation nationale (yet to be published)) indicates that
    poverty in rural and urban zones has dropped between 2006 and 2011 (roughly, the
    beginning and end of the project) from 40.6% and 34.3% to 39.7% and 31.4% for rural
    and urban zones, respectively.

76. In education projects, the most relevant indicators of poverty reduction are those that
    indicate the intake rate in schools by region (disaggregated by gender), the primary
    completion rates by region (also disaggregated by gender) and literacy rates. Although
    proxies, these would show whether more students (particularly girls) are entering primary
    schools in the poorest areas and are being retained there.

77. Literacy. Literacy Rates are improving, as revealed in the table below, taken from UIS
    sources.

78. Gender. The project has helped to address gender inequalities in the student population
    and, to some extent, the teaching profession as well. Before the launch of the program,
    gender inequality among primary students clearly existed on the national scale – and was
    particularly prevalent in rural areas. Girl’s participation was particularly low from the
    poorest families in rural Benin. As of 2012, data indicate that girls represent 48.24
    percent of all those enrolling in primary schools across the country. Modest gains have
    been made in the gender parity index for gross enrolment at the primary level, rising
    from .89 to .92 in 2011. However, without more precise data, it is difficult to pinpoint
    why this rise occurred and what in fact the project’s contribution to this increase has been.
    Clearly, more research is needed to understand what is driving this.

79. One unanticipated outcome in this regard, worthy of note, is the rise in the number of
    women entering the teaching profession, a phenomenon that has led to a slight rise in
    female teaching staff (from 17 to 19% according to the UIS).
   Institutional Change/Strengthening

80. In 2007, the Ministries involved in this project exhibited many of the characteristics of
    large administrations with obsolete management systems -- stratified along strictly
    hierarchical lines, with poor communication among the various entities. Aware of this
    from the extensive capacity assessments carried out , 16 a key challenge for reform was to
    move away from this highly centralized rules-based system towards one that, by being
    better organized and trained at the central level and by being more decentralized and
    based on local decisions made by highly competent professionals, would become more
    responsive, effective, and efficient.

81. The introduction and use of FTI procedures for each activity in this project has brought
    with it some benefits in this regard. Even if (i) it was a challenge to have this approach
    accepted and (ii) it took time to learn and fully understand it, the exercise came to be
    appreciated because it introduced principles, an explicit framework, and rigor into
    government procedures. It helped formalize and rationalize the execution of activities and
    introduced accountability into the process.

   Despite this, an appreciation of the Ministry’s functional capacity remains, for the
   moment, guarded. For instance, the last supervision mission for the project indicates that
   recurrent challenges persist in the Ministries in terms of: (i) strengthening institutional
   capacity to coordinate, combine, and deploy resources to reach target results, (ii)
   improving procurement, and (iii) efficiently coordinating the basic education sub-sector
   as a whole. These conclusions are disappointing, coming after the project devoted
   considerable resources to institutional capacity building.

   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

82. Worth noting in this regard are two project activities that have had unintended outcomes:
    the community development programs for school construction and the introduction of
    FTI procedures. As we saw above, for the construction of classrooms, 28% of the works
    were carried out using a CCD approach which offered the least unit cost in the country
    and which, in addition, was fastest. Secondly, the introduction of and insistence on using
    FTI procedures for each activity in this project brought with it unanticipated benefits, as
    we saw in the previous section.

   Section 4: Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

83. The project objectives continue to be relevant to country needs as reflected in the
    Education Sector Plan (ESP), the Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the
    Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) which all give high priority to the education sector as
    one significant engine for promoting growth and reducing poverty. In addition, while key
    indicators of quality and retention were slightly lower than expected at project close,
    substantial progress was made in access and equity. These key actions are highly likely to
    continue to have an impact on development outcomes after project closure, provided that
    the reforms, particularly those related to quality, are sustained. Indeed, two risks threaten
    the sustainability of these outcomes: government commitment and government capacity,
    both of which have fluctuated over the course of this project to its detriment. The risk of
    this occurring again is fair and so the rating is moderate.

   Section 5: Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

84. As outcome targets of this project were formally revised in the second restructuring, the
    project could in principle be divided into two parts and the two parts be weighted,
    following the calculations in Appendix B of the ICR guidelines. However, since (i) the
    PDO was not formally revised and the change was to just one of the seven PDO level
    results indicators (a slightly downgraded target was given for Primary Education
    Completion Rate) and (ii) the restructuring came at the very end of the project (the
    closing date was extended by just six months), the ICR team has decided not to divide the
    project up 17. A very evenhanded evaluation of this project is possible without doing so.




   17
      If the project were divided according to ICR guidelines, there would be two confounding issues: (i) the
   division is relatively arbitrary in the context of the project (because disbursement was increasing at a
   constant rate both before and after the proposed division) and (ii) the weights of the pre-restructuring and
   post-restructuring periods would be about 6.5 to 1 -- weights which do not actually reflect the relative
   importance of each of the periods in the life of the project.

   Bank Performance

   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85. As examined in detail in section 2.1., the Bank ensured quality at entry in the following
    four ways:

86. Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis supporting the project was
    generally good, lessons learned were incorporated into the project, and the rationale for
    Bank intervention was sound.

87. Assessment of project design: The objectives were sound and perfectly in line with
    government goals, the MDGs, and the programmatic approach agreed on by all donors in
    Benin. The three project components were appropriately identified. With the amount in
    question (US$76.1 million from the Bank alone), the WB project, as part of the larger
    harmonized program, was meant to be ambitious and include a number of activities in
    many education sub-sectors. However, what was not easy to anticipate was how this
    project would be received and acted upon by a Government that was understood to have
    weak implementing capacity, poor inter-ministerial coordination, and no experience of
    such sizeable projects. Critics might claim that the project design was in fact too complex,
    calling on many actors to work in coordination and including too many activities to be
    carried out in the relatively short time frame of three years.

88. Adequacy of government commitment. Before the elections, the Government worked
    closely with donors to prepare the project; after it, however, the new government did not
    re-engage on this project -- at least not at first and not quickly enough. Only as the end of
    the project came into sight, did the Government seek ways to expedite all activities.

89. Assessment of risks. A number of risks were clearly and correctly identified in the PAD
    (p.11), all of which, but one, were rated as substantial; however, the measures put in
    place to mitigate them did not always succeed. These risks included the risk of political
    reorganization in ministries, the involvement and interaction of four ministries, weak
    financial management, weak (in procurement, financial management, and monitoring and
    controlling budget execution), weak absorption capacity of external funding, and weak
    capacity to monitor the quality of education and effectiveness of education activities.
    While measures were given to mitigate these risks, it takes great foresight and experience
    to establish successful measures. The risks to this project were great enough that these
    provisions should have been better planned, more realistic, and achievable.

   Quality of Supervision

   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90. There were some shortcomings in the Bank’s response to resolving problems at the outset
    of the project. The delay of more than 12 months that was required by the GoB to put into
    place the relevant systems and organizations for the project was neither practical nor


                                                 20
   realistic given the project timeframe (of three years). Some of these issues were, of
   course, beyond the purview of the Bank’s supervision, some were not; nevertheless, at
   some point, such a delay must become the Bank’s responsibility as much as
   Government’s. The Bank was active in interceding when it could. As a case in point, the
   Bank did solicit the help of the President’s office in Benin to overcome Ministerial inertia
   at one point.

91. Once implementation began, subsequent Bank supervision was very good as the Bank
    regularly followed up with counterparts, interceding actively when necessary, to help
    project execution flow as smoothly as possible. At times, the TTL raised issues with
    management and management interceded. This positive approach characterizes fine
    project supervision and is to be commended.

   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92. As Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory and
    the quality of the Bank’s supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory, the rating for
    Overall Bank performance is also Moderately Satisfactory.

   Overall Borrower Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

93. For the purposes of this ICR, no distinction will be made between ‘government’ and
    ‘implementing agency.’ This is because four Ministries and numerous directorates within
    these Ministries were involved in the project, working in various capacities, both in the
    administration and execution of the project. It is true that there was a PMU put in place as
    a condition of effectiveness, but it was an extra-governmental entity created to help
    leverage government execution of the project; it did not act as an implementing agency
    per se.

94. As discussed in greater detail in earlier sections of this report, borrower performance was
    affected by a number of factors including:

       •   Poor initial commitment
       •   Ineffective management
       •   An unrealistic implementation schedule
       •   Inefficient administrative procedures
       •   Implementation delays
       •   Inefficient procurement and disbursement
       •   Weak M&E

95. Government ownership and commitment went from being very poor at the outset of the
    project to very strong by the end of it. One could make reference to various Government
    entities that were fully committed to the project. So, for example, the PMU worked
    tirelessly to make this project a success, while the Minister of Finance’s Cabinet,
    recognizing the urgent need to intervene as the project faltered, found a way to bring all


                                                21
     government units together on a regular basis to create an ad-hoc taskforce to oversee the
     project. These were impressive moments in the project. Other units, on the contrary, that
     were meant to lead the project, did not rise up to the challenge.

 96. A suitable institutional environment was not in place; at the outset, the government was
     simply not ready. As the project advanced, the timely resolution of implementation issues
     remained a constant issue. The project did finish by disbursing well above 98% of the
     allocated FTI funds (as of November 2012), but this was in great part due to extensions in
     project closing dates.

 97. So, despite the fact that the project met its objectives, the general picture of borrower
     performance that emerges is one that is mixed. There were significant shortcomings;
     hence, the rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.
     Section 6. Lessons Learned

 98. The lessons below are given in three sets: to do with (A) the Bank/Partners, (B) the
     Project, and (C) the Government.

     Bank/ Donors

 99. Realism is required. Serious challenges in capacity and coordination had been
     recognized before the project began 18 and needed to be thoroughly addressed; they were
     not in their entirety and, as a result, their effect was felt throughout the course of the
     project. In any new project, greater realism is required. The capacity constraints
     identified in this ICR cannot be overlooked in the new project. Recommendations are
     given below.

100. Work with the donor community. Collaboration with donor partners in this project led
     to the success of the pooled funding mechanism. This deserves to continue, so the Bank
     should invite the donor community to participate in future meetings.

     The Project

101. Complexity versus quantity of components. The project was judged to be ‘too complex’
     for a government of weak capacity with poor inter-ministerial coordination, and was
     perceived by many to have too many components, with the result that the project was
     seen as a ‘scattering of resources’ (‘saupoudrage’), which placed priority on quantity
     rather than the quality of the intervention. The obvious lesson would be to stress the
     importance of keeping design simple and components achievable. The superposition of a
     rich layer of activities onto an already busy bureaucracy is a challenge, certainly.

102. Despite this observation, most components of this project were in fact achieved -- albeit
     with a few exceptions and some project re-arrangement. The problem was not one of
     complexity but rather, in this assessor’s opinion, one of streamlining. Had the project
     started more swiftly (the next project should, incidentally), there would have been more
     leeway to sort out the various implementation challenges that commonly arise in
     ambitious projects such as these, such that all components would have indeed been
     accomplished. An FTI contribution, it should be recalled, is an exceptional event, one for
     which all parties must be well prepared. And well prepared to adapt.

103. In addition, a multitude of factors constrain the education sector in Benin; many are
     interrelated. Adopting a simpler approach may facilitate the GoB’s task, but may not be
     sufficient to address the web of issues that arise together in the sector, all of which need
     to be addressed. Ultimately, the new project must address the complexity of these issues
     while its design remains simple to implement.


104. M&E design in the context of pooled funding mechanisms. In keeping with the EFA
     principle of donor harmonization, country partners in Benin agreed to enter into a pooled
     funding mechanism to finance this program. Unlike other donors, 19 the World Bank
     insisted that attribution be possible -- that whatever FTI funds had financed remain
     identifiable entities distinguishable from others. In addition, appropriate indicators for the
     FTI project components had to be developed, which became a subset of the greater
     SWAP program indicators. This is a strong point of the project that has allowed the WB
     to commit to pooled funding mechanisms and still respect its M&E obligations.

105. Good impact evaluation is critical. The new project must include M&E that clearly
     demonstrates project impact.

106. CDD approaches for Construction. Schools in this project built by communities have
     been built quickly and more inexpensively than those built by CMA’s or the Government.
     Other initiatives in decentralization should be explored in the new project to take
     advantage of this benefit.

     Government

107. Ministerial coordination was weak and caused delays. While two inter-ministerial
     bodies were created to oversee the GoB’s ten-year education sector plan, they did not
     always concern themselves with the various challenges that the particular project
     activities could create. A task-force that is officially endowed with the requisite power
     and credibility to overcome these bottlenecks must be put in place and remain in place.



     19
        Other donors are not in a position to distinguish what exactly their contribution has been spent on,
     except in the broadest terms of categories, and can only state their contribution as a percentage of the total
     program expenditure.



                                                           23
108. A dedicated taskforce. The management structure put in place for the project did not
     function as planned, so an ad-hoc management team formed and, in conjunction with the
     PMU, drove the project forward. In the new project, it will be important to formalize this
     taskforce/management unit. It will be critical to have:

              •   A formal mandate from Government to move this agenda forward;
              •   A streamlined management unit that:
                     o is tasked with this mandate,
                     o includes all relevant ministerial stakeholders (directorates and so on),
                     o identifies, at the outset, their roles, responsibilities and working
                       relationship,
                     o acts as a dedicated taskforce, meeting on a regular basis, to address
                       the ongoing challenges that will be encountered with a project of this
                       scale,
                     o and maintains a pragmatic sense of realism about attaining objectives
                       within the given timeframe.
              •   Capacity strengthening in FM, procurement, and so on (see below);
              •   Solid technical support from donors.

109. Independence of the Project Management Unit. The project manager was appointed
     from outside of government, which turned out to be a good choice because this person
     was able to make use of his autonomy -- which an appointed civil servant might not have
     enjoyed -- to leverage government action.

110. A focus on building the capacity of systems, not individuals. This project both
     benefitted -- and suffered – from the contribution of certain individuals. Progress should
     be achieved however through systems having been put in place, not from any one
     participant. This is particularly pertinent in Benin where civil servants rotate between
     posts on a regular basis. The introduction of, and insistence on using, FTI procedures
     (that included terms of reference, detailed activity sheets, and so on) for each activity in
     this project went a long way towards accomplishing this objective. Even if (i) it was a
     challenge to have this approach accepted and (ii) it took time to learn and fully
     understand it, the exercise came to be appreciated because it introduced principles, an
     explicit framework, and rigor into the procedure. It helped formalize and rationalize the
     execution of activities and introduced accountability into the process. The clear lesson is
     that this approach -- promoting FTI procedures -- must be carried through to the next
     project. The familiarity with the procedures must not be lost. Early on it the new project,
     training or retraining should be put into place to ensure this.

ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS


1.      This economic analysis shows that the invested resources were spent in a modest
efficient manner. The economic and financial analysis in the PAD presents an overview
of public and household spending on education in Benin, an assessment of student-
teacher ratios as well as salary costs for teaching personnel. Due to lack of data on costs
and benefits of the separate components of this project, this annex only provides an
economic assessment on efficiency of part of component 1. Component 2 and 3 are not
covered by the economic analysis. Finally, a short financial analysis is presented.

2.      The project consists of three components: 1) Improving access, equity, and
retention, 2) improved quality of teaching and literacy training, and 3) improving
management and steering of the system.

Economic Analysis
3.      The project completed 2,613 classrooms compared to a target of 2,191 classrooms.
Out of the 2,613 classrooms, 732 (28%) were built using a Community-Driven
Development (CDD) approach, and the resulting 1881 classrooms were appointed to
Contract Management Agencies (CMA). Data on construction costs is available for most
of the classrooms built (327 using the CDD approach and 1602 using the CMA approach).

4.     The lowest unit cost was achieved using the CDD approach with an average unit
cost of US$ 12,931 (2012-prices) including costs of furniture. The unit costs of
classrooms (excluding furniture) built by CMA range from around US$ 13,500 to above
US$ 20,000 (2012-prices) depending on contract and management agency, cf. Table 1.

  Data on costs have been provided by the Government. All costs include taxes. Costs are converted from
FCA current prices to US$ current prices using exchange rates from the World Bank Databank (2008-2011)
and the ICR official exchange rate (2012). Costs in current prices are then converted to constant 2012-
prices using IMF inflation rates (incl. estimate for 2012).


                                                  29
5.      The average unit cost of classrooms across both CMA is 17,855 US$ (2012-
prices), which is somewhat higher than the prices obtained in other construction projects
undertaken in Benin within the same period of time. The average unit costs of classrooms
built under three other projects (PCRESC-EPP, ZOFROLA, and PROCEDE) are
US$ 15,584, US$ 16,936, and US$ 14,907 respectively (all prices are 2012-prices). 21
These projects did not make use of CMA, but contracts were made directly between the
Ministry and the construction firms. Except for the difference in procurement type, prices
are directly comparable to those built by the CMA, as the classrooms were built in
equally accessible areas and are of the same type and size. Thus, the classrooms built by
the CMA the EFA-FTI project come out as slightly less cost efficient compared to those
built in other projects. However, on the positive side, classrooms built by the CMA under
the EFA-FTI project were built much faster (in 4-5 months) than classrooms built by the
other projects (1-3 years), which enables communities to benefit from the new
constructions earlier. The expeditious process is explained by a fast recruitment process
of firms as well as close supervision of the works by the CMA.

6.      A comparison of construction costs across countries and over time shows that unit
costs differ substantially across projects and according to management methods.
Examples of projects managed by CMA show unit costs between around US$ 11,000 in
Senegal in 1992 and US$ 17,700 in Chad in 1993 (all costs are 2012-prices). Thus,
compared internationally the average unit cost of classrooms built by this project is also
on the high end. 22 However, it is difficult to systematically compare efficiency across
these projects as constructions vary in standards, quality, common premises included etc.

7.     Indicators on access to school improved during the period of implementation and
the GER for primary education reached almost 120% in the school year 2011-2012.23
Although this project is expected to have a significant positive effect on access to
education, it is not possible to quantify by how much the project contributed. Primary
school fees were abandoned in 2006-7, which presumably have had a great positive effect
on enrollment as well.

8.     Most of the new permanent classrooms replaced already existing semi-permanent
classrooms structures, which may result in a lower increase in access for these areas.
Thus, although the new construction has increased access in some areas, this is not
necessarily the case in all areas. However, the new permanent structures are expected to
increase learning outcomes for students in all of the covered areas, as a number of studies
show a positive effect from quality of school buildings on learning achievement. 24
Furthermore, the permanent structure of the classrooms is expected to bring financial
savings to the communities, as communities will no longer have to rebuild semi-

permanent classroom structures. Unfortunately, as data is not available on either
conditions of prior constructions or costs associated with rebuilding this saving cannot be
quantified.

Financial Analysis
9.      Public spending on education in Benin has experienced strong growth from
US$ 141.1 million (FCFA 69.6 billion, 2010-prices) in 2000 to US$ 351.7 (FCFA 174.2
billion, 2010-prices) in 2010, which corresponds to an increase of 149%. In 2010 the
resource allocation to the education sector accounted for 5.4% of GDP and 24.8% of
government expenditure. 25

10.    The majority of the budget allocated to education goes to basic education, and
thus 52.3% of public expenditure on education went to the Ministry of Pre-primary and
Primary School (MEMP) in 2010. 30.6% of the budget was allocated to the Ministry of
Secondary, Technical and Vocational Training (MESFTP), and 16.8% for higher
education (MESRS). 26

11.     The fiscal impact of this project primarily stems from the higher cost of the
expanded school infrastructure, i.e. the recurrent costs associated with the additional
number of students accommodated in the new classrooms as well as with the new literacy
centers. However, for the new classrooms that are replacing semi-permanent classrooms,
the recurrent costs are only expected to be higher than prior costs to the extent that the
permanent buildings lead to a higher enrollment of children in primary education. It is
also possible that the permanent classrooms result in a fiscal saving due to lower
maintenance costs. Furthermore, replacement of furniture and maintenance costs for the
new classrooms is expected. Due to lack of data on change in enrollment and recurrent
spending prior to and after the investments, the direct fiscal impact from the project is not
calculated.

   ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

   Note: This is a summary of the Beneficiary Survey

1. As part of the implementation of the Fast Track Initiative Program Common Fund budget,
   a survey of stakeholders and beneficiaries was sponsored by the Department of Maternal
   and Primary Teaching. The overall objective of the mission was to assess the satisfaction
   of both actors and beneficiaries of the program to enable the ministries in charge of
   education to gather lesson learned in order, ultimately, to build on the achievements of
   this program. Specifically, the mission aims to:
           •   recognize the degree of satisfaction among stakeholders and beneficiaries of
               the FTI/FCB activities;
           •   assess the degree of ownership of stakeholders and the participation of
               beneficiaries in the implementation of the FTI-FCB (for project identification
               and implementation);
           •   analyze the strengths and limitations of the implementation of the program as
               expressed by stakeholders and beneficiaries;
           •   share stakeholders’ satisfaction with respect to the financing of the program
               and the procurement process municipal and community with accurate
               statistics;
           •   identify proposals advocated by stakeholders to improve the performance and
               modalities of implementation;
           •   analyze approaches to solutions proposed by stakeholders and beneficiaries;
           •   and present a list of key lessons and propose actions to policy-makers in the
               departments in charge of education.
2. To achieve these objectives, a participatory methodological approach involving all FTI /
   FCB stakeholders was adopted by the team in charge of the mission. It basically includes
   the methods and strategies of intervention, the preparatory phase, sampling, data
   collection, processing and analysis of data.

3. As the investigation necessarily included various types of actors distributed across the
   country, the choice of the survey sample was not easy. Indeed, the survey had to cover a
   representative sample of the different categories of stakeholders of the program. To do
   this, clusters were formed in the population according to categories. Seven clusters were,
   in fact, formed namely stakeholders, parents, teachers, alpha, students, partners and CP
   inspectors. Collection tools have been developed accordingly to survey each group of
   actors.

4. With this approach, several difficulties were encountered, which include:
           • the delay in processing the survey;
           • the unavailability of electronic versions of the documents provided by the PMU.
           • the period chosen (the holidays were a real headache for investigators /
           controllers due to the unavailability of those to be surveyed);
           • Computers without available anti-virus programs led to delays in capturing data
           and complications in merging tasks, thus lengthening the processing time.


                                               33
5. Nevertheless, with both determination and commitment, the national team in charge of
   the mission overcame these difficulties to capture the following:

   Stakeholders
6. Stakeholders at the middle school level are 88.05% satisfied with program activities
   (36.96% are very satisfied and 51.09% are quite satisfied). For primary school
   stakeholders, 45.97% are very satisfied with the program, and 36.97% are somewhat
   satisfied, with the combined result that 82.94% of the total primary stakeholders being
   satisfied with the overall program. In short, these stakeholders are satisfied with a number
   of criteria.

   Literacy
7. The majority of learners (82.71% of respondents) are satisfied with the program activities
   in literacy.

   Teachers
8. The overall assessment of teachers (carried out by level of education) on the FTI/FCB
   program seems satisfactory. Of 235 primary school teachers interviewed, over 90%
   report being satisfied. Approximately 88.61%% of secondary teachers are satisfied with
   the overall activities of the FTI / FCB program.

   Parents (indirect beneficiaries)
9. The proportion of satisfied parents is greater at the primary education level than at the
   secondary level.

   Students
10. 679 students appear to be favorable to the program continuing. There is a tendency to
    believe that the program was not well understood by these beneficiaries, but they
    nonetheless want the program to intervene in their locality. The program is very much
    appreciated by students or 72% of the total surveyed.

   Partners
11. Donor partners are indifferent about many of the points on which they were interviewed.
    It seems evident that the guide was sent to various (perhaps poorly chosen) categories of
    people and so, because of this, their understanding of the issues is not necessarily the
    same. The degree of involvement of respondents is not of the same order and the same
    nature. Nevertheless, issues such as the exemption of fees for girls, school canteens, and
    school infrastructure are topics of interest to many surveyed.

   CP and inspectors
12. The CPs (conseil pédagogique) and inspectors condemn the short teacher training periods
    as inappropriate. Some believe that politics is involved in the matter to the point where


                                                34
   unionism has taken over professionalism. Almost all inspectors and pedagogical advisors
   agreed that the in-service teacher training has improved teachers’ professional and
   content knowledge, which has justified massive numbers of these teachers passing the
   various professional examinations (CAP / CEAP). For the majority of CP and inspectors,
   their own in-service training has strengthened their capacities and helped them transfer
   skills to teachers. Conversely, for some inspectors and CP, the skills acquired during
   training remain to be strengthened. Support for canteens developed by the program was
   highly appreciated by the inspectors and CP. Generally speaking, inspectors and CP
   greatly appreciated the various infrastructure improvements made by the FTI / FCB. For
   them, this infrastructure has provided a better working environment for both teachers and
   students.

   Lesson Learned
13. Regarding lessons learned, many are currently available to be used in the improvement of
    the next program. It is important to take the suggestions of various different types of
    beneficiaries seriously, as a first step. Second, it is important to note that it is possible to
    derive a high degree of satisfaction from beneficiaries through actions that do not cost
    anything. For example, the commitment of different actors was one of the points raised
    quite often by beneficiaries. Similarly, the monitoring of construction should not
    normally have been an [extra] financial cost. Improvements in these two areas would
    revitalize and strengthen existing management and operation structures (with the
    technical support of local councils), making them more efficient.

14. Beneficiary satisfaction is particularly favorable to the funding made available by the FTI
    / FCB program. This is encouraging but much remains to be done. Information
    dissemination will be important for the next program in order that all recipients receive
    the same amount of information. This will allow them to be more effective, by having a
    better understanding of goals and a better understanding of their role.

15. The disabled, meanwhile, benefited from an induction program in urban areas, but this
    program does not seem to have taken root. The ambitions of the program are noble and
    desirable nevertheless: that parent 'stakeholders' become more involved in this process to
    help this special social group become visible.

17. At the end of this investigation and in light of the data contained in this table, on the one
    hand, and the realities on the ground, on the other we can conclude that almost all players
    are satisfied (89.23%) with the FTI/FCB program activities.

18. RECOMMENDATIONS

19. In light of the various criticisms made by beneficiaries and the revelations garnered from
    the surveys, it will be important for the next program to involve community stakeholders
    better in all phases of the program. This will include the selection of contractors and the
    selection of contracting authorities delegated so as to ensure the quality of infrastructure
    built through rigorous monitoring and control activities.

20. Due to the low level of knowledge of the program and its objectives among stakeholders,
    it is essential that the new program has a communication structure to make its operations
    visible. A lack of information can be construed as the confused actions of political power.

21. In terms of program management, it is essential to review the procedures for the
    disbursement of funds which is a very important step that is not without impact on all
    levels of program activities. This effect is often manifested in implementation delays that
    slow construction, and delay the start of canteens at the beginning of the year.

22. As for latrines, it is recommended that they are not only equipped with sinks but that they
    are also built in sufficient numbers and by qualified contractors.

23. Regarding canteens supported by the program, it is necessary that actors at the grassroots-
    level -- including parents -- be more involved in plans for their future modernization,
    which could lead to the construction of real canteens in schools. On the other hand, the
    low participation rate of children must be improved through improvements in the quality
    and quantity of meals served.

24. In addition, depending on the availability of program resources, it would be desirable to
    consider extending the exemption of fees to all girls and even boys. In other words, we
    need completely free education in Benin.

25. Satisfaction depends on the type of beneficiaries. Secondary school teachers for example
    are significantly less satisfied than primary. And this is not without some inconvenience
    to the educational system. The program, because of its focus on primary education, could
    destabilize the education system by overly-promoting primary school teachers. The
    action taken at the secondary level was appreciated, but we should point out that nothing
    was done at the level of technical education and vocational training, though it is a
    component of the same sub-sector.

26. Stakeholders are important actors in a chain. The program should attempt to benefit more
    from the involvement of parents in all steps so that problematic management issues, lack
    of transparency, and management questions become things of the past. Note that a greater
    involvement of grassroots actors can correct many imperfections.



                                                 36
27. Partners who were a target of this investigation also appreciated the program. The survey
    conducted at that level is quite rewarding. We note simply that at the level of
    municipalities, the program is known but there is a real need to strengthen agents /
    managers directly involved in the program. In the future, the program must make known
    all its components to the beneficiaries.

28. Finally, it will be important to evaluate the pilot phase of the program to integrate
    disabled children into schools in urban areas (implemented by the NGO Iseh) in order to
    see whether this idea should be extended to have national coverage.
