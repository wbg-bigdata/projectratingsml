KENYA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUNMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The rapid pace of Kenya's economic growth in recent years has
placed heavy demand on its transport sector. Agriculture, which provides
more than 35% of GDP, and tourism, the largest single earner of foreign
exchange, require a reliable and efficient system of all-weather roads.
But despite substantial investment in the road network, many of the gravel
and earth roads serving key agricultural and tourist areas do not provide
all-weather service and the condition of the network is deteriorating. The
objective of the proposed project is to ensure that economic development is
not hindered by rising transport costs.
ii.       Maintenance of the road network has for many years been divided
between the Roads Branch 1/ of the Ministry of Works (MOW) and local authori-
ties. The Bank Group, which has been assisting the Government for over a
decade in expanding and improving the network to meet the demands of a
growing economy, recognized that the growth of the road system might event-
ually outstrip the local authorities' capacities for maintenance, and has
kept careful watch on the condition of the network. In 1968, when it first
appeared that maintenance of the network was deteriorating, the Government
agreed to make a comprehensive study of the maintenance organization. The
study, carried out by the consultants, INBUCON (U.K.), as part of Loan 639-KE
(1969), concluded that the MOW should be reorganized and given full respon-
sibility for the main road network, and recommended that a comprehensive
maintenance program be undertaken. The Government has adopted the consul-
tants' recommendations and has requested IDA assistance in implementing them.
iii.      The project will strengthen the headquarters and field organization
of the Roads Branch of the MOW, enabling it to cope with its increased respon-
sibilities, and will provide the means to carry out a four-year maintenance
program, thereby eliminating a backlog of maintenance on about 12,000 miles
of the most economically important roads. The project includes (a) a staff-
ing and training program to fill key positions in the Roads Branch, (b) pur-
chase of road maintenance and workshop equipment and spare parts, (c) improve-
ment of regional workshops, offices and road camps, (d) training of mainte-
nance personnel, (e) construction of additional training center facilities
and purchase of training equipment, and (f) consultants to assist in project
implementation.
iv.       Total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$18.1 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange costs will be met by an IDA credit of
US$12.6 million equivalent (69% of total project costs), and a grant from
1/   Recently changed to Roads Department.



- ii -
the U.K. in the amount of US$400,000 equivalent (2X). In addition to bear-
ing the local costs of the project of US$5.1 million equivalent, the Govern-
ment will meet all recurrent expenditures required to carry out the four-year
maintenance program totalling about US$34 million equivalent.
v.        The MOW will be responsible for execution of the project.  Suc-
cessful implementation of the project largely depends upon the appointment
of experts to key positions within the Roads Branch. Because the Government
has met limited success recruiting experts locally for these posts, the pro-
ject provides funds which will enable the Government to offer salaries in
line with the world market. The experts thus provided will be responsible
for training Kenyan counterparts. In addition, consultants or other experts
will be provided who will assist the Government in (a) training of mainten-
ance staff, (b) introduction of sound cost accounting and budgeting proce-
dures and (c) preparation of bidding documents, prequalification and evalu-
ation of bids.
vi.       The project, which will result in the improved condition of 12,000
miles of roads, is expected to generate savings in vehicle operating costs
that will yield an internal economic rate of return of over 30%. The ratio
of benefits to costs, expressed in present value terms, is 1.32:1 when a
conservative opportunity cost of capital of 14% is used for discounting
purposes.
vii.      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$12.6 million equivalent to the Government of Kenya.



KENYA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The recent rapid growth of road transport in Kenya has placed
a heavy burden on the Ministry of Works (MOW) which has responsibility
for maintaining the road network. For years, actual maintenance of the
network has been divided between the Roads Branch of the MOW and local
authorities - an arrangement which worked reasonably well in the past,
but less so as the network and traffic grew. The Bank Group has long
been assisting Kenya in financing the necessary investments in its high-
way sector to meet the demands of a rapidly developing economy and, ac-
cordingly, has kept a close watch on MOW's ability to keep the growing
network in satisfactory condition. In 1968, during the appraisal of a
recent Bank-financed highway project (Loan 639-KE, 1969), maintenance was
found to be deteriorating and it became evident that the organizational
arrangements for maintenance were no longer suitable to care for the ex-
panding road system. As a result, a detailed study of the maintenance
organization was included in that project. The study, carried out by
the management consultants, INBUCON (U.K.), was completed in December
1969 and recommended extensive reorganization of the MOW, particularly
its Roads Branch, and a comprehensive program to improve road maintenance,
including equipment purchases and training of maintenance staff.
1.02      The Government officially adopted the reorganization of the MOW
on January 1, 1970, but is short of staff to implement it and to take on
the increased responsibilities recommended by INBUCON. The Government has
requested IDA assistance in implementing the consultants' recommendations.
The proposed project will assure the success of the reorganization through
a staffing and training program and will provide the means to carry out a
four-year maintenance program designed to improve the condition of 12,000
miles of roads. The cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$18.1
million equivalent. Foreign exchange costs under the project, estimated
at US$13.0 million equivalent, will be financed by an IDA credit of US$12.6
million equivalent (69% of total projects costs), and a technical assistance
grant from the United Kingdom in the amount of US$400,000 equivalent (2%).
1.03      The Bank Group has helped finance six projects in Kenya for road
development:

million in 1955 and 428-EA of US$38.0 million in 1965) to the former East
African Common Services Authority for the development of equipment and
facilities operated by the former East African Railways and Harbours
Administration. Also, in 1969 a Bank loan of US$35.0 million (638-EA) was
made to the newly created East African Harbours Corporation (EAHC) and in
1970, a loan of US$42.4 million (674-EA) was made to the new East African
Railways Corporation (EARC).
1.05      This report is based on the recommendations of a study carried
out by the consultants, INBUCON, in 1968-1969 and on the findings of an
appraisal mission comprising Messrs. H. Cooke (Engineer) and G. McBride
(Economist), which visited Kenya in March 1970. Messrs. D. Bickers
(Economist) and F. Reid (Engineer) of the Permanent Mission in Eastern
Africa assisted the Government in preparing the project and participated
in the appraisal. This report was edited by Miss J. Murphy.



2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Kenya, an independent republic since 1963, is bordered by Tanzania
on the south, Lake Victoria and Uganda on the west, Sudan and Ethiopia on
the north, and Somalia and the Indian Ocean on the east (see map). With an
area of 225,000 sq mi, it is about the same size as Prance. Kenya straddles
the equator, and yet variations in altitude provide a wide range of climatic
conditions. More than half the country, in the north and east, is arid and
sparsely populated. About three-quarters of the population live along the
coast and in the highlands in the southwest between Mount Kenya (17,000 feet)
and Lake Victoria (3,700 feet). In 1969, the population was about 11 million;
it is growing at a rate of over 3% p.a.
2.02      Kenya's per capita GDP at constant prices has increased since
1964 at a rate of about 3% p.a., or, in current prices, from about
US$96 in 1964 to about US$120 in 1969. Although still a poor country,
Kenya's economy is more advanced than most in Africa. Its relative
economic strength stems from a diverse and efficient agriculture, and from
a small but reasonably well developed industrial base consisting primarily
of petroleum products, cement, food processing and textiles. Agriculture
provides over one-third of the total GDP, with subsistence farming con-
tributing nearly 60% of the agricultural value added. The most important
agricultural products are coffee, tea, cattle, dairy products, wheat, maize,
pyrethrum and sisal, while agricultural commodities account for about 70% of
all exports. Tourism is the largest single earner of foreign exchange, and
the number of overseas visitors, estimated at about 145,000 in 1968, is
projected to increase by 17% p.a. until 1974. The importance of agriculture
and tourism make adequate roads a critical factor in the further development
of Kenya's economy.
2.03      The 1970-1974 Development Plan, which calls for capital investments
amounting to US$1.9 billion equivalent, seeks ". . . a broadly based develop-
ment of the whole economy, in which all of the people of the country are
involved. . . ..  Recognizing that transport facilities are integral to the
achievement of this objective, the Government has allocated nearly 20% of the
Plan's projected investment, or US$366 million equivalent, to the transport
sector.
B. The Transport Sector
2.04      Rail, air, and road transport facilities are concentrated along
the 600-mile corridor from the Uganda border to the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa which is the principal outlet to the sea for Uganda and Kenya, as
well as for Rwanda and northeastern Congo (Kinshasa). This concentration of
transport services reflects the uneven distribution of Kenya's population
and economic activities.



2.05      The three East African Community Corporations for Railways,
Airways, and Harbours provide much of the transport service in Kenya.
Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania share equally in the ownership and operation
of these Corporations. The main railway line from Uganda to Mombasa,
together with subsidiary lines feeding into it, account for some 1,000
miles of the 3,700 mile rail system administered by the EARC. The East
African Airways Corporation (EAAC) provides international and internal air
services through the main airports at Nairobi and Mombasa. Movements of
passengers and freight by air within Kenya are still relatively insigni-
ficant. As the principal sea port under the EAHC, Mombasa accommodates
about 1,100 ocean-going vessels each year, and it is estimated that over
2.5 million tons of dry cargo will be handled in 1970.
C. Transport Coordination
2.06      The East African Transport Study, a study of the economic coordi-
nation of transport within the Community carried out by the Economist Intel-
ligence Unit (U.K.), was published in October 1969. This study, financed
by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency, focused upon transport
pricing and regulatory and investment policies which would promote the
economic distribution of traffic among modes, particulary between rail and
road. The most important recommendations were: (i) that the licensing
policies which in the past severely restricted the development of commercial
road transport should be relaxed; (ii) that the railway's differential
tariff (a tariff based upon the value of the cargo without regard to actual
transport costs) should be abandoned in favor of cost-based commercial
pricing; and (iii) that the EARC should have the authority to alter its
rates and methods of operation so as to have the commercial flexibility
required to meet road competition. These recommendations are now being
implemented in accordance with a time-phased program under the Third East
African Railway Project (Loan 674-EA).
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Road Network (see Map)
3.01      Effective January 1, 1970, the MOW instituted a new classifi-
cation system for its road network based on economic importance and
traffic. Under the new classification, the network is made up of approx-
imately 25,000 miles of trunk, primary, secondary and minor roads which
are the responsibility of the MOW, and of about 5,500 miles of unclassi-
fied roads which are the responsibility of the local authorities (Table
1). Although the length of paved roads has tripled over the past 10
years, totalling about 1,500 miles in 1969, more than half of the network
consists of unimproved roads or tracks, and many of the gravel and earth
roads serving key agricultural and tourist areas do not provide all-
weather service.



-5-
B. Traffic Growth and Characteristics
3.02      Mechanical traffic counts are taken regularly on the moat
important and heavily trafficked roads. These have been supplemented by
traffic data collected for various studies, including the INBUCON study.
Traffic varies from a few vehicles per day on minor roads to about 3,500
vpd on roads radiating from Nairobi. On the network as a whole, traffic
has been growing at an estimated average annual rate of 7% since the
mid-1960's. This relatively rapid growth of traffic has seriously strained
the MOW's capacity to maintain the roads adequately.
3.03      Over the past decade, the vehicle fleet grew at an average annual
rate of about 7% (Table 2). In 1969, about 52% of the vehicles were pas-
senger cars and 34% were light trucks and buses. The number of heavy
trucks (8% of the fleet) has scarcely grown, but the average size of freight
vehicles increased from 5-ton capacity in 1960 to 10-ton capacity since 1965.
In very recent years, trucks with capacities of 30 tons and more, and with
wheel loads of well over the 12,000 lb limit, appeared in significant numbers
on the Mombasa-Nairobi road and, to a lesser extent, on other trunk roads.
The condition of these roads, not built to handle such heavy loads, began to
suffer from the overloading. The Government was obligated under previous
Bank/IDA projects to maintain the road system adequately and to restrict
axle-loads and overloading of vehicles. In February 1969, after the gravity
of the situation had been impressed upon the Government by the Bank, repairs
were made and the Government increased its efforts to enforce the Traffic
Rules. During the negotiations of Loan 639-KE, the Government gave further
assurances that these regulations would be rigorously enforced. Plans have
been drawn up to install permanent weighing stations and to establish special
highway patrols to facilitate enforcement of the regulations.
C. Administration
3.04      Although the Government assigns responsibility for administra-
tion, construction and maintenance of the main road network to the MOW, it
was Government policy, until recently, that the MOW delegate responsibility
for much of the network to local authorities. As traffic on the network
grew, however, the local authorities were unable to keep the roads in good
repair (para. 3.09). In addition, the organization of the MW was ineffi-
cient. The Ministry had several branches (Roads, Materials, Buildings,
Mechanical), all under the Engineer-in-Chief, its senior technical officer.
Although the Roads Branch was the most directly concerned, no one branch had
complete responsibility for and control of all aspects of the road system.
Research in road design and construction materials, for example, was con-
ducted within the Materials Branch, where it received insufficient attention.
The disposition and maintenance of road maintenance equipment were under the
control of the Mechanical and Transport Branch which was also concerned with
the maintenance of all other Government common services vehicles. No cost
accounting or control procedures existed within the Ministry. Control over
field operations was limited, as the provincial engineers reported directly
to the Engineer-in-Chief and had considerable freedom in determining the
scope and nature of maintenance operations. Within the Roads Branch,
responsibilities often overlapped and lines of communication were unclear.



-6-
3.05      As part of their assignment under Loan 639-KE (para. 1.01),
INBUCON studied the road organization. The consultants recommended that
the M(W be reorganized and that under its aegis the Roads Branch be given
responsibility for the entire classified network. This reorganization
(as shown in Chart) was officially adopted on January 1, 1970; although
only a few now positions were created, the MPW is short of experienced staff
to implement it and to take on the increased responsibilities. The proposed
project will assure that adequate staff are available to ensure successful
implementation of the consultants' recommendations.
3.06      Under the reorganization, the Roads Branch will be reshaped,
with clearly defined lines of authority and responsibility and direct
lines of communication and command. Road construction and maintenance
will be executed by separate divisions within the Roads Branch; the provin-
cial engineers will report to the Chief Engineer (Roads) on all road matters;
and the mechanical field engineers will report to a superintending engineer
within the Roads Branch. A few new positions were created to strengthen the
field organization whose maintenance responsibilities have increased four-
fold. Each regional office will have a team of three maintenance experts
who will organize the maintenance works. The reorganization places emphasis
on the relationship between cost accounting and operational control at all
levels of authority. Successful implementation of the reorganization will
depend upon the Government's ability to attract qualified experts to fill
key posts within the Roads Branch. Staffing by foreign experts has been a
necessity since Kenya gained independence in 1963. The experts to be pro-
vided under the proposed project will train counterparts to remedy this
situation (para. 4.05).
D. Planning and Financlng
3.07      The Ministry of Economic Planning, worklng closely with the
Ministry of Finance and the MOW, prepares investment plans for the highway
sector. The present five-year Road Development Plan (1969/70-1973/74)
allocates K Sh 800 million (US$112.0 million equivalent) for capital
investments in roads. The Plan gives priority to developing secondary
and minor roads in rural areas in accordance with Government policy to
emphasize rural development. The proposed project, while mainly directed
toward improvement of trunk and primary roads, includes the improved main-
tenance of about 3,800 miles of secondary roads, thereby assisting in this
endeavor. A Bank Economic Mission (Report AE-6a, October 1969) has con-
cluded that, on the whole, the Plan is well conceived.
3.08      Expenditures for the construction, maintenance and administration
of roads are made from allocations in the general budget. Road users con-
tribute substantially to the Government's general revenues. The revenues
(Table 3) ste3ming from licenses, taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, and
import duties increased from US$10 million equivalent in 1958/59 to US$32
million equivalent in 1967/68, or at an average annual rate of about 20%.
Although expenditures on roads (Table 4) increased at a somewhat faster rate
(nearly 302) over the same period (from US$5.7 million equivalent to US$22.4



million equivalent), the annual amounts of road user charges received as
part of the Government's general revenues have remained greater than expendi-
tures on roads. In 1967/68, for example, the Government's expenditures on
roads amounted to about 70% of the road user charges paid.
E. Maintenance
3.09      Over the past two to three years, despite the efforts of the MoW,
maintenance of much of the road network has been inadequate and vehicle
operating costs generally have risen significantly. Until the introduction
of the new road classification in January 1970, the MOW was financially
responsible for maintaining 12,000 miles of roads but delegated responsibil-
ity for the physical maintenance of 8,200 miles of these roads to the local
authorities who were also responsible for maintaining the remaining minor
and local roads. With rapid traffic increases in recent years and road
improvements requiring more expert and sophisticated maintenance methods,
the local authorities were unable to carry out their responsibilities,
largely due to financial, equipment, and staffing difficulties. The de-
ficiencies in the organization of the MOW noted above and the difficulties
of administration hampered supervision of maintenance activities. As a
result a backlog of maintenance developed.
3.10      The MOW has now been given full responsibility for 25,000 miles
of trunk, primary, secondary and minor roads under the new classification.
To enable the MOW to bring the road network back to adequate standards,
an urgent maintenance program is required. The proposed project, based
on the INBUCON program, provides for the improved maintenance of 12,000
miles of the most economically important roads. While the remaining
13,000 miles will be maintained by the MOW utilizing existing equipment,
they will be considered for an intensive maintenance program only after
the MOW has gained experience from the present project.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project will strengthen the headquarters and field organiza-
tion of the Roads Branch of the MOW and provide the means to carry out a
four-year program of improved maintenance. The project includes the follow-
ing:
(a)  implementation of the reorganization of the Roads Branch
through a staffing and training program;
(b)  purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment
including spare parts;
(c)  construction and improvement of regional workshops, offices
and road maintenance camps;



(d) training of maintenance personnel at all levels;
(e) construction of additional training center facilities and
purchase of training equipment; and
(f) consultant services
(i)   to introduce new cost accounting and management
procedures,
(ii)   to assist with equipment procurement, and
(iii)   to assist, to the extent bilateral assistance cannot be
found, in the provision of required foreign experts for
(a) and (d) above.
B. Reorganization of the Roads Branch
4.02      The reorganization of the Roads Branch recommended by INBUCON
(see Chart) is designed to assure efficient management of all aspects of
roads administration and to enable the regional offices to carry out their
increased maintenance responsibilities. Successful implementation of the
reorganization, however, hinges on the Government's ability to attract
qualified experts to fill the technical positions. There has always been
a shortage of qualified Kenyans to fill such positions within the Government,
and since independence, the Roads Branch, like other branches of the Govern-
ment, has relied on foreign experts to staff many of its posts. Recruit-
ment of the experts has proven to be a problem because of the world demand
for this type of expertise. To assure the success of the reorganization
and of the highway maintenance program, the project includes a staffing and
training program which will not only meet the immediate staffing needs of
the Roads Branch but will provide for the training of Kenyan counterparts.
4.03      Under the staffing and training program, qualified staff will be
recruited to fill 12 key positions within the Roads Branch headquarters and
15 positions in the five regional offices (Table 5). Four of the head-
quarters positions are presently filled under contracts with the Government
which are due to expire within the next year: one expert has an indepen-
dent contract, one is financed under Credit 120-KE, and two are supplied
under bilateral aid from the U.K. and Norway. The U.K. has agreed to con-
tinue its assistance. The British Overseas Development Authority will
assist in recruitment of experts for the Roads Branch, and the U.K. will
contribute about K Sh 700,000 (US$100,000 equivalent) toward their salaries.
The provision of all 27 experts is included in the total project cost, which
reflects the U.K. contribution. Negotiations are also underway with the
Canadian and Norwegian Governments to provide some of the required experts.
If bilateral assistance in addition to that already assured by the U.K. can
be found from these or other sources, there would be some saving under the
credit. Recognizing the importance of filling these key positions as soon



- 9 -
as possible, the Government agreed during negotiations to appoint the 27
required experts, with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Asso-
ciation, within nine months of signature of the Credit Agreement.
4.04      Successful recruitment of the 27 experts will only be possible
if salaries are negotiated in line with the world market. The salaries
proposed by the Government are reasonable, and are in line with Bank Group
experience throughout the world. The funds to be provided by the Associa-
tion and the U.K. represent the foreign exchange component of the salaries,
and will make up the difference between the normal civil service salary
scale and salaries being offered for similar positions elsewhere in the
world.
4.05      But merely providing experts will not solve the long-term problem
of shortage of experienced Kenyan engineers. To alleviate the problem, a
major function of the experts will be to train Kenyan counterparts who can
step into their positions in the Roads Branch as the foreign staff depart.
During negotiations, the minimum qualifications and experience of candidates
for these understudy positions were agreed upon and the Government agreed to
formulate a plan to assure the appointment of suitably qualified Kenyans to
the positions. Agreement between the Government and the Association on this
plan is a condition for effectiveness of the credit.
4.06      While the availability of technically trained Kenyans is slowly
improving, a number of years of professional experience are necessary before
a graduate engineer is qualified for a specific post within the establish-
ment; it would not be in the best interests of an engineer still in training
to specialize before he has a broad experience within the MOW. Despite a
policy of Kenyanization, the Government has not been particularly success-
ful in recruiting nationals with the required qualifications. Out of a
total of 80 professional posts in the Roads Branch, only 15 are filled by
Kenyans, and five of these are still in training. Recruitment of qualified
engineers has been hampered primarily by the reluctance of the Government to
adopt a more realistic salary scale and other inducements. To assure the
long-term success of the staffing and training program, this situation must
be corrected.
4.07      The Government is aware of these probleus and, in February 1970,
set up an independent commission to review the conditions of service and
remuneration of the entire public service. The commission is expected to
complete its report by the end of 1970. During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed to prepare, on the basis of the recommendations of this com-
mission, a long-term plan for the Kenyanization of the Roads Branch. The
Government agreed to send this plan to the Association for comment within
six months of Government acceptance of the commission's report. If the
commission's report has not been accepted by the Government within six months
of signature of the Credit Agreement, the Government has agreed to consult
with the Association with a view to agreeing on further steps to be taken.
The Government and the Association also agreed to review the understudy plan
(para. 4.05) from time to time, with a view to adjusting it if necessary
in light of the steps being taken under the plan for Kenyanization in order
to assure that the most effective use is being made of available talent.

C. The Maintenance Program
4.08      INBUCON has identified about 12,000 miles of main roads which have
deteriorated badly and which urgently require improved maintenance to re-
turn them to an adequate standard. The consultants have carefully defined
the works to be performed on this road network after evaluation of present
condition and economic importance. While the works do not involve any
changes in geometric standards, the ultimate outcome of proper maintenance
will be improved surface conditions and the lowering of vehicle operating
costs. This four-year program involves a substantial increase in the work-
load of the MOW and the proper execution of the works is dependent on the
successful implementation of all phases of the project.
Road Maintenance and Workshop Equipment
4.09      INBUCON estimated the amount of road maintenance equipment re-
quired to carry out the program and the necessary workshop equipment to
keep it in good repair, taking into account existing equipment and plant.
The make-up of the list is in accordance with the new field operations
proposed under the reorganization of the Roads Branch and consists mainly
of trucks, bulldozers, graders, loaders, water tankers and bitumen sprayers.
Table 6 shows the list of equipment and spare parts to be purchased under
the project.
Workshops, Offices and Road Camps
4.10      Under the reorganization, the number of roads to be maintained
by the Roads Branch has increased four-fold; the present regional facili-
ties are inadequate to handle this increased responsibility. Existing
regional workshops and offices will be improved and road camps will be
constructed or improved under the project. These will contribute to the
efficiency of maintenance works carried out under the maintenance program.
Training Center
4.11      A serious problem associated with the increased responsibilities,
reorganization, and strengthening of the Roads Branch is the lack of
maintenance personnel, including machine operators and mechanics, especial-
ly at the lower supervisory levels. A highway training center is pre-
sently being staffed and operated by INBUCON on a temporary basis. The
center's facilities, curriculum and staff must be improved, however, if
the 1,200 supervisors, operators, and mechanics required are to be pro-
vided. Under the project, an additional student accommodation to minimum
standards will be constructed. The principal and teachers who will assist
in administration, curriculum planning, and instruction (see Table 5) will
be provided under the project. The Government will provide teaching counter-
parts and a deputy principal who will serve as the principal's counterpart
and will handle most routine administrative work.
4.12      The training center is presently utilizing equipment on loan
from the regional maintenance centers of the Roads Branch for instruction
and demonstration. This equipment will be needed by the Roads Branch for
maintenance work. The equipment needs of the center will be provided



- 11 -
under the project. The proposed list of equipment, as recommended by
INBUCON and reviewed by the Association, is shown in Table 6. The U.K.
has offered bilateral assistance in the form of a grant amounting to
US$300,000 equivalent forw the training equipment.
D. Consultant Services
4.13      Consultants to be provided under the project will assist in im-
plementing the reorganization of the Roads Branch through introduction of
sound cost accounting techniques, budgeting, and management control proce-
dures. They will prepare specifications and bidding documents for the pur-
chase of the equipment and spare parts and will assist in tender prequalifi-
cation and evaluation. In addition, consultants will assist the Government
in the provision of experts for the Roads Branch and the training center
to the extent bilateral assistance cannot be found to provide these services.
E. Cost Estimates and Financing

4.15      The cost estimates for maintenance, workshop, and training
equipment are based upon current manufacturers' quotations. The esti-
mated costs for all building construction are based upon recent MOW ex-
perience. The costs for Roads Branch staffing support and consulting
services are based on INBUCON and MOW estimates reviewed by the Associa-
tion and are in accord with present international market conditions. A
contingency allowance amounting to 10% of the project cost is provided to
cover unforeseen expenditures. For price escalation, a further contingency
allowance of 5% is provided which reflects the amount of increase expected
in prices in both Kenya and other countries where equipment or materials
might orignate. These cost estimates and contingency allowances are rea-
sonable.



- 12 -
4.16      The Government has requested retroactive financing for INBUCON's
preliminary work on the contract documents for equipment purchases and the
operation of the training center since January 1, 1970. It is estimated
that the foreign cost of these services will amount to about US$150,000
by the end of 1970, when the credit is expected to be signed. Financing of
this amount is included in the proposed credit.
4.17      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$18.1 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange costs, about US$13.0 million equivalent,
will be met by an IDA credit of US$12.6 million equivalent (69% of total
project costs), and a grant from the U.K. amounting to US$400,000 equivalent
(2%).
4.18      In addition to financing the local costs of the project (US$5.1
million equivalent), the Government will finance all recurrent expendi-
tures needed to carry out the four-year maintenance program. These recur-
rent expenditures are expected to amount to approximately US$34 million
equivalent over the four-year period of the project (Table 7). During
negotiations, the Government confirmed that it will meet all local capital
costs and all recurrent costs required to ensure the successful implemen-
tation of the project.
F. Disbursements
4.19      Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) foreign exchange costs of foreign experts for
the Roads Branch, less bilateral assistance;
(b) C.I.F. costs of imported goods and equipment;
(c) 20% of expenditures on building construction and
improvement, which represents the estimated foreign
exchange component thereof; and
(d) foreign exchange costs for consultants' services.
An estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 8. Any surplus
funds remaining in the credit account upon completion of the project would
be cancelled.
G. Execution
4.20      The MOW will be responsible for execution of the project, with the
assistance of consultants employed under terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association. The Government has selected INBUCON, the consultants who
carried out the reorganization study of the MOW and are presently operating
the training center, to assist in introducing the new cost accounting and



- 13 -
management procedures. Table 9 shows the makeup of the project implementa-
tion team. The Government has also decided to engage the Crown Agents for
Overseas Governments and Administrations (U.K.) as consultants to assist
in the prequalification and evaluation of bids for equipment purchases.
The consultants selected by the Government are satisfactory to the Associa-
tion. Signature of the consultants' contracts is a condition for effectivenes
of the credit.
4.21      During negotiations, the Government confirmed that procurement of
equipment and spare parts, with the exception of goods provided under U.K.
techniical assistance, will be on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Bidding documents will be
submitted to the Association for review to assure that they conform to its
procedures. The equipment contracts will provide for delivery of about 20%
of the equipment in fiscal year 1971 and about 40% in each of the fiscal
years 1972 and 1973. Suppliers will be required under bond to provide an
adequate servicing organization in Kenya, and to maintain a reasonable
inventory of spare parts. The contracts will be awarded on the basis of
the lowest evaluated bids in terms of equipment purchase price, as well
as spare parts prices and availability, also taking into account the
advantages of standardization. Improvement and construction of the regional
workshops, offices, road camps, and training center buildings will be carried
out by government forces or by local contractors selected on the basis of
competitive bidding. The buildings are mostly of low standard construc-
tion, scattered all over the country, and would not attract international
bidding.
5. ECONOHIC EVALUATION
5.01      The objective of the proposed project is to ensure that economic
development is not hindered by the deterioration of the road network and
rising transport costs. Important sectors of the economy are dependent
upon a reliable and efficient road network. Agriculture is the dominant
sector, employing the vast majority of the population, and generating more
than 35% of total GDP. Efficient distribution of agriculture output,
especially perishables such as milk and green tea, requires a dependable
system of all-weather roads in rural areas.  Tourism is the fastest growing
sector and is the largest single earner of foreign exchange. Its continued
expansion will require a reliable and extensive road network. The growing
industrial sector requires an efficient network joining areas of produc-
tion, consumption and export/import. Thus the recently noted deterioration
of the road system threatens economic development on many fronts. The
proposed project is designed to improve the situation. By assuring that
the MOW is capable of adequately maintaining all economically important
roads, the project will also preserve the substantial investments already
made in the highway sector.



- 14 -
5.02      The economic benefits attributable to road maintenance have
been measured in terms of the savings in vehicle operating costs on the
12,000 miles of road included in the project. Other possible benefits,
such as savings due to postponing the need for costly reconstruction of
neglected roads, have not been included so as to permit an easily quan-
tifiable and conservative economic evaluation.
5.03      Since the project is concerned with an extensive system of
roads, the economic evaluation is based on an analysis of a representative
sample covering 1,683 miles of road, or about 14% of the project roads
(Table 10). INBUCON estimated unit savings in vehicle operating costs on
the sample roads and projected these to all project roads. (The Annex
describes the procedure used by the consultants.)
5.04      The MOW collects road transport data and summarizes them accord-
ing to approximate vehicle per day (vpd) categories. Traffic data for the
sample roads have been used to determine an average traffic figure for
each vpd category, which, in turn, has been applied to the total mileage
in the project. Normal traffic for the entire system is expected to grow
at an annual rate of 7% over the economic life of the project. No induced
or diverted traffic has been included in the economic evaluation.
5.05      The economic evaluation involves the comparison of the benefits
and costs (both capital and recurrent costs) expected to be generated by
the project over its economic life, reduced to their present values (Table
11). All benefits and costs are measured on a with and without basis,
net of taxes, duties, and similar levies. Two investment criteria are
employed: the internal economic rate of return and the ratio of the bene-
fits and costs, expressed in present value terms. The economic life of the
project is taken to be seven years, based upon INBUCON's estimate of the
physical life of the equipment. A salvage value of the equipment has been
computed in accordance with the timing of the procurement, using straight-
line depreciation. For calculating the benefit-cost ratio a discount rate
of 10% was used. For sensitivity purposes, the calculations were also
carried out using a discount rate of 14%. It is estimated that the oppor-
tunity cost of capital in Kenya is within this range of discount rates. The
following table summarizes the results of these calculations which indicate
that the project is economically sound.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The following are the major matters discussed and agreed upon
during credit negotiations:
(a)  The Government will appoint experts, with qualifications
and experience acceptable to the Association, to fill all
the positions under the staffing and training program
within nine months of signature of the Credit Agreement
(para. 4.03).
(b)  The Government will prepare a long-term plan for the
Kenyanization of the Roads Branch on the basis of the
recommendations of the commission which is presently
reviewing the conditions of service and remuneration
of the public service, and will send this plan to the
Association within six months of Government acceptance
of the commission's report. If the commission's report
has not been accepted by the Government within six
months of signature of the Credit Agreement, the Govern-
ment will consult with the Association with a view to
agreeing on further steps to be taken (para. 4.07).
6.02      The following have been agreed as conditions for effectiveness of
the credit:
(a) Agreement between the Government and the Association on
the plan to provide understudies to experts in the Roads
Branch (para. 4.05); and
(b) Signature of the contracts with the consultants who have
been selected to assist in project implementation and in
equipment tendering (para. 4.20).
6.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$12.6 muillion equivalent to the Government of Kenya.

Notes on Procedures for Estimating
Savings in Vehicle Operating Costs
1.        Because the project is concerned with a whole system of
roads--i.e., 12,000 miles of roads in various conditions and with differ-
ent design grades, the economic evaluation is based on an analysis of a
representative sample. This sample covers 1,683 miles of roads, or about
14% of the system (Table 10), and was chosen on the basis of traffic
density, rainfall, elevation and geographic location.
2.        INBUCON (U.K. consultants) determined the vehicle operating
costs for all types of roads and road conditions. These costs, shown
in the table below, were derived from investigations by the U.K. Road
Research Laboratory and from recent consultant studies, including the
East Africa Transport Study. The table shows, for example, that the
estimated cost of operating a heavy vehicle on an earth road ranges from
about K Sh 2.22/mi to K Sh 1.99/mi, whereas on an engineered gravel road,
the range is from about K Sh 1.54/mi to K Sh 1.32/mi.

3.        In order to estimate savings in vehicle operating costs, INBUCON
(a) assessed the present condition of each sample road; and (b) estimated
the condition that could be achieved solely through improved road main-
tenance. Each sample road was first graded by awarding points for differ-
ent characteristics such as riding quality, gradients, etc., at frequent
intervals over its length. The points relate specific road conditions
to vehicle operating costs, as shown in the above table, and therefore,
the point score for any particular road indicates the cost of operating
a vehicle on it in its present state. To estimate the condition achiev-
able through improved maintenance, the consultants then selected a point
level within the road's design grade, and the vehicle operating costs
associated with it. Thus, for example, if the consultants felt that,
by improved maintenance, a particular semi-engineered gravel road could
be improved from its present state with a point score of 49, to a condition
with a score of 55, the cost of operating a heavy vehicle on it would be
reduced from about K Sh 1.65/mi to K Sh 1.55/mi. The savings for the sample
roads in each vpd category were averaged and applied to the total project
mileage.
