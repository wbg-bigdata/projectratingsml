PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION AND CAD COMPOSITE PROJECT
(Loan 1251-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Andhra Pradesh
Irrigation and CAD Composite Project in India, for which Loan 1251-IN in
the amount of US$145.0 million was approved on June 10, 1976. The Loan was
closed on June 30, 1985, three years beh4nd schedule. The last disburse-
ment was on December 31, 1985 and undisbursed balance of US$8.55 million
was cancelled.
This PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of
the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
On February 14, 1990, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the
request to prepare Part II by April 4, 1990, but none was received.
Preparation of this PCR wa  started during the Bank's final r-¶ir-
vision mission of the project in April 1985, and is based, inter alit
the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal
Bank memoranda.

ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION AND CAD COMPOSITE PROJE(T (LN. 1251-INM
PROJECT COMPLTION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMARY
Objectdves
1.   The project was to finance the completion of wirgation infstruction on three existing
irrigation schemes in Andhra Pradesh, namely: the Naga;junasagar (NSP) on the Krishna,
theTungabhadra (TBP) on the river of that name joining the Krishna, and the Pochampad (PBP) on
the Godavar. Command area development activities were to be extended on the NSP, TJBP and
PBP. Rural road network in NSP was to be enhanced. And a detailed study of system loses was
to be undertaken (Part I, para. 6).
hnplIMentAdo Eaxecd=
2.   Project start up was delayed due mainly to inadequate local funding, prourent problems
and reluctance of farmers to finance on farm development woks. To rectify these problems and
to make a number of technical adjustments, the project was reformulated (Part L para. 12-13).
3.    With redefined objectives , the project gathered momentum, inspite of continued
inadequate funding Physical construction standards were generally acceptable. Most components
substantally achieved their physical targets. Field channel, field drain and land shaping
achievements far exceeded even revised targets. It has been reported that items not completed by
the extended June 1985 closing date were continued under state flmding and completed two years
later (PartI, L aram 14-17).
4.   There was a lack of commitment by GOAP in carrying out prescribed studies. The most
important study concerning operation characteistics seepage losses and water use efficiency
suffered serious delays, and after its completion its results were not analyzed. Now, all measuring
devices are unserviceable. A study carried out by a Bank technical consultant found that main
conveyance capacity enhancement was required (Part I, para 18, and Part m Table 6D). There
was also an almost lack of interest by both GOAP and the Bank in the agricultural extension
component of the project (Part I para. 19). The Bank's lack of interest is evidence by the absence
of an agdculturist or an agriculture extension expert in all but a few of the Bank's supervision
missions (Part m, Table 8B). The conversion from high paddy cultivation to inigated dry crops
would have been significantly aided by a well trained extension service in the commands.
Project Results
5.    The project's physical objectives had been largely met and, for some components,
exceeded (Table 4, P rt m). The main project shortomings reflected in the project's economic
viability and future sustainability, relate to water distribution system (Part L para. 24) and
sanctioned cropping patterns (Part I, para. 25). Unless these are corrected, inefficiencies and
inequities in water distribution and cropping patterns will not allow full realization of inigation
benefits, and may cause waterlogging and salinity problems in heavily irrigated areas.
g     ~~Sustainability
6.   In 1988/89 only 61% of the command received irrigation supplies in Kharif and 36% in
rabi. Due to a decline in water allocation, a decline in iurigated area can be anticipated. This can



iii
only be improved through GOAP's efforts to induce farmers to adopt the design cropping pattern
and bymaking the disbribution system more efficient. In addition, more attention is needed
towards improving agricultural practices of farmers in the commands. Because of protests by
tailend farmers who received inadequate water supplies, GOAP has approved lift and gully
diversion irigaton in deprived areas. This altornative source would serve about 71,900 ha at at
cost of about Rs.200 M but at no cost to farmers. This brings into question GOAP's intention to
operate the NSP as intended by the project, as well as which sector will be deprived of scarce
electric power that wil be required to operate the pumps (Part I, paa. 29-30).
Findings and Lessons Learnt
7.    One of the project's shorcomings was GOAPs lack of interest in the agricultmual
component of the project This was exacerbated by the absence of agriculturist. or agriculkre
extension experts in most but a few Bank supervision missions. Farmers in the command could
have benefitted from improved agricultural practices. The Bank should have been more resolute in
dealing with State government's defaults on covenants which sexiously impaired project
performance and sustainablity. The project received considerable technical assistance from Bank's
engineers, hydrologists and technical experts during supewvsion missions. Not only can such
level of technical assistance be sustained, but it may lead to instances where the Bank is held
responsible, directly or indirecdy, for results of such technical assistance (Part I, pam 32-33).

Projet Completion Report
The project aimed to  lete irgaton infras    on thee existog irgation schemes
in Andhra Pradesh, together with some xtension of comand areas,  ral s  progam and
sues related to improving irigation efficiency. Followg a slow start, due mainly to inadequate
local funding, procurement problems and reluctance of farmers to finance OFD works, the project
was reformuated to taie account of these problems and to make a number of technical
adjustments. The proect subsequendy gathered momentum and at fime of compledon, 2-l/2 years
after the appraisal tre the projects physical objectives had been largely met and, for some
components, exeeded. The main project shomings, which are importantly reflected in the
pjet's economic viability and future stsainabil, relaeo the water distribution system and
sanctioned cropping paers. Iefficiencies and ieqies in water distribution and cropping
patterns will not allow full realizaton of iigation benefits and may cause waterlogging and salini-'
problems in heavily inigated areas. If these problems are tackled, a rate of return of 7% v.'ould
result as opposed to 4% if current practices continue. More attention is also needed towards
mproving agricultural practices of farmers in the commands and on studies and monitoring of
systemnefficiency.
1 .   The Project fell in the irrigation sub-sector of the agricultural sector of Bank lending
operaions in India A Loan of US$145.0 M was made to Govenmment of India (GOI) on June 10,
1976 foronward financing to Govemment of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) through the normal center-
stae arrangements then in force.
Backgon
2.    The principal objedve in the agricltual sector was and continues to be the increase in
food and fiber production to achieve national self sufficiency, and to raise living standards of the
ral populaton. In the decade prior to project inception, the ovell growth in agricultural
production was disappoinng, averaging about 3% per year; only marginally above population
growth rae.
3.   To atempt to improve the rate of increase in agricultural production, GOI policy after
independence sought to make agricultue less dependent upon the vagaries of climate. As a result,
rapid expansion of irrigation took place, achieving a rate of expansion of irrigation area potential of
*about 4.5% per year. Much of this was due to ground water exploitaion. Surface water schemes
on the other hand were disapp ing in their achievement. Although many had been commenced,
their consructon periods were longerthan planned, resulting in progressively larger allocation of
national rso  tes with ver delyed benefits. To attept to rec   this, G0I policy moved to the
completion of on-going wors and more timely realization of benefits.



2
4.   In addidon to delayed reazatdon of irnigadon potential, those surface water projects wbich
had been completed were achieving production much below potendal, together with inequitable
distribution of benefits to prq,ect farmers. These shortcomings were the results of inappropriate or
inadequate opeadonal nrles and the dominance of farmers in the upper reaches of the main
conveyance .ystem, often with politcal and operating staff backing. To atmpt to overwme these
deficiencies in operation, GOI intrduced the concept of Command Area Development (CAD),
which dtrough project-specific authoities would complete the distibution system to farm level,
assist with land shaping to give higher water application efficiency, enhance agricultural support
sevices, and improve canal operation schedules.
5.   In Andhra Pradesh (AP) at the time of project preparation, some 70% of the population
were dependent upon agriculture, and only about 25% of the cultivated area was under inigation.
With substantial untapped water resources at its disposal, including the interstate Godavan and
Krishna rivers, GOAP was investing heavily in irrigation development. Tree major projects,
namely Nagajunasagar (NSP) on the Krishna, Tungabadra (TBP) on the river of that name joining
the Krishna, and Pochambad (PBP) on the Godavari accounted for nearly half the state surface
water inigation potentiaL All three projects suffered from the deficiencies noted above.
aroect Ohietive and Desonm
6.   The project aimed to complete the physical development of inuctre on NSP, and to
extend CAD activities on NSP, TBP and PBP. In NSP, the rural road network would be
enhanced, and a detaied study of system loses would be made in order to determine apprpriate
measures to improve efficiency.
7.    The project components at apprisal were:
NSP
a) complete Left Main Canal (LMC) by extending it by 65 miles, and increase the
command area by 191,000 hal to reach its full design area of 397,000 ha;
b) complete the Right Main Cnal (RMC) by extending it by 29 miles, and to incre ethe
command area by about 140,000 ha to reach its full design area of 475,000 ha;
c) construct or rehabilitate about 1575 km of rual roads;
d) carty out CAD works (field cbannels, field drains and land shaping) over about
16,000 ha in LMC and 16,000 ha in RMC commands; and
e) studies, including system opation and seepage losses, project moderization, and
farm irigation cEficiencies.
BP and PBP
a) cary out CAD woks over 6400 ha in TBP and 33,600 ha in PBP,
a) reorganize and improve the agricultural extension services in each area, and
b) monitor crop yields.

Reference to Table 4, Part m gives quantitative details of works, and Table 6D, Part m the
prescribed studies.
8.    The total project cost was estimated at Rs 2673 M (US$297M). Details are given in Tab'e
SA, Part IIL An IBRD Loan of US$145.0 M was made, the proceeds of which are shown in
Table SB, Part m. It should be noted that whereas a cost estmate of Rs 21.9 M was made for
agricultual extension improvements, no provision was made for ebursement under the Loan.

rspectively.
EIject Design and Organization
9.    The project was thoroughly prepared and well appr    based on clearly defined
objecives. All peripheral actities sh as studies and agrcultal extension  ovements were
in context. It is reported by those GOAP officials sdll available for cment that the prject as
defined at appraisal was well understood by GOAP. The project was not innovative in that it
sought to develop the command areas by conventional metods and standard engineering criteria..
Although the measurement of seepage losses and the study of system opeations woud in
intenational practice be routine procedurs, under Indian coœditions these could be considered
innovative in that they are generally neglected or not consdered. Again, in intenational practice,
the close association of agricultral extension services i; inigation projects is considered the norm,
whereas under Indian conditions it is the exception. This emphasis under the project could also be
considered innovative.
10.  Tbree major assumptions were made at appraisal, reinforced by GOAP assurances. Two
(a) and b) below) have already been proved unfounded, and the third (c) is likely to be the cause of
considerabh instability to NSP later. These assumptions were with espect to:
a)    CAD Worsi
It was assumed that the farmers would pay the full cost of field channel, field dain, and land
levelling works, together with a 15% surcharge to contribute to CADA overheads, by taking loans
fi-m commercial and land development banks, and from Aricultural Refinance and Development
Corpor-ion (ARDC). It was also assumed that land levellig would be compulsory, so permitting
the woks to proceed in discet blocks. In the event, the famers refused to pay for these woks,
and no legislation exised or was introduced to cover this. Due to thei reluctance to caopate,
CAD works made litle progress until reformulation.
b)    Crpping Pattern
In AP, the system of "loclization" is used whereby the authorities give permanent sanctions to the
farmers to grow paddy or "liigated Wet" (W), field crops or "Irigation Dry" (ED), or pennials
such as sugar cane. In the cropping patr  assumed in the SAR, the NSP futmre with project
patterns contained much reduced IW in favor of enhanced ID. On these were based funre
econonmc projections and the savings in water which would permit the extension areas to be
supplied It was assumed that GOAP would induce the farmers aready growing excessive paddy
to convent to the new patemns by persuasion and water rotation means. Regrettably this has not
ocurrd, with GOAP taking no steps to corect the situaton. The results of this will be discussed
below.
c) W-alArhlloatdo
Under the terms of the Krishna Waters Tribunal of December 1973, the NSP was allocated 264



4
TMC2 annUy. As may upsteam project in AP, and in the riparin states of Maharashtra and
Kamataka wee sd!l udae development, the pnoject concept penmitted NSP to draw considerably
more than this amount until upstream abstacdon reduced supplies progressively to the Tribunal
quot.l Due to antiipted (at apprasal) savings due to improved system efficiency and ID
dominant crop mix, tt was pled that this reduction would be absobed with no loss of inigated
area. Mhere is no indicaton that either water saving exped&nt is occuming.
11.   Due to the     and prolonged preparation, and the very explicit SAR, all GOAP
agencies shoud have been fully awa' of thek roles and responsibilites. A separate and detaid
agreement was signed between the Bank and ARDC for financing the CAD component. In
rrspect the following major omissions or inapropriate conditions were made at appsal:
a) An overaU Project Manage shoud have been included to ensure close coordnation
and phasing ben the constituent agencies;
b) a prqec monitoing cell shoud bave been fomed under the project manager,
c) the procurment method prescibed with its over emphasis on ICB procedures for
NSP main canals was unwodrable and excessively time consuming, and the later
adopted package and slice system was more appit
d) the Bank should have insisted that area proportional, supply controlled, rotatonal
water supply should be itduced in all NSP, and
e) the Bank should also have id  upon the raisingof 0  & M funding to a level
which would have pemitted the old NSP area distribution sysem to be rehabiitated,
and to ensure that al the system would be rehabii  and   ense that all the system
woula be maintAned in effective rnning order in the fute. Section 3.04 (a) of the
LA was inadequa.
Ejec Ridomlafi
12. FoDlowing Loan effectiveness in September 1976, the project made a very disappointing
sta, due mainly to very inadequate funding, to pent problems, and to the famers
relucmce to finance OFD warks. Reference toTable 3, Part m shows the very slow
disbursement aein the first th  years of the projecL In addion, the following addnional
shor    ngs clearly manest themselves:
a) A lack of GOAP commitment to the run   road component, with admisratve sanction
only being given in 1979,
b) no legislaton to induce fams to finance CAD works;
c) an assessment that the seepage losses in the NSP distribution system were three times
or more than those assume at appraisal;
d) the observation that in the NSP, in the RMC command increasing paddy was being
grown in areas sanctioned for ID, and in the LMC command paddy was increasing in
rabi season, both makdng excessive water demands; and
2 TMC = thousand million cubic feet 1.00 TMC = 28.34 MCM



5
e) due to c), d) and the sdll dpdated ste of the distribution system, only 75% of target
area m LMC and 80% ir RMC were reiving irigation
13.   As GOAP was not responsive to the Banks advice to coirect these shortcogs, the Bank
advised GOAP by letter dated Seember 21, 1979 that it was contemplating suspension of
disbusemnts unde- the Loa' This led to a positive response, and an agment to reformuate
the prqect accoviingly. Refoaulation activides took place duing the period October 1979 to May
1980. A technical report was proded summaing the findings and  cmendadons.
14.   As a result, the projectscope was mvised as follows:
a)  Ihe LMC command area infr   ewas reduced by 44,000 ha to give a rvised
target of 147,000 13 A  link dwns were deleted;
b) the RMC command area infrastructur was maintained at the previously defined
140,000 ha but link dramins were deleted;
c) the upper reaches of LMC over 72 miles to be lined to inease its capacity to 390
cumecs;
d) the lower reaches of the RMC to be remodelled to increase its capacity to 120 cumecs,
e) absob all field channelsiield drains under the capl works budget, and waive the
15% overhead charge to the farmes Area o be covered increased to 147,000 ha in
LBC command and to 128,400 ha in RBC command; and
f) the roads component was reduced in scope.
TBP and PBP
a) All field chamel and fied drain nuctimon deleted.
a) The partial construcon and eq  g of a Water and Ln Managmnt
1ntt (WALAMTARI) at H  erabaci
All rvised quantities are detai'ed in Table 4, Part IEL
15.  The revised cost estmate was RS 2672 M, virtuay unchanged from apprasaL Revised
detailed cost esmates are shown in Table SA, Part IL The evised ERRs for various
cniIguratons are shown in Tabe 6B, Part m, and they were simil to ap    estimate  An
extension in Loan closing was granted to June 1984. The refoulated pect definitions were
formally conveyed to GOAP by Bank's letter dated May 12, 1980.
16. The Bank sought assurances from GOAP that:
a) Adequate budget prvisions would be made for al designated items,
including rmral and service roads;



6
b) the NSP, LMC and RMC capacities would be increased as specified-; and
c) adequate water would be detvered to the Bank NSP areas.
Inexplicably, in view of their crucial influence on the project success, no assurances were required
with respect to adherencethe revised cropping panern nor for adequate O&M fimd allocations.
Possibly due to these omions, the poject is stil (1989) dominantly paddy and the distibution
system is still dilapidated.
17. With redefined objectives, the project gathered momentum following reformulation. It was
stll, however, inhibited due to inadequate funding. Physical construction stndards were
generally acceptle~, although NSP main canal remodlling; especially on the LMC, was seriously
constrained due to extended operation of the system for paddy interests in the upper reaches, thus
giving only a vely limited time for constrction works Reference to Table 4, Part m indicates that
most components substantially achieved their targets. Indeed, due to the GOI assisted CAD
programme, the field channel, fielddrain and land shaping achievements far exceeded even revised
targets. It is reported that all items not completed by the closing date (extended) of June 1985 were
continued under state funding, and were completed by June 1987.
18.  Of serious concern was the lack of commitment by GOAP in can-ying out the prescribed
stdies. Table 6D, Part H lists the studies, and it is noted that only crop yields and patterns were
regularly reiewed by CADA and Agricultue Department. The most inportant studices, on which
the extension of command area of NSP was contingent, concerning operation charceisdcs,
seepage losses, and water use efficiency were only given cursory attention. Although discharge
measuing devices wae insalled dtoughout the system to provide data for these studies, they
were in poor condition duing project execution, and are now reported to be all neglected and
unserviceable. The only serious and meaningful study was carried out by a Bank technical
consultant at considerable expense to the Bank, and it was his observations which were largely
responsible for the realition that main conveyance capacity  ancement was required.
19. A second shortcoming was the almost total lack of interest by either GOAP or Bank
supervsion missions in the agricultural extension component Had it been subject to
reimbursement under the Loan, this may have been less pronounced. It is unfortunate, as the
important conversion from high paddy cultivadon to ID crops would have been significandy aided
by a positive, well trained extension service in the commands.
20.  The Loan was closed, after a further one year extension, on June 30, 1985. The cost of the
project on that date was RS 2558.4 M, somewhat below previous estes. An amount of

Potential Created and Utlized (NSP)
21. The development of irrigation in NSP since 1967 is given in Table 9A, Part III for LMC
and 9B for RMC. Also shown is water utilized on each systm. The deductions which may be
made fiom these are:
a) Although RMC at full development wfll be 20% larger than LMC, both get
the same water allocation;



7
b)  in 1987/88 and 1988/89, LMC total, isAon areas were greater tan
RMC;
c) in 1988/89, assuming an average clmatic yea, the miTiMaton itensity of
LMC was 111% andon RMC wasonly 86%; and
d) the maximum area irigated in any season on LMC was 341,080 ha (86%
of target commd size) and on RMC was 299,726 ha (63% of target
command size).
It is learned that on both c-'nxa- s, the main canl capadties with the pesent paddy dominant
crop mix have been reach: t, *L 4ing that only mode increase in inigation is possible.
22.   The development of iugation in the "Bank' mas idenfied at appraisa since 1978 is given
in Table 1QA, Part m for LMC and Table lOB for RMC. The following deductions may be made:
a) Since 1986J87, the iigation intensities on each command are similar,
b) sn 1988/89, irrigation intensity on LMC was 69% and on RMC was 64%;
and
c) the maximum area irigated in any season was 13, 128 ha on LMC (68%
of taget command size) and 79,434 ha on RMC (57% of target cmmand
size).
23.   Overal dedutons from the above include:
a) Although the LMC has favored treatment with a higher specific water
allocatin ghing it a higher cropping intendty ovell tan RMC, the
Bank-financed areas would appear to have been equitably ltated;
b) dte cropping intensities on the Bank areas are significandy below those for
the whole commands, indicating a severe    tag  compad with
upper reaches of the systems; and
c) 'iit present in canal capacites and crop mixes, a limit has nearly been
eached whereby the mamum as dut can be inigated are 86% of LMC
and 63% of RMC considering the whole potential command areas.
The pect is thus orafing in a very inequitable manner, with LMC receiving significandy higher
benefits than RMC and wit the Bank areas eceiving inadequate water supplies, thus yielding
much lower benefits than anticipated at appraisa  Much of each command receives no irrigatio
WaterUtilizaion MNSP
24.  It is recalled that NSP will be limited under the Krshna Tribunal allocation to 264 TMC by
about 2005 D. It is of inteest to review the recent water usage on the project given in the
following table:



8
LMC
1984/85              210.6       209.1
1985/863             169.2       167.8
1986/87              197.0       195.0
1987/88 3            153.5       150.8
1988/89              203.0       206.7
There is no indication of declne in water use as agreed at appaisal and reformuation. In an
average year, some 400 TMC ar being utilized, and indeed even with this excessive amount,
Tables 9A and 9B, Part m point te an irrigation intensity of only 98% overall in 1988/89. It is
thus difficult to envisage the NSP achieving its design performance over its full command area of
872,000 ha at utimate development on its Tribunal allocation of 264 TMC
Cropping Pattem (NSP)
25.  A current review ofthe crpping pattem indicates that in those areas localized" for II, the
farmers are grwing some 80%4 of paddy. The reasons for this appear to be:
a) political favors for famers in the upper reaches;
b) connivance of operaing staff in permitting excess water delivery to these
areas;
c) pleniful water supply-
d) very small farm sizes (about 0.8 ha average), with all fames wishirg to
grow subsistence paddy for fimily consumption due to dietary preference.
Reason (d) indicates that even with low rtuns to the farmers from paddy compared with certain
ID crops, due to dietary habits and the need for subcsise   production it is unly tiat they wil
voluntarily change into U) production as planned.
Economic Rate of Retun (NSP)
26.  A summary of ERR's for different configumtions and scenarios is given in Table 6B,
Parto   Three scenaios have been analyzed:
a) The cropping pattem proposed at appr , assuming whole command
area iigated and system fully upred. This is the ideal situation.
b) contminug present high paddy content with 400 TMC per year and system
unimproved.
c) continung present high paddy content with reducdon in water supplies to
264 TMC, and system unimproved.
All ERR estimates are below acceptable norms, but if GOAP resolutely tackles the crop mix and
system uprting, a Bank area ERR of about 7% would result If not, and if the present trend

continues with reduction in wate supply to the Tribunal allocation of 264 TMC, the ERR will be
about 4%.
27.  Other indications of project benefits are given in Table 6A, Part EL Of those listed, only
the following have been assessed:
a) C     cations:
These will have been improved considerably by the roads  vement progm. It is
not possible to quantify the benefits.
b) Farm Income:
The increases in net farm income are sim  to appraisal predictions if the design
cropping a,tte  is foliowed. If the present level of paddy cultivaton coninues, then
the will be minimal increase.
28.  In NSP, the project has had minimal influence on insitutional and human resource
development While poverty alleviation woud result in those newly developed areas formnate
enough to receive water, the distribution of income is thought to have widened between head and
tail end farmes This will be exacbated as water allocations diminish. A sedous environmental
danger exists in the heavily irrigated areas from waterlogging and consequent salinity.
29.  With only 61% of the command receiving irrigation supplies in khaif and 36% in rabi in
1988/89 with some 410 TMC, a future decline in irrigated amea can be anticipated in view of the
future decline in water allocation. An imovt could only be achieved if GOAP resolutely
nduces farmens to adopt the design cropping paten, and by making the distribudon system more
efficient
30.  Indeed, due to vociferous protests to GOAP by tailend farmers, who received inadequate or
no water, GOAP has approved lift and gully diversion irrigation in the deprived areas. This is
reported to be of the following extent
MC   RMC
__(ha)--
-  lift (pumped)             -          32,000
irigation
-  guly diversion          26,500       13,400
Thus some 71,900 ha would be served by alternadve sources, with RMC supplement mainly in the
Bank financed areas, at a total cost of well over Rs 200 MK The insutllations would be constucted
and opeted by AP Irrigation Development Corporaion, and no costs would be charged to the
farmers, even for operations. With such an outlay, it is questioned whether GOAP ever intends to
opemted the NSP as intended, thus failing to meet its undertkng to the Bank A further quesdon
may be raised in a stae so short of electic power - which sector will be deprived in order to
operatetheppumps?

Bank PeFocce
31.   The Bank, apat from emors ofjudgement on GOAP's comment concerning water
distibution, on which the project benefits and justification were founded, canied out a careful and
well documnted prepton and appisal Subsequently, ef      on, although insufficiently
rigorous with respect to the disquieting trends in water use and crop patterns, took into account
other consraints and the remientation was appropriate.
32.   Refrnce to Table 8B, Part m shows a very large number of missions, especially technical
missions comprising engineers, hydrologists and systems    *alistsm Thus the pject receved
considerable technical assstance at Bank expense. A signifiant weakess in Bank supervision
was the neglect of the agricultual component generally, and the minimal supeion of PBP and
TBP CAD wc-ks.
33.   Lessons leamed from the record of Bank acivities would include:
a) Supervision of multifaceted irrigadon projects should be by composite
missions comprising agricultui  also;
b) non-engieering acdvides should receive more atention;
c) the Bank should be more resolute m dealing with State govements
where defaults on covenants seriously impair project peiformance and
sustainabiEty; and
d) mechanisms need to be found, through use of project consultants or
otherwise, to reduce the detailed demands on Bank engineers during
project supervision.
Bonowrs Perftmance
34.   The GOAP performance was satisfactory in engineering and CAD consructdon aspects. It
was deficient in providing funds thoughout most of the project period, and it was most inadequate
regding the opertional aspect, including
-  O&M funding;
-  inducement of changemin cop patten;
- political influence affecting canal closures and equity of water supply,
-  system studies; and
- lack of resolution in collecting water charges.
Pmiect Relaionships
35.   The strength of the BankIOAP reladonship lay in the technical coordination between the
engineers of the respective agencies lAtde contact was made between the Bank, te prject
audties and the GOAP Agricultal Department with reference to the project specific agdcultural
services.
Project Services
36.   No consultants were employed by GOAP during the project, but following Loan closure a
GOAP corpation was retancd to assist with the PCR preparato  After four years, a modest
report was submited which was inadequate in scope. All constucdon wois were by contracts,



11
the larger of which performed satisfactorily. Small works such as CAD OHD were largely
executed by local conteto, and quality was m general inadequate. Land levellng was largely by
the fanners.
37.  Peived weaknesses in the legal documents include:
a) Section 2.03 (a) LA
It was with hindsight not prudent to have encouaged GOAP to abstra more than its
allocion of 264 TMC for NSP as an interim measure, without having first evolved
and received agreement on a detailed plan to progo'ssively reduce ulzation to that
amount. This has encouraged wastef  use by favored farmers, given rise to
watelogging hazards, ar1 has defered the inevitable rehabilitation of the older
distributon system as there is no incentive to use water economically.
b) No covenant was pribed in the legal documents to require GOAP to
bring about a change in the cropping pattern to ensure adequate water
supplies to the whole command.
38.  The SAR, followed by the Reformuation Technical Report, prvided sound bases for
project execution. In addition, many technical reports were submitted to GOAP by Bank missions,
which were invariably of high standari The PCR preparation has been more difficult than normal
due to the length of time that has elapsed since Loan closue. However, the Bank preparaton team
was provided with all relevant data from GOAP archives dming its visit to Hyderabad, and
received the full cooperation of Secretary (rigation and CAD), and semor officials of the imvolved
agencies.

Notes:
1/     No training component was included in the SAR. Following request
by GOAP, the Bank included the construction, equipping and
operation of WALMI, Hyderabad. This was established as a
Department under CAD Department in May 1982, but was redesignated
WALANTARI (Water and Land Management, Training and Research
Institute). The Loan Agreement was amended at Section 1.02 and the
Project Agreement at Section 2.09. An allocation of US$ l.OM was
made in the adjusted Loan proceeds.
2/     The project included a component aimed at reorganising the
extension services, complete with provision of vehicles,
accommodation, offices and equipment. From the later supervision
reports, it is difficult to assess the progress or impact of this
component. No allocation of funds was made under the Loan
Agreement.
J/    Most of CADA works were carried out under GOI assisted programme,
as indicated by above target physical achievement with much below
target expenditure.

Notes:
This assmmes that the project will trend to the revised cropping
patterns. If not, and the present pattern persists with high paddy
percentage, the future net income would be about Rs. 2123 per
hectare of irrigated land for the left bank command, and about Rs.
2047 per hectare of f'rigated land for the right bank command. In
this case, however, Irrigation intensities would be very low on
average.
