HEORBUMlU hAND RECOKMENDATION
OF TER PRESIDENT OF
TEE 1NTIRN&TIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TUE EMECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MULAVI
*                                       FOR POWER V PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Republic of Malawi for
SDR39.2 million (US$55 million equivalent) to help finance a power project. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years,
including 10 years of graoe. An amount of US$53.75 million will be on-lent to
the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi (ESCON) for 20 years including 5
years grace, at 7.23Z rate of interest, with ESCOC  taking the foreign exchange
risk. The remaining -mount of SDR0.89 million (US$1.25 million equivalent) will
be passed on to the Department of Economic Planning and Development (EPD), the
Petroleum Coutrol Commission (PCC) and the Tobacco Control Commission (TCC). The
Project would be cofinanced by the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the
European Investment Bank and the African Development Bank in the amounts of:
PStg15 million (US$25 million equivalent), ECU15 million (US$18 million
equivalent) and US$27.7 million equivalent respectively.
2.          Backzoond. Malawi is a landlocked country with 1990 population of
about 8.5 million. Average per capita income in 1990 was low at US$190. The
economy is predominantly rural with some 891 of the population living in rural
areas. Major exports are tobacco, tea and sugar. After a period of healthy
economic expansion in the 1970s, with GDP increasing at an average of over 4.51
per year, declining export earnings and the security situation in Mozambique
slowed economic growth during the 1980s to an average of only 1.81 per year, well
below the current population growth of 3.5S per year. Increases in smallholder
output, exports and increased balance of payments support, helped stimulate
economic recovery in 1988-90, vhen economic growth averaged over 51.
3.          Per capita energy consumption in 1989 was 0.36 tonnes of oil
equivalent, among the lowest in Africa. The predominant source of energy is
woodfuel which, together with agricultural residues, accounts for almost 921 of
total final energy consumption. Imported petroleum accounts for 52, electricity
for 21, coal and ethanol for less than 11. Almost all electricity is from
hydroelectric sources, with only 161 of the country's potential having been
tapped so far. Malawi's 381 of forestry cover is dwindling at 3.51 per year.
The energy sector, which in 1990 consumed 161 of export earnings for import of
petroleum products and some coal, has a significant role to play in the economic
development of Malawi. The Government's sectoral objectives are: minimizing the
impact of the high cost and of the uncertainties in supply of imported oil and
coals developing a sustainable program for meeting woodfuel demand; and meeting
electric power demand in a least cost manner.  To achieve these sectoral
objectives, the Government is pursuing the following strategiess improving the
procurement and distribution of petroleum and exploring for coal; supporting the
production of ethanol for blending with petroleum as transport fuel; encouraging
improved woodland management and conservation of woodfuel resources including
conversion of forest thinnings to softwood charcoal; developing and implementing
a least cost power development program; and strengthening  energy sector
Institutions and Government's capability for energy planning and co-ordination.



-2-
4.          The Government is taking a variety of initiatives to improve the
management of the country's wood energy revources on a cost effective and
eavironmentally sound basis.  The ongoing Ruerpv I project, in vhich IDA is
involved, is actively supporting increased woodfuel supply and wood energy
conservation. The Government has established the Petroleum Control Commission
to supervise petroleum procurement and distribution.   Ethanol blending is
educing petroleum imports by about 72. A least cost power development program
"as been prepared and adopted by the Government in 1988.   This program
recommended that Tedzani III hydroelectic power plant (the third phase of hydro
power development at Tedzani Falls), currently being implemented under the
ongolng Energy I Project, followed by Rapichira (the main component of the
proposed Power V Project) are the next least cost options to meet Malawi's power
needs up to the turn of the century.
5.          Rational. for IDA's Involvement.  Greater efficiency in the supply
and use of energy, decreasing dependence on imported energy sources and seeking
measures to minimize the depletion of indigenous woodfuel resources, are key
elements of the Government's structural adjustment program which the Bank is
supporting. The Bank/IDA has helped finance four power projects in the p&st,
including the ongoing Energy I Credit. By helping finance the proposed Power V
Project, IDA can seek to enosure that a comprehensive and least cost approach is
used for the development of the capital intensive power sub-sector.  IDA"s
continued involvement =n the power sector would: (i) help sustain the expansion
of the industrial and commercial activities in which the private sector
participates; (ii) expand access of electricity to households, particularly in
urban areas, thereby contributing to substitution of a cleaner, more versatile
fuel for environmentally damaging and increasingly scarce woodfuels5 and (iii)
provide continuity in capacity building support to energy sector institutions.
IDA's involvement would help fill part of the resource gap facing the power sub
sector and would also assist to mobilize and optimally direct additional donor
aid flows.
6.          Project Objectives.  The main objective of the Project is to assist
the Government and ESCOM to implement the priority components of the least cost
power development plan. The specific objectives are to: meet the growing demand
for power through the construction of the Rapichira hydroelectric scheme and the
rehabilitation of the existing power stationsa improve the quality and efficiency
of power supply through reinforcing the transmission and distribution systms to
minimize outages and reduce losses; strengthen the capacity of the energy sector
Institutions to plan and manage the energy sector, and support 'an rationalization
of sector wide energy pricing policies.
7-          Project Descrintion.   The pgnr_ sg9_*e_mt of the Project would
compriset (a) construction of a 50MW (first phase) of a hydroelectric power
plant at Kapichira Falls; (b) rehabilitation of the Mxisting hydro, gas turbine
snd diesel power plants to improve their availability; (a) acquisition of tubular
steel poles and steel cross arms to replace wooden poles and wooden cross arms
on a 340km 132kV transmission line supplying power to the capital city Lilongwe
and the northern region, to reduce outages and improve quality of supply; (d)
distribution reinforcement through the installation of about 50MVA substation
transformers, 35ONVA distribution transformers, circuit breakers and accessories,
construction of about 450 km of 33kV and llkV distribution line, provision of
energy meters and vehicles; and (e) institutional strengthening of ESCOK through
the provision of computer hardvare and software, and training. The MgV=gMM
compolat& of the Project consist of: (a) energy planning and policy formulation



- 3 -
(to be undertaken by EPD) through: ti) a household energy strategy study; and
(ii) expert services to assist the Government on energy related issues; (b)
expert services to the PCC to review current petroleum product procurement,
transport and bulk storage arrangements and recommend measures for least cost
petroleum product supply; and (c) technical assistance to the TCC to demonstrate
energy eff icienet barn designs for tobacco curing by smallholder farmers with the
main objective of moderating the negative environmental impact of er4essive
woodfuel consumption.   The project's small input of US$400,000 for technical
assistance is consistent with the need for flexibility in applying IDA's policy
to diversify away from tobacco production for a country like Malawi which is
heavily dependent on tobacco for export earnings. Malawi's research-oriented
approach to develop alternative crops, with which IDA agrees, is an effort to
comply wlth this policy in the long term.
8.          The Project is estimated to cost US$231.3 million, excluding interest
during construction (estimated at US$40.5 million), of which i5$167.7 million is
in foreign currency. The breakdown of costs and the fi-ancing plan are given in
Schedule A, the procurement method and the summary of allocations are shown in
Sctadule B.
9.          Prolect Implementatlon.  ESCON, to which almost all of the credit
will be on-lent by the Government, is a state owned parastatal empowered by the
Electricity Act of 1963 to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in
Malawi. ESCOK continues to enjoy financial viability since its formation, and
is regarded the best parastatal in Malawi. The timely delivery of its audited
accounts and the relatively low value of outstanding electricity bills are among
the best in Southern Africa region.
10.         The Energy Division under EPD and the Petroleum Control Commission
will be responsible for the implementation of the non-power subcomponents (total
US$1.25 million) of the project. The Eneriv Division is the Government's arm for
policy formulation and co-ordination in the energy a*ctor. The Division needs
support for studies and institutional strengthening. The PCC is a parastatal
established for the supervision of petroleum supply. Least cost importation and
security of supply of petroleum products are its main concern. The project will
explore options for cost minimization and will advise on changes that may be
needed in the legal framework of PCC to help their attainment. The TCC is also
a parastatal with powers to oversee the tobacco marketing industry.   The
project's involvement is, however, directed to reducing woodfuel consumption in
the smallholder tobacco curing industry.
11.         Prolect Sustainabilitv.  ESCOM continues to be a financially viable
institution through Government's timely support for adjustment of tariffs
enabling ESCOM to finance its operations, service its debt and contribute
adequately to its capital expenditure needs. The proposed Project will help to
ensure the continued sustainability of ESCOM's operations through sector wide
iastitutional strengthening and supporting sound energy pricing policies.
12.         Lessons Learnt from urevious Bank Mxuerience. IDA has helped finance
four power projects in the past. IDA's contribution to these projects totals
US$85 million, or 8S of total Bank operations during the last 20 years.  IDA's
involvement has helped to provide a reliable power supply at least cost to
alsavi. The Audit and Project Completion Reports on the first three projects
have highly commended the performance of the power sector. ESCOK continues to
be run as an exemplary power util.'ty in Southern Africa. ESCOK has been and is



- 4 -
a finmacially viable institution. Its operations are efficient and projects have
been well managed. However, since the commencement of Energy I, delays have been
experienced on procurement due to Government intervention through the whole
procurement cycle. ESCOQ also faces competition from the private seetor in
attracting skilled manpower. During negotiations, Government has agreed to grant
ESCOM adequate autonomy on procurement rnd management matters.
13.        A&Itgos A.g*d.  During negotiations egreement was reached on the
following major covenants: (a)s Government  _d conclude or cause ESCO)  to
concludes (i) by not later than June 30, 1993, appropriate financing agreements
for the carrying out of the transmission and distribution reinforcement sub-
components of the Project; and (ii) by not later than February 28, 1993, an
agreement with the AfDB for the financing of the generators and turbines for
Rapichira power plantl (b) the Government vould take IDA's view into account
on the Rnergy Pricing Study (undertaken under Energy I) and the recommendations
so agreed will be put into effect commencing from April 1, 1993; (c) ESCOK would
s (i) finance yearly from internal sources not less than 301 of its average
capital expenditure incurred or expected to be incurred over a three year period,
comprising the current year, the years preceding and following the said current
year; and (il) would not incur any debt unless a forecast of its revenues and
expenditures show that the projected cash generation is at least 1.5 ti$es the
projected debt aervice requirement; and (d) ESCOK would: (i) compensate affected
families (para. 13), including their resettlement, and woodlands lost for use by
the wildlife (wildlife conversion) either In kind or as may be agreed between
ZSCGI and the Department of Parks and Wildlife; and (ii) establish an in-house
environmental unit which would be responsible for implementing environmental
mitigation measures and monitoring plans; (e) as conditions of effectiveness: (i)
Government would execute an on-lending agreement with ESCOC for US$53.75 million
at 7.232 interest rate and 20 years repayment period including 5 years grace,
ESCGO bearing the foreign exchange risk; and (ii) Government and 3SCOM would take
appropriate actions to ensure notification by CDC and SIB are received by IDA
prior to disbursement of their respective loanss and (f) as condition of
disbursement ESCC) would appoint a project manager for the power component of the
Project.
14. *a viromeatal Issues,   The Government, with the assistance of
consultants, has carried out the environmental assessment for this Category A
project.   Concerned government Departments and NOOs were involved in the
assessment process. The Rapichira dam will be a daily regulating dam inundating
an area of less than 200ha with a reservoir of about 11 million cubic meters.
The reservoir will take about lOOha of the 78,000ha Majete Game Reserve and about
lOOha of the 10,OOOha Blantyre City Woodfuel Reserve. There will be temporary
disturbances to wildlife (main habitat about 100 elephants) in the reserve during
construction. The dam has no serious impacts on fishery resources in downstream
areas. The 58km 132kV transmission line feeding Kapichira's output into the
Interconnected system will follow closely an existing line route with minimum
environmental impact. ESCCO will compensate the wildland lost to the wildlife,
establish an environmental unit to monitor mitigating measures, and compensate
the resettlement of affected families (5 families) along the route of the
transmission line. Positive environmental and social benefits include improved
tourist access to the Game Reserve, provision of improved social services
(school, clinic) snd increased economic activity.  TVlQ Shire river is an
international river flowing into Mozambique. In response to the request of the
Republic of Malawi, the Government of Mozambique has communicated its no



objection to the constrection of Rapichira hydroelectric power plant on the 8hire
river.
15.         BenefAte.  The Project would assist Malawi in meeting additional
power demand in a least cost manner, improve the quality and reliability of power
supply and strengthen Malawi's capability to plan, manage and operate the energy
sector. The economic rate of return (ERR) of the power component of the Project
it estimated at 16.  which is above the opportunity cost of capital in Malawi.
The ERR is robust to substantial price increases anJ appreciable reduction in
sales.
16.         Risks. The Project runs the risk of delay if the financing agreement
for the generators and turbines is not concluded as scLtAled in the credit
agreement. The conditionalities in the credit agreement and IDA's consultations
on aid co-ordination will minimize this risk. There is also a risk that donor
financing will not be forthcoming, leaving a serious gap in the resources
available for the Project.   In that case, ESCOM and the Government have
undertaken to ensure that the necessary fund can be provided from domestic
sources. The financing gap could also be reduced by triming the transmission
and distribution reinforcement subcomponents of the Project at the risk of
reducing some of the benefits of the Project and jeopardizing donor interest in
the excluded components.   The Kapichira scheme is designed with a daily
regulating dam and has no complex structures or major environmental impact; no
technical risks are therefore anticipated. There is also the risk that new
generation capacity may be commissioned too early or too late if demand forecasts
prove inaccurate or are adversely affected ay international economic situations
or unforeseen political developments in the region. Accordingly, the power plant
is being designed to permit flexibility to respond to demand changes through
phasing of the generating units.
17.                    Lou. 1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
