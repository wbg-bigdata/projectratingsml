IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2838-CHA)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fertilizer Rationalization
Project in China, for which a loan in the amount of US$97.4 million equivalent (Loan 2838-
CHA) was approved on June 16, 1987 and made effective on April 14, 1988.
The Loan was closed on June 30, 1994 compared to the original closing date of June
30, 1993. Final disbursement took place on November 14, 1994, at which time a balance of
US$ 0.344 million was canceled.
This ICR was prepared by Mr. Carlo A. Punsalan, Task Manager, EA2IE with
assistance from Mr. Kurt Constant, IENIM and reviewed by Mr. Richard S. Newfarmer,
Chief, EA2IE and Mr. Yo Kimura, Project Adviser, EA2DR.   The borrower and
implementing agencies and enterprises provided their contribution, which is shown as Part II
to this ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in October 1994. It is based on material in the project file including the Staff
Appraisal Report, Loan and Project Agreements, supervision reports, and the Project
Completion Reports submitted by the borrower and beneficiary enterprises.  The five
implementing enterprises also provided actual statistical information and the Ministry of
Chemical Industry (MCI) which was the coordinating agency and directly responsible for the
implementation of the technical assistance component of the Project also provided its
comments and assessment.  The draft ICR was also discussed with the borrower and
implementing agencies during a mission in March 1995.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2838-CHA)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    The Bank's four projects in the fertilizer sector in China were to assist in the
implementation of the government's development program with three priorities, i.e., a) expansion,
rehabilitation and energy saving of nitrogen capacity; b) rapid expansion of phosphate fertilizer
capacity using locally available phosphate rock; and c) identification and development of domestic
potash resources. The first of four Bank projects was the Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy
Saving Project (Loan 2541 -CHA) and involved mainly the rehabilitation of four large and medium
sized ammonia/urea plants. The second project was the Fertilizer Rationalization Project, the
subject of this ICR. The third and fourth projects were the Phosphate Development Project and
the Hubei Phosphate Project, both of which were designed to assist in the development of the
phosphate sector. Given the size of the fertilizer sector, the Bank projects were aimed at
providing models for the establishment and rehabilitation of other large and medium-sized plants
both in the nitrogen and phosphate sectors.
Project Objectives
2.    The specific objectives of this Project - the Fertilizer Rationalization Project - were aimed
at: a) improving the production efficiency of existing medium-sized plants through plant
renovation and upgraded technology; b) expanding phosphate production to help achieve a more
balanced nutrient input; and c) improving institutional capacity through the introduction of more
modem systems and techniques in financial and operational management. These objectives which
were in line with the government's priorities and strategies for the sector, were appropriate and
were for the most part achieved.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The Project was executed by five existing fertilizer enterprises with overall coordination
by the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) through a World Bank Project Office, which also
handled the institutional component of the project.  These enterprises have successfully
constructed four modern urea plants with a capacity of 132,000 tpy each and one new phosphate



iii
fertilizer plant capable of producing 240,000 tpy of diammonium phosphate (DAP)/ nitrogen,
phosphate, potassium complex fertilizers (NPK) which is the first complex fertilizer plant in China
based on international technologies and utilizing indigenous phosphate rock. Under the Project,
the staff of the enterprises and MCI were provided training; a management study was also
completed resulting in manuals on accounting, management information systems, and
organizational structures which have been adopted by the beneficiary enterprises and which are
being promoted by MCI to other companies in the sector.
4.    The completion of the Project was delayed for about 12 months. This resulted mainly
from initial delays in the loan effectiveness and selection of the process technology, the events of
June 1989, and delays in the availability of counterpart local currency funds mostly due from the
respective provincial governments. The rapid economic changes and price reforms during the
implementation period resulted in a large project cost overrun in domestic costs. The actual costs
of the Project amounted to US$105.8 million and Yuan 943.3 million compared to the original
estimates of US$110.1 million and Yuan 326.5 million. The foreign exchange costs were slightly
under target, principally due to lower interest during construction. The Bank Loan (disbursement
of US$ 97,055,603.15 or 99.6%) accounted for almost 92% of the total foreign currency cost.
Actual local currency costs, at 2.9 times the original estimates, resulted from a combination of
implementation delays, high domestic inflation, the need for much larger construction loans with
higher interest rates. As a percentage of actual total project costs in Yuan equivalent, the Bank
loan decreased from 52% to 45% despite the devaluation of the Yuan while actual domestic costs
increased from 47% to 51%. These Yuan costs were financed primarily (82%) by domestic loans
of Yuan 773.5 million. The actual total costs in equivalent Yuan compared to estimates for
individual components were as follows: 2.2 times for Xuanhua Chemical Fertilizer Company
(XCFC), 2.3 times for Yunnan Xuanwei Chemical Fertilizer Company (YXCFC), 2.3 times for
Beijing Chemical Experimental Company (BCEC), 2.2 times for Yuanping Chemical Fertilizer
Company (YCFC) and 2.0 times for Luoyang Chemical Fertilizer Company (LCFC). These
increases are explained both by the rise in domestic costs as well as the higher exchange rate at
completion, which accounted for about 22% of the total Yuan equivalent costs.
5.    The Bank played an important role in the identification and preparation of the Project. It
contributed significantly in the design and configuration of the urea plants for the four medium-
sized nitrogenous fertilizer enterprises as well as the establishment of China's first major DAP
production facilities based on international technology and utilizing local phosphate rock.
Through its procurement procedures, the Bank also contributed to the selection of the appropriate
technology and equipment. The Bank provided continuing technical advice during project
implementation via review of procurement matters and close/regular supervision missions. Based
on consistent and detailed assistance from the Bank, the enterprises have shown improvements in
their financial reporting as well as in preparation of multi-year operating and financial planning.
6.    With experience gained in the first Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project
(Loan 2541-CHA), the beneficiary institutions, particularly MCI actively participated in the
project preparation and appraisal.  The China National Chemical Construction Corporation
(CNCCC) was also better prepared to handle international procurement under the Project and



iv
acted satisfactorily within Bank guidelines.  The beneficiary enterprises implemented their
components efficiently albeit delayed due mainly to factors which were beyond their control, e.g.
technical design and counterpart funding. The MCI and Beijing Institute of Chemical Engineering
and Management (BICEM) implemented the technical assistance component effectively and on
schedule. MCI's Project Implementation Coordinating Unit played a very useful role, particularly
as the Project involved multiple beneficiaries/ components.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned.
7.    The Project outcome is rated as satisfactory.  The Project has met all of its major
objectives although these were achieved with some delays and deficiencies, notably in the cost
overruns and financial profitability of the beneficiary enterprises. The latter were due to huge
inflation-induced increases in input prices and control over output prices. Without the Project, the
financial situation of the enterprises would have been much worse. The Project, however, is
likely to be sustainable. In May 1994, the marketing of fertilizer was fully deregulated but
starting in September 1994, was again subjected to some controls. Despite this control, overall
domestic prices of fertilizer have started to increase although not to the extent of the equivalent
international prices. In view of the recent rapid increases in international fertilizer prices,
which are expected to remain at the current levels, the recent financial performance of the
enterprises has improved and profits are expected in the future as the enterprises achieve higher
capacity utilization through technical improvements, product diversification, and increased access
to power; adjustments of the domestic fertilizer prices closer to the equivalent
international/market prices would be a major contributing factor. The economic rate of return of
the Project estimated at about 22% at completion, is satisfactory although slightly lower than 24%
estimated at appraisal. The financial rate of return estimated at completion and assuming the
1994 controlled prices for urea, is marginal at about 5% reflecting mainly the controlled pricing
but fully deregulated input costs.
8.    The monitoring of the financial performance of the beneficiary enterprises would continue
through the five-year "rolling plans" of the enterprises which take account of the operational
measures to improve efficiency and financial measures including additional budgetary allocations
and/or bank loans, as necessary, to sustain operations and attain sound financial positions. During
supervision missions of other still on-going fertilizer projects, the Bank expects to also monitor
compliance with financial covenants under Loan 2838-CHA, and major developments in the
fertilizer sector as well as overall price reforms in China.
9.    The impact of recent pricing reforms in China on the fertilizer sector was substantial and
unexpected. These reforms have had an adverse effect on the performance and financial viability
of fertilizer enterprises in general as input prices rose to market levels while fertilizer prices
remained depressed and controlled. This was exacerbated by the unexpected events during
project implementation in 1989. Under these unusual circumstances, the financial impact of the
price reforms on the project costs should have been re-examined more closely during
implementation.  This might have resulted in obtaining more realistic requirements and
commitments for counterpart funding, which could have minimized the implementation delays and



v
further cost escalation.  Because of the substantial cost increases combined with a tight
government budget, counterpart funding became a serious issue over which neither the Bank nor
the MCI/enterprise had control. Based on this experience, the Bank has emphasized and has had
more success in updating project cost estimates regularly in other on-going fertilizer projects
(Hubei Phosphate Project) as well as in obtaining firm commitments on the counterpart funding.
10.   Because of their importance for and impact on the farmers' income and agricultural
production, policies on marketing and pricing of fertilizers are sensitive and difficult to predict.
Although a loan covenant required that the marketing and pricing of fertilizer products of the
Project enterprises would be outside the state quota system and would be at market related
prices, compliance by MCI/enterprises with this covenant has been difficult due to other more
urgent and priority objectives of the government. In future, other arrangements may need to be
made to attain the objectives of such a covenant. For example, since the government has the
policy prerogatives for an important commodity like fertilizer, an alternative is to make the
resulting subsidies to the farmers as transparent as possible and provided directly by the fiscal
authorities and not at the expense of the enterprises. Thus, instead of input subsidies (which
penalize the provider), the government may need to provide direct payment to the enterprises
equivalent to the difference of the market prices and negotiated or controlled prices (similar to the
small financial subsidy being provided to one participating enterprise).
11.   The full operating efficiency of the enterprises is being realized only slowly due to lack of
experience with the new technology and advanced equipment under the Project. The enterprises
under the Project have relied mainly on the design institute and in-house capacity during the initial
operations, which had some technical difficulties. The Bank has strongly recommended external
advisory services to assist the enterprises including the use of some of the savings under the Bank
loan. In the future, suitable external technical assistance during the period of initial operations
should be included in similar projects and whenever possible, financing acceptable to the
borrower, e.g. TA grants, should be arranged to ensure implementation.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2838-CHA)
A. Project Objectives and Description
1.    Project Objectives.  The objectives of the Fertilizer Rationalization Project
(Project) were to assist China in:
a) improving the production efficiency of existing medium-sized fertilizer plants
through demonstration plants that incorporated technical renovation and energy
saving measures;
b) reducing China's (nitrogen-N/phosphate-P) nutrient imbalances through capacity
expansion of phosphate fertilizers; and
c) improving institutional efficiency of the fertilizer sector through the introduction
of modern economic, financial and operational systems and techniques.
These objectives were clear and achievable and in line with the priorities of the
government to further advance agricultural production and improve overall
competitiveness of the fertilizer sector. However, institutional development aspects were
more complex and long-term in nature; as such they were to be based on a management
study undertaken by external consultants and implemented on a pilot basis in selected
enterprises under the Project.
2.    Project Description. The Project had three major components as follows:
a. Phosphate Fertilizer Development. This component included:
i) installation of a 240,000 tpy dianunmonium phosphate (DAP)/ nitrogen,
phosphate, potassium (NPK) granulation plant and the necessary up-stream
facilities, i.e. a 230,000 tpy pyrite-based sulfuric acid plant, a 80,000 tpy P205
phosphoric acid plant with a 4,200 tpy fluoride processing capacity; and
ii) establishment of utilities and offsite facilities including raw material
handling and storage facilities and a site for phosphogypsum disposal;



2
iii) implementation of energy-saving measures in the existing coal-based
medium-sized ammonia plant; and
iv) local and overseas training for operations and technical staff.
b. Nitrogenous Fertilizer Rationalization and Expansion.  This component
included:
i) energy saving modifications in four existing coal-based medium-sized
ammonia plants;
ii) expansion of individual ammonia capacities to 80,000 tpy;
iii) installation of four 132,000 tpy (400tpd) urea plants, based on
international technologies;
iv) all utilities/offsite facilities required for smooth plant operations,
including storage facilities for ammonia and bagged urea; and
v) training in operations and maintenance.
c. Institutional Development. This component included:
i) a management study to design and implement on a pilot basis improved
enterprise -level management systems;
ii) a program at the Beijing Institute of Chemical Engineering and
Management (BICEM) to strengthen sector-wide management training and
iii) improvement in the Ministry of Chemical Industry's (MCI) data and
project management system.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.    Physical Objectives. The above objectives were achieved, albeit delayed in terms
of implementation. The four medium-sized fertilizer plants, Yuanping Chemical Fertilizer
Company (YCFC), Luoyang Chemical Fertilizer Company (LCFC), Xuanhua Chemical
Fertilizer Company (XCFC), and Beijing Chemical Experimental Company (BCEC)
completed their projects by installing advanced equipment and technology to produce urea
(instead of ABC - Ammonium Bicarbonate), which is a higher-grade fertilizer product.
Based on test and operating results, all four enterprises achieved the rated and improved
energy consumption. Each of the four enterprises has a total capacity of 132,000 tpy of
urea. The fifth enterprise - Yunnan Xuanwei Chemical Fertilizer Company (YXCFC) has
established a 240,000 tpy of DAP and NPK fertilizer plant which is the first complex



3
(NP,NPK) fertilizer plant in China based on international technologies and utilizing
indigenous phosphate rock. The plant's capacity is equivalent to an increase of about 10%
of total phosphate production capacity. Together, these enterprises would be producing
both high grade and phosphate fertilizers for which there is an increasing demand from the
market due to more efficient application.
4.    Institutional Objectives. A management study was completed and implemented
on a pilot basis in YXCFC and BCEC, which involved the introduction of "responsibility"
accounting, preparation of financial statements and five-year rolling plans, and
computerization of accounts. Corresponding manuals have been prepared and distributed
to other companies in the chemical sector. It was evident that the enterprises had adopted
improved and more frequent reporting as well as preparation of five-year rolling plans.
This is expected to continue after the Bank project, and the Bank and the MCI/enterprises
have agreed to have periodic follow-up and review of the operational performance against
financial covenants after project completion.   BICEM  has successfully  provided
management training to the five enterprises under the Project and has in place a program
which is being offered on a continuing basis to other enterprises in the sector. MCI
benefited in improving its project data base and project management system, which is now
more centralized in line with a recent reorganization of government agencies.
5.    The project partially achieved some sectoral pricing objectives in that it was agreed
that the products under the Project are to be sold outside the quota system and at market
related prices. This was a first and important step in the pricing reform in the fertilizer
sector. In May 1994, the pricing and marketing of all fertilizer products were largely
deregulated. However, the resulting increases in the market prices of fertilizers were still
insufficient to show financial gains for the enterprises since the major input prices had
been adjusted much earlier and rapidly increased to market levels. Beginning in the last
quarter of 1994, the fertilizer prices (particularly international) were up substantially
(footnote, para 9). Unfortunately, starting in September 1994, the government reimposed
controls on the marketing of urea with the objective of alleviating the burden on the
farmers and increasing agricultural production. Although this resulted in higher domestic
prices for urea compared to previous years, the average price ceilings were still
substantially lower (about 30%) than the prevailing international prices. Furthermore,
half of the urea production must be sold to the government at slightly lower prices than
the balance, which the factory is allowed to sell directly. At the same time, the prices of
the inputs to the urea plants have mostly been deregulated and have escalated to market
levels (except in isolated cases where the cost of electricity and coal is slightly subsidized).
Although the government's overall policy is to deregulate fertilizer prices, implementation
has been and is expected to be gradual and determined considering the overall and wider
concerns of the government in the fertilizer and agricultural sectors. However, based on
government's overall pricing reform policy and as indicated by the September 1994
action, domestic fertilizer prices should be increasing albeit gradually and approaching
the level of international prices although full deregulation would appear difficult in the
near term.  Under these circumstances, full compliance with Bank's covenant on
marketing of the fertilizer products under the Project, has been difficult despite continuing



4
efforts of MCI and the concerned enterprises and the lack of supportive reform in the
policy regime has tended to undermine the overall objectives of the Project.
6.    The economic rate of return (ERR) of the Project at completion was about 22%
compared to an ERR of 24% at appraisal. However, because of lower domestic prices,
the financial rate of return (FRR) at completion was estimated at only 4.9% compared to
an FRR of 16% estimated at appraisal. The ERRs are higher than the FRRs reflecting the
higher economic prices of fertilizer compared to the actual prices which are still controlled
and much lower than market or equivalent international prices. The FRRs at completion
of the individual enterprises ranged from about only 2% to 10.3%. These are low due
mainly to: i) the substantial increase in input prices after deregulation while prices of
fertilizer products are still controlled at levels that barely cover the input costs; and ii)
differing capacity of enterprise management to fully realize technical efficiencies and
capacity utilization (para 9). On the other hand, the ERRs at completion are acceptable
and are based on international/ market prices at the end of 1994. A comparison of these
estimates is shown in Table 9 in the attached Statistical Tables.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
7.    Loan Effectiveness and Project Schedule. The processing schedule from project
identification to Board approval on June 16, 1987 was essentially on time.  Loan
effectiveness was originally scheduled for September 1987, but loan documents were
signed only on December 28, 1987, with the loan becoming effective on April 14, 1988 or
a delay of about 7 months. This contributed to an overall delay in project completion and
loan closing by 18 months and 12 months, respectively.
8.    Project Implementation. Table 5 in Annex A shows the comparison between
estimated and actual dates for project completion, commissioning and commercial
operations. Implementation of the four urea plants was slow at the outset due to delays in
securing appropriate process technologies (about 7 months), resulting from tedious
procurement procedures and delays in securing the foreign design owing to lengthy
domestic processing and decision making. Consequently, the bidding and contracting of
procurement packages began 11 months late. The completion of the DAP/NPK plant was
reasonably on time despite some initial delays - installation of equipment/machinery was
in December 1991 against a projected date of September 1991. Another major factor for
implementation delays was the events in June 1989 (one year after loan effectiveness),
which for some months virtually stopped all Project activities. Inadequate and untimely
availability of counterpart local currency funds contributed to the implementation delays,
which was exacerbated by the government's austerity program beginning 1990. The
inadequate counterpart funding was a major problem during implementation. Project delays
meant higher capital costs mainly due to the increasing cost of domestic construction
materials. Shortfalls in counterpart funds fueled further delays and higher costs. This
translated into higher debts for the enterprises. The enterprises also tended to divert available
funds to immediate needs and postpone other important components. In one sush instance,



5
the Bank took firm  action.  When the construction of the environmentally-critical
phosphogypsum dump site by YXCFC was delayed, the Bank made further commitment of
the loan balance subject to the satisfactory progress on this disposal site. As a result, funds
were promptly allocated and provided by the provincial authorities, and this facility was
eventually completed although much later than planned.
9.    All five enterprises in the Project also had some problems after completion during
the testing/commissioning of their respective plants. The four urea plants all experienced
a similar technical problem, with the leaks in the urea reactor and stripper. The problem
was due to material incompatibility and poor workmanship.  The equipment was
subsequently repaired and no further problems have occurred. During the guarantee runs,
the plants all reached 409-431 tpd of output, which exceeded the guaranteed output
capacity of 400 tpd. However, the plants could not fully meet the guaranteed values in
terms of input consumption: actual consumption was generally higher in ammonia, CO2
(except for LCFC), steam, and power. Table 6A contains a detailed comparison of
guaranteed performance versus test results.  During supervision, the Bank repeatedly
emphasized and strongly recommended the use of suitable experts to assist the plants in
correcting these problems and improve operating efficiencies. However, due mainly to
cost considerations, the plants preferred to resolve problems through experiments using in-
house expertise. Actual experience indicates some but fairly slow successes. By the end
of 1994, three enterprises have reached a reasonably high capacity utilization of 80% and
above; two enterprises reflected only 55% utilization due mainly to insufficient power
and some diversion of ammonia to more profitable products such as methanol. Depending
on availability of working capital and adequate power supply, all enterprises expect to
reach full capacity starting in 1995 except for one (YXCFC) which projects full utilization
only in 1996 for its DAP plant.  However, it is expected that  improvement in
consumption of inputs could be accomplished only slowly particularly without suitable
external advisory assistance. This has resulted in financial losses since production costs
were high, particularly in comparison to current domestic fertilizer prices (although
international prices have increased substantially starting in late 1994)1. To accelerate and
ensure improvements in operating efficiencies, the enterprises should still consider the
benefits of obtaining suitable international advisory services.
10.   Project Costs/ Financing Sources. Table 8 provides a comparative breakdown of
the estimated and actual costs of the Project.  The actual project costs amounted to
US$105.8 million and Yuan 943.3 million compared to the original estimates of US$1 10.1
million and Yuan 326.5 million. The foreign exchange costs were slightly under target,
principally due to lower interest during construction.  The disbursed Bank Loan of
US$97,055,603.15 accounted for almost 92% of the total foreign currency cost. As a
percentage of actual total project costs in Yuan equivalent, the Bank loan decreased from
52% to 45% while actual domestic costs increased from 47% to 51%. Actual local currency
costs, at 2.9 times the original estimates, resulted from a combination of high domestic
'For example, urea prices increased from $100/t in 1992 to $219/t in December 1994 while DAP prices
increased from $172/t to $ 256/t during the same period.



6
inflation, implementation delays, and the need for much larger construction loans with higher
interest rates. The local currency costs were financed primarily (82%) by loans of Yuan 773.5
million. The actual total costs in equivalent Yuan compared to estimates for individual
components were as follows: 2.2 times for XCFC, 2.3 times for YXCFC, 2.3 times for
BCEC, 2.2 times for YCFC and 2.0 times for LCFC. These increase are explained both by
the rise in domestic costs as well as the higher exchange rate at completion which accounted
for about 22% of the total Yuan equivalent costs.
D. Project Sustainability
11.   The Project is likely to be sustainable. In view of recent and rapid increases in
international fertilizer prices, the financial performance of the enterprises is expected to
improve significantly.  Current expectations indicate that higher international prices of
fertilizer products in 1994 should remain at their current level. Domestically, fertilizer prices
after being fully deregulated in May 1994, were again subjected to some control starting in
September 1994 (para 5). However, the domestic prices in 1994 were higher than 1993 and
although still marginal, improved the financial performance of the enterprises. To sustain the
operations of one enterprise (BCEC) while it improves its efficiency, it receives several
concessions through tax rebates, lower pricing for power and coke, and financial subsidy of
RMB 75 per ton of urea. Under the current pricing policies, the strategy of the enterprises
has been to continue to improve efficiency while at the same time, to diversify into more
profitable product lines. Financial performance of the enterprises (Annexes B-1 to B-5) are
expected to improve as the enterprises achieve higher capacity utilization through technical
improvements, product diversification, and increased access to power; adjustment of the
domestic prices closer to the equivalent international/ market prices would be a major
contributing factor (para 5).
E. Bank Performance
12.   The Bank played an important role in the identification and preparation of the Project.
It contributed significantly in the design and configuration of the urea plants for the four
medium-sized nitrogenous fertilizer enterprises as well as the establishment of China's first
major DAP production facilities based on international technology and utilizing local
phosphate rock. Through its procurement procedures, the Bank also contributed to the
selection of the appropriate technology and equipment.  The Bank provided continuing
technical advice during project implementation via review of procurement matters and
close/regular supervision missions. During initial operations, the Bank presented alternative
ways of improving production levels and efficiency including continuing assistance from
external consultants which was believed to be crucial in identifying technical problems and
designing viable solutions. Although the enterprises had some success in operating the new
plants, suitable external assistance would still be useful and cost effective.  Based on
consistent and detailed assistance from the Bank, the enterprises have shown improvements
in their financial progress reporting as well as in preparation of multi-year operating and



7
financial planning. As agreed, the Bank will continue to monitor progress and compliance
with financial covenants under the Bank loan.
F. Borrower Performance
13.   With experience gained in the first Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project
(Loan 2541-CHA), the beneficiary institutions, particularly MCI, actively participated in
project preparation and appraisal. The China National Chemical Construction Corporation
(CNCCC) was also better prepared to handle international procurement under the Project and
acted satisfactorily within the Bank guidelines. The beneficiary enterprises implemented their
components efficiently, albeit delayed due mainly to factors which were beyond their control,
e.g. technical design and counterpart funding. The MCI and BICEM implemented the
technical assistance component effectively and on schedule. MCI's Project Implementation
Coordinating Unit played a very useful role, particularly as the Project involved multiple
beneficiaries/components.  Due to depressed fertilizer prices resulting in poor financial
performance, the enterprises could not fully comply with the financial covenants (Table 10);
covenant on product marketing (outside quota system and market related prices) was also not
fully complied with (para 5).
G. Assessment of Outcome
14.   The project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The project has met all of its major
objectives although these were achieved with some delays and deficiencies, notably in the
cost overruns and poor financial profitability of the enterprises. This unfavorable financial
performance was the result of the unexpected, rapid and huge increases in input costs amid
depressed and recently controlled fertilizer prices which are beyond the control of the
enterprises. Nonetheless, the financial situation of the enterprises would have been much
worse without the Project. The financial performance of the enterprises improved in 1994 as
domestic prices increased although not to the level of international prices. The development
results are expected to be realized as the enterprises produce higher grade fertilizer with more
advanced and efficient equipment.
H. Future Operations
15.   The financial performance of the enterprises would be monitored mainly through the
various five-year "rolling plans" which take account of operational measures to improve
efficiency, and financial measures including additional budgetary allocations and/or bank
loans, as necessary, to sustain operations and attain sound financial positions. During
supervision missions of other still on-going fertilizer projects (Phosphate Development
Project and Hubei Phosphate Project), the Bank expects to also monitor compliance with the
financial covenants under Loan 2838-CHA, as well as major developments in the fertilizer
sector and overall price reforms in China.



8
I. Lessons Learned
16.   The impact of recent pricing reforms in China on the fertilizer sector was substantial
and unexpected. These reforms have had an adverse effect on the performance and financial
viability of fertilizer enterprises in general as input prices rose to market levels while fertilizer
prices remained depressed and controlled. This was exacerbated by the unexpected events
during project implementation in 1989. Under these unusual circumstances, the financial
impact of the price reforms on the project costs should have been re-examined more closely
during implementation. This might have resulted in obtaining more realistic requirements and
commitments for counterpart funding, which could have minimized the implementation delays
and further cost escalations. Because of the substantial cost increases combined with a tight
government budget, counterpart funding became a serious issue over which neither the Bank
nor the MCI/enterprise had control. Based on this experience, the Bank has emphasized and
has had more success in updating project cost estimates regularly in other on-going fertilizer
projects (Hubei Phosphate Project) as well as in obtaining firm commitments on the
counterpart funding.
17.   Because of their importance to and impact on farmers' income and agricultural
production, policies on marketing and pricing of fertilizers are sensitive and difficult to
predict. Although the Bank and the government had agreed that the marketing and pricing of
fertilizer products of the Project enterprises would be outside the state quota system and
would be at market related prices and despite efforts of MCI/enterprises, compliance with
this convenant has been difficult due to other more urgent and priority objectives of the
government. In future, other arrangements may need to be made to attain the objectives of
such a covenant. For example, since the government has policy prerogatives over an
important commodity like fertilizer, an alternative is to make the resulting subsidies to the
farmers as transparent as possible and provided directly by the fiscal authorities and not at the
expense of the enterprises. Thus, instead of input subsidies (which penalize the provider), the
government may need to provide direct payment to the enterprises equivalent to the
difference of the market prices and negotiated or controlled prices (similar to the small
financial subsidy to BCEC).
18.   The full operating efficiency of the enterprises is being realized only slowly due to
lack of experience with the new technology and advanced equipment under the Project. The
enterprises under the Project have relied mainly on the design institute and in-house capacity
during the initial operations, which had several technical difficulties. The Bank has strongly
recommended external advisory services to assist the enterprises including the use of some of
the savings under the Bank loan. In the future, suitable external technical assistance during
the period of initial operations should be included in similar projects and whenever possible,
financing acceptable to the borrower, e.g. TA grants, should be arranged to ensure
implementation.

Fertilizer Rationalization Project
Implementation Completion Report Mission
February 27- March 1, 1995
Beijing, China
Minutes of Meetings
1.    World Bank Mission (Carlo A. Punsalan, EA2IE) visiting China met with representatives
of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and participating enterprises under the Bank's Fertilizer
Rationalization Project (Project) to discuss the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Project and Loan 2838-CHA.
2.    It was noted that since the last mission in October 1994 (Mr. K. Constant), the MCI has
provided the Bank with updated information required for the ICR preparation. Two major draft
documents were reviewed and discussed: i) ICR prepared by the Bank and ii) ICR portion
prepared by the borrower (MCI and participating enterprises).
3.    The MCI provided several factual corrections on the Bank's draft including major reasons
for the delays in implementation, actual dates for completion for various plant and institutional
development component, actual figures for key indicators on project operations and plant
performance.
4.    The MCI informed the mission of the recent changes in the pricing policies for fertilizer
products.  While full price liberalization policies were adopted in May 1994, the central
government imposed macro control on urea pricing system again in a bid to alleviate the farmers'
burden and to further boost agricultural production. The large ammonia and urea plants are
required to sell 50% of their output to the state at a specified standard price with allowance for
adjustment of 15% plus or minus. This price was RMB 1,150 to RMB 1,200 per ton of urea (ex-
factory). The balance of 50% could be sold directly by the factory but at the standard price of
RMB 1,300 to RMB 1,350 per ton of urea (ex-factory). For medium-sized fertilizer plants, the
policies is dictated by the provincial government which has also adopted the same pricing policies
as the central government and involved the four urea plants under the Bank Project. For DAP
and NPK, 100% can be sold by the factory and the pricing is controlled by the provincial
government although the current prices are close to the equivalent of international prices, e.g.
RMB 2,000 per ton for DAP and RMB 1,850 per ton of NPK.
5.    The mission indicated that the recent change in fertilizer pricing policies was not in
compliance with the agreement with the Bank which requires that all the output of the
participating enterprises would be "sold outside the quota system at market related prices". MCI
agreed that this was the case and have and will continue to make strong representation to the
government in order to comply with such agreement. More importantly, the lower than market
prices would mean lower if not negative profitability for the enterprises and their sustainability
could only be attained with subsidies from mainly the provincial government through tax

remission, lower input costs such a power and coal, and if necessary outright cash infusion for
operating capital. It was indicated, however, that one
option being pursued is to diversify the enterprises's products to more high margin products
whose marketing and pricing are market based. The mission noted these changes and would
reflect them in its evaluation of the project's financial and economic rate of return (FRR/ERR) as
well as on the project's sustainability.
6.    The enterprises provided the mission with the actual financial performance for 1994 as
well as detailed costings required in the recalculation of the FRR and ERR. Upon return to
Washington, the mission will incorporate these costings in its calculation of the FRR/ERR and
reflect the results in its ICR portion.
7.    With reference to MCI portion of the ICR, it provided the amendments on page 2 to
reflect the recent changes in the fertilizer pricing policies. These will be reflected in the report,
otherwise, there were no other revisions on the report and this portion will be finalized as part of
the ICR report.

Part II
CHINA - FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT LN 2838-CHA
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Project Review by MCI:
Background
1.    The Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan No. CHA-2838) focused on China's medium
size fertilizer industry and was the second operation in a series of World Bank interventions that
aimed at assisting GOC's program for improving overall fertilizer sector performance. The project
tried to demonstrate the benefits of technological and management reform in domestic medium-
scale fertilizer plants by setting-up models that can be used for modernization of a large number of
existing similar operations. The major two components of the project covered
* Adjustrnent of product structure in five chemical fertilizer companies (i.e., Beijing Chemical
Experimental Company (BCEC), Hebei Xuanhua Chemical Fertilizer Company (XCFC),
Henan Luoyang Chemical Fertilizer Company (LCFC), Shanxi Yuanping Chemical Fertilizer
Company (YCFC), and Yunnan Xuanwei Chemical Fertilizer Company (YXCFC). YXCFC
converted ABC to DAP/NPK production, while the other four plants changed from ABC to
urea; and
* Institutional development, including a studies on improving management efficiency in the
five project companies and strengthening the Beijing Institute of Chemical Engineering
Management (BICEM) to raise technical training standards for managerial personnel and
enhance their overall management capabilities.
Implementation Review
2.    Overall, the implementation and performance of the project are considered very
satisfactory together with project scope optimization and compliance with project objectives. In
the five plants, the project has accomplished substantial improvements in product range and
quality, environmental protection levels, energy conservation and process efficiencies including
lower raw material consumption. Although the enterprises have not met all financial covenants
after project start-up, they have generally been doing a lot better than most other comparable
fertilizer plants in the country, as project benefits outweighted a major part of the financial
recession in the sector. Additionally, the project has enabled China to increase its domestic
production of efficient high-grade fertilizers by 530,000 tpy urea and 240,000 tpy DAP/NPK by
upgrading existing domestic technical standards through transfer from abroad of advanced
technologies and equipment, and close collaboration with international specialists.
3.    Final performance tests have verified the international operational competitiveness of the
new production units not only in terms of efficiency, reliability, and product quality, but also in
human capital, as management standards and professional skills of staff at virtually all levels have
been significantly enhanced by intensive internal and external training, and the studies conducted
on organizational structure, management information systems and cost accounting.



28
MCI's Role in the Project
4.     Through its Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFUO), MCI's role in the execution of the
project was to coordinate and consolidate the work of all concerned departments and provide
assistance to the enterprises in resolving implementation issues. Further, MCI organized all major
project-related studies (institutional development, improvement of management efficiency in
medium-size enterprises, China's fertilizer pricing system) and sponsored BICEM's endeavor to
excel its management and technical training to industry and administration.
5.     The managerial efficiency study on China's medium-size fertilizer enterpn'ses was
conducted by an international consultant with assistance by an eleven-member coordination unit
set-up by MCI. Nine reports summarize the findings and recommendations of the study that were
jointly reviewed by the Bank and MCI in 1990 and pilot implemented at BCEC and YXCFC;
additionally, factory manager seminars were organized in Beijing. In view of the successful
completion of the pilot implementation in 1992, MCI prepared four financial manuals for
improving industrial management efficiency (i.e., responsibility accounting; major financial
statements (balance, profit and loss, and cash flow sheets); 5-year rolling plan; and accounting
computerization). The manuals have been distributed within the chemical industry so as to
promote sector-wide managerial performance improvement.
6.    In early 1988, MCI along with the State Pricing Bureau (SPB) established a committee to
conduct an international fertilizer price survey that subsequently visited the USA, Brazil and India.
The data gathered by the committee and its recommendations to GOC have provided valuable
inputs for the ongoing and recently intensified economic reform process in China that has also
strongly affected fertilizer pricing policies. In May 1994, prices of all fertilizer products were
liberalized. In September 1994, the central government imposed macro control on urea pricing
system again in a bid to alleviate farmers' burden and further boost agricultural production.
According to the new regulation, large-sized fertilizer enterprises have to sell their urea products at
a standard price (with a percentage of 15% floating range) set by the central government, while
urea price for medium-sized fertilizer plants (including the four urea plants under the Project) is
determined by the provincial governments based on the regulation. While all fertilizer inputs and
outputs were strictly government controlled in the 1980s, fertilizer enterprises may currently sell
their products to anybody and at market prices, with exception of some large-size fertilizer plants
that were originally state-financed.
Cooperation with the World Bank
7.     During the course of the project implementation, cooperation between the Foreign Funds
Utilization Office on behalf of MCI and the Bank has been very good. Whenever difficulties or
problems arose, they were mutually resolved through friendly discussions and consultations. The
Bank's guidelines and procedures for project appraisal and implementation were concise, scientific
and efficient, and generally Bank requirements and suggestions to the executing agencies were
rational. Bank officials in charge of appraisal and supervision as well as technical experts were
skillful, competent and responsible. They have made an important contribution to the successful
implementation of the project and we highly appreciate their hard work.



29
Outlook
8.     Against the background of China's transition to a socialist market economy, the
performance of the domestic fertilizer sector and its dominant role in agriculture have attracted
special government attention. With deepening reform, stronger market forces and competition
develop that create an urgent need for improved fertilizer sector efficiency. Although China will
continue to import fertilizers to balance the increasing demand of its agriculture sector, it has to put
high priority on an the establishment of a sound and competitive fertilizer industry to support a
sustained agricultural development in an environment that calls for substantial increases in yield
and variety.  In this context, the Bank assisted Fertilizer Rationalization Project has set a
successful example for the modernization and improvement of China's medium-size fertilizer
enterprises. Based on this successful experience and lessons learned, MCI intends promoting
similar rationalization projects in future, while, concurrently, also pursuing new competitive
projects for high-grade fertilizer production, when and where economically viable.

CHINA - FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT LN 2838-CHA
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ProWect Review by the Four Urea Enterprises:
Background
1.    Before the project, the four companies (BCEC, LCFC, XCFC, YCFC) operated coal-
based ammonia/ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) plants that were typical for most of China's
existing medium-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants.  As process technologies were outdated,
particularly in the areas of pollution control, energy consumption, safety, reliability and product
quality, MCI decided in 1985 to improve product structure and technologies in medium-size
nitrogenous fertilizer plants. The State Planning Commnission cleared the urea project In October
1986 including assistance through a World Bank loan. During appraisal, the project scope was
optimized to maximize economic benefits and included construction of four 400 mtpd urea plants
based on advanced international process technology, so as to raise energy and raw material
consumption efficiencies, bring industrial pollution levels up to international standard, and expand
the ammonia capacity from typically 60,000 tpy to 80,000 tpy.
2.    Besides providing the four enterprises with internationally competitive technologies, the
project aimed at setting-up demonstration models for the rationalization of a large number of
existing indigenous ammonia/urea plants of similar design. Transfer of advanced technology,
technical and financial training at management and operating levels, and partnerships of domestic
design institutes and enterprises with international engineering firms and equipment manufacturers
were additional benefits of the project.
Implementation Review
3.    Project construction in the four companies began in December 1989 and was completed by
the end of 1991, when the new plants went into operation. The performance tests confirmed that
the introduction of new urea process technology and equipment have been successful; virtually all
process performance guarantees have been achieved. Operation of the units has been stable and
actual output has reached 107% of design capacity. The product quality met the State's first-grade
standards.
4.    Under the leadership of MCI and coordination as well as assistance by CNCCC, the
modifications were carried out simultaneously in the four fertilizer companies. This arrangement
has played an important role in the smooth implementation of the project.
5.    ICB procurement of technology and goods proved very satisfactory and as result, the value
of the international project content has not exceeded original budgets. The two major contract
parties fulfilled their obligations satisfactorily and met the agreed project quality standards.
6.    The project companies organized individual executing agencies for project implementation
that were responsible for supervision of construction, training of operating personnel, and
management of technical matters. In addition, the agencies took care of reporting on project
progress and financial performances so as to manage and implement the project efficiently and as
required by the Bank.



31
7.     The international urea process licenser took charge of basic design, supervision of
installation and performance tests. Good design and installation quality was obtained through
close cooperation between all parties concerned.
8.     The World Bank has significantly contributed to the successful completion of the project.
At the time of project appraisal, the Bank staff made very valuable studies and investigations.
During the implementation period, the Bank project team provided strict, technically sound and
responsible supervision and performed its work with skill and professional competence. During
the implementation period, procurement inspection and project supervision by the Bank were
timely and effective thus ensuring rational use of project capital.
Conclusion
9.     Scope and implementation of the project were appropriate and successful.  The
modernization and capacity expansion of medium size ammonia plants, replacement of obsolete
ABC units by urea plants, introduction of advanced technology and equipment, as well as extensive
training and strengthening of enterprise management have set good examples for the rationalization
of medium size companies.
10.   The project was implemented during a period of rapid transformation of the Chinese
system to a socialist market economy that has led to steep price increases including all major inputs
to the fertilizer industry (prices of raw materials, coal, electricity etc. are currently 2.5-3.5 times
higher than those at the time of appraisal), while fertilizer prices remained fairly low due to strict
government pricing policies on farm inputs. Consequently, the financial performance of the
fertilizer enterprises under the project is relatively poor as anticipated economic benefits could not
be fully obtained. However, the introduction of advanced process technology and equipment
together with financial and technical training provided under the project, have significantly raised
the performance levels of the enterprises. While the majority of the fertilizer plants in China has
been experiencing very serious financial problems, the situation among the four project enterprises
is less severe as result of the project benefits. Without the project, their financial situation would
have been significantly more critical.

CHINA - FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT LN 2838-CHA
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Project Review by Yunnan Xuanwei Chemical Fertilizer Company (YXCFC):
Background
1.    YXCFC produced ammonia and ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) at an annual capacity of
60,000 t and 240,000 t, respectively. As the enterprise was having financial problems that were
mainly due to the single-product structure and outdated technology, it proposed to rationalize its
operations by modernizing its ammonia process and replacing the ABC unit by a high-grade
granulated DAP and NPK fertilizer plant with 240,000 tpy capacity. The project was included in
China's Eighth Five-Year Plan, its scope optimized with assistance by the World Bank to ensure
maximum economic benefit, appraised in 1987 and approved by the State Planning Commission
(SPC) in October 1987.
2.    The project allowed establishing the first high-grade NP/NPK fertilizer plant in China
based on indigenous inputs (coal, phosphate rock, pyrites) and advanced technologies, and formed
a major milestone in the development of an internationally competitive domestic phosphate
subsector. Similarly to the urea project component, the transfer of advanced technology, technical
and financial training at management and operating levels, and partnerships of domestic design
institutes and enterprises with intemational engineering firms and equipment manufacturers were
additional benefits of the project.
Implementation Review
3.    Construction commenced officially in June 1990 and finished by the end of 1992. After
one year of operation, project performance proved satisfactory and reliable, confirming that project
selection and implementation have been successful. Performance tests verified that production
capacities, consumption levels and environmental protection met design figures and process
guarantees. Fertilizer quality complies with State standards for first-grade products.
4.    Project design and implementation were appropriate and professionally sound.  The
production facility is the first of its kind in China and uses advanced intemational technology and
equipment in its sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and DAP/NPK fertilizer plants. The project has
not only improved the company's product structure and operational standards, but also has set an
example for construction of similar new plants and demonstrated how to avoid shortcomings in
similar units based entirely on domestic design and supplies.
5.    Adoption of ICB procedures for procurement of technology, equipment and materials not
only resulted in significant s aving of investment, but also provided training in and improved
knowledge of advanced international technological developments and methodologies. Procurement
has been carried out well and the quality of the delivered goods was satisfactory.
6.    A  special Executing Agency was established by YXCFC  to coordinate project
implementation that has been responsible for supervision of construction, training, data collection
and consolidation, and as a communication link with the Bank.



33
7.    General and detailed engineering were done by a local design institute (China Nanjing
Chemical Design Institute, CNCDI). Process know-how for pyrite roasting, phosphoric acid and
DAP/NPK manufacture was supplied by intemational firms that also provided some of the basic
and detailed process engineering, and technical advice on construction and operation. By means of
local competitive bidding, a very experienced construction team was selected. High standard and
reliability in design, engineering and construction could be achieved as result of close cooperation
of all parties concerned.
8.    During project implementation, MCI established the World Bank Loan Office to
strengthen management and supervision of Bank financed projects in China. The office has played
an important part in raising project funds, resolving issues in process design, procurement and
construction, and facilitating smooth project implementation.
9.    The success of the project has demonstrated that the procedures and methodologies
adopted by the Bank in the course of project appraisal, procurement and implementation
supervision were technically sound, practical and efficient. Throughout the implementation, the
Bank project team was very committed and professional.
Conclusion
10.   YXCFC is satisfied with the scope and implementation of the project. The improvement of
its ammonia plant and substitution ABC by DAP and NPK fertilizer production units in
conjunction with advanced technology transfer, management and operator training and introduction
of modern accounting procedures present a good model for the rationalization of other medium size
fertilizer plants.
11.   The ongoing economic reform in China has also affected the YXCFC component under the
Fertilizer Rationalization Project. Since input prices and transportation costs escalated steeply
while GOC did not allow fertilizer output prices to follow at adequate rates, the anticipated
financial and economic project benefits have not materialized. Hence, the financial performance of
YXCFC has not met expectations. However, the introduction of advanced process technology and
equipment together with product diversification, training provided under the project, have
significantly raised the performance levels of the enterprises. While the majority of the fertilizer
plants in China has been experiencing very serious financial problems, the situation of YXCFC is
not as bad due to the benefits of the project. Without the project, YXCFC's financial performance
would have been much more critical. As result of rapidly increasing intemational fertilizer prices
and deepening of the economic reform in China, increases of factory gate fertilizer prices may soon
be announced which would substantially improve overall project performance.
