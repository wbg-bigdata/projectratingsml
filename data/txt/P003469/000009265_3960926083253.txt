MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FERTILIZER RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
1.          I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China to help finance a Fertilizer
Rationalization Project. The proposed loan for US$97.4 million would have a
term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest
rate.  The Government would onlend $96.1 million equivalent of the proceeds for
plant rehabilitation to the five project companies at an interest rate of 7.92%
p.a. with a repayment period of 15 years, including 5 years of grace. The
balance of $1.3 million in loan proceeds would be used for the institutional
development component, which includes $0.45 million to cover a Management Study,
to be passed on in equal amounts to the five project companies, with a service
charge of 0.75% p.a. and a repayment period of 15 years, including 5 years of
grace. The commitment charges and foreign exchange risk on all onlent proceeds
would be borne by the project companies.
2.          Background.  China is the third largest user of chemical fertilizers
in the world, with consumption of 17.8 million tons per year of nutrients (tpyn)
in 1985. However, China's level of fertilizer application, at 123 kg of
nutrients per hectare of cultivated land in 1985, was only one tlhird of the
level in neighboring countries such as Japan and South Korea. In addition, due
to local shortages, China's application rates of phosphate and potash
fertilizers are low compared to the rate for nitrogen fertilizers. Thus, there
is large potential to increase chemical fertilizer application in China's
agriculture sector. In view of the constraints to expansion of cultivated
areas, efforts toward increased and more efficient fertilizer use are central to
China's strategy to increase agricultural output. China currently has about
1,900 operating fertilizer plants and is the world's third largest producer of
chemical fertilizers. Despite an impressive build-up of production capacity
during the last decade, China still had to import nearly 30% of fertilizer
consumed in 1985. Most of the plants are small and produce low grade
fertilizers, using outdated technology which consumes excessive amounts of
energy. As demand for fertilizer is projected to reach 23.4 million tpyn in
1990, the Government has identified further development of capacity to produce
fertilizer as a priority under the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90). However,
China is expected to continue importing fertilizer for at least the next decade.
3.          In the past, fertilizer prices were strictly administered by the
Government. The ongoing economic reforms in China have introduced two-tier
pricing for fertilizers which, along with a change in policy on fertilizer
allocation, has allowed market forces to play an increasing role in determining
production and allocation. Under two-tier pricing, fertilizer plants sell their
output at controlled prices for the state plan quota and market-related prices
for above-quota output. At present, about 40% of the country's total
consumption of fertilizers is sold at market-related prices outside the state
allocation plan. The Government's strategy has been to continue gradually



- 2 -
reducing administrative control of fertilizer pricing in parallel with the
gradual dismantling of annual production planning and allocation. The
Government has recently formed an inter-agency working group to review
fertilizer pricing and allocation policies, according to a scope of work
discussed with the Bank.
4.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist the
Government in achieving its development objectives for the fertilizer sector,
namely: (a) improvement of production efficiency of medium and small-size
plants through technical renovation and energy saving; (b) reduction of nutrient
imbalances through expansion of capacity for producing phosphate fertilizers;
and (c) improvement of institutional efficiency through the introduction of
modern economic, financial and operational systems and techniques.
5.          Project Description.  The project will comprise three components:
(a) establishment of phosphate fertilizer production capacity at a low-grade
nitrogenous fertilizer plant in Yunnan Province; (b) conversion of nitrogenous
fertilizer production of four medium-size operating plants from low-grade to
high-grade products, and expansion of production capacities using energy saving
technology; and (c) a management efficiency study to introduce improved
enterprise management systems and a program to strengthen sector-wide management
training capabilities and establishment of an information management system for
MCI. The project will be carried out over five years, and the proposed loan
will provide foreign exchange funds for: (a) equipment and materials;
(b) licensing, engineering and consultancy services; (c) project management and
commissioning; (d) consultancy services for the management study; (e) overseas
training of the companies' staff; and (f) training and technical assistance.
The pollution control measures and expected emission levels of the five
companies' plants are acceptable to the Bank. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$184.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$110.1
million (59.8%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6662-CHA dated May 11, 1987, is being distributed separately.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Project will complement the
Bank's ongoing Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project (Loan 2451-
CHA), which is focused on efficiency improvements in large plants, and will
broaden the Bank's contribution to improvement of sector-wide efficiency. This
second loan for fertilizers supports the Government's strategy to rationalize
its existing medium-size plants. The phosphate fertilizer development component
will establish one of the first major DAP production facilities in China
utilizing local phosphate rock, thereby supporting the Government's strategy to
develop a phosphate fertilizer industry to help improve the balance of nutrients
in fertilizer use. Experience gained in the preparation and implementation of
the project will be useful to the Government in implementing similar projects in
the future. The institutional development component will support the
Government's efforts to improve management efficiency in the sector and will
serve as a model of a comprehensive sectoral approach to adapting organization
and management of enterprises to the increasingly commercial environment in
China.



- 3 -
7.          Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(1) to carry out the management study in accordance with terms of reference and
a timetable acceptable to the Ban'c; (2) to permit the five companies to market
directly the entire output of fertilizer from project-supported facilities, at
market-related prices, which are currently about 95-100% of CIF import prices
(subject only to such general Government provisions as may affect fertilizer
pricing at the retail level); (3) to ensure that BICEM will carry out a program
for strengthening sector-wide management training with scope, content and timing
agreed with the Bank; and (4) to maintain MCI's project coordination unit. The
five companies will: (a) develop training programs by December 1987 for review
by the Bank; (b) build and operate the plants with due regard to safety,
ecological and environmental factors and in accordance with environmental
standards satisfactory to the Bank; (c) maintain their respective project
management teams; (d) maintain debt service coverage ratios of at least 1.2;
(e) maintain long-term debt to equity ratios of no more than 75:25; (f) maintain
c1.rent ratios of at least 1.2; and (g) prepare five-year rolling financial
plans for each year from 1987-1992. During negotiations it was confirmed that:
(i) all necessary arrangements for the provision of local funds to the five
companies have been approved; (ii) the working group for the study of fertilizer
pricing and allocation (para. 3) has been formed and work has commenced on
preparing the study, for which the detailed terms of reference will be sent to
the Bank by end-June 1987. Signing of subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and each of the companies under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, as well as State Council approval of the Loan Agreement, will be
conditions of loan effectiveness.
8.          Justification.  The quantifiable benefits of the project derive
from: (a) production of phosphate fertilizer (DAP) utilizing locally available
phosphate rock, pyrites and ammonia (which is currently used for ABC
production); (b) imlrovement in economic efficiency of production through
conversion of low to high economic value fertilizers; (c) expansion of ammonia
production; (d) improvements in the energy efficiency of ammonia production; and
(e) savings in transportation costs of products mainly due to the higher
nutrient content of urea, DAP and NPK compared with ABC. The ERR for the
project is estimated at 24%. The benefits from the institutional development
component, though unquantifiable, are expected to be significant.
9.          Risks.  The project is not subject to any unusual technical or
commercial risks. It deals with existing plants, technically and commercially
proven technology, and with products which will be sold (at market-related
prices) in what are expected to be buoyant markets. There is some risk of delay
due to the lack of local experience in designing and operating facilities for
DAP and urea-based NPK fertilizers. The involvement of international
engineering firms and provision of comprehensive training for local staff would
minimize this risk.
10.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
