APPRAISAL OF PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD
POWER DISTRIBUrIONl AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Pub lic
Utilities Board of Singapore consisting of the expansion of the electric
power distribution system for the twu-year period, 1967-68,and a second
water supply project. A Bank loan of US$23.0 million equivalent (com-
prising US$15 million for powier distrioution and US$8 million for water
supply) has been requested to cover the foreign exchange cost of the
project, the total cost of which is estimeted at US$400. million,
including interest during construction.
ii.       The Borrower would be the Public ttilities Board (PUB) which is
an autonomous statutory corporation of the Go\ernment of Singapore. Three
loans have been made to the PUB; Loan No. 337-$I for US$15.0 million
equivalent for power in 1963, Loan 405-MA for O&$6.8 million equivalent
for water supply in 1965 and Loan No. 473-SI fork US$10.0 million equivalent
in 1966 for power. Experience with these loans has been satisfactory.
iii.      The power and water supply projects ar6 ~.-.:hnically sound, their
estimated costs are reasonable and the respective construction arrangements
are satisfactory. The power distribution facilities and the proposed new
water supply facilities are necessary to enable the PUB to ineet the demands
for power and water.
iv.       The PUB would be a suitable Borrower.  It has been making satis-
factory progress in correcting deficiencies in organization, staff,
management, administration and accounting.
v.        In 1966 the government rescinded the fuel tax and reduced pro-
perty taxes imposed on the PUB, and the PUB increased its tarriffs. As
a result the PUB has overcome its temporarily weak financial position
and the institution as a whole, as well as the Electricity, Water and Gas
Departments individually should be able to achieve rates of return in
excess of 8%.
vi.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.0 million
equivalent for 20 years, including a grace period of three years for the
US$150. million allocated to power distribution and a grace period of
five years for the US$8.0 million allocated to water supply.



APPRAISAL OF PUBLIC UTII.ITIES BOARD
POIU,R DISTRIBUTICI AND W1JATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
1. INTRODUCTIO1N
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Public Uti-
lities Board (PUB) of Singapore consisting of the expansion of the electric
power distribution system for the two year period 1967-68 and a second
water supply project.
1.02      The expansion of the distribution system would entail the instal-
lation of 230 M4VA of primary and 250 MVA of secondary distribution
transformers, 145 miles of primary distribution cable and secondary dis-
tribution equipment. The water supply project would entail the construction
of a new Seletar Dam and reservoir, expansion of the Woodleigh Treatment
Plant and extensions to the distribution system through 1970.
1.03      The estimated cost of the project is M$120 million (US$40 million)
including interest during construction. The Bank has been asked to make a
loan to cover the foreign exchange cost, including interest during
construction, estimated at US$23.0 million equivalent; of this amount
US$15.0 million equivalent would be expended on power facilities and US$8.o
million equivalent on water supply.
1.04      The Public Utilities Board of Singapore would be the Borrower.
The PUB has received three loans previously: US$15.0 million equivalent
in May 1963 (Loan 337-SI) for the foreign exchange cost of the first stage
of the Pasir Panjang "B" thermal station, US$10.0 million equivalent in
October 1966 (Loan h73-SI) to finance a portion of the foreign exchange
cost of the second stage of this station and US$6.8 million equivalent
in February 1965 (Loan 405-MA) for the foreign exchange cost of the Johore
River Water Supply project. The Pasir Panjang station was completed on schedule
and is operating satisfactorily. The construction of the water supply
project is proceeding satisfactorily and completion is expected in 1967.
1.05      This report is based on information submitted to the Bank by the
PUB and on the findings of Bank missions of December 1966 consisting of
Mr. P. Callejas and Mr. G.B.H. Renger, to appraise the water supply project,
and of January/February 1967 consisting of Mr. D. King and Mr. Renger to
appraise the power project.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The PUB is an autonomous public corporation responsible for the
electricity, water and gas utilities of Singapore. It was established on
May 1, 1963 by the Public Utilities Ordinance of 1963. Under this Act
the electricity, water and gas undertakings, together with all related
functions, services, assets, liabilities and associated matters were
transferred from the Singapore City Council to the PUB. It is established
as a single financial entity but it is required to keep separate accounts
for electricity, water and gas.
A. Organization and Management
2.02      The Board is composed of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and seven
other members who are appointed by the President of the Republic for periods
not exceeding three years. Board members are eligible for reappointment.
2.03      The PUB is required, with the approval of the government, to
appoint and employ a General Manager who shall, subject to the direction
of the Board on matters of policy, be charged with the direction of the
business of the PUB, its administration and organization, and the admi-
nistrative control of its employees. It is also required, with the approval
of the government, to appoint and employ a Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Engineers for the Electricity, Water and Gas Departments. The
government is required to consult with the Public Service Commission
before granting approval of appointments to any of the above posts. In
addition the PUB is required, pursuant to agreements with the Bank in
connection with the previous loans, to consult with the Bank (and has done
so) prior to making appointments to the posts of General Manager, Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Electrical Engineer and Chief Water Engineer.
2.04      The PUB may appoint such other staff as it considers necessary
to carry out its functions. The appointment, dismissal, and disciplinary
control of these employees are vested in the PUB, but the government,
with the consent of the Public oervice Commission, may require that, for
certain posts or classes of posts, the PUB exercise such functions on the
advice of the Commission.
2.05      The organization, duties, responsibilities and powers of the
PUB as prescribed in the Ordinance were established in consultation with
the Bank prior to the first powier loan. The provisions of the Ordinance
are generally satisfactory. The government exercises its power with
respect to the PUB with due consideration to the desirability of giving
the PUB a high degree of autonomy in the conduct of its affairs.



- 3 -
2.06      To initially fill the posts of Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Engineers of the Electricity, Water and Gas Departments in 1963, City Council
Officers holding corresponding posts were transferred to the PUB. The ex-
isting staff of the Electricity, Water, Gas and Finance Departments were also
transferred to the PU3B. This enabled the operation of the utilities to con-
tinue without interruption but, as all departments of the City Council were
short of experienced senior staff, the PUB was faced with a difficult problern,
which to date has not been fully solved.
2.07      On  establishment of the PUB a person suitable for the position
of General Manager was not available and a senior civil servant was appointed
in an acting capacity as a temporary measure. This proved unsatisfactory
and the Bank expressed its concern and delayed consideration of Loan 473-SI
until a General Manager acceptable to it was appointed in July 1966. Prior
to this the PUB was for practical purposes without a General Manager, and
the Chairman and Board members necessarily assumed greater administrative
responsibility. This situation tended to become crystallized and as a re-
sult the present Chairman and Board members continue to assume some of the
responsibilities which normally should be exercised by the General Manager.
This lack of delegation of authority is one of the main organizational prob-
lems of the PUB at present.   However, the situation is improving and the
General Manager, who is fully competent, is gradually assuming the responsi-
bilities of the post.
2.08      The PUB and the government agreed in early 1965 to the Bank's pro-
posal to engage the services of a management consulting firm to make a com-
prehensive study of the organization and to prepare recommendations aimed
at improving the PUB's efficiency. The consultant's report was submitted
in October 1965 but consideration of its recommendations was deferred until
the appointment of a suitable General Manager. Since the latter's appoint-
ment the consultant's recommendations have been under active consideration
and, in accordance with Loan Agreement 473-SI, the PUB is consulting with
the Bank from time to time on the actions it proposes. In addition the
PUB had made other changes recommended by its auditors and by the Bank.
2.09      Among the changes in process are the reorganization of the account-
ing system to put the accounts on a commercial basis. Those for 1966 will be
the first to be shown in this manner. The establishment of an administration
department with responsibility for personnel functions is under consideration;
It is planned to establish a separate budgeting division which will report,
along with the legal division, to the General Manager. Training has been
given greater emphasis and, temporarily, is to be put under the direct
authority of the General Manager. The Electricity Department has been re-
organized to include a planning division and a load dispatching section and
in the Water Department the planning function is also receiving greater
emphasis. In general the PUB is making satisfactory progress.



2.10      The PUB experienced difficulty in recent years as the result of
the replacement of expatriates by not fully experienced local personnel in
many senior or supervisory posts. This led to a chronic shortage of senior
staff, particularly in the Electricity Department, and necessitated an
extensive training program and strong recruiting effort. Because of the
shortage it has been necessary to retain the services of engineers of the
firms which manufactured the boilers for the Pasir Panjang thermal station
to ensure proper supervision and maintenance. While the PUB continues to
be short of some supervisory staff, the training program, which includes
training of Electricity Department staff by the Central Electricity
Generating Board in the United Kingdom, is beginning to yield results and
the situation is gradually improving.
2.11      The Chief Financial Officer retired in May 1967; his duties
are being handled temporarily by the Deputy Chief and the Chief Accountant.
The PUB is recruiting a new Chief Financial Officer and hopes to fill the
post soon.
B. Facilities of the Electricity Department
2.12      The electricity system of the PUB is well designed and of a size
and extent adequate to supply existing demands. The present installed
generating capacity is 464 HZ consisting entirely of thermal stations,
including a 22 MW gas turbine and a 27 TV free piston installation (Annexes
1 and 3). Since the PUB serves a metropolitan area comprising the city
and its environs located on the Island of Singapore, there is no significant
transmission because of the short distances. Until a few years ago power
was transmitted at 22 kv from the generating stations to main step-down
substations where it was converted for distribution over the 6.6 kv primary
distribution system. With the increase in load and load density this
arrangement grew inadequate and a 66 kv network to connect the main dis-
tribution centers with the generating stations was developed. The 22 kv
system was then largely converted to primary distribution purposes, sup-
plementing the 6.6 kv primary distribution. Future development envisages
an increasing emphasis on 22 kv primary distribution. The secondary dis-
tribution system is 400/230 volts. Industrial loads are supplied from the
22 kv, 6.6 kv or secondary distribution system depending on size and
location.
2.13      The distribution system is underground except for some overhead
6.6 kv and secondary distribution circuit serving rural developments on
the outskirts of the city and outlying parts of the Island. At the end
of 1966 the PUB had in service approximately 110 miles of 66 kv and 1,100
miles of 22 kv and 6.6 kv underground mains, 450 MVA of 66/22 kv and 500 MVA
of 22/6.6 kv primary distribution transformer capacity, and 500 MVA of
secondary distribution trnasformer capacity.
C. Facilities of the Water Department
2.14      The Water Department supplies substantially all water used for
domestic, governmental, commercial and industrial purposes by Singapore's
more than 2 million population (estimated 1966) as well as a considerable
population in the State of Johore, Malaysia. Five separate sources of



supply are utilized. These are shown on Map 2. On the island tthere is
one group of three adjoining catchment areas with reservoirs (MacRitchie,
Poirce and Seletar) which supply water to two treatment plants (Bukit
Timah and Woodleigh). There is also a small groundwater source on the
island. The major part of Singapore's water supply comes from the State
of Johore in Malaysia where there are two catchment areas supplying water
to the Gunong Pulai Treatment Works plus two river supply sources without
storage (Tebrau and Scudai). An agreement with the Government of Johore
permits Johore to take over the Gunong Pulai works and tributary catchments
on four years notice to Singapore. Under normal conditions approximately
80% of the water produced for Singapore comes from Johlore through a cluster
of three mains on the causeway to the island which are exposed to damage
by a serious accident on the railway or road facilities which share the
causeway. The sum of the reliable dry weather yields from these sources
individually is only about 62 IMGD (million imperial gallons per day).
However, the "combined reliable yield", obtained by integrated operation,
is about 88 IMGD/   Upon completion of the Johore River Water Project
(Bank Loan 405-MA) during 1967, the combined reliable yield will be about
118 I1"GDI (Annex 6).
2.15      The water system includes about 1,000 miles of transmission and
distribution mains in service which in recent years have increased at the
rate of about 30 miles per year. Water main sizes range from 4-inch to
66-inch diameter. There are about 190,000 water service connections, all
metered. There are about 2,500 public street hydrants, also metered. In
spite of the Water Department's notable efforts to match Singapore's
growing water supply requirements, deficiencies have developed in the
transmission and distribution systems and in the methods of providing
integrated control of water withdrawals from the various sources for best
economy. Therefore, a comprehensive study of the transmission, distri-
bution and control facilities was included in the Johore River Water Supply
Project and is expected to be completed by early 1968. These studies will
identify necessary improvements to the existing system which will be
incorporated into the Water Department's long-range expansion program
(paragraph 4.13).
D. Facilities of the Gas Department
2.16      The productive capacity of the Gas Department's existing facilities
is about 9 million cubic feet/day which should be adequate until about 1971
(paragraph 3.08) when a new plant with a capacity of 3 million cubic feet/day
is scheduled for completion. The gas system has about 72,000 service con-
nections and about 420 miles of distribution mains.
1/ These figures for "Combined Reliable Yield" are lower than those of
102 I4GD and 132 IMGD given in Appraisal Report No. TO-411c for the
Johore River Water Project. Of the reduction, 4 IMGD is due to
refinements in data interpretation and 10 IMGD is due to deferment
of improvements to Woodleigh Water Treatment Plant (paragraph 4.12).

3. MARKETS FOR POWER WATER AND GAS
A. Market for Power
3.01      Sales by the Electricity Department in 1962-65 increased at an
annual rate of 9.8%. On the basis of preliminary information an increase
of over 17% is indicated for the year 1966. Estimated sales in 1966 amount
to about 1,070 million kwh of which approximately 43.9% was to domestic
consumers, 48.6% for commercial and industrial purposes, 2.0% for public
lighting and 5.5% for large industrial power. Annex 2 gives the details
of sales for the period 1963-65 and the forecast for the period 1966-72.
3.02      The forecasts show an average rate of increase in total sales of
about 15.5% per annum. This rate is relatively high due to sizeable
increases in sales to large industrial customers; without these sales the
average rate of increase would be about 9%, which is reasonable and may
possibly be somewhat on the low side.
3.03      The forecast of sales to large industrial consumers indicates a
very rapid rate of growth in the 1967-70 period. After this a smaller
increase is shown as it is not feasible to estimate the industrial growth
accurately this much ahead and a conservative rate of increase has been
assumed. The forecast of large industrial load has been the subject of
detailed analysis by the PUB and their consultants on the basis of known
industrial plans, trends in the establishment of new industry, information
given by the Economic Development Board and other factors. This information
has been analyzed and estimates scaled down consistent with the fact that
experience has generally shown a considerable lag in load build-up for this
type of consumer, notwithstanding individual consumer forecasts. The
estimates of industrial sales are realistic. A breakdown of expected sales
in the main categories for 1970 shows domestic sales are expected to
amount to 32%, commercLil and industrial sales 39%, and large industrial
sales 28% of the total. This is consistent with Singapore's development
plans.
B. Market fcr Water
3.04      Water sold during the period 1960-1966 has increased at an average
rate of about 4% per year and, between 1964 and 1966, at about 7% per year.
In 1961 and 1963 water rationing was imposed because of droughts. Rationing
was particularly severe in 1963 when reliable dry weather supply capacity
was only 80% of average daily production requirements, and sales fell 11.7%
below those in 1962. Since 1963, normal rainfall conditions and increases
in supply capacity have permitted sales to resume their long-term trend.
Annexes 5 and 6 show the past trend and forecasts of future water sales.
3.05      Sales of water in 1966 totaled 78.5 INGD (Annexes 5 and 6), an
average of about 36.5 gpcd (gallons per capita per day) for the total
populationl/. Domestic use averaged about 41.6 IMGD (21 gpcd) and amounted
1/ All per capita figures for water exclude sales to the Government of Johore.



-7-
to 53% of sales. This included 6.7 IMGD used at public st.'eet hydrants
and latrines. Commercial and industrial use in 1966 was alout 15 IMGD,
representirng 19.5% of sales. Government and military use C' water
(undoubtedly including a considerable amount of domestic us% at barracks
and staff housing facilities) amounted to about 16 IMGD, 21% of total use
in Singapore.  In addition to sales on the island, the PUB s ad 5.5 IMGD
to the Government of Johore.
3.06      Water sales are expected to increase to about 107 DI.?  (equivalent
to about 43.5 gpcd) in 1972 at an average annual rate of 5.3%1. The Water
Department's highest estimate of water production requirements is based
on an average annual sales increase of about 6.5% (Annexes 5 and 6). During
this period domestic requirements should continue the trend of recent years,
making up about 56% of total sales and equivalent to about 25 gpcd for the
total population, the increase in per capita use being due primarily to
improved housing. As during the past few years the principal unknown,
insofar as future requirements are concerned, is the water use by commerce
and industry. For the forecasts such use is based on the recent trend and
by 1972 should amount to about 21 INIGD. These forecasts appear reasonable
in view of the population growth and the continuing active programs for
new housing and expanding industry in Singapore. The Water Department's
proposed expansion program should assure that these requirements for water
could be met.
C. Market for Gas
3.07      Sales of gas during the period 1961-65 increased at an average
rate of 16% annually due mainly to the construction by the government of
a number of large housing schemes. Sales increased at a lower pace in
1966. However, the Gas Department estimates that sales during the next
six years will increase at an average rate of 9½% per annum. This appears
reasonable as the government intends to continue its program of construcion
of large housing estates, which will be supplied from the PUB's gas
system. Forecasts of production and sales prepared by the Gas Department
are shown in Annex 14.
3.08      Production to meet present demand for gas averages about 6 million
cubic feet/day and this is expected to increase to about 10 million cubic
feet/day by the end of 1972.
1/ Estimates of the annual population growth rate range from 2.5% to 3.5%.

4. THE PROJECT
A. POWER DISTRIBUTION PRJECT
4.01      The electric power project consists of the expansion of the dis-
tribution system during the two year period 1967-68, representing the first
half of a program which the PUB has devised for the four years 1967-70 to
supply the load growth forecast for that period. See paragraphs 5.01 through
5.03 for the Electricity Department's overall expansion program. In the past
the PUB has systematically expanded the distribution system year by year to
keep pace with growth and the program is a continuation of this policy. The
program includes expansion of the 66 kv, 22 kv, 6.6 kv and low voltage dis-
tribution networks.
4.02      The project would include the installation of approximately 30 miles
of 66 kv circuit, 60 miles of 22 kv circuit and 55 miles of 6.6 kv circuit;
the installation of 90 MVA of 66/22 kv and 140 MVA of 22/6.6 kv transformers
to supply the primary distribution system and 250 MVA of 22/0.4 and 6.6/0.4
kv transformers to supply the secondary distribution system; and associated
switching and ancillary equipment. It would also include the expansion of
the 400/230 volt secondary distribution system network and the provision of
110,000 new meters.
Estimated Cost
4.03      The estimated cost of the power project is given below.  A more
detailed estimate is given in Annex 4.

Grand Total                       l0o00        15.00       25.00
4.04      The local currency cost includes about US$2 million equivalent, to
be paid in local currency, for certain equipment for the 66 kv and 22 kv
systems. These would not be covered by the proposed Bank loan because the
supply and financing, partially under favorable suppliers credits, already
have been arranged.



4e05      The amount of Bank financing proposed for power would be US$15.0
million equivalent to cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment, certain engineering services and interest during construction.
The proceeds would not be used to reimburse for expenditures made prior to
the date of a loan. It would represent 60% of the total cost of the power
distribution project and 29% of the capital expenditures of the PUB on
electric power facilities during the 1967-68 period (Annex 9). In the
unlikely event that there are any savings in the foreign exchange costs of
the project, the unused balance of the loan would be cancelled unless the
circumstances prevailing at the time the decision has to be taken provide
good grounds for applying the savings to additional works.
4.06      The cost estimates were prepared by the PUB which is fully com-
petent in this respect. A contingency allowance of approximately 9.5% has
been included for the local currency element of the project. The foreign
exchange contingency allowance amounts to approximately 11.5%. These allow-
ances are considered adequate. The cost of the distribution expansion program
is considered reasonable.
Status of Engineering and Construction
4.07      The Electricity Department of the PUB has planned and designed the
expansion of the electric distribution system, seeking the advice of con-
sultants (Merz and McLellan, London) with respect to particular problemas
It has traditionally purchased equipment on the basis of international com-,
petitive bidding and specifications for equipment required for the project
have been prepared with this in view. Following normal PUB practice, the
bulk of the power distribution construction work and the installation of
equipment will be carried out by contractors, under PUB supervision. The
remainder of the work will be carried out byPUB'sown staff. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory.
4.08      It is the practice of the PUB to employ consultants to design and
supervise the construction of its thermal generating plants and the Jurong
Thermal Plant was designed and is now being constructed on this basis. There
are other areas in which the guidance of engineering consultants would in
future be useful. An amount has been included in the proposed loan for con-
sulting services for a review of the power tariff structure as mentioned in
paragraph 6.07. Assurances have been obtained from the PUB that consultants
will be engaged for this purpose.
4.09      The present load growth of the PUB indicates that the future
system required to transmit power from the generating stations to the main
distribution centers will require careful planning, as a system voltage higher
than 66 kv may become necessary in the early 1970's. Moreover, a review of
basic distribution planning in this same context is likewise desirable, given
the fact that the load density will continue to increase markedly in the city
proper, and notwithstanding the fact that planming and design for immediate
expansion are satisfactory. While these studies are not directly related to
the power distribution project it would be desirable for the PUB to have
consultants undertake them without undue delay. The PUB has been informed
of the Bank's views and has indicated it will give the matter its careful
consideration. The contingency allowance in the proposed loan has been
calculated to also cover, should the PUB so request, the foreign exchange
costs of these studies.

B. THE W4ATER SUPPLY PROJBCT
4.10      The proposed project would consist of improvements and extensions
to the system of transmission and primary distribution mains through 1970,
construction of a new Seletar Dam and Reservoir, water extraction facilities
on several streams to supplement the Seletar catchment area, various pumping
stations, an expansion of the Woodleigh Treatment Plant and the supply of
water meters required through 1970.
4..11     The Seletar portion of the project would add L4P0O IM  (million
imperial gaUons) to the capacity of reservoirs for untreated water on the
island - an increase of about 260%. Eight smaUl streams on the northern
part of the island would be tapped and, by pumping, made tributary to the
new reservoir. There would be new facilities for pumping from Seletar
Reservoir to Pierce Reservoir and from Pierce to the Woodleigh Treatment
Plant and to MacRitchie Reservoir.
4.12      The expansion of the Woodleigh Treatment Plant would include new
filters, chemical dosing facilities and new pumping capacity so that the
plant could handle about 40 IMGD on a sustained basis and peak requirements
of about 54 IMGD. 1/ The location of the proposed Seletar and Woodleigh
Projects arN shown on Map 1.
4.13      Improvements and extensions to the transmission and primary dis-
tribution mains would add about 17.2 miles of 18-inch and 24-inch diameter
mains and about 21.4 miles of 30-inch through 48-inch mains to the system.
Some adjustments to the sizes and locations of a few of the mains in this
program can be expected to result from the findings of the distribution
study (paragraph 2.15), although the study is expected to affect mostly
the long-range program. About 77,000 service meters would be purchased
under the project, about 98% of which would be for domestic service con-
nections.
4.14      The prime objective of the Seletar and Woodleigh portions of the
project is to make a substantial increase in the water production and re-
verve storage capacities on the island, reducing the seriousness of any
interruptions in supply from the distant sources on the mainland (para-
graph 2.14). Engineering studies have shown that the proposed Seletar
site and structures would be the most economical means of developing a
substantial increase in storage volume on the island. In order to do this
as economically as possible, the project also is designed to make the most
effective use of the additional storage and treatment capacity in order to
increase the reliable yield from Singapore's combined sources on both the
mainland and the island. The actual effect of the project on reliable
1/ A smaller expansion of this plant was included under "Other Works" which
the PUB undertook to complVte, without Bank financing, in conjunction
with the Johore River Water Project (Loan 405-MA). This was changed,
however, in favor of the larger expansion that would be necessary in
connection with the proposed Seletar Project.



yield capacity would depend on how the reservoir and other proposed facili-
ties are operated and could range from a net increase as low as 5 or 6 IMGD,
if most of the added storage is held in reserve for emergencies, to 18 or
20 flGD if the storage is used only for increasing yield. The PUB proposes
to operate the facilities to obtain a net increase in combined reliable yield
of about 15 IMGD but the actual amount will depend on the trend in production
requirements (Annex 6).
Estimated Cost
4.15      The total cost of the project is estimated to be M$48.12 million
(equivalent to US$16.04 million) including interest during construction. The
cost estimate is summarized below and given in detail in Annex 7.

4.16      The construction cost estimates were prepared by the Engineering
Consultants, Binnie and Partner-Malaysia, and the Wlater Department. About
50% of the estimated foreign exchange and total construction costs (before
contingencies) are based on actual bid prices for various contracts. The
balance of the estimates are based on preliminary or detailed project de-
signs. The individual items in the estimates include appropriate provisions
for freight and insurance and allowances for escalation of about 2% per year.
The allowances for contingencies average about 12% for foreign exchange and
16.5% for local currency costs. The cost estimates are reasonable.



i 12 -
4.17      The amount of Bank financing proposod for water supply would be
US$8.0 million equivalent to cover the estimated foreign exchange costs in-
cluding interest during construction. The loan represents 50% of the total
project cost and excludes estimated expenditures to be made prior to the
date of a loan. Disbursements from the Loan Account would reimburse the
PUB for the actual foreign exchange costs of goods and services used in the
project. In the event that these costs are less than estimated the unused
balance of the loan would be cancelled.
Status of Engineering and Construction
4.18      The major part of the Seletar portion of the water project has been
designed and the supply and construction contracts will be supervised by
the Consulting Engineers. The Woodleigh Treatment Plant Extensions and minor
routine portions of the Seletar Project have been designed by the PUBts
Water Department which also will be responsible for supervision. The water
meter purchases and the distribution program have been planned by the Water
Department and will be carried out by contracts under the Department's
supervision. It is expected that some details of the distribution program
for 1968-1970.i may be affected by the findings of the distribution study
(paragraphs 2.15 and 4.13). These arrangements for design and construction
supervision are satisfactory.
4.19      In accordance with the PUB's usual practices, supply and construc-
tion contracts for the project are being awarded on the basis of international
competition. The procedures followed for contracts intended to be financed
from the proceeds of the proposed loan meet Bank requirements and are in
accord with those approved for the Johore River Water Project (Loan 405-MA).
For the Seletar project and certain parts of the Woodleigh project, bids
for most of the major contracts have already been received and several awards
have been made since January 1, 1967. In all these cases, the necessary
documentation has been submitted to the Bank for comment and found to be
acceptable in the event of a loan. Actual expenditures under these contracts
prior to the date of a loan are expected to be comparatively small; the
financing plan does not anticipate that such expenditures would be reimbursed
from the proceeds of a Bank loan.
4.20      The proposed schedules for meter purchases and the distribution
program are reasonable. The construction schedules which the PUB hopes to
meet for the Seletar and Woodleigh projects are very optimistic and are
liable not to be met. The Bank's reservations on this matter are known to
the PUB and the forecasts of project expenditures and completion dates
presented in this report reflect what is believed to be a more realistic
program. Fortunately, the delays that might occur are not expected to
have a significant effect on water revenues or project costs; nor should
they affect the proposed closing date for a loan since, at the latest,
Seletar and Woodleigh should be completed by mid-1970. Their principal
effect would be to delay by several months the achieving of reserve water
supply capacity on the Island of Singapore for use in the event of interrupt-
ions in water supply from the mainland (paragraph 4.14).

5. FUTURE EXPANSION PROGRAMS
A. Power
5.01      As noted in paragraph 4.01, the distribution program proposed for
Baik financing is part of the program planned by the PUB for the 1967-70
period. The four-year program has been considered in detail and the esti-
mates for 1969 and 1970, given in Annex 9 under requirements for funds, are
realistic. Amounts of similar size are shown in this Annex for expansion
of distribution facilities in 1971 and 1972.
5.02      The PUB has also in hand the planned expansion of generation
facilities. Contracts financed by suppliers credits have already been let
for the first stage of the Jurong thermal station, comprising two 60 MW
generators. Site work has commenced and the two generators are scheduled
for operation in 1969 as indicated in Annex 3. In addition, the PUB is
considering the award of contracts for the third and fourth 60 MW Jurong
generators which are planned for operation in 1970-71 as shown in Annex 3.
This program of expansion is required to enable the PUB to meet the load
growth forecast in this period. These plans were reviewed in connection
with Loan 473-SI for the second stage of the Pasir Panjang thermal station
and are still considered appropriate.
5.03      After the installation of four 60 MW units at Jurong, the PUB is
likely to install 120 MS; units and the first of these is shown in Annex 3
as commencing operation in 1972. While this is tentative, it is included
in the expansion program so that reasonable provision is made for capital
requirements in the period prior to 1972.
B. Water Supply
5.04      During the period 1967 through 1972 the Water Department's expansion
program is estimated to cost M$100.3 million. The proposed water project
amounts to M$48.1 million of this. Completion of the Johore River water pro-
ject requires M$12.5 million. Other planned capital expenditures amount to
about M$41 million, the major part for distribution reservoirs and mains in
1971 and 1972, but also including improvements to existing treatment plants
and the possible start in 1972 of a large extension to Pierce Reservoir.
5.05      If water supply requirements were to increase along the lines of
the PUB's maximum estimates (Annex 6), capital investments of about M$29
million for the second stage Johore River Project might have to begin toward
the end of 1970. On the other hand this expansion at Johore River probably
would not be necessary until 1975 or 1976, and has not been included in the
financial projections.

6. FINACIAL ASPECTS
A. Tariffs
6.01      The PUB has authority to set tariffs withott reference to the
government, though in practice tariffs are not varied ithout consulting
it.
6.02      Under the terms of the Ordinance and the ex. eting loans (Numbers
337-SI, 473-SI, and 405-MA), the PUB is required to nai tain tariffs for
the sale of electricity, water and gas and hiring of aplliances which will
produce revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses, including taxes,
if any, to provide adequate maintenance and depreciation. to meet sinking
fund contributions and periodic repayments on long-term .ebt to the extent
that they exceed provisions for depreciation and to create reasonable re-
serves. Supplementary letters to the loan agreements recx:d that tariffs
will be adequate to meet these purposes if they yield an o'serall rate of
return not less than 8% on the average value of total net fixed assets in
operation. In computing the return, depreciation is charged on a straight-
line basis in accordance with a schedule of useful life of the fixed assets
as approved by the Bank.
6.03      Through 1964 the PUB tariffs were sufficient to yield an overall
return well in excess of the required 8%. In 1965 the government imposed
a tax on fuel of M$15 per ton, representing about 40% of the cost of fuel,
and at the same time increased substantially (to 6.7% of the PUB's gross
revenues) the property tax, payable by the PUB in lieu of income tax.
6.04      Mainly as a result of the increased taxes, the overall rate of
return fell sharply from 9.6% in 1964 to 506% in 1965. Prior to negotia-
ting the Second Power Loan (473-SI), the government agreed to measures
which would bring the return back.to the required level. Electricity, water
and gas tariffs have been increased as of November 1, 1966. The fuel tax
was rescinded on August 24, 1966 and the property tax was reduced retro-
actively from January 1, 1964 to a maximum of 5.36% of gross revenues.
These measures are reflected in the financial forecasts which show that the
overall return should average about 8.5% over the next 5 years.
6.05      In the Supplemental Letter re Tariffs for Loan 405-MA, the PUB
recognized the desirability of each utility department making a full con-
tribution to the PUB's financial results. Acknowledging that the Water
Department did not make an adequate contribution to the overall return,
the PUB further stated its intention to adopt corrective measures. The
tariff and tax measures discussed above resulted in a 6.9% return for the
Wlater Department in 1966 and expected returns of 9.2% and 8.5% in 1967 and
1968 respectively. However, the Department's return is expected to drop to
7.7% in 1969 and slightly below 7% in 1970 and 1971.
6.06      The PUB has agreed to continue maintaining tariffs sufficient to
give an overall return of at least 8% per annum. It also has confirm-
ed its policy that revenues from the services provided by each Department
should cover the cost of providing such services and permit an adequate
contribution by each Department to the financial needs of the PUB.



- 15 -
6.07      The average electricity rate for the current year is calculated at
7.2 cents Malayan per kilowatt hour (2.4 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour). The
PUB has a two-meter system, which is not normal utility practice, and differ-
ent tariffs for domestic consumption for lighting and fans, etc. (average
rate 15.1 cents Malayan per kilowatt hour) and for domestic consumption for
other purposes (average rate 7 cents Malayan per kilowatt hour). In addition
with the advent of large industrial loads on the system, the tariffs for
large industrial consumers should be reviewed. Assurancos havo boon obtained
from the PUB to engage consultants to review the tariff structuro. In the
process thoy should determine a rato suitable for domcstic service wihich
would eliminato tho necessity of the two-meter system.
6.08      The new tariffs for water are calculated to yield an average of
M$1.01 per thousand imperial gallons (US$0.40 per thousand U.S. gallons)
sold for the current year, an increase of about 25% over the previous
tariffs. The new gas tariff brings an average of 3.98 cents Malayan per
cubic foot and represents an increase of about 7%.
B. Accounting System
6.09      The PUB keeps separate accounts for the Trading Departments (Water,
Gas and Electricity Departments) the Transport Center and the Service De-
partments (General Manager's, Finance, and Architect's Departments). The
latter cover such services as billing and collection. The total costs of
the Service Departments and Transport Center are charged to the three
revenue-producing departments. Water, gas and electricity meters are read
monthly by the same meter readers and one bill is sent out for the three
services. Non-payment of a bill results in prompt cut-off. This procedure
works well and there is no problem concerning uncollected accounts. Accounts
receivable and payable are kept for the PUB as a whole and consequently are
not shown on the separate balance sheets for the Electricity, Water and Gas
Departments. The cash balance or deficit shown for each department is a
theoretical figure only, the actual balance in hand or deficit being that
shown for the PUB as a whole.
6.10      In accordance with the requirements under the existing Loan Agree-
ment, the PUB is carrying out a reorganization of its accounting system
(paragraph 2.09). The PUB is being assisted by its external auditors,
Messrs. Turquand, Youngs and Co., and the Annual Report for 1966 should pre-
sent the accounts on a commercial basis properly reflecting operating costs
and depreciation charges. Before the end of 1967 the whole accounting pro-
cess, including management reporting which virtually did not exist and bud-
get control, should be geared to the new commercial system.
C. Present Financial Position
6.11      At the time of appraisal, statements covering 1966 were not yet
available and the income statements and balance sheets for this year, dis-
cussed below, are based in part on estimated data. Proliminary financial
statemonts for 1966 rocontly received confirm that these estimates reflect
accurately the present financial position.

6.12      The following table summarizes the returns of each department and
the PUB as a whole for 1963-1966 and clearly shows that until the tax
measures of the government, discussed above, the PUB's earnings were good:

1964                  11.3%            6.4%           10.6%             9.6%
1965                   5.6%            6,C%            4.5%             5.6%

During this period the PUB's debt service coverage averaged 2.25 times (1.9
times, the lowest coverage, was in 1965).

posed as follows:

290.25
The loans, subject to sinking fund requirements, have been transferred from
the former Singapore City Council. The terms of these loans vary from 20
to 40 years, the last maturing in 1980; interest varies between 3 and 5%.
The Singapore Goveinment loans made since 1963 have a 20-year amortization
period without grace and carry an interest of 5-3/4%.
6.15      The sinking fund contributions are invested in Sterling Common-
wealth securities and Singapore Municipality bonds. The government has
suggested that the PUB should convert all of its Sterling investments, which
amount to nearly 60% of the total into Singapore Government bonds. This
would result at present in a book loss of about M$6 million, but this would
be acceptable provided an equivalent yield to maturity were obtained on the
new investment. Also, since there is no ready market for Singapore Govern-
ment bonds, their maturity would have to coincide with the due date of the
PUB's debt. The PUB has assured the Bank that the sinking fund will con-
tinue to be maraged on a sound basis so as to insure that funds invested
will be sufficient to meet the liabilities in respect of the loans as they
fall due. The latest report of the external auditors on the operation of
the sinking fund was satisfactory.
6.16      Under the existing loan agreements with the Bank, the PUB is not
to incur any long-term indebtedness without the Bank's agreement unless net
revenues cover the maximum debt service requirements at least 1.5 times.
Under these covenants debt is defined as being incurred iwhen it is
drawn down. Under Loan 473-SI there is also a covenant which limits the
PUB's short-term debt to M$12 million unless the Bank would otherwise agree.

D. PUB Financing Plan. 1967-1971
6.17      Annex 16 gives the estimated sources and requirements of funds for
the PUB as a whole for the period 1966-1972. Cash flow statements for the
trading departments individually are shown in Annexes 9, 12, and 14. The
following table summarizes the PUB's financing plan for the period 1967-71:

- 19 -
6.18      The amount of M$45 million (US$15 million) proposed for the power
distribution project would cover 60% of the project cost. The amount of
M$24 million (US$8 million) proposed for the water supply project would
cover about 50% of the total project cost. The total loan would cover 14.6%
of total requirements for funds and total IBRD financing during the 5-year
period would cover 19% of these. A suitable term for the loan would be 20
years including 3 years grace for the amount proposed for financing the power
distribution project and 5 years grace applicable to the amount proposed for
financing the water supply project. Interest has been assumed at 6%.
6.19      During the 5-year period the PUB would cover 44% of its total re-
quirements for funds by internal cash generation, During this period the
Electricity Department's capital outlays would be covered for about 60% by
borrowings, and the Water Department's capital expenditures for about 50%.
6.20      The total amount of borrowings required during the 5-year period
1967-71 is estimated at M$258 million (US$86 million). The total amount of
IBRD financing would amount to M$89 million (US$29.7 million) including
drawings against the existing power loans 337-SI and 473-SI amounting to
M$ll million (US$3.7 million) and against the existing water loan 405-MA
amounting to M$9 million (US$3 million). The balance of borrowing require-
ments is partly covered by suppliers credits of M$31 million. Of this, M$1
million refers to the Gas Department and the remaining M$30 million repre-
sents credits obtained from suppliers of the most important items for the
Jurong Power Station, mainly Japanese manufacturers. The terms of the
credits vary from 15 years for the foreign exchange component to 5 years
for the local currency component. Interest rates average close to 6%.
Further suppliers credits might be obtained but in the financial forecasts
it has been assumed that the remaining financing requirements will be covered
by government loans with an amortization period of 20 years at 5-3/4% inter-
est. This is a reasonable assumption because the expected terms and con-
ditions of possible suppliers credits would not significantly increase the
PUB's debt service.
B. Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.21      Estimated income statements for the three trading departments are
shown in Annexes 8, 11, and 14   The estimated returns for each department
and for the PUB as a whole are summarized below:
1967   1968   1969   1970   1971   1972
Electricity Department              9.0%   9.8%   9.7%   8.9%   8.9%   9.2%
Water Department                    9.2%   8.5%   7.7%   6.8%   6.9%   7.1%
Gas Department                      8.2%   9,2%  10.0%  llo2%  12.0%  12.9%
PUB - Consolidated 1/               8.9%   9.3%   9.1%   8.3%   8.4%   8.8%

and the Service Departments (General Managerts, Finance, and Architect's
Departments).



- 20 -
6c22      The PUB's debt service coverage as forecast is satisfactory, and
although expected to drop from 2.1 times in 1967 to 1.8 times in 1970, it
would improve again to 2.0 timnes in 1972.
6.23      The PUB's future financial position should be satisfactory and
the estimated overall debt/equity ratio, expected to increase to 56/44 in
1968, would decrease to 44/56 in 1972. Annex 17 gives the estimated balance
sheets for the PUB for the period 1966-72; separate balance sheets for the
three trading departments are shomin on Annexes 10, 13, and 15.
6.24      The existing covenants regarding sound management of the sinkdng
fund (paragraph 6.15) and limitation of short-term and long-term debt (para-
graph 6.16) are adequate and assurances have been obtained from the PUB to
maintain them.

7. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reason-
able and the arrangements for construction are satisfactory.
7.02      The additional power distribution and water supply facilities
which the project would provide are necessary to meet the expected demand
for power and water.
7.03      The PUB is making satisfactory progress in overcoming difficult
organizational and management problems.
7004      The electricity tariff structure is in need of review.  The PUB
has agreed to engage a consulting firm to undertake such review and make
appropriate recommendations.
7.O5      As a result of tax reductions by the government and the PUB's
tariff increases, the financial position and prospects of the PUB are
satisfactory. The PUB has agreed to continue the covenants adopted in the
previous loans regarding maintaining tariffs sufficient to give an overall
return of at least 8% per annum (paragraph 6.06), consultations with the
Bank before the appointment of officers (paragraph 2.03), sound management
of the sinking fund (paragraphs 6.15 and 6,24) and short-term and long-term
debt limitations (paragraphs 6.16 and 6.24).
7.06      The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.0 million
equivalent for 20 years, including a grace period of three years for the
US$15.0 million allocated to power distribution and a grace period of five
years for the US$8.0 million allocated to water supply.

MEMORANDUM ON THE
ECONOMIC SITUATION OF SINGAPORE
Introduction
1.        The current economic situation of Singapore combines a favorable
recent record of advancement and stability with an air of uncertainty about
the longer run future. This was described in the Bank's last economic
report on Singapore (FE-52a, dated February 10, 1966). It noted the high
growth rate during the first half of the present decade, which - leaving
out 1964 when trade was depressed by the Indonesian Confrontation - averaged
about 7%. At the same time, with the rate of natural population increase
dropping from 3.2% in 1960 to about 2.5% in the mid-1960's, there was a
substantial rise in average per capita income to about $500 a year, one of
the highest in Asia. This memorandum updates the above-mentioned economic
report.
2.        The uncertainty in this otherwise favorable picture stems from
the considerable slowdown in recent times of the traditionally thriving
entrepot trade which has been the historic foundation of Singapore's prosperity.
An alternative pattern of economic activity is needed to sustain a continued
high level of growth and for this, Singapore will have to develop in the
future into an industrial, as well as, entrepot center. As a "city state"
with limited hinterland and resources, there seems no other course for the
maintenance of a prosperous development. Even now, despite the favorable
economic trends of recent years, Singapore has a large unemployment problem,
resulting from high birth rates in the post-war period, and substantial
immigration until quite recent times. Whether Singapore can achieve an
adequate rate of industrial growth is not at all clear. It has both
advantages and disadvantages for such development which have been discussed
in previous Bank reports and are referred to below. Recent events have
tended to aggravate the uncertainties. The problem was summed up in the
last Bank report as follows:
3.        A satisfactory solution to the income and employment problem
hinges on the success or failure of the effort to industrialize, including
the development of competitive exports. The task will be more difficult
than it would have been if Singapore were participating in a common market
with Malaysia. Moreover, the problem would become even more difficult if
some of the uncertainties in Singapore's outlook develop unfavorably - for
instance - a halt in U.K. military expenditures in Singapore without
replacement of such expenditures from another service; or a serious
deterioration in relations with Malaysia.
Recent Developments
4.        Since the last economic report, Singapore's economic relations
with Malaysia have deteriorated. At the time of separation of the two
territories in August 1965, some hope still remained for the maintenance of
economic cooperation and for closer market integration. These hopes have
not been realized, and now the link of a common currency is being severed



- 2 -
with the inauguration of separate monetary systems in Malaysia and Singapore
in June 1967. Uncertainty about the future of British military spending has
also been aggravated by the announced intentions of the U.K. to reduce its
military establishment in the area. British military spending in Singapore
now accounts for about 16% of Singapore's total national expenditure and
about 32,000 civilians are employed at Britain's large Singapore base.
5.        Yet with all the uncertainties, the rapid growth of economic
activity in Singapore continues. In 1965, GNP increased by about 6% and it
was probably about that figure last year. One favorable development on the
international scene - last year's end of Indonesian Confrontation - started
a partial revival of Singapore-Indonesia trade. This and other favorable
trade developments of the last two years, including U.S. purchases for
Vietnam, combined with large increases in military spending, rising
Government outlays for both ordinary and development purposes, and substantial
private investment account for the sustained pace of the Singapore economy.
Private investment rose sharply in 1965 - much of it in construction but also
in manufacturing and other fields. There was probably some decline in 1966
in view of the "wait and see" attitude of many private investors after
separation.
6.        Next to construction, manufacturing has been the fastest growing
sector of the economy. In the period 1960-1965, value added by manufacturing
in Singapore nearly doubled. It has received a substantial stimulus from
Government encouragement in the form of physical and financial facilities
and tax incentives. This has attracted foreign as well as Singapore investors.
Nevertheless, manufacturing remains small in the total economic picture - only
about 10% of total output. It is still characterized by small scale
establishments producing a wide variety of light manufactures for the domestic
market and only to a limited extent for export. Singapore is still not very
far along the way to becoming a large scale international competitor in
manufactured goods in the manner of Hong Kong and the Republic of China.
The Financial Situation
7.        Along with its favorable growth record, Singapore has continued to
maintain financial stability. External accounts are maintained in approximate
balance from surpluses on invisibles, capital inflow and other sources which
more or less offset a large deficit on trade. In 1966, foreign reserves
increased by about M$80 million after small reductions in the previous two
years. Net foreign reserves (including Singapore's share of the Malaysian
Currency Board assets) amounted to M$1,090 million at the end of 1966. This
was equal to nearly 60% of the value of retained imports.
8.        The domestic financial picture is also favorable.  Current spending
has gone up at a fairly fast rate, but so has revenue. Public sector
surpluses have been sufficient to finance over half of public development
spending. Most of the balance has been covered by net domestic borrowing
plus small amounts of foreign borrowing and use of Government balances. The



- 3 -
same pattern is prcposed in this year's budget. The 1967 budgeted deficit
is somewhat larger than in the past but this is not likely to materialize
because spending levels in the budget will probably not be reached.
9.        There has not been much chance for Singapore's finances to get
out of kilter within the Currency Board system of monetary management. The
present Currency Board, shared with Malaysia, will be dissolved in June with
the separation of currencies, but Singapore has decided to issue its own
currency under a new Currency Board system including 100% foreign exchange
cover for the currency.
Economic Plans and Development Prospects
10.       The financing of further public development expenditure on the
scale now contemplated does not appear to present serious difficulties. It
does propose public borrowing abroad in larger amounts than in the past - M$70
million a year compared with about M$40 million last year and a budgeted M$50
million this year. But these are not formidable amounts, and arrangements
have already been made to secure the bulk of the external finance needed.
11.       The development plans for the period 1966-1970 reflect a
continuation of past practices and policies. They remain well suited to
Singapore's requirements and problems under present circumstances. Emphasis
continues to be on industrialization as the engine of further growth and
increased employment. Secondary emphasis is on the improvement and maintenancE
of public sector services and facilities, both economic and social. The
role of the Government is to provide favorable conditions and adequate
incentives for private industrial investment. The actual job of initiating
and managing industry is left to private enterprise.
12.       There is some uncertainty about how well the formula will work -
whether private interests in Singapore and abroad will respond to the
industrial facilities, financial arrangements and other incentives for
industrial investment provided by the Government. Singapore has a number
of things in its favor in attempting to hasten industrialization.  It is well
located, has an educated and hard working labor force, some supply of
entrepreneurial capability and a favorable financial atmosphere in terms of
stability and institutional development. But it also has disadvantages. The
Singapore market is small and industrialization must therefore be export
oriented - probably in fields which are intensely competitive. Labor is fairly
well organized and better paid than in many other Asian countries. And,
Singapore's entrepreneurs, by and large, do not yet have the skills and
experience of those in Hong Kong, the Republic of China or Korea. It is,
therefore,-difficult to judge whether, on balance, Singapore has the ingredient
for a thriving industrial future. It is particularly difficult right now
until there is more time to assess the effect on the Singapore investment
climate of the changing relations with Malaysia, and a prospective decline
in Britain's military spending and employment.



Creditworthiness
13.       Despite this uncertainty, there is no issue at present of
Singapore's creditwiorthiness for substantial additional borrowing. The
uncertainty about the future economy is not as between growth and stagnation
but rather as between growth at a rapid rate and growth at a moderate rate.
Barring much more serious political developments in the region than now
seem likely, Singapore's growth prospects are certainly adequate to support
a much larger external debt. Ser-vice on present external debt is only
about 2% of domestic exports and net entrepot earnings and other foreign
receipts on current account.
