  REENGAGEMENTAND INSTITUTION-BUILDINGSUPPORTPROGRAM

                         GRANTANDPROGRAMSUMMARY

Recipient:     Central African Republic

Implementing   The Ministryof Planning, Economics and InternationalCooperation
Agency:
Amount:        SDR 55.4 million (US$82millionequivalent)
Terms:         IDA Grant

Objective and  The proposed Grant for a Reengagement and Institution-Building Support
Description:   Program sets the stage for meaningful reengagement of the donor
               community that is sustainable over time. It would assist the Central African
               Republic (CAR) in its economic and social recovery underpinned by the
               Government's Economic and Social Policy Framework (ESPF). This one-
               tranche operation would support Government-owned reforms that might
               help stabilize the security situation, strengthen institutions and reduce
               poverty, through budget financing of basic public services. It would be the
               first IDA operation in CAR since the country went into arrears in 2002. It
               i s an integral part of the Bank's strategy for reengaging with CAR.
               The key objectives of the ESPF are: (i)    consolidation of security and peace;
               (ii)reinforcement         of  transparency and      good    governance;    (iii)
               macroeconomic stabilization and deepening of reforms;                and (iv)
               rehabilitationof infrastructure and social sectors. The proposed operation is
               designed to help achieve these objectives through support for policy
               measures aimed at: (i)      restoring the key functions of State planning,
               execution and control, as regards (a) definition of strategic frameworks at
               the nationaland sectorallevels, (b) public finance management and (c) State
               personnel management; and (ii)        improving governance, as regards (a)
               transparency and accountability; (b) observance of investors' rights; and (c)
               managementof natural resources(mining and forestry sectors).

               Proceeds of the proposed operation would provide funds necessaryto assist
               the Central African Republic with foreign exchange needs in the period
               immediately after arrears clearance.

Disbursement:  The proposed Grant would be released in one tranche, immediately
               following effectiveness of the FinancingAgreement.

Benefits:      The proposed Grant would support the resolution of CAR'Sarrears to IDA,
               failing which full-scale financial support from IDA could not be restored.
               This reengagement would pave the way for a resumption of social and
               economic development activities in CAR, which in turn is expected to help
               improve a fragile security situation and ease tensions in the region. The
               proposed Grant would address poverty reductionintwo important ways at a
               critical time in the country's transition to democratic rule following the
               peaceful elections of 2005.

                First, the Grant would contribute to the establishment of a stable
                macroeconomic framework more conducive to economic growth and would
                enable coordinated donor reengagement. Second, the Grant would help the
                Government improve and modernize public finance management through
                improved reporting of all revenues and expenditures in priority sectors,
                audits of the Treasury and a private customs revenue collection agency,
                improved Treasury management, and the adoption of a unified budget and
                accounting nomenclature that would enhance the Government's capacity to
                trace revenues and expenditures. Further improvements would be made in
                 the payroll and personnel management system, including for military
                personnel, to further reduce the scope for fraud. Control over and efficiency
                 of public expenditure management, especially non-wage expenditure on
                 which controls are currently lax, would also be tightened up and effective
                 sanctions introduced for non-compliance with procedures. Overall, this
                program is expected to increase budget resources available for primary
                expenditures that would be concentrated on key programs with a high
                beneficialimpact on the poor.
                 On governance, the proposed Grant supports: (i)      stronger anti-conuption
                efforts, which should in turn increase public resource availability; (ii)  an
                 improved business environment through better observance of investor
                rights, and better trained judges as regards business law; (iii) revised
                                                                                    a
                investment code, new telecommunications code and new forestry code; (iv)
                greater transparency inthe mining sector, as regardsreportingof the content
                 of mining conventions; and (v) adherence to and implementation of the
                Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Risks:          The proposed Grant is high-risk. The four main risks are: (i)  security risk,
                internally and/or at the regional level (CAR shares borders with Chad,
                DRC, the Republic of Congo, and Sudan (Darfur), all countries where
                 security i s fragile); (ii)
                                          political risk,namely that the Government i s unable
                 to maintain its commitment to implement the reforms, notably in public
                 finance management and the mining sector; (iii)       macroeconomic risk,
                includingthe possibility, after September 2007, that CAR could again fall
                into arrears to IDA, if CAR has not reached the Decision point by then, if
                expected external flows do not materialize and/or if the Government's
                revenue mobilizationdoes not improve; and (iv) fiduciary risk,particularly
                for the resourcesallocated through the budget.
                While mitigation of the security risk falls outside of the scope of this
                operation, it i s expectedthat other development partners will remain closely
                involved in this area. Political risk would be mitigated by broad-based
                frequent consultations with stakeholders to strengthen the case for reforms
                and Government's commitment to them. The macroeconomic risk would
                be mitigated by closer economic monitoring by the Bank and the IMFand
                an acceleration of the HIPC timetable, provided that overall government
                performance is fully satisfactory on the part of the Government. Finally,
                the fiduciary risk would be mitigated through a combination of AAA
                (notably a CFAA), technical assistance and capacity building(under LICUS
                11)andexternal oversight of the Treasury Committee.

                                   I.INTRODUCTION

1.    This report constitutes the Program Document for a proposed Reengagement and
Institution-Building Support Program (RIBSUP) Grant to the Central African Republic
(CAR) in the amount of SDR55.4 million (US$82 million equivalent). This constitutes
the first Development Policy Operation (DPO) aimed at supporting the development
strategy of the Government of the Central African Republic in the context of a multi-
donor reengagement process. The proposed RIBSUP Grant will be a single-tranche
operation, based on the Government's program and prior actions undertaken for its
implementation. It contains a series of triggers and milestones from which, on the basis
of progress realized, prior actions for eventually proceeding with another operation will
be derived.

2.    Proceeds of the proposed Grant would provide funds necessary to support CAR
cash flow needs in the period immediately after arrears to the International Development
Association (IDA) have been paid. The proposed Grant would also support budget
expenditures. In addition, the Grant would permit the resumption of assistance from
several donors after a long period of interruption and would set the stage for assistance
under the enhanced Initiative for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) that would
alleviate the country's external debt burden.

3.    The Government of CAR drew up an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) in Dec 2001, but progress towards a full PRSP was delayed by an outbreak of
conflict that culminated in a change of regime in March 2003; it i s now expected to be
completed inthe first half of 2007. Inorder to present donors with a comprehensive view
of its strategy and address the most urgent needs of post-conflict transition while the
PRSP i s being finalized, the Government has drawn up an 18-month Economic and
Social Policy Framework (ESPF), known in French as the Document Cadre de Politique
Economique et Sociale (DCPES). The ESPF i s based on a policy statement presented to
the National Assembly in August 2005 and ongoing work to finalize the PRSP. It i s
coupled with a Transitional Results Matrix (TRM), which includes core priorities through
mid-2008 with which donor strategies can align. The ESPF shares the same goals and
priority areas with the PRSP under preparation, namely: (i)  reinforcement of security and
consolidation   of peace; (ii)institution-building and governance           reform;   (iii)
macroeconomic stabilization and the promotion of economic growth; and (iv) access of
the populationto essential social services andinfrastructure.

4.    The proposed RIBSUP Grant of US$82 million i s part of an exceptional IDA
allocation of US$lOO million for the IDA-14 period, to support the process of
reengagement through both budget support and investment operations. CAR qualifies for

exceptional treatment under the exception to IDA'Sallocation rules, which allows that
"additional allocations may be provided on a one time basis to countries that are in the
process of reengaging with IDA after a prolonged period of inactivity on the basis of a
strong transition plan with concerted donor support".' The allocation of the remaining
US$18 million will be considered in the Joint Interim Strategy FY07-08 that i s being
preparedjointly with the African Development Bank (ADB).

5.     The proposed Grant i s part of an overall package of IDA operations to improve the
financial management of the state, raise fiduciary standards and support public
administration reform. In particular, it i s supported by components of a US$6.8 million
grant from the Low Income Countries under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund, approved in
October 2006, to provide, inter alia: (i)     capacity-building and technical assistance to
enhance governance and economic management systems (EGEMAS); and (ii)an
assessment of the mining sector.




               11. CAR'SDEVELOPMENT          CHALLENGES      AND PROSPECTS


A.       Socioeconomic and Political Background

6.     Political Situation. CAR gained independence from France in 1960. After three
decades of misrule by various governments, civilian rule was established in 1993. A
series of uprisingsby soldiers in the mid-1990s led to protracted internal conflict, which
intensifiedin May 2001 when army officers came close to deposing the elected President,
Ange FClix PatassC.       The Government was able to foil the coup, but the situation
remained unstable, and systematic attacks carried out by the Government security forces
on the ethnic group of the former head of State, General Andre Kolingba, who claimed
responsibility for the attempted overthrow, resulted in widespread looting and killing. In
March 2003, General Franqois BozizC succeeded in overthrowing the PatassC
Government and established a Transitional Government, as well as a legislative National
Transitional Council.        A new Constitution was adopted in 2004.          Free and fair
Parliamentary and Presidential elections were held in March and May 2005, and Franqois
BozizC was affirmed as President and inaugurated the following June.                   A new
Government was formed and took office in July 2005. It i s headed by a former senior
official of the ADB as Prime Minister.

7.     Security. The security situation remains fragile and significant risks undermine
recovery efforts. Since 2005, violence has continued in the North, with repeated clashes
between government forces and rebel groups. Although these groups are divided and
unlikely to gain enough support to topple the Government, they have caused instability
and disrupted economic activities, forcing 30,000-50,000 civilians to flee into the interior
and a further 20,000 flee to Chad. In addition, the Government does not control the area

the MillenniumDevelopmentGoals. IDA/R2005-0029, March 10,2005. Annex 1, paragraph9.

close to the common borders with Chad and Sudan, as recently suggested by the fall of
Birao into rebel hands on October 31, 2006.

8.    Insecurity in neighboring countries adversely affects the CAR economy.            For
example, insecurity between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire makes it impossible for trains
to run; hence CAR i s obliged to export all of its logs by roadthrough Cameroon, which i s
more expensive. At the same time, highway robberies remain a problem on the Bangui-
Cameroon road. Coupeurs de route, also known as Zaraguinas, are road blockers who
attack travelers along the main provincial roads, seriously impeding the free circulation
of people and goods. The problem i s compounded by the proliferation of small arms and
light weapons all over the country (with an estimated 50,000 incirculation inBangui and
its immediate surroundings).     Foreign investors, especially in the mining sector, are
reluctant to invest due to insecurity and the associated high costs. On the social front,
public service personnel are reluctant to be located outside Bangui for the same reasons,
limiting the reach of government services in rural areas.        The country's significant
tourism potential, both in the West and the East, i s considerably constrained for the same
reasons.

9.    Overcoming this situation will require significantly stronger donor commitment in
support of the Government's effort to restructure its security forces.      Currently, the
national army (FACA) consists of approximately 5,200 members comprised of a
patchwork of former militia and rebel groups, mostly over-aged, and without the means
to function properly.    The security forces lack discipline and rather than providing
protection, constitute at times a source of insecurity.        Archives and key security
documents were destroyed during the various lootings, weakening the administrative
capacity of the State and daily operations inGovernment. Domestic and external partners
all agree that reducing insecurity i s essential for sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction. Given its geographic location, improving security in CAR requires a
regional approach with better collaboration of all of the countries concerned (Cameroon,
CAR, Chad, DRC, the Republic of Congo and Sudan).

10. Economic Decline. Affected by repeated bursts of conflict, CAR experienced weak
macroeconomic performance in the last decade, with a limited rebound since 2005 in the
wake of the democratic transition and subsequent political stabilization. Contrary to
other countries of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC),
CAR'S economic performance after the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc was poor.
Economic growth and fiscal stability have proven to be elusive goals since then. The
decline in agriculture was particularly marked, with production falling by more than 50
percent in both 2002 and 2003. CAR GDP grew by 1.3 percent in 2004, rising to just
over 3 percent in 2006. Over the last decade per capita income has declined markedly.

11. DeepeningPoverty. CAR has lost at least 25 years inits human development. The
economic decline has been accompanied by increased poverty and worsening social
indicators.  Poverty in CAR deepened over the last two decades resulting from a
combination of a limited economic base, a difficult geography and political turmoil. The
Human Development Index for CAR dropped by 5 percent between 1990 and 2003, from
0.375 to 0.355, placing CAR in the bottom 5 countries worldwide. Life expectancy and


                                             3

education rates are at or below levels found at the time of CAR'S independence in the
1960s. Health statistics are equally dismal: the mortality rate for children under the age
of 5 has increased from 180 per 1,000 in 1988 to 230 per 1,000 in 2003. Similarly,
maternal mortality rates have doubled in 15 years, rising from 683 per 100,000 in 1988 to
1,355 per 100,000 in 2003. HIV/AIDS i s also taking its toll, with a prevalence rate
estimated at 10.7 percent in 2005. The decade-long conflict has dramatically worsened
the well-being and livelihood of children and women throughout the country, as
manifested by the highnumber of displaced persons and refugees, and rapes and violence
against women and the most vulnerable members of society, as well as the destruction of
the social fabric inmany communities.

12. Deterioration of Public Finances.            The country's difficulties have been
compounded by conflicts as well as weak political and economic management over the
last few years, resulting in persistent budgetary and external current account deficits.
These have required domestic and foreign financing that have created twin domestic and
external debt overhangs, compromised the integrity of the budget as a central State
mechanism for allocation of resources according to Government's priorities, and forced
the Government to favor short-term objectives (such as salary payments, security needs
and state consumption of utilities) at the expense of sound long-and-medium-term
decisions (investments for economic development, maintenance of basic infrastructures.)

13. Exports. The balance of payments has remained in deficit throughout the last
decade, financed by accumulation of external arrears, in turn compounding
macroeconomic imbalances. Both exports and imports declined over the period 1997-
2003. B y 2003, the value of exports represented only about 60 percent of the 1996 level.
In the last decade, the share of diamond exports and timber exports, the country's two
leading sectors, averaged one-third of total export revenue, while unrecorded exports
escaped through widespread evasion and smugglingdue to weak customs administration.
It is believed for instance that diamonds sold in Antwerp with a CAR origin amount to
between 2 to 4 times the value of official diamond exports registered.

14. Trade Balance. Over the same 1996-2003 period, imports adjusted only partially
to the significant drop in exports, contracting only about 17 percent. This resulted in an
aggravation of the current account deficit over the whole period, particularly marked in
services and incomes.       Similarly, the balance of private sector transactions was
systematically negative. The balance on goods has further worsened inthe last two years,
largely due to rising petroleum prices.

15. Revenue Mobilization. The picture i s equally dismal on the fiscal front, with
meager revenues being inadequate to finance the core expenditures of the state (wage bill
and utility consumption). Revenues rank as among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa,
averaging between 8 and 9.5 percent of GDP in 1997-2001, rising to a peak of 10.8
percent in 2002, and then falling back to a low of 7.7 in 2003 and reaching 8.2 percent in
2005. Moreover, due to compensation mechanisms requiredby suppliers in the presence
of significant domestic arrears by the State, cash revenue amounts to roughly 6 percent of
GDP. The main reasons for the low revenue mobilization include the widespread
insecurity, a high share of subsistence agriculture not favorable to the establishment of


                                              4

solid tax base in rural areas, a weak customs administration, a large informal economy
and widespread tax evasion, especially inthe miningsector.

16. Fiscal Balance. As a result of poor revenue mobilization, the primary balance has
been very small or negative, reflecting the reality that the Government i s unable to fully
pay interest on internal and external debt. The fiscal deficits that resulted were initially
financed by a combination of debt relief and grants, but these have dried up since 2000
and the Government has increasingly resorted to accumulating arrears, both internal and
external, to finance its deficit - especially after 2001/2002. This i s all the more so since
access to bank financing, whether from the Central Bank or commercial banks, i s highly
constrained because credit lines have been heavily drawn down and monetary rules in the
CFA zone limit bank advances to finance the deficit.

17. Expenditure Control. Public finance management (PFM) in CAR has deteriorated
with conflicts directly affecting public administration. Budgetary outcomes frequently
have little to do with the finance law voted by Parliament. The proliferation of extra-
budgetary expenditure and the bypassing of the expenditure chain has hindered the
integrity of the budget system and prevented a clear analysis of the efficacy of public
spending. The discrepancy between allocations and executions makes it difficult to
monitor budget outturns. However, recent measuresto adhere more closely to the budget
law, especially through control of cash advances (caisses et re`gies d'avance), should
constitute a first step toward a progressive strengthening of budgetary management.

18. Structure of Expenditure. Expenditures which used to reach about 16 percent of
GDP have gradually been reduced to about 12 percent.              More than one-third of
expenditures goes towards wages and salaries, more than one-fifth i s for goods and
services, and about one-tenth i s for transfers and subsidies. Because of the predominance
of wage (4-5 percent of GDP) and non-wage expenditure (especially for goods and
services), and of the low levels of capital expenditure, the Government i s unable to invest
for growth. At the same time, as in many sub-Saharan African nations, most expenditure
i s concentrated in urban areas, while most of the poor live in rural areas. Despite the
wage bill's high share of GDP, the civil service i s in disarray, with the average age of
civil servants well over 45. The retirement of civil servants may pose a significant fiscal
burden owing to the fact that their wages have been frozen for the last twenty years as
statutory increases have not been paid. However, their pensions are calculated as if these
increases have been paid, so that their pensions, which are currently unfunded, may even
exceed their final salaries.

19. Financial Intermediation. Thanks to conservative monetary management at the
Bank of Central African States (BEAC), the Central Bank of CEMAC countries, inflation in
CAR has been contained throughout the last decade, averaging only 3 percent in2005. In
fact, inflation has never been a significant problem, as i s to be expected given CAR'S
membership in the CFA zone. At the same time, by relinquishing monetary sovereignty
to the BEAC, CAR has faced difficulties in dealing with its mounting domestic debt
overhang without possible recourse to seignorage. Interest rates charged by the BEAC
and commercial banks are also high, at 10 and 18 percent respectively.




                                               5

20.   Domestic Debt. The State has been unable to service domestic debt consistently,
which has led to a drawing down of domestic assets and a large buildup of domestic
arrears. The factors behind the accumulation of arrears include the lack of an effective
cash management system, weak coordination between Treasury and spending ministries,
the prevalence of extra-budgetary expenditure, overall poor budget control and
accounting practices, and the persistent under-budgeting of certain categories of
expenditures, notably utilities.

21.   Domestic Arrears. The stock of domestic debt, which amounted to about 31
percent of GDP at end-2004, has decreasedto about 26 percent of GDP and consists of a
combination of salary arrears (42 months in all) and arrears toward the private and
banking sectors. The accumulation of salary arrears has contributed to domestic conflict,
and the accumulation of arrears to the banking system and private suppliers i s a factor
behind the erosion of confidence on the part of the financial and private sectors in the
ability of Government to pay its bills. The result of this situation i s an increasing
unwillingness of suppliers, unless effectively so compelled, to sell to the Government
except on a prepayment basis, which, in turn, has further weakened the expenditure
management system. By not paying salaries regularly until October 2005, governments
have compromised the trust of civil servants, lowering morale and increasing incentives
for corruption. This situation greatly improved over the 12 months preceding September
2006, a period duringwhich no additional salary arrears was accumulated.

was characterized by substantial arrears to both multilateral and bilateral creditors (Box
1). As of end-2005, total debt including arrears was about US$1.07 billion (about 90
percent of GDP), of which US$741 million are current maturities and US$328 million
represent arrears (27 percent of GDP). Of these external arrears, about US$102 million
was owed to multilateral creditors (US$49 million to IDA, US$36 million to ADB,
US$9.4 million to the OPEC fund, and US$6.8 million to FAD),and US$184 million to
official bilateral creditors, of which US$23 million to the Paris Club, and the rest to other
official bilateral creditors. Commercial debt to the London club stands at about US$48
million, of which US$42 million corresponds to arrears.                        A joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) i s being prepared in the context of the HIPC Preliminary
document for Board discussion in December. It i s expected that these numbers will be
subsequently refined.

24. External Debt Sustainability. Since CAR i s in non-accrual status with nearly all
its creditors, it i s clearly in a situation of debt distress. The country's estimated NPV
debt-to-exports ratio as of end-2005 i s 538 percent2. This clearly places CAR's debt
burden at an unsustainable level. The HIPC common reduction factor, which will be
confirmed in the Decision point document, i s likely to range between 70 and 75 percent.
The stock of external arrears in 2005 was close to 27 percent of GDP. CAR's inability to
service its external debt i s also apparent from Table 2, which shows that over the period
2003-2008, CAR's external sector i s characterized by both a negative resource balance
and a negative current account balance. The domestic primary fiscal balance has been

the HIPC initiative.

negative over the last three years and i s likely to be only marginally positive for the next
three years.      At this stage, external debt can only be serviced through exceptional
financing.

Arrears

25. Macroeoconomic Imbalances.                      The reasons explaining the rapid buildup of
external arrears relate to the fiscal situation in the 2002-2005 period. During that time,
receipts represented around 8 percent of GDP and total expenditures averaged more than
13 percent. The domestic primary balance (i.e., receipts less domestically financed non-
interest expenditure) was negative. Actual debt payments have risen from 0.3 percent of
exports of goods and services in 2002 to about 3 percent in 2005, mainly as a result of
repayments to the IMF under the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA), while
scheduled debt service has been in the range of 25-30 percent of exports over the same
time period. Hence, external arrears have accumulated on a regular basis.

26.    Arrears Clearance. Looking forward to 2008, CAR i s expected to progressively
raise domestic revenue collection by a cumulative 1.7 percentage point of GDP between
2003 and 2008. Total expenditure would be limited to about 12 percent of GDP. The
domestic primary fiscal balance would remain slightly positive, reaching 1 percent of
GDP in 2007 and 2008, and there would be no further accumulation of external arrear~.~
This leads to a residual financing gap of 20-25 billion CFAF (i.e., close to 3 percent of
GDP per year) or 71.5 billion CFAF (about US$140-150 million) for the three year
period). The mobilization of these additional resources would not be possible without a

  Inthat connection, it is worth noting that total debt service payments amount to about 2.9 per cent of GDP
per year (US$45-50millionper year).

resolution of the existing stock of external arrears, which has prevented IDA and other
multilateral Banks from fully reengaging. This i s particularly important for the social
sectors and to consolidate early gains of the political transition and the improved social
climate since the Government has started paying salaries on a regular basis.

27.   FinancingRequirements. Under these conditions, itis clear that CAR is unable to
service its external debt without substantial debt relief from multilateral and bilateral
donors in the context of both the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). The fact that the country i s in arrears also implies that debt relief
would initially be "notional" in that it would only reduce debt service due relative to the
situation before relief. Debt actually paid would increase relative to the current situation
where nothing i s paid. In turn, increasing debt service payments would be difficult, on
account of the limited primary fiscal surplus, unless existing primary expenditures are
reduced andor revenues increased.         The messages for the international financial
community are clear: (i)    arrears clearance alone and debt reduction through the HlPC
Initiative will not suffice, as CAR would still lack the domestic resources needed to pay
current maturities and invest for development; and (ii) CAR will need continuedfinancial
assistance even after it attains the HIPC Decision point. The sustainability of CAR'S debt
will depend on the willingness of official creditors and donors to provide positive net
transfers to the country in grant or highly concessional terms while reforms are taken by
the authorities to progressively increase their primary fiscal surplus and limit CAR'S
current account deficit.

28.   HIPC DecisionPoint. Medium-term fiscal and external debt sustainability will
depend fundamentally on the implementation and successful monitoring of both the
HIPC and MDRI Initiatives. Assuming that a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) i s approved inDecember 2006, Decision point would normally be reached upon
completion of the first PRGF review in September 2007 (i.e., on the basis of end-June
performance). However, advancing the Decision point to, say, end-June could lower
unreduced debt service due by about US$7-8 million, thereby freeing up an equivalent
amount of resources for development expenditures (about 10-15 percent of non-wage
expenditures).   In other words, lengthening the period between arrears clearance and
Decision point would: (i)    increase the amount of unreduced debt service to be paid as
well as the risk of the country falling back into arrears; and (ii)  reduce the amount of
external assistance that can be used to finance development expenditures. Thus, CAR
and the international community have a common interest in the country reaching the
HIPC Decision point as soon as possible.

29.   Contribution to Growth. One of the major long-term challenges for CAR is its
weak economic base. Sparsely populated and landlocked, CAR i s predominantly an
agrarian economy focused on crops, livestock, timber, huntingand fishing. In structural
terms, agriculture's share i s roughly half of total GDP and grew at 2.2 percent over the
1997-2005 period (see Table 3). Growth and social stability in the country will require
strong policies to jump-start agricultural activity. France and the EUare taking the lead
among development partners in this area, particularly with cotton, where domestic arrears
and insecurity have paralyzed production in recent years. Sustainable agriculture will
also require a diversification of production. To move to a path of sustainable growth and


                                             9

poverty reduction, the country will also need to: (i)    improve security and enhance trust
between the Government and its partners; (ii)     increase the rate of investment, both public
and private; (iii) increase the supply and quality of public services, particularly in rural
areas; and (iv) improve the environment for private investment.

30. Fiscal Space. Table 3 shows that the sub-sectors contributing most to growth
(hunting and fishing) are not the ones most likely to generate revenue. In the medium
term, as the HIPC process kicks in and as the resource balance improves, the debt
servicing obligations of the state will decrease. However, it i s important to note that debt
relief in itself will not free resources for social sector and investment spending since no
debt service i s currently being paid. Because of a weak revenue base and necessary core
expenditures, the capacity of CAR authorities to raise discretionary expenditures i s
limited. The Government's economic reform program and fiscal and macroeconomic
frameworks (Tables 4 and 5) reflect these constraints.               Success requires major
commitment on the part of the Government, particularly with respect to good
macroeconomic management, domestic resource mobilization and prudent fiscal policy.
It also requires an effort on the part of the international community, which will have to
continue to provide significant financial assistance for the foreseeable future.



B.      Macroeconomic and FiscalFramework for 2007-2009

31.     The most recent currently available macroeconomic framework for the next three
years was prepared on October 2006 with the assistance of IMF staff, in the context of
discussions for a possible PRGF.The macroeconomic framework i s summarized in Table
4, including an estimate of the overall financing gaps, while Table 5 provides an
overview of the fiscal framework for 2002-2009. The framework i s predicated on the
following assumptions:



                                               10

    0  Economic growth rising from 3.1 percent in 2006 to 4.0-4.5 percent in 2007-
        2009;
       Inflation declining from 4.5 percent in 2006 to 3.0 to 2.5 percent by 2009;
        Constancy of the exchange rate innominal and real terms;
        Gross investment rising from 8.3 to 10.4 percent of GDP, with private investment
       increasing by 1.2 percentage points from 5.6 to 6.8 percent of GDP, and public
       investment rising by only 2.7 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP;
       Revenues, including grants, rising from 11.5 to 13.3 percent of GDP and
       expenditures increasing from 12.4 to 13.5 percent of GDP, implying an overall
       deficit (commitment basis) of less than 0.5 percent of GDP duringthe program;
       The domestic primary balance (excluding grants, foreign financed investment and
       interest payments) remaining positive in all years, averaging 1percent of GDP.

32.    The framework also supposes that there i s no further accumulation of external
arrears and that debt service i s fully paid in a timely manner on an unreduced basis (i.e.,
that no debt relief through the HTPC Initiative has been assumed so far). Annual debt
service requirements amount to about 21 percent of exports of goods and services, or 32
percent of tax revenues. This implies a financing gap equal to scheduled external debt
service, which i s expected to be filled by the provision of external financial assistance.
To this it i s necessary to add the financing arrangements needed to clear the stock of
external arrears, without which it will be impossibleto qualify for a PRGFfrom the IMF,
which would inturn block assistance through the HIPC Initiative.

33.  Inthis context, the proposed DPO has been prepared inclose consultation with all
other development partners, including the WIF, based on the following approach:

       Simultaneous clearance of arrears to IDA and ADB before end-2006, and
       provision of positive transfers large enough to permit CAR not to fall back into
       arrears;
       Comprehensive treatment of arrears and debt by all multilaterals based on the
       principle of non-negative transfers and participation inthe HIPC Initiative;
       Debtrescheduling with bilateral creditors through the ParisClub; and
       Reaching the HIPC Decision point no later than September 2007, which implies
       putting in place a PRGF no later than December 2006. The common reduction
       factor i s likely to be in the range of 70-75 percent, which could lead to a 80-90
       percent reduction in scheduled debt service with frontloading of HIPC assistance
       -andhenceacommensuratereductioninfinancingrequirements.

34.   Progress i s as follows:

         The IMF i s preparing a PRGF with presentation to the IMF Board, tentatively
         scheduled for December 22, 2006, at which point the HIPC Preliminary document
         would also be presented;

         CAR and the ADB are working on arrangements leading to full clearance of
         CAR'S arrears to ADB inDecember 2006:

         The Government has already addressed letters to other multilaterals (BADEA,
         BDEAC, FAD, OPEC Fund) requesting them to initiate discussions on a
         comprehensive treatment of CAR arrears and external debt;

         The Government has already reached agreements to clear its arrears to BDEAC
         and BADEA, and has initiated discussions on further debt relief and new
         financing;

        The Paris Club would be asked to consider a Naples rescheduling immediately
         once the PRGFprogram i s inplace.

35.   Underthese assumptions, Table 5 summarizes government finances for 2006-2009,
and incorporates in particular (i) clearance of arrears to IDA and ADB; (ii)
                                     the                                            bilateral
debt rescheduling; and (iii)      non-accumulation of arrears during 2007. Under these


                                             12

assumptions, there i s a zero residual financing gap for 2007, and financing gaps in 2008-
2009 corresponding to debt service before HIPC relief.

36. It i s expected that the macroeconomic framework outlined here would be updated
duringthe finalization of the PRGF, and later revisedas preparations are made for CAR'S
admission to the HIPC Initiative. The additional financing to be made available under
the PRGF will increase available external financing and admission to HlPC will reduce
debt service in 2008-2009. These developments, together with reengagement of other
multilateral donors and increased flows from bilateral donors, should generate the fiscal
space to increase development expenditures.

                       111. CAR'SDEVELOPMENT         STRATEGY

A.     Policy Framework

37.    Protracted internal conflict has caused difficulties in the preparation and adoption
of a long-term strategic vision. In July 2005, the Government developed a draft Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) for 2005-08, which builds on an Interim PRS that covered the
period 2000-03.

38.    However, the final PRSP i s not expected to be ready before mid-2007.
Consequently, in mid-2006, the Government decided to draft an Economic and Social
Policy Framework (ESPF) to lay out its reform plans over the following 12-18 months.
The Framework i s accompanied by a Transitional Results Matrix.

39. An important Government objective of the ESPF i s to help renew dialogue with
development partners to kick-start economic recovery and strengthen its capacity to
reduce poverty. Economic growth that i s strong, sustainable and shared will stem from
improved governance, thus enabling development of the private sector, enhanced
competitiveness in the mining, forestry and agriculture sectors, and better targeted public
expenditures.

40.   The policy framework i s built around the four main pillars of the draft PRS: (i)
reinforcement of security and consolidation of peace; (ii)    improvement of governance
and public sector institutional capacity; (iii)
                                              promotion of macroeconomic stability and
economic growth through structural reforms; and (iv) improvement of the population's
access to essential social services and rehabilitated infrastructure.          Within this
framework, the Government i s developing strategies for, inter alia, a security sector
reform, a reform of thejudiciary to enhance the rule of law, an anti-corruption action plan
and a medium-term rural development strategy. These strategies are expected to be
embedded inthe forthcoming PRS.



B.     Pillar 1 Reinforcement of Security and Consolidation of Peace
               -

41. Key issues: Reinforcement of security and consolidation of peace are absolute
prerequisites for a successful outcome of the Government's development strategy. CAR
has intensified its cooperation with neighboring countries (Chad, Cameroon and Sudan)
and regional institutions, and has engaged in joint activities to improve border controls
and prevent conflicts.     CEMAC has deployed 380 troops through FOMUC, its
multinational force funded in part by the European Union and supported by the
Government of France. FOMUC's mandate expires in August 2007. BONUCA, the
office of the UnitedNations' Special Representative of the Secretary General (UNSRSG) in
CAR, provides training to the Police and Gendarmerie, in addition to its advisory and
advocacy work in political and human rights issues, and its role in security monitoring.
The UN system i s active through its Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and
looks at a larger and more sustainable intervention (2007-201l),   especially in the interior



                                            15

as security permits. Civilian disarmament activities and operations aimed at strengthening
local governance and security are being implemented by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) with financing from the Governments of Sweden and France
respectively.

42.   The largest donor-funded security project in CAR so far has been the Multi-Country
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP), for a total of US$9.8 million. The EU,
through its `Peace Facility' window, i s another major sponsor of security-related efforts.
It is supporting FOMUC, the regional peacekeeping force. until mid-2007.                 The
Government of France has another important military cooperation arrangement with
CAR. In addition to logistical support to FOMUC, France i s providing training of the
Gendarmerie and i s planning similar activities for the Police. France has also seconded a
defense advisor to the President's Office.      Finally, the office of the UN Secretary
General's Special Representative (UNSGSR) in CAR, the BONUCA, also provides some
trainingto the police.

43.   Reform strategy: The respective roles and responsibilities of`the various national
actors involved in the country's security need to be clarified. In the last few months the
Government has expressed concerns regarding the state of its security sector and has
strengthened dialogue with its partners on how to address them. In the short run, the
objective i s to improve security and freedom of movement on key commercial routes,
including in distant rural areas. The Government will need assistance from donors and
multilateral partners to enhance the capacity of its security forces through training and
equipment for communication and transport. In the medium term, further to completing
the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) program launched by the
Bank and the UNDP, the Government will prepare in consultation with domestic
stakeholders and development partners a new legislative framework for the security
sector to clarify the mission of the respective security forces, define their size, determine
recruitment policy, introduce modern management tools and present a medium-term
expenditure framework to cover the needs of the different components of the security
sector.

44.   Transforming the security sector will require broad consultations with multiple
partners and sustained political will. In this context, the Bank - at the request of the
Government - undertook a review of security sector issues in August 2006 inthe context
of the MDRP and concluded that major reforms were needed. While in many of these
areas the Bank does not have a mandate or expertise, areas for improvement include
public finance management of the security sector. Budget preparation and expenditure
management, including payroll management, in the security sector are weak and do not
conform to accepted norms, rules and procedures. In these areas the Bank, which has a
mandate and core competencies, could make a useful contribution.

C.       Pillar 2 Institution-Buildingand GovernanceReform
                 -

State Administration

45.   Key issues: Under the transitional Government (March 2003 - May 2005), CAR
made visible progress on institutional and structural reforms, with improved democratic
governance that enabled free and open democratic elections.          Improving governance
further will require a revamping of the institutional capacity of the State in general and in
particular; (i) deepening of budgetary reforms already engaged; (ii) significant
                 the                                                            a
strengthening of the whole expenditure chain and controls, including through a system
that produces reliable and timely statistical and financial management data to monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness of public expenditure; (iii)  a reform of the administration and
civil service; together with (iv) steps to decentralize and deconcentrate the State. The
judicial sector i s also in need of an overhaul and the fight against corruption needs to be
strengthened.

46. Reform strategy: The program for institution-building in the public administration
sector addresses financial management, personnel management functions and economic
decision-making.      The emphasis i s on customs and tax administration, treasury and
budgeting. The objective i s to enhance both the tax base and revenue, to improve public
expenditure control (particularly for the wage bill) and to improve its efficiency. A
decentralization law, effectively transferring power and resources to local governments,
will be submitted to Parliament. Inaddition, the Government will enhance its capacity to
produce reliable socio-economic and financial statistics on poverty, public finances,
external trade and public debt, to better inform the preparation of the budget, and
establish a baseline for MonitoringandEvaluation (M&E).

47. Particular emphasis i s to be placed on the reform and modernization of the civil
service, which the Government considers essential to improving the quality of public
services.    During 2006, the Government has been concentrating on setting up an
Integrated Financial and Administrative Management (IFAM) system to improve payroll
management and reduce fraud.           In the medium term, it plans to reorganize the
administration through functional audits, address procedural reform of human resource
management through the implementation of the IFAM system, and reform the wage and
incentive system.

Fiduciary Standards

48.   Key issues and reform strategy: Special attention needs to be given to raising
fiduciary standards that are currently extremely low. The Government intends to put in
place modern budgeting processes, with greater transparency and accountability in the
Treasury cash management system, including through external oversight.               It will
strengthen controls over the entire public expenditure chain.        More specifically, the
Government will strengthen and rationalize internal control processes through the
adoption of a new nomenclature for public expenditures and limit its use of exceptional
procedures.     The Government will also strengthen and rationalize external control
institutions. Finally, the Government wishes to increase the effectiveness of



                                              17

Parliamentary oversight on the Executive regarding the management of public resources.
These efforts will be supported through a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) to be undertaken jointly with France and the European Union, and it i s expected
to produce an Action Plan to strengthen budget formulation andexecution.

Procurement

49. Key issues and reform strategy: The Government and the Bank completed a
Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) inApril 2006, which provides a detailed action
plan for a comprehensive reform of public procurement, including early steps for visible
and immediate results. In particular, the action plan recommends adopting a new
procurement code and companion regulations (the standard bidding documents, guides
and user manuals), and then establishing, equipping and staffing the new procurement
institutions (i.e., regulatory agency, fiduciary agency) created by these texts. The
Government intends to formally adopt the CPIP action plan and request international
technical assistance for its implementation.     A new legal, regulatory and institutional
framework, that complies with international best practice will improve transparency in
the State's public procurements, including for purchases of military equipment.

TheJudiciary

50. Key issues and reform strategy: The Government i s preparing, with EU support, a
national roundtable on justice that will contribute to the preparation of a modernization
plan for the sector to improve the rule of law in a sustainable way. The Government
objective i s to strengthen institutional capacity, promote broader civil society
participation and provide judicial services in courts that are more transparent, fair,
equitable and accessible. To support these reforms, the Government, while establishing
an independent Higher Council against corruption, will rehabilitate the Ministry's run-
down facilities, modernize and equip Jurisdictions and Courts, provide logistical support
to the Cour des Comptes (the Court of Accounts) to improve its oversight over public
accounts, strengthen the rule of law in the private sector, and increase consultation
between private and public sectors.

CorruptionandMoneyLaundering

51. Key issues and reform strategy: CAR fares far worse in governance indicators than
the regional Sub-Saharan Africa average, particularly with respect to government
effectiveness, rule of law and regulatory quality. The Government intends to implement
the recommendations that emerge from a corruption study being undertaken by UNDP
and Transparency International. It will prepare a national action plan to fight corruption
and money laundering, and will harmonize legal codes with international conventions in
this area and with enhanced sub-regional cooperation. The Government will strengthen
the capacity of the Ministry o f Justice's anti-corruption cell through technical assistance.




                                               18

D.       Pillar 3 Macroeconomic Stabilization & the Promotionof Economic Growth
                 -

52. Key issues: The key issues are increased revenue mobilization, which i s essential to
improve the delivery of basic services and raise the level of public investment, and a
better business environment as well as structural reforms in sectors with growth potential
(in particular agriculture, the private sector, forestry and mining) - all of which are
needed to raise private investment.

RevenueMobilization

53.   Key issues: At 8.1 percent of GDP in 2005 (excluding grants), revenue mobilization
in CAR is far too low and one of the lowest in sub Saharan Africa. Since 1999, the
Government has implemented a number of measures to improve revenue mobilization. A
variety of administrative reforms have been implementedin the last six years to increase
revenues by strengthening domestic tax collection procedures and curbing fraud. Firstly,
the use of the single taxpayer identification number (TIN) has been introduced in order to
bringthe informal sector into the tax base, strengthen the fiscal agenciesinorder to make
them more effective, and improve taxpayer compliance.            Secondly, in January 2001,
replicating the experience of other sub Saharan African economies, CAR introduced a
value-added tax with a single rate of 18 percent (subsequently increased to 19 percent).
Third, there have been greater efforts to rein incorruption inthe diamond and the logging
sectors.    The 2003 contract with BIVAC international, one of the world's largest
providers of import control and inspection services, as well as an agency for export
verification in the forestry sector, i s evidence of that effort. Nevertheless, revenue as a
percentage of GDP has remained on average below 9 percent, resulting in a lack of
financing for the core activities of the state, and hindering both economic growth and
political stability inCAR.

54. Reform strategy: While there has been some progress, much remains to be done to
significantly increase revenue mobilization and develop an effective and integrated
revenue administration. The Government needs to improve the management of large
taxpayers through an intensification of efforts to penalize delinquency, as well as
improve the record-keeping for smaller and medium scale enterprises.

55. Finally, with regard to custom reforms, the authorities have reinforced customs
border posts and a transit customs office in Douala that acts as a one-stop window for
transit trade. But its performance has been mixed. The recent abolition of the customs
department due to allegations of widespread impropriety necessitates that the
Government select a different institutional customs framework to minimize fraud. A new
customs information database, which will permit more comprehensive tracking and
reconciliation of customs data between the Douala advance clearance office, the customs
headquarters in Bangui and regional offices, i s urgently needed, as well as more ad hoc
inspections to monitor customs fraud. At the request of the Government, the Bank i s
providing emergency technical assistance to revamp the customs department, rationalize
the sequence of the customs clearance chain, and clarify the role of the various customs
brigades with a focus on the informal sector. With the requisite political will, there i s
scope for enhancing revenue mobilization.



                                              19

PrivateSector Development

56. Key issues: The private sector in CAR (including agriculture) has suffered as a
result o f poor governance and repeated internal economic and socio-political crises, as
well as conflicts in central Africa. CAR has natural resources in minerals and forestry
products, but foreign private investment in these areas has been limited by the poor
business environment.

57. Reform strategy: The Government intends to improve the business climate in the
country. The strategy consists of: (i)     reducing the cost o f factors (electricity, telephone,
water and transportation); (ii)   facilitating the transit of import goods; (iii) improving the
rule o f law for the private sector; and (iv) lowering administrative barriers for private
investors. First, on utilities, the Government will launch audits to prepare for a
restructuring o f ENERCA (energy) and SODECA (water) by 2008. Furthermore, the
Government intends to revise the regulatory frameworks in the telecommunications and
forestry sectors in2006, and inminingin2007/08. Inthe telecommunications sector, the
Government is currently modernizing its legal, regulatory and institutional framework to
reflect the existing competitive environment and adapt national texts to international
good practices. This enabling environment should increase private sector investments to
develop the national network and new services. This will provide better, cheaper access
to services, and make themmore accessible to the poor, particularly inunderserved areas.

58.   The Government also intendsto facilitate imports, exports and transit activities, and
lower the number o f administrative barriers, legal and other, that affect private investors.
For instance, it i s in the process o f establishing a one-stop shop that will enable
companies to conduct all administrative and business registration procedures in one
place. This action will be effective if procedures themselves are simplified and staff
given the authority to sign off, without reporting to Department Directors. Beyond, the
facilitation o ftransit will also depend on the security situation.

59.   The Government will increasingly rely on consultations with organizations in
charge o f private/public sectors relations. To formalize this consultation framework, the
Government would like to strengthen the capacity o f employers' organizations and
promote a management center. To durably improve its relations with the private sector,
the Government will proceed with an audit o f all domestic arrears accumulated by the
State, including arrears due to private companies. A strategy for arrears clearance will be
preparedand implementedas financing becomes available.

Agriculture

60. Key issues and reform strategy: The objective i s to raise revenue in agricultural
households in targeted areas by 2008. Particular emphasis will be placed on increasing
productivity and production through support for basic infrastructure and equipment,
rehabilitation o f agronomic research, better access to markets, and better organized and
trained producers. The Government will seek to increase the competitiveness o f the
sector, rehabilitate the cotton sector, stimulate coffee and food production, broaden
access to agricultural services and credit, andpromote public and private investments.



                                                20

Forestry

61. Key issues:      Despite years of political unrest and civil conflict, forestry has
continued to play an important role in CAR'S economy.           Issues in forestry include
ensuring that timber harvesting rights are allocated on the basis of market mechanisms
and that forestry taxes are collected. The forestry legal and regulatory framework i s
being revised in order to: (i)modernize and strengthen, in line with emerging
international standards, the dispositions pertaining to the preparation and implementation
of forestry management plans; (ii)progressively increase the rate of domestic
transformation of logs; (iii)revise criteria for attribution of harvesting permits; (iv)
tighten tax reporting and collection arrangements; and (v) improve arrangements for
sharing forestry revenue with forestry communities. The revised framework has been
prepared with substantial assistance from France and will be soon be the object of
national participatory consultations with key stakeholders. IDA and other donors are also
being invited to provide comments and suggestions.

62. Reform strategy: Government efforts will focus on improving stakeholder
sensitivity to the importance of sustainable management of existing forestry resources
and raising tax revenue for the State and local populations. The Government will seek to
improve the implementation and compliance with the forestry code.             It will launch
invitations to tender remaining forest harvesting and management plans (FHMP),
encourage domestic processing of logs, develop the oversight capacity of the forestry
administration, and reform the forestry fund with private sector and local community
participation.

Mining

63. Key issues: The mining sector i s an important source of revenue for CAR. The
country i s believed to have good potential in the mining sector (alluvial diamonds, gold,
iron ore, uranium), which could be a significant source of economic growth, employment
and community development in the medium and longer term if enabling conditions are
put in place. Government capacity to manage the sector i s limited, however, and is
characterized by weak governance.        Priorities include: (i)an upgrade of the legal,
regulatory and institutional settings in the mining sector; (ii)an improvement of
governance and transparency in the sector, including the Kimberley process; and (iii)     the
initiation of the process defined by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI). The country will also need reforms to enhance the investment climate and build
sustainable institutional capacity in the sector.     Assistance from private and public
partnerswill be sought to quickly stimulate production.

64. Reform strategy: A sectoral strategy that identifies constraints and define a road
map of actions will be prepared based on the recommendations of the National Dialogue
forum, other consultations and the institutional assessment of the sector financed by a
LICUS Grant. In this context, CAR plans to promote socially and environmentally
responsible artisanal mining practice, and to demonstrate the benefits of organization and
formalization to the small-scale and artisanal miners for: (i)securing their livelihoods; (ii)
improving working and living conditions; (iii)protecting and caring for their



                                            21

environmental and natural resources assets; and (iv) developing the social and economic
well-being of their families and communities.        The framework for a mining sector
environmental management will be put in place along with appropriate procedures and
guidelines to improve the environmental impact of project inthe sector.

65.   Governance and transparency will be improved through the strengthening of the
Kimberley process (i.e., diamond traceability) and the improvement of diamond
valuation. The assessment of the country's mining resources should not only promote
exploration, but also enforce security and the fight against fraud. Key institutions will be
strengthened in their capacity to monitor and control the diamond chain, while
management gets support to implement reforms inthe sector.

66. The Government will seek to promote responsible private investment in the sector,
both national and foreign, while ensuring that the country captures a reasonable share of
the resource rent. To achieve this, the mining law (mining code) promulgated in 2004
should be reformed to bring it fully in line with internationalbest practice, particularly as
regard the titling process. To reassureforeign investors, the management and the security
of mining titles and the stability of terms in contracts signed by the Government need to
be improved. Over time, the Government will review the mining code and draft a
standard agreement template for new concessions based on the technical recommendation
of a panel of international experts. Updating the miningcode will involve the alignment
of fiscal, financial, and regulatory provisions to accepted international mining good
practice.    To improve transparency, the Government will publish summaries of
convention, including mining bonuses, demonstrate their accountability in Treasury
accounts and proper use through formal accounting and budgetary mechanisms. For
CAR, this will constitute a first step toward entering the EITIprocess.



E.     Pillar 4 Access of the Population to Essential SocialServices & Infrastructure
                -
Education

67. Key issues: The education system in CAR i s in serious need of rehabilitation. The
national gross primary enrollment ratio, which was 117 percent in 1988 dropped to 67
percent in 2003, far below the average of the CEMAC countries (82 percent) and Sub-
Saharan Africa (95 percent), with strong disparities between regions and by gender.
Repetition and drop out rates are high at 30 percent and 16 percent respectively. The
education system suffers from a shortage of teachers, materials and equipment. Teachers
are unwilling to serve in rural areas, especially those affected by conflict with little
housing availability. The situation i s worsened by an increasing number of teachers
being infectedby HIV/AIDS.

68. Reform strategy: The Government has identified five actions it aims to undertake:
(i)reinforce capacity of existing academic structures and administration; (ii)     prioritize
marginalized and minority areas; (iii)   promote community responsibility in the area of
education; (iv) raise parents' awareness; and (v) increase government resources for
education to reach over time about 26 percent of the investment program.              In the



                                             22

transition period, the Government will help revive the education system nation-wide,
working with local authorities and communities, parents, NGOs and faith-based
institutions.  Other specific issues the Government will tackle include: (i)    promoting
equal access to education for girls; (ii)targeting poor regions and marginalized areas with
the weakest education indicators; (iii) reducing repetition rates and improving completion
rates. The Government will need to, inter alia, provision for equipment, construct
classrooms, design new curricula, create 100 new literacy centers, and develop
partnerships with communities.

Health

69.   Key issues: The health situation in CAR has deteriorated over the years of socio-
political instability, with the most prevalent health problems linked to HIV/AIDS,
infectious and parasitic diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and malnutrition. The
incidence of HIV/AIDS i s currently estimated to be 10.7 percent (2005). Life expectancy
declined from 49 years (1988) to 43 (2003), and the maternal mortality rate doubled in
the same period and currently stands at 1,355 per 100,000 births. Health facilities,
particularly in isolated areas, are run-down, poorly equipped, lack drugs and
consumables, and some have no runningwater and electricity.

70. Reform strategy: The Government will take measures to reduce infant and maternal
mortality and intensify the fight against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, in
collaboration with religious organizations, humanitarian agencies, and NGOs.             A
particular effort will be made for isolated areas. The Government i s also initiating
programs aimed at increasing access to potable water to assure adequate sanitation in
rural areas.

Basic Infrastructure

71.   Key issues: Poor infrastructure presents a major challenge to CAR. Access to
electricity, water and telephone i s low inBangui and almost non-existent inthe rest of the
country. The road network, which has never been very dense, has deteriorated due to
lack of maintenance. Rural areas, where 56 percent of the population lives, are isolated
from markets, health centers and schools, and only 27 percent of the population have
access to improved sanitation facilities.

72. Reform strategy: Targeted government actions to improve the basic provision of
infrastructure include: (i)the rehabilitation of rural tracks and roads in production areas;
(ii)efforts to disenclave isolated areas in the country; (iii)the development of air
transport, notably local; (iv) an increase in energy production; and (v) the diffusion of
new communications technologies.         The construction of basic infrastructure will be
linked to poverty reduction efforts. NGOs and civil society are expected to play an
important role.

              Iv.   BANKSUPPORTTO THE CENTRALAFRICANREPUBLIC

A.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

73. Without a significant increase in external assistance, the risk i s high that CAR will
be unable to improve the living conditions of its citizens, which in turn could bring about
renewed conflict.      This would risk de-stabilizing CAR and undermining recovery
prospects for years. Reengagement with the donor community and an increased amount
of resources i s required to reestablish the conditions for a resumption of growth and
provide the most basic social services to the population. Bank support has been limited
since CAR fell in arrears to IDA. Other multilateral financial institutions are in the same
situation.

74.    The proposed Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program Grant sets
the stage for meaningful reengagement of the donor community that i s sustainable over
time. First, it will enable the clearance of external arrears accumulated toward IDA,
through repayment of bridge financing provided by the Agence Franqaise de
De`veloppement (AFD), and also pave the way for HIPC debt relief with attainment of the
Decision point expected no later than September 2007. HIPC debt relief i s needed to
prevent the gains of this operation from being wiped out by the country's falling back
into non-accrual status. Moreover, this operation should facilitate an early adoption of a
PRGFprogramwith the IMF.

75. In addition, the proposed RIBSUP Grant would provide around US$7 million to
finance new budget expenditure. These resources, equivalent to over one month of the
Government's wage bill, will provide some flexibility for the Government toward the end
of the year. For instance, provided this i s the choice made by the Cabinet, some of these
resources could be channeled through the budget for social expenditures. Moreover, by
enabling the reengagement of IDA with CAR, this operation will unleash additional IDA
resources (around US$18 million) that will be available for investment programs and
rapid results activities with a visible impact on the population. Finally, it will enable the
disbursement of the remaining US$14.5 million available on the HIV/AIDS credit. The
scope of the later credit may be restructured to make it more relevant for today's
priorities, for instance to help improve social service delivery on a more global scale.



B.      Linkto Joint Interim Strategy FY07-OS

76. The Bank's overall strategic framework for this operation i s a Joint Interim Strategy
FY07-08, which i s scheduled for Board presentation inDecember 2006. This instrument
will be the Bank's strategy for reengagement, in consultation with other donors, and
representsjoint work with the African DevelopmentBank (ADB). The process envisages
a simultaneous reengagement of the main bilateral and multilateral external partners of
CAR following the successful implementation of the post-conflict program supported by
the IMF.




                                              24

77. The Strategy i s fully aligned with the ESPF and PRSP under preparation by the
Government. The objective of the Joint Interim Strategy i s to help the Government put
the country on a sustainable and shared growth path. It i s focused on two areas: (i)
economic recovery, governance and capacity building; and (ii)human development,
particularly for the poor.

78. The proposed RIBSUPGrant directly contributes to the first area by supporting the
Government's reform programs in public finance management, in governance in the
mining and forestry sectors, and in reducing the obstacles to unblock private sector
development. It will also be instrumental in helping CAR: (i)    restore relations with all
multilateral creditors through coordinated arrears clearance; and (ii)
                                                                     gain earlier access to
multilateral and bilateral debt relief through the HIPC and MDRIInitiatives.



C.      Relationship to other Bank Operations

79.   Since CAR fell into arrears to IDA, in 2002, all IDA credits have been closed with
the exception of the HIV/AIDS project, which was kept open on an exceptional basis, and
with disbursements being limited to advances under the Project Preparation Facility
(PPF). Beyond this, the Bank's portfolio has been limited to a US$9.8 million h4DRP
and two LICUS Grants.

80. The proposed Grant complements existing operations, notably a second LICUS
Grant of US$6.8 million approved in October 2006, which followed a first such Grant of
US$4 million approved in August 2004 (LICUS I)to improve public finance
management and support service delivery in social sectors and to assist the Government
in the finalization of the PRSP. Building on achievements under the previous LICUS
Grant, the second Grant supports five areas: (i)public finance management and
governance; (ii)  Miningsector institutional assessment; (iii) to community-driven
                                                             support
development and social sectors; (iv) interim support to HIV/AIDS treatment; and (v)
reforms to enhance human security.

81.   Two components of the second LICUS Grant are particularly relevant for this
operation.    First, the Enhancing Governance and Economic Management Systems
(EGEMAS) Grant i s a companion activity to this operation that will provide needed
measures for upgrading the Government's revenue collection system, strengthening
public expenditure management, cash management system and settling domestic arrears,
civil servant management and payment control, and improving the public procurement
system. France, the EU, IMF and UNDP are also making a concerted effort to support
this critical activity. Second, the Mining Sector Assessment will provide the baseline
information neededfor the Government to improve governance inthe sector.

D.      Collaboration with the IMF

82. The Bank has worked on CAR in close collaboration with the IMF since the first
Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) was approved in 2004 in the amount of
SDR 5.57 million. Following its satisfactory completion, a second EPCA was approved
on January 27, 2006 in the amount of SDR7 million. The IMF i s currently preparing a
PRGF, which is expected to be presented to its Executive Board in December 2006 and
following the normalization of the Government's financial relationships with its
multilateral creditors (or at least a firm plan to do so). It i s expected that the program that
will be negotiated will provide for measures to complement and reinforce the reform
program supported by the RIBSUPGrant.

83.   The two institutions are also collaborating on the preparation of the HIPC
Preliminary document, which i s currently scheduled for Board presentation at the same
time as the PRGF in December 2006. This document will discuss the timing of the
Decision point, which would normally be upon completion of the first PRGF review in
September 2006, on the basis of end-June performance. However, discussions are in
progress as to whether this timing can be advanced, so that the Decision point could be
attained no later than June 30. This would reduce the share of external support which
would have to be used to help CAR pay its current debt service maturities in a timely
manner following arrears clearance, thus limiting the risk that the country would fall back
into arrears and effectively permitting an increase in the share of external assistance
which could be usedto finance development expenditures, rather than debt service.

84. There i s also close collaboration with the IMF on technical matters concerning
economic governance, public finance management and sectoral questions. For example,
the IMF has been consulted on the design of PFM activities, which are financed by the
LICUS Grant and underpinthis operation.



E.      Coordination and Harmonizationwith Other Donors

85. The preparation of the DPO, and indeed IDA'Soverall reengagement strategy, has
led to increasingly intense collaboration with other donors, not only with ADB but also
France, the European Union, the USA and the UN system. Specifically, over the last
year, donors have assisted the authorities in preparing the Government's TRM, which
supports the ESPF. This has helped the Government play a much stronger role in leading
aid coordination activities - an extremely difficult task in the country's fragile economic,
social, and political situation. The Government and external partners rely on the TRM as
a framework for strengthening development effectiveness. In this respect, responsibility
for coordination of external development assistance has been given to the Direction
Ge'ne'rale de la Coope'ration pour le De'veloppement.               A formal framework for
consultation and collaboration between the Government and its external partners - the
groupe de contact - was created in 2004 and meets on a regular basis under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, Economics and InternationalCooperation.




                                              26

86. Once the PRSP i s finalized, the Government intends to make it the main policy
framework for collaboration with its external partners. Alignment of external partners'
development assistance strategies with country priorities will strengthen over years to
come. Donors are also increasingly coordinating their activities and strategies, largely as
a result of the consultations held as part of the preparation of the JISN by the World Bank
and the ADB.

87. France and the EUare the two main donors in CAR. France, inparticular, has been
providing support for the' security sector, where the Bank has no mandate. The UN
family i s also active in the country. The EU and France (as well as UNDP) currently
manage their activities from their field offices in Bangui, unlike the World Bank where
the Country Manager for Cameroon in YaoundC currently covers CAR. To facilitate
coordination and partnership with Government and other external partners, the World
Bank plans to scale up its presence in Bangui in 2007, with the appointment of a Country
Manager to take up residence as early a possible in the year. The ADB and the IMF still
manage most of the projects andprograms they finance from headquarters. Development
assistance agencies on the ground holdincreasingly frequent informal meetings with each
other.



F.      AnalyticalUnderpinnings

88. The RIBSUP also builds upon a substantial volume of analytical and advisory work
undertaken during 2004-2006. The Bank has made a substantial attempt to rebuild its
knowledge base starting with the February 2004 Joint Assessment Mission. This mission
launched analytical and capacity-building work, providing significant inputs to help the
transitional Government produce CAR'S first TRM. Follow-up technical meetings
among development assistance agencies took place inMay 2004 to assist the Government
in identifying which TRM actions could realistically be implemented in light of the
administration's weak capacity and limited donor resources. The report produced by the
2004 mission, or Policy Notes, presented an overview of issues pertaining to recent
economic, political and security developments, public finance management, private
sector development, natural resource management, macroeconomic questions and poverty
reduction. A conflict prevention analysis was issued in 2005, expanding some of this
work.

89. The Bank's analytical work was deepened in 2006 by a Procurement Review
(CPIP), an assessment of the business environment prepared by IFC, an assessment of the
security sector prepared by CPR and the h4DW secretariat, and an aid effectiveness
review. Additional pieces of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) currently in
preparation include a CFAA, which i s being conducted jointly with France and the EU
and will provide a key analytical underpinningto this operation (see section on Fiduciary
Assessment), an External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), and a Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS). In addition to that, several pieces of analytical work have been
undertaken through the LICUS IGrant, including several reports by consultants on key
public finance management issues (a review of Treasury operations, a survey of domestic
arrears, upgrading payroll management systems, promoting the budget and accounting


                                               27

reform). All of this analytical work has been drawn up and incorporated in the design of
the proposed RIBSUP. The proposed RIBSUP Grant also draws on work done by other
donors in the areas of public finance and governance, in particular the European Union,
France, the IMF,the ADB and UNDP/Transparency International.




V. THEPROPOSEDREENGAGEMENTAND INSTITUTION-BUILDINGSUPPORTPROGRAM

A.      Description of the Operation

90. Reform Program. The Government's interim strategy, the Economic and Social
Policy Framework (ESPF) and associated TRM are described in Section III.These
documents were adopted by the Cabinet on November 4, 2006. They constitute the
reference framework behind the Government's Letter of Development Policy (LDP),
translated in Englishin Annex 2. Through its LDP, the Government has requested IDA
to support an important subset of the reforms outlined in its strategy under pillar I1
(Institution-Building      and Governance Reform)       and pillar I11 (Macroeconomic
Stabilization and the Promotion of Economic Growth) while other donors are supporting
other reform areas, including pillar I(Reinforcement of Security and Consolidation of
Peace) and pillar IV (Access of the Population to Essential Social Services and
Infrastructure). The Bank i s also supporting the fourth pillar through other instruments
that will be described inthe Joint InterimStrategy FY07-08.

91. Policy Matrix.          The reform program supported by the Reengagement and
Institution-Building Support Program Grant i s outlined in the policy action matrix
(Annex 3).    This operation i s the first Development Policy Operation in the Central
African Republic. By clearing the way for IDA and other multilaterals, notably ADB, to
reengage with full-scale programs in CAR, this RIBSUP Grant also prepares the ground
for possible programmatic support to CAR in the future. Such support would be subject
to the availability of resources and the overall progress in implementing reforms as well
as the evolution of the country situation, and would support the Government's
development strategy, with each phase of support specifying recommended triggers for
moving to the next phase.

92. Objective. This operation, with the possible series of programmatic reforms, would
lead over time to the restoration of the country's fiscal sustainability, significant progress
ineconomic governance and enhanced transparency for the State. Inthis first operation,
the focus will be to develop key public finance and payroll management systems that will
help raise domestic revenue, strengthen the Treasury's control over expenditures, and
ensure timely payment of public wages and utility consumption. To increase the state's
tax base, particular attention will be given to improving the business climate and
promoting private investment, especially inthe miningsector.

93. Finally, because the consolidation of the State requires political stability and trust
from its citizens, it i s important for the Government to reduce chronic disparities across



                                              28

regions inthe delivery of basic services, consolidate the rule of law and improve security
(particularly in peripheral areas and on key commercial routes). Regular payment of
salaries to civil and security sector personnel, and a more consultative and transparent
approach to policy and budget formulation, with both domestic stakeholders and external
partners, should help in that regard. These aspects have been factored in the design of
this programto the extent allowedby the Bank's mandate.

94. Design.       A single tranche of US$82 million would be made available at
effectiveness. O f this, at the request of the CAR authorities, about US$62.4 million
would be usedto directly reimburse AFD that i s in the process of extending a bridge loan
used to clear the CAR'S arrears to IDA; the remainder would be deposited into
Government's accounts in the BEAC. Some of these resources would be used to finance
priority new budget expenditures, except those on a negative list, as specified inSchedule
1 of the Financing Agreement.        The use of the funds deposited by IDA in deposit
accounts of the Central Bank will be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA.



B.      PriorActionsfor the ReengagementandInstitution-BuildingSupport
Program

95.   As reviewed in section 111, and in agreement with the Government's LDP
(Annex 2), a few actions are deemed essential to the successful implementation of the
Government's program. While satisfactory progress has been made in several areas,
completion of all prior actions i s required for Board discussion of the proposed
Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program Grant. These actions are as
follows:

    Committee (IC) satisfactory to IDA, and will be submitted to the I C and the
    Council of Ministers for their deliberation on the agreements in question.
   These opinions will be made available to IDA for information on a strictly
   confidential basis.

        0   Ministerial order prohibiting special forest harvesting permits.


C.      Proposed Triggers for a Possible Second DPO

96. The reformprogram supported by the Grant i s outlined inthe policy action matrix
(Annex 3). This operation i s the first DevelopmentPolicy Operation inthe Central
African Republic. B y enabling the clearance of external arrears accumulated toward
IDA, this RIBSUP Grant lays the foundationfor a possible series of Programmatic
Support for Economic Recovery and Institution Buildingoperations. This potential
series, subject to the availability of resources, the overall progress inthe program and the
evolution inthe country situation, would support the Government's development
strategy, with each operation specifying a set of recommended triggers for moving with
the next operation.

97. Triggers for an eventual secondDPO can be summarized as follows:

        Restoring the Kev Functions of State Planning, Execution and Control

        Public Finance Management
            Implementation of a macroeconomic framework for 2007 satisfactory to IDA
            embodying an increase in domestic revenue and non-accumulation of wage
            arrears.

            Progress deemed satisfactory by IDA in the implementation of corrective
            measuresrecommended inthe Treasury audit.

            The public expenditure chain i s strengthened as evidenced by the following in
            fiscal year 2007: (i)  satisfactory post-audit application of the new regulatory
            framework with respect to control of cash advances in accordance with the
            principles set forth in the prior action; and (ii)   a requirement to impute all
            spending on goods and services in excess of what i s budgeted to an
            "unforeseen expenses" line-item not exceeding 10% of the total goods and
            services chapter in the budget. This "unforeseen expenses" line-item shall be
            grouped with the "common expenses" budget chapter.



                                              31

    The Treasury has incorporated within the 2007 public accounts all revenues
    retained by and advances to MDAs, as well as all other public revenue or
    expenditure items.

    Publication of a decree establishing a new budgetary and accounting
    nomenclature and mandating the use of the new nomenclature in the
    preparation of the 2008 budget.

    The Government has approved and begun implementing a customs reform
    program satisfactory to IDA that takes into account the recommendations of
    the audit of the one-stop shop.

    Taxpayers have been surveyed and registered, controls have been intensified
    to boost effective revenue collection by the Treasury, overdue taxpayers have
    been sent notifications and accounts receivable have been recorded.

    ENERCA, SODECA and SOCATEL have settled their 2007 tax bills in full
    and have initiated a census of their customer supply points. The Government
    has paid in full its public utility bills for the current year.

    The review of the public procurement system i s published on the
    Government's website and the related action plan i s approved by the Council
    of Ministers.

State PersonnelManagement

    Effective installation of a unified payroll management system for both civilian
    and military personnel, enabling on-time payment of wages and salaries on the
    basis of a secure database. The system i s networked to facilitate budgetary
    controls on employedpersonnel.

Improving Governance
Management of Natural Resources

    Adoption by the Government of an action plan for the mining sector inspired
    by the recommendations of the National Dialogue forum, the mining sector
    consultations forum, and the LICUS TF-supported assessment of the mining
    sector, the terms of reference of which will have been agreed with IDA.

    Submission to the Council of Ministers and publication on the Government's
    website of draft standard agreement templates for the mining and energy
    sectors, drafted on the basis of recommendations from the panel of
    international experts.

    Consultations have been held with, inter alia, the state departmentdentities
    concerned, sector representatives and civil society organizations resulting in
    agreement on the goals of, outcomes sought from, and work program to
   enable EITIimplementation.

                          VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION


A.      Country Ownership

98. Participatory Process. The proposed operation i s fully supported and owned by the
authorities as indicated in the Government's Letter of Development Policy. The policy
and strategy framework for this operation i s driven by national priorities for security,
state building and economic recovery, which are all reflected in the Government's ESPF
and associated TRM. The national program itself i s the result of a participatory process
with key stakeholders.    Notably, a Steering Committee composed of eight thematic
groups specializing in high priority areas (education, public health, governance, rural
development, urban development and rehabilitation, public finances and the economy,
competitiveness and sources of growth) i s in charge of leading a participatory process for
the formulation of the PRSP. Other organizational mechanisms and initiatives with
stakeholder representatives, including civil society and the private sector, as well as the
broader population, have been established by Government to guide political directions
through participation and social dialogue.      These efforts are intended to enhance
ownership and widen support for the Government's program.

99. Trust. Despite these efforts, the Government does not currently enjoy the
widespread trust of the people. The chronic nature of insecurity and its consequent
erosion of trust pose a critical danger for the safety and stability of CAR. A recent
Government report assessing the PRSP process recommends a more comprehensive and
more broadly participative approach that places the emphasis on accountability between
state and citizen for more efficient use of poverty reduction finances and resources,
promoting poor people's involvement in development as partners rather than
beneficiaries.   In parallel, the Government is developing a more comprehensive
communication strategy with assistance from the UNSRSG and a few bilateral donors.
The Government intends to widen this process to further indicate its openness to criticism
and to generate a higher level of trust from the population. Nation-building remains a
critical challenge, which will be supported to the extent possible by the international
community.



B.      FiduciaryAssessment

100. Country Systems. Despite growing donor support in the last three years, PFM
standards in CAR remain weak and country systems are not yet reliable. Public finance
management has been weakened by conflict and instability. Budget implementation and
cashmanagement needto be enhanced, an objective which i s at the core of this operation.

101. Technical Assistance.      The EU carried out an audit of the public finance
management system in 2002-03. This helped coordinate early engagement of the
European Union, the French Cooperation, the World Bank and other donors.              The
IMF/FAD has further assessed CAR PFM in 2004, recommending a shift to long term
technical assistance to the MoF. In line with this series of recommendations, a first


                                            33

LICUS Grant launched reforms in 2005 in the area of corruption deterrence, public
revenue collection and expenditure management. A second LICUS Grant, approved in
October 2006, will provide nearly US$2.8 million in technical assistance to enhance
governance and economic management systems in core budgeting, expenditure control
and payroll management functions of the state. Finally, a Country Procurement Issues
Paper (CPIP), completed in April 2006, concluded that the national public procurement
system i s in need of an overhaul and proposed an action plan, of which the initial phase
will be supported by the same LICUS Grant.                 Durable gains in transparency,
accountability and effectiveness of the Government's financial management systems will
likely require sustained engagement of the donor community in support of the
Government's reform process.

102. CFAA. In parallel with the recent increase inthe volume of technical assistance to
strengthen public finance, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment, jointly
conducted with France and the EU, i s scheduled for completion by end-2006. The CFAA
will help assess fiduciary risks associated with budget support and deepen the dialogue
between donors and the Government on PFM issues. In particular, the CFAA will: (i)
develop a joint donor-Government understanding of the main strengths and weaknesses
of the PFM system; (ii)  identify a limited set of prioritizedrecommendations based on the
capacity and willingness of the Government to implement those measures; and (iii)
support the CAR Government in defining a more realistic reform implementation agenda,
inline with nationalcapacities.

103. Reforms.    The Government has indicated in its LDP its intention to undertake a
reform program that will strengthen public finances and governance and encourage
economic recovery and macroeconomic stability. Over 2006, the Government has had
the discipline to contain domestic arrears, and has paid salaries on time.        A new
nomenclature for budgetary and accounting systems will soon be adopted and the
Government has agreed to open its Treasury Committee to external advisers. Through
this program, controls on cash advances and public accounting of all government's
sources of revenue and expenditures will be greatly improved. Beyondthese initial steps,
potential follow-up DPOs together with HIPC triggers will require even tighter
expenditure tracking systems on the part of the Government.

104. Governance. The World Bank's 2004 Governance Indicators rank the Central
African Republic only in the last third percentile of countries in its efforts to control
corruption.    Continuous instability and the chronic non-payment of salaries have
exacerbated corrupt practices. However, the Government i s committed to fighting
corruption and money laundering, both by investigating corruption cases and establishing
policies and procedures to prevent corruption. It i s also committed to developing a
national anti-corruption strategy, with the assistance of development partners. Over time,
accountability at all levels of Government and transparency in financial operations of the
state will become more prevalent. This operation's main outcome should be to have
helped the Government move a few more steps toward that goal.

C.      Grant Administration, Disbursementand Auditing

105. Grant Amount and Tranching. The recipient i s the Central African Republic,
represented by the Ministry of Finance. The Grant i s for an amount equivalent to US$82
million, on standard IDA terms to be released in one tranche following approval of the
RIBSUP Grant and notification by the Association of Effectiveness of the Financing
Agreement.

106. DisbursementMechanism. The Government will request disbursements under the
Grant so that: (i)about US$62.4 million of the tranche will be disbursed by IDA to repay
directly the obligations of the CAR to the institution that had extended a bridge loan to
CAR in order to clear arrears to IDA; and (ii)  the balance of the Grant (about US$19.6
million) would be paid into dedicated deposit accounts in the name of CAR at BEAC.
Disbursements by the Government will comply with the prohibition to finance
expenditures listed in the negative list of the Financing Agreement (Schedule 1).
Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases and no procurement requirements
will be needed. In case any portion of the proceeds of the Grant i s used for ineligible
purposes as set forth in the Financing Agreement, IDA would require the borrower to
refund the amount to IDA. Transactions and balances of each Deposit Account will be
fully incorporated into the Government's accounting records and financial statements.

107. Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing. The Financing Agreement will give IDA
the right to require the Recipient to audit the deposit accounts in the name of CAR at
BEAC, that are dedicated to this operation. Pursuant to this provision and considering
the prevailing financial management situation in CAR, immediately following closure of
one of the Deposit Accounts, IDA intends to request the Borrower to have the said
Deposit Account audited by auditors acceptable to IDA, with terms of reference equally
acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will send a copy of the audit report to IDA no later
than 4 months following the date of IDA'Srequest for such an audit. In addition, IDA
may also request audits of any of the Deposit Accounts prior to their closure in
accordance with the Financing Agreement.

108. Implementation, Monitoring and Supervision. During the preparation of the
RIBSUP Grant, IDA has assisted the Government to help ensure timely implementation
of the agreed measures. The IDA resident adviser for M&E will help identify ministries
responsible for monitoring progress and develop a plan to monitor indicators. To assess
the impact of the proposed operation, IDA will monitor progress in achieving the triggers
in the LDP. Progress with the Government's TRM will help benchmark overall
development progress in the country and needs for further adjustment in development
strategies or donor coordination.

109. ClosingDate. The expected closing date of the RIBSUP Grant will be November
30,2007.




                                           35

D.      Environmental Aspects

110. Mining. The proposed RIBSUP Grant supports a number of economy-wide policies
and institutions. The reforms supported by the proposed Grant will not have significant
effects on the country's environment and natural resources; indeed the policy reforms
being proposed are likely to have a positive impact on the environment through increased
transparency and improved governance inextractive industries and forestry. A trigger for
a possible second DPO i s the preparation of a mining strategy based, inter alia, on the
findings of the institutional assessment of the sector to be financed by the World Bank.
This assessment will include an analysis of the environmental impacts associated with
extractive industries in CAR, and will propose regulatory reforms and institutional
measures to better control these impacts. Visible progress on these measures will matter
inpossible subsequent operations.

111. Forestry. In the forestry sector, a key milestone for the program is the launch of
invitations to tender for forest harvesting and management plans (FHMPs). This measure
forms part of the broader program of the forestry sector reforms being supported by FDA.
As part of this program, the Ministry of Water, Forests, Wildlife and Fisheries has
determined that before any such invitations are issued, forest management policies will
be revised to promote reforestation initiatives and protect ecologically fragile zones.



E.      Poverty and Social Impact

112. This Grant i s expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction by improving
the efficacy of public finances and the capacity of the state to implement its budgetary
priorities through enhanced revenue collection and strengthened controls on expenditure
management. Consequently, resources for priority spending ministries, including health
and education, are expected to increase. Similarly, by ensuring timely payment of civil
servants, who usually support their extended families, and by improving the financial
viability of utility companies, this Grant should have a positive social impact in Bangui,
where 70 percent of the urban poor live. The regular payment and proper equipment of
civil servants and security sector personnel, which the Grant would enable through its
impact on public finances, i s likely to have a positive impact even on the population
livingin less central parts of the country.



F.      Monitoring and Evaluation

113. Capacity for M&Eremains extremely limited, but technical assistance i s being put
in place to help overcome this gap over the coming year. The Government recognizes
M&E to be an essential component of policy implementation and the success of their
program. At the Government's request, IDA i s financing a resident adviser who i s
assisting the authorities in developing an M&E management and reporting system. A
DPO M&E action plan will be prepared in collaboration with the resident adviser, the




                                             36

Technical Committee for Structural Adjustment Programs (CTP-PAS) and the PRSP
Steering Committee, as indicated inthe Government's LDP.

114. In parallel, collaborative monitoring has been progressing among donors, with the
Government's support. The EU and ADB are now organizing joint missions to Bangui
with the World Bank, generally coordinated around the reviews of the IMF programs.
Program objectives, like improving basic public finance and governance to enhance the
business environment, are fully shared by other partners. The ADB, co-author of the
upcoming Joint Interim Strategy FY07/08 with IDA, i s considering providing budget
support in early 2007 on the basis of the same policy matrix that i s presented in this
program document.

115. Given the volatility and fragility of the security and political environment in CAR,
one quick visible result for this operation would be to support the stabilization of the
country through reengagement of the international donor community.             This first
Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program Grant therefore i s not designed
to meet an extensive set of measurable outcomes, but targets only a few important
indicators, which can be achieved realistically, within a year.



G.      Benefits

116. Normalization offinancial relationships. The first benefit would be the resolution
of the IDA debt arrears. Without the foreign exchange cash flow provided by the
proposed operation, the CAR would not be able to clear its arrears to IDA, in which case
normal access to IDA financial support would not be restored.

117. Strengthening the administration.          The RIBSUP Grant would support the
rehabilitation of some of the State's core functions in policy planning and public finance
management, including expenditure control and accounting, revenue mobilization,
procurement and personnel management.           It would support the implementation of
reforms leading to a stronger institutional capacity in Government and a more efficient
allocation of fiscal resources, including for the poor. B y raising fiduciary standards it
would reduce the implementationrisk of all projects, including this operation.

118. Governance reforms. Another benefit would be to support policies that would help
improve governance and transparency in key economic sectors, particularly for the
management of natural resources. The Grant would provide resources to the Government
to deepen its reform program in areas that would improve the investment climate and
renew interest inthe CAR from foreign companies.

119. Signal to other donors. IDA'S support to the Government in the form of the
RIBSUP would be seen as a catalyst for other donors and accelerate their support. It
would likely translate into higher levels of donor assistance to the budget beyond IDA.
The Grant would also support the harmonization of donor assistance by the Government
to improve overall aideffectiveness.




                                            37

120. Security and trust. This RIBSUP Grant would contribute to mitigating the risk of
further deterioration of the political and security situations. It would free up space in the
budget for more regular payment of State personnel salaries, including in the security
sector, and would enhance the overall effectiveness of the civil and military
administration. It would contribute to lowering the level of individual corruption or
predatory behaviors by enforcement agencies. The situation inCAR remains fragile, and
continued progress hinges on sustained support from the internationalcommunity.



H.      Risks and Risk Mitigation

121. The RIBSUP Grant has significant country (security, political and macroeconomic)
and fiduciary risks.

122. Security risk. As inmany conflict-affected countries, a deterioration of the security
situation constitutes the largest source of risk for the operation. Continuing security
incidents are a manifestation of such risks. In particular, a deterioration of the regional
situation, whether in Sudan (Darfur) or in Chad, would leave CAR at risk. Chadian
rebels, allied to armed CAR elements, have already declared their intention to take
Bangui by force. The capacity of the international community to provide peacekeeping
forces at the Sudanese borders, both with Chad and CAR, will be one determinant of the
extent of risk that persists.  Post-election uncertainties in DRC, may also have some
impact on CAR. The Equator province, separated from Bangui by the Oubangui River,
has been the geographical base of violent armed rebels in the past. If the democratic
process in DRC i s not sufficiently inclusive of political forces across a wide spectrum,
resentment in the North of the country could easily threaten stability in CAR, which i s
significantly less populated. These country risks are exogenous and their mitigation falls
largely outside the scope of this operation.        However, the Grant would allow the
Government to extend basic service delivery outside of Bangui, contribute to nation-
buildingefforts andcould help mitigate domestic security risks.

123. Politicalrisk. While the recent Government's track recordhas lowered uncertainty
regarding the "whole of Government" commitment, significant vested interests remain
that may handicap some aspects of the proposed program. A reversal in the political
stabilization process and weakened ownership indeed constitute serious risks for the
operation. To mitigate these risks, the proposed prior actions and triggers focus on areas
in which the Government has expressed ownership and has demonstrated goodwill for
reforms. These risks would increase, however, if the population fails to see direct
benefits from the reengagement of the international community and withdraws its
political support. Understanding stakeholders' expectations matters in a post-conflict
setting such as CAR. The operation's emphasis on participatory consultations i s essential
to mitigate this specific risk. Some trade unions and opposition forces have questioned
the rationale behindthe programs of the multilateral development banks, particularly with
regard to public service freezes in wages and hiring. Vested interests in natural resource
management can also hurt the outcome of the program. Winning all these stakeholders
over would contribute to sustaining reforms inthe country over time.



                                             38

124. Macroeconomic risk. The country's macroeconomic performance represents
another important risk. The success of the program will depend critically on CAR'S
adherence to a medium-term macroeconomic framework elaboratedjointly with the Fund
and the Bank. Endogenous risks, such as fiscal slippages, could weaken the operation.
Solid macroeconomic management will be needed to provide the foundation for sustained
economic growth. Moreover, the pace of program implementation in CAR, coupled with
a potential deterioration of the external environment, will need to be monitored carefully.
Macroeconomic risks can be mitigated through a combination of fiscal prudence coupled
with the inflows of foreign capital. Close economic monitoring and policy advice by the
Bank and the Fund could help guide the authorities on optimal macroeconomic
management in the face of weak revenue mobilization, slow export growth or terms of
trade shocks. The particular macroeconomic risk of CAR falling back into arrears has
been addressedin the design of this operation through foreign exchange access from the
moment arrears have been cleared.          Full debt service payment to IDA could be
compromised if the country does not reach its HIPC Decision point by end-September
2007 and if aidflows remain insufficient at that time. To mitigate this risk, the Bank and
the Fundmust provide continuing leadership to ensure coordination and synchronization
of broader support from donors.

125. Fiduciary risk. As indicated inthe above section on fiduciary assessment, financial
controls in CAR are weak and the operation's fiduciary risk i s significant. However, this
risk can be mitigated. Improvement in fiduciary standards is a central objective of the
program and continued IDA assistance in the areas of public finance management and
public administration will help raise these standards and improve budget implementation
processes over time. The negotiation of a CFAA action plan with the Government will
consolidate gains made under this operation. Furthermore, a significant share of the
resources will be used to repay the provider of the bridge loan used to clear CAR'S
arrears to IDA under IDA'Sstandard procedures for such transactions. With respect to
the share going to the budget, the presence of an adviser financed by the Bank at the
Treasury Committee i s expected to further mitigate the remaining risks that these
resources are improperly used. These resources will also be subject to the Bank's
standard auditing procedures requirements, including verifying that they were not used
for items on the negative list. Finally, since this program i s designed as a series of
possible operations (subject to financing availability) that are based on prior actions and
subsequent triggers, IDA can adjust subsequent operations to the pace of reform
implementationand a satisfactory use of previous Grants by the Government.

Mr.President,
         1.     Ihave the pleasure of submitting to you the Development Policy
Document of the Government of the Central African Republic insupport of its request for
a Grant of approximately US$82 million from your institution.
        2.      The CAR i s inneed of emergency support to launch the implementation of
its economic and social program within an ever-challenging context. Economic recovery
i s slow, particularly in comparison with other countries in post-conflict situations. The
financial situation i s as constraining as can be: the taxable base has weakened with the
disappearance of numerous enterprises in the formal sector, thereby limiting the
opportunities for domestic resource mobilization. To date, the mobilization of external
resources has been hampered by the issue of the settlement of our arrears, in particular
vis-a-vis the development banks, among these, the World Bank. Resource mobilization
i s very low in comparison with the support received by other countries in post-conflict
situations. Under these conditions, the State i s not in a position to ensure the satisfactory
functioning of its public services, in particular its social services, nor to provide for the
country's vital reconstruction needs. Furthermore, without a marked progress in the
economic and social situation, the reinforcement of security, the consolidation of peace
and the achievements of the democratic transition are threatened.
        3.      The Grant requested by us, in the form of an initial support towards the
program for the reengagement and reinforcement of State institutions, must contribute
towards .a simultaneous progression on two points : on the one hand, international aid




                                             41

mobilization, and on the other, institutional capacity-building for the successful
implementationof the Government's economic and social policy.
          4.     As regards international aid mobilization, the resources made available by
your institution would provide funds necessary to support CAR cash flow needs in the
period immediately after arrears to IDA have been paid. The proposed Grant would also
support budget expenditures. This operation will thus enable us to settle our arrears vis-
&-vis your institution, thereby removing an obstacle not only to your financial support,
but also to the re-establishment of normal relations with the entire international
community, according to the following : the settlement of our arrears vis-&vis other
international institutions i s on track ;the preparation of a triennial program supported by
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) presents itself under favorable
auspices due to the satisfactory realization of two post-conflict programs proven by the
I M F ' s review mission andthe commencement of technical discussions within this scope ;
the attainment of the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Decision point, forecasted
for mid-2007, will enable us to again ensure that debt i s serviced.
           5.    As regards the reinforcement of our institutions, the structural measures
supported by your Grant will focus on the improvement of key aspects of governance, in
particular the management of public and natural resources, in order to put these resources
to the best use, as regards to the reconstruction of the country. These measures will
complement the progress already attained owing, inparticular, to the World Bank support
through the implementation of the LICUS 1. This will further be facilitated by the
critical mass of technical assistance to the economic and financial management
institutions provided by the World Bank through the LICUS 2, as well as by the ADB,
the European Union and France.
          6.     These measuresform an integral part of our economic and social program,
of which they constitute the foundation. The Grant will be disbursed once your institution
i s satisfied, on the basis of objective documentation, that we have effectively executed
the first set of prior actions conveying our determination and our commitment to tackle
the serious problems that are undermining our country. And this i s only one part of it.
The economic and social program submitted by the Government for consideration by
your institution i s a prelude to the overall program for the reconstruction of the country,
which will be further developed in a poverty reduction strategy paper, together with
technical support from the World Bank and from the UNDP, the attainment of which will
facilitate the extensive mobilization of the international community.
          7.     We express our sincere wish that the consideration of this document will
meet with a favorable response from the World Bank Group.


          Yours sincerely

      LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY OFTHEGOVERNMENT OFTHE

                             CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

                                      FOR 2006-2007



Introduction
8.      The Government's reference document i s the Economic and Social Policy
Framework Paper (DCPES) which expresses the willingness of the Central African
Government to carry out reforms essential to bringing the country back onto the path of
development.     This eighteen month program will then be expanded in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper compiled in a participatory manner by incorporating the entire
national population and domestic and foreign partners.
9.      The DCPES i s centered around four principal axes : (i) reinforcement of
                                                                      The
security and the consolidation of peace; (ii)   The reinforcement of good governance and
institutional capacities for improvedpublic finance management, inparticular an efficient
execution of public expenditure aimed at poverty reduction;            (iii)Macroeconomic
stabilization through the correct management of a suitable macro-budgetary framework,
the diversification and growth of production and (iv) The improvement in access to social
services and the reconstruction of the basic infrastructure to improve the quality and
accessibility to education services, as well as to health care in view of reducing infant and
maternal mortality and to fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
10.     The initial budgetary support to the State's reconstruction program focuses on the
improvement in public resource management such as natural resources, as well as other
aspects of governance. As such, it contributes to the improvement in governance (axis ii)
and also prepares for diversification and growth in production (axis iii)through its
provisions linked to securing investors and to the miningand forestry sectors.
11.     As regards the domains retained, the foundations must be dispensed with and the
State must be reinforced in its capacity to carry the country's reconstruction through to a
successful conclusion, whilst restoring confidence. Inorder to send out a strong message,
this restoration rests on the immediate adoption of a set of measures prior to the
disbursement of the Grant, in one single installment.
12.     The DCPES, in other words the transitory strategic framework, was adopted by
November 4,2006. It i s the road map of the Government, whose action will be guidedby
the outcomes to be achieved as grouped inthe associated TRM in order of priority for the
four axes retained.
13.     Insofar as public finances are concerned, the prior actions guarantee both the
adoption of a credible Budget for 2007 and the proper execution thereof. The credibility
of the Budget i s based on a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, including realistic
hypotheses and objectives, taking proper account of constraints, the measures envisaged
and the financing that can be mobilized. Its proper execution i s based primarily on



                                             43

improvement in expenditure management procedures.              Other aspects of public
management and governance are equally affected by the preliminary measures, including
the audit of the Treasury accounts and the issue and justification of loan accounts by
beneficiaries.

MACROECONOMIC        AND BUDGETARYFRAMEWORK

14.     The hypotheses underlying the draft 2007 appropriation bill rely on the 2007
economic prospects and the achievements midway through the execution of the 2006
budget.
15.     In2007, the economic progress will depend on the consolidation of socio-political
stability with the progressive return to domestic security, on the reinforcement in the
confidence of economic operators, on the continued recovery of raw material prices, on
the stabilization of the oil price, on the pursuit of reforms committed to by the
Government with the support of development partners and the reengagement of the
InternationalFinancial Institutions following the successful settlement of external arrears.
16.     Within this context, the GDP at market prices is estimated to be FCFA 815,6
billion in 2007 compared with FCFA 767,2 billion in 2006, representing a 3,3% increase
in the real GDP in 2007 compared with 3,1% in 2006. This growth level would be
obtained due to: i)support to the cotton production sector through the creation of the new
cotton company and financed by the French Development Agency, ii)improvement in
the productivity of forestry companies through the re-allocationof former permits and the
intensification of the activities of SCAD, SEFCA and SCAF iii),the effective
exploitation by companies such as DE BEERS and AURAFRIQUE, iv), the resumption
of the large road construction projects (Bouar Gara-MhoulaY, the rehabilitation of Bangui
streets), v) the continuation of the extension of telephonic coverage within the country,
and vi) the continuation of public finance reforms.
17.     The level of fiscal burden i s estimated at 9,1% of GDP in 2007 compared with
9,0% in 2006 in conjunction with an estimated inflation rate of 2,7%, compared with
3,6% in 2006, which i s lower than the CEMAC benchmark. The expected level of
investment in 2007 would be 11,6% compared with 10,9% in 2006 attributable to the
resumptionof activities inthe productive sectors such as the mines.
18.     On the revenue front, the tax revenue forecasts for 2007 are based on an upward
revision of 2006 levels. The revenues recorded for 2006 are supported by the tendencies
of the 2005 collective and the 2006 appropriation bill coupled with spontaneous
developments and the implementation of a series of structural and administrative
measures. These have led to a forecast of the level of domestic budgetary resources of
FCAF 75,388 billion. The projected external financing mustbe added to this envelope.
19.     The structural measures apply to government departments. As regards Internal
Revenue, the efforts noted in 2006 must be consolidated and improved upon through the
following actions ; i)the optimization of tax audits, ii)an increase in audits, iii)the
revitalization of companies, iv) monitoring of invoicing, v) increased monitoring of the
effective utilization of cash register machines and the pursuit of prompt VAT audits, vi)
the reinforcement of the collection of the business tax (patente) through a One-Stop
Shop (single window) mechanism, and vii) expanding the tax base inthe property sector.


                                            44

20.     The effects of the economic events indicatedinparagraph 14 above may be added
to the impact of these measures on the taxable base: i)the creation of the new cotton
company with the participation of DAGRIS, ii)the effective production by the companies
DE BEERS, URAMINE-CAR and AURARIQUE, iii)the impact of regular payment of
salaries on consumption, and iv) the resumption of the activities of SCAD.
21.     At the Customs level, the improvements focus on :i)strengthening the capacities
of the One-Stop Shop in its role of providing better security with respect to transit
between Douala and Bangui, ii)the reinforcement of teams along the borders to monitor
the passage of goods to the interior of the country, iii)taking charge of the container
terminal, iv) better and effective mastery of the Sydonia customs computerized
information system, v) the effective resumption of river traffic, vi) the continuation of
reforms, and vii) revision of petroleum taxation tending to neutralize the negative effect
of the specific taxhubsidy regime (TUPP) on government revenue.
22.     At Treasury level, the Collections and Prosecution Department will consolidate
existing achievements, through; i)the continuation of reforms initiated for improvement
in the quality of its services, ii)the continuation and deepening of revenue data
reconciliation, iii)the mobilization of and recording for all budgetary revenue, iv) the
mobilization of counterpart funds from Japanese grants for financing expenditure in the
Health, Education and Agricultural sectors.
23.     The contribution of external resources to the investments has decreased from
CFAF 33,9 billion in the initial 2006 appropriation bill to CFAF 21.8 billion in 2007,
consisting exclusively of grants. This important decline in external financing may be
explained by the end of several projects financed by loans in the following sectors:
Energy and Hydraulics, Sanitation, Housing and Urban Planning, Transportation and
Communication; and by the deferral of certain projects financed by the European Union
and the French Development Agency (improvement and surfacing of the Bouar-Baoro or
the Bouar-Garoua-Boulai' road).
24.     The State has partially stabilized expenditure over a period of two consecutive
years.   Thus, with a constant structure, expenditure has established itself at FCFA
131,766 billion in 2007, compared with FCFA 129,345 billion in the initial 2006
appropriation bill, representing an increase of 1,87% due to minor resumption of current
expenditure requiredfor administrative operations.
Restorationand maintenanceof external solvency
25.     The CAR should benefit from debt relief of up to 90% in the servicing of its
multilateral debt at the Point of Decision of the HIPC Initiative, towards mid-May 2007.
This will enable the Government to ensure regular servicing of this debt and to receive
new aid at concessional rates from the development banks. The methods of settling the
arrears take into account debt service up until the Point of Decision. Also, up until this
date, we have asked our official lenders to commit to maintaining net positive transfers in
order to ensure equitable treatment among creditors as well as the financial viability of
the program.
26.     The UNDP, the European Union, France and most of the financial backers
participate in the form of grants. The comparison between the total grants received by



                                            45

the CAR inproportion to the GDP and other post-conflict countries, i s unfavorable to our
country. Once the HIPC Decision point has been reached, the Government's program
must basically mobilize this support in the form of far more substantial grants and
concessional loans in order to attain significant positive net transfers ,to protect the debt
profile and to regularly service the debt.

Prior actions

27.     EXPENDITURE    MANAGEMENT. The prior actions primarily address the problems
encountered in the management of the treasury and the expenditure channels. They aim
towards improved expenditure control, better transparency and increased stringency in
the management of funds. Transparency i s ensured through the presence of technical
consultants financed by the development partners who participate in the treasury
committee meetings, through an audit of the accounts and the adequate functioning of the
Public Treasury for the year 2006 which will be undertaken prior to the end of March
2007 by an independent auditor appointed by the Revenue Court, as well as by the
publication of a report on the use of funds and cash advances. Stringency i s imposed in
the management of cash advances by compelling beneficiaries to justify, and if need be,
to regulate the use of these public resources.         All non-reimbursed advances will
henceforth be deducted directly from salaries.          Furthermore, a ministerial order
integrates, within the general State accounting function, all revenue and expenditure
regardless of their type or their management methods and procedures.
28.     REVENUE MANAGEMENT.           Restructuring of the entire customs department i s in
progress together with the support of international donors. In this context, an audit will
enable the first evaluation of the Douala One-Stop Shop to be carried out since its
establishment, as well as an examination of the prospects for its extension to other
corridors.
29.     MANAGEMENT OF STATE PERSONNEL. Two significant phases during 2005/06 in
respect of the reform in progress were the merging of the payroll database with the
administrative database, as well as the deletion of the database for all ghost workers
identified. This generated significant savings insofar as the wage bill i s concerned. We
are pursuing these efforts through the verification of diplomas, as well as through a
census of retirees.
30.     IMPROVEMENT INGOVERNANCE. The prior actions in this area aim to remove the
principal obstacles to investor interest, as well as to ensure the correct management of
natural resources. Investors will benefit from the measures taken to reduce corruption,
notably the creation of a financial pole of Justice and the removal of public interference
lacking legal foundation in the award of telecommunications licenses.            As regards
mineral resources, the Government will ensure transparency through the examination of
all draft agreements by a panel of experts; through the publication on the Government's
website of a summary of all mining agreements and detailed information concerning the
allocation of miningbonuses to State accounts as well as their use, both for existing and
future agreements. We express our desire to join the ElTIprocess (Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative) and in this regard, request support and technical assistance from
the World Bank. Lastly, forestry resources will be protected through the prohibition of



                                             46

special harvesting permits; in the context of the efforts that we are deploying to ensure
the sustainable management of our forests.

Futureactions

31.     Here, we are concerned with building a platform for the reconstruction of the
country, in other words an economic governance quality and a financial transparency
which guarantee: (i)  the correct use of public funds, (ii) complete mobilization of the
                                                           the
international community, (iii)the successful and comprehensive execution of the
economic and social program, and (iv) the return of investors, firstly in the mining and
forestry sectors and thereafter in other sectors together with re-established confidence.
32.     The Government devotes itself firstly to re-establishing the principle functions of
State planning, execution and control which will be restored. From 2007, the PRSP will
be finalized and the sectoral strategies will be adopted and published concerning: (i)
reform of the security sector, (ii) of the legal system in order to reinforce the rule
                                    reform
of law, (iii)the Government's anti-comption action plan, as well as (iv) the medium-
term development of the rural sector. The co-ordination and harmonizationof the actions
of development partners around the principle priorities of the Government, for their
complete and efficient mobilization, will thus be achieved.
33.     We intend to accomplish significant advances as regards the macroeconomic and
budgetary framework, as well as in respect of the key aspects of public management: as
well as good governance associatedwith the securization of public resources, of investors
and of natural resources.
34.     As regards the macroeconomic and budgetary framework, the expected outcomes
are: maintenance of good economic and budgetary performance, a significant increase in
tax revenue which i s indispensable to the increase in development and poverty reduction
expenditure, the translation of the PRSP into investment programs which are compatible
with the priorities, as well as the preparation of the 2008 Budget based on reliable socio-
economic data. Furthermore, we intend to avoid the accumulation of new domestic
arrears and to reduce the existing stock - here it concerns a measure essentially to assist
in the restoration of the confidence in the economic and social partners of the
Government.
35.    As regards the key aspects of public management which will be reformed, the
Government will ensure efficient fund management (treasury and expenditure channels);
comprehensive public accounting through the recording of accounting data pertaining of
all operations and the adoption of a new unified budgetary and accounting nomenclature;
the mobilization of revenue through the re-organization of customs, the census and
registrationof taxpayers, the strengthening of collection actions; it will ensure the correct
management of public enterprise through the reorganization of the financial relations
between the State on the one hand, and ENERCA, SOCECA and SOCATEL on the other
hand, whilst ensuring improved revenue collection and a drastic reduction in fraud; the
public contracting will be improved through an investigation of the system and through
the adoption of an action plan; the efficient management of State personnel through the
implementation of a new management system and the development of a general
organizational framework for the reform of the civil service.


                                             47

36.    The fight against corruption will be intensified through significant actions: (i) the
requirement for all politicians and high-ranking civil servants to declare their assets on an
annual basis ,(ii)the establishment of a National Financial Investigation Agency and the
launch of its activities, (iii)
                              visible increase in the number of known cases of corruption
investigated and inthe number of penalties imposed.
37.    Investors' rights will be better guaranteed following the adoption of a new law on
telecommunications, reflecting the consensus between the Government and private
operators, and the revision of the Investment Code, ensuring its compatibility with
CEMAC's Common Charter.
38.    An action plan in the mining sector based on the recommendations of the Assises
du DialogueNational,of the national workshop General States of the mining sector and
of the sectoral audit financed by the LICUS Grant, the TORof which will be established
by mutual agreement between the Government and the IDA. Similarly, the Court of
Accounts will conduct an audit in respect of the bonuses and social capital transfers
obtained from all mining agreements signed since 2004, as well as their use. In the
future, best practices will be introduced as regards standard draft agreements for the
mining and energy sectors which will be published on the Government's website. The
CAR resolutely commits to the launch of the EITIprocess in the phase mentioned above.
Finally, as regards the forests, the call for tenders for the award of exploitation and
development plans will be launched.
EXPECTED    OUTCOMES
39.    The expected outcomes of this program, which we intend to pursue over the
medium term, are firstly an improved co-ordination and harmonization of the actions of
development partners around the key priorities of the Government as described in the
DCPES and in the PRSP under finalization. We also envisage a strong improvement in
public finance management in all areas, not only on a budgetary accounting level, but
also concerning accountability.     We attach particular importance to improvement in
respect of payroll management and in the preparation of a fundamental reform of the civil
service which, in our opinion, i s a vital element of our economic and social reform
program.    At the level of governance, we expect an improvement in the business
environment, which ought to manifest itself through an increase in both domestic and
foreign private investment, particularly in the mining sector, which could become a true
development pole in the future.       Finally, as regards public resource management -
financial as well as natural - we intend to achieve strong improvement in governance in
general and in transparency, particularly insofar as taxation i s concerned. Inthis context,
we expect to derive extensive benefit from our participation inthe EITIprocess.
40.    The program will be executed by existing structures, which have demonstrated
their management capacity in particular concerning the two EPCA programs supported
by the IMF. These are the CTPPAS and the PRSP Committee. These are overseeing by
an inter-ministerial Steering Committee composed of the Ministers implicated inprogram
execution, inparticular the Ministers of Mines, Forestry, Equipment, Rural Development,
Transport, Justice, Civil Service, Finance and Budget, as well the Minister of Economics,
Plan and International Cooperation, who i s its President.         The Steering Committee
defines the strategic orientations and work planning for the two technical sub-committees



                                             48

which are responsible for periodic execution reports.        These reports are sent after
validation to the donor community, including the World Bank.

CONCLUSION

41.     This program will be executed by the existing structures which have proven
themselves in the management of previous programs, in particular the two post-conflict
programs supported by the IMF. These are the CTP-PAS and the PRSP committee.
42.     The Government of the Central African Republic i s seizing this opportunity to
reiterate its commitment to the efficient execution of the program described inthe present
Development Policy Document for the next 18 months. It i s convinced that the efficient
and satisfactory execution of this program will contribute towards boosting the national
economy onto a healthy and sustainable basis in view of poverty reduction. In view of
the macroeconomic reforms already carried out and in the light of the fixed objectives in
this program and the results achieved during the two post-conflict programs which are
very encouraging, the Government of the Central African Republic requests the favorable
consideration of its financing request of 27 October 2006 aimed at the approval of a
Grant of approximately US$82 million for a sustainable settlement of our arrears vis-&-
vis your institution and the provision of significant budgetary support for financing our
economy. We further hope to promptly receive additional financing leading to: (i)      the
HIV/AIDS project whose activation should be announced upon the normalization of our
relations with your institution; and (ii) new projects to be financed out of the balance of
the US$lOO million allocated to us within the scope of the IDA 14. Finally, we sincerely
hope to be admitted to the reinforced HIPC Initiative as soon as possible given that our
external debt i s unsustainable, currently exceeding 500% of our exports.

        Dear Mr. Nankani,

        In recent years there has been a gradual but steadyreengagementof the IMF with the Central
        Afi.ican Republic (C.A.R.). The Executive Board approved a first Emergency Post-Conflict
        Assistance (EPCA) program in July 2004 with a disbursementequivalent to 10percent of
        quota and a second in January 2006 with a disbursement equivalent to 12.5percent of quota.
        The EPCA disbursements were designed to supportthe authorities' early effortsto reform the
        economy after the civil war ended and to act as a catalyst for wider donor support. To a large
        extent those objectives have been achieved. Also, the Fund has helped buiid institutionaland
        administrativecapacity through assistancein public fmancial managemeni and statistics.

        Performanceunder the recent EPCA program has been generally satisfactory, taking account
        of the difficult external environment. Overall, the main objectives of the authorities' program
        for this year should be achieved,with a moderate increase in economic growth, an improved
        fiscalposition, and some progress in structuralpolicies.Regarding the fiscal accounts, tax
        revenue is strong and should reach its highest level in a number of years (althoughthe tax
        revenue ratio remains among the lowest in developing countries).On the expenditureside,
        however, there has been some slippagewith respect to the EPCA supportedprogram. This
        slippageis related to unanticipated expendituresto address internal security needs, increased
        petroleum-relatedsubsidies designed to offset higher world oil prices, and support to the
        cotton sector. The wage bill will be slightlyabovebudget at year's end but this is due to
        additionaloutlays tied to a French grant to supportearly retirements, and to salarypayments
        to 720 civil servants (including militarypersonnel)who had been inadvertently lefi off the
        payroll census earlier this year. All of the structuralpolicy measures under the EPCA have
        been implemented, although some with a delay. Thesemeasures have been directed to
        enhancing governance and improving the ability of the legal system to address financial and
        commercial crime.

        Earlier this month the staff reached understandings,ad referendum, with the authoritieson a
        three-year program that could be supportedunder the Poverty Reduction ahd GrowthFacility
        (PRGF). This program aims to achievethe followinggoals: real GDP growth of 4-5 percent

        per annum to allow for modest progress toward reaching the MillenniumDevelopment
        Goals; further fiscal consolidationto graduallyeliminatethe overhangof domestic debt and
        open room to support growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing socialpolicies; increase credit
        to the private sector; and make external debt sustainableby regularizingrelations with
        external creditors and benefiting fromdebt relief from the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
        Countries and MultilateralDebt Relief Initiatives.

        A majorrisk to the program is possible delays andlor lower volumes of foreign aid. Over the
        medium term, substantiallyhigher aid inflowswould be needed for high growth and poverty
        reduction. Also, the smooth implementationof the program will depend on technical
        assistance to build administrativeand institutional capacity, and efforts should be coordinated
        in this area.

        Proposed access under the PRGF arrangementis set at SDR 36.22million, equivalent to
        65 percent of quota.

        Executive Board considerationof the authorities' request for a three-year PRGF arrangement
        is conditionalupon (i) clearingexternal arrears to multilateral creditors, or at least having in
        place sufficient financing assurances for 2007, and (ii) the authoritiesobservinga prior action
        which entailsthe issuance of an international tender to undertake an audit for the validation
        of domestic payments arrears that accrued during the period 1998-2004.The Paris Club has
        indicated its intention of providing financing assurancesto the C.A.R. under the Fund-
        supportedprogram, It is anticipated that other bilateral and commercialcreditors will
        reschedule the C.A.R.'s debt to them on terms at least as favorable as those expectedfrom
        the Paris Club.

        A Board discussion to considerthe authorities' request is tentatively scheduled for December
        22,2006 7'
