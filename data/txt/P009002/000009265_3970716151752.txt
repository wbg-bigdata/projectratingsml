CUKUROVA REGION URBAN ENGINEERING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:    Republic of Turkey
Amount:       USt9.2 million
Terms;        Seventeea years including four years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project       The proposed engineering loan would assist the Government in
Description:  completing preparation for a Cukurova Region urban
development project which involves formulation of an
integrated approach to regional and urban development in the
Cukurova Region. Technical assistance would be included
under the loan for institutional, feasibility and design
studies for selected urban investments with emphasis on
shelter, water and sewerage, training of municipal and
central governmlent staff and improvements in municipal
financial management. The loan would also provide technical
assistance to establish a Project Coordination Unit
responsible for project implementation and equipment to
advance completion of cadastral surveys in the Cukurova
RegLon.
Benefits      Ihe proposed project supports the Government's objectives in
and Risks:   the urban sector to decentralize responsibility for some
urban services, improve the management of local governments,
provide adequate infrastructure and services, and reduce the
housing shortage. The project would assist in formulating
appropriate regional and urban development policies which
would be replicable on a national basis. The main risk is
that the studies under the project may not proceed on
schedule. This risk is minimized since consultants for the
*                           main studies have been selected and the Project Coordination
Unit has been established with qualified staff. The risk
that difficulties would arise in reaching a consensus
amongst the various agencies and municipalities involved
with regard to the components for implementation in the main
project has been minimized by the creation of national and
local steering committees.

INTERNATIONAL F1ANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXEC1IfVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A CUKUROVA REGION URBAN ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$9.2 million to help fin-ance
technical assistance and equipment for a Cukurova Region Urban Engineering
Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace,
with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey:  Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled:  "Turkey:  Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector' (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission revieweu the Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) in
August/September 1984 and its findings are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 48 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1230 in
1983. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 47 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings.  Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of exLernal trade.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on che Industrial Schools Project (P-395b-TU), dated
April 18, 1985.



Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of public investment in GOP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowings. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 19708 was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and becter selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
systeia, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program.  Implementatiri
of the adjustment program was carried out under a military regime during
September 1980 - November 1983 and since then ,y an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program -- 1980-84
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 and 1984
proved to be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the
external front, slippages in the monetary program, a persistent shortfall in
Government revenues and the renewal of inflationary pressures.
8.       Real GNP expanded by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982.  In
1983, GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent, due in large part to the effects
of a bad harvest and a decline in the contribution of the foreign balance.
The growth rate rebounded in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, supported by
favorable performance in the productive sectors with agricultural value added
growing at 3.6 percent and industrial value added at 9.6 percent. Capacity
utilization rates in private industry in 1984 are estimated to have risen by
about 5 percent to an average rate of 72 percent. On the expenditure side,
the average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment has been
contained to 3.1 percent over the 1980-84 period while the growth rate of
private investment has improved systematically from -17.3 percent in 1980 to
4.8 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.4 percent in 1984. Private
consumption, which had actually fallen by 5 percent in 1980, grew at
4.9 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.0 percent in 1984. On the other hand,
helped by strict budgetary discipline, the rate of growth of public
consumption declined from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983.
Estimates for 193!t suggest a modest growth of 2.4 percent.



9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average
rate of increase in the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981
and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 che downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. This rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and comaercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983 as well as an unexpected increase in the budget deficit.
The resulting liquidity expansioa, in conjunction with a lowering of nominal
deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the expense of savings.
10.      Inflation accelerated further in the first half of 1984, although it
moderated in the second half. The average inflation for 1984 is estimated at
a little over 50 percent. The major factors that contributed to the worsening
of the inflationary situation were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agriculture product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization au- higher export market
prices. Other important inflationary factors included substantial "catch up"
increases of SEE prices and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira.  In addition, inflationary pressures steamed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues. Given the tight monetary and fiscal
programs likely to be agreed upon with the IMF as part of a new standby
agreement (para. 25), the expectations are that inflation will decline this
year.
11.      Commercial bank interest rates, which were deregulated in July 1980,
have increased substantially and are now positive in real terms. As a result,
total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981
this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 103 percent and time
deposits by 274 percent. Growth in total deposits slowed after 1982, and in
1983 and 1984 they grew at 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. The
bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook
depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds into the larger
banks. The Government averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector and
undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole. A
new banking law was enacted in June 1983 which covered many of the
recommendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector
(No. 4459-TU).  These included measures to reduce the undercapitalization of
banks, place limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the
establishment of branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the
interlocking between banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance
scheme, and increase the role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the
banking sector. A new law is currently before Parliament which will further
the banking reform process by introducing standardized accounting for banks
and improved procedures for handling non-performing loans. The Government
also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation by reducing
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Separately, the
Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge).



-4-
12.      The Government is committed to maintaining an interest rate structure
for deposits which is positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding more or less positive real returns since end-1983, with interest
rates ranging from 45 to 53 percent depending upon the term of the deposit.
While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to save, they
have also meant high borrowing costs. Nominal interest rates range from 60 to
80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because of the high
intermediation costs of the commercial banks and their widely prevalent
practice of requiring compensating balances. The interest rate differentials
between preferential and non-preferential credits and among preferential
credits are large and need to be reduced. The Government has reaffirmed its
determination to achieve positive real rates on all lending by a combination
of bringing down inflation and phasing out interest rate subsidies on
preferential credits. In January 1985, it eliminated preferential interest
rates on short-term export credits. High market interest rates, together with
the limited availability of credit, have led to considerable liquidity
problems for the private business sector, particularly for businesses
supplying the domestic market. Measures are also needed to lower the
operating costs of banks, which are well above prevailing levels in comparable
countries.
13.      In the fiscal area, progress was evident from 1980 to 1982 but there
have been slippages in 1983 and 1984. The budget deficit to GNP ratio was
reduced from 5.3 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 1982, and the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) dropped sharply from 12.6 percent of GNP to
6.9 percent over the same period. However, the revenue to GNP ratio has been
declining over the past three years. From a high of 20.3 percent in 1981, it
has fallen sharply to an estimated 15.6 percent in 1984. Largely because of
this significant shortfall in revenues, overall fiscal performance has
worsened since 1983 even though government expenditures have been considerably
curtailed (from 24.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to an estimated 20.8 percent in
1984) and budgetary transfers to SEEs as a percentage of GNP have fallen
steadily (from 4.8 percent in 1980 to an estimated 1.6 percent in 1984). The
budget deficit is estimated at 5.2 percent of GNP in 1984 and the PSBR at
8.8 percent. The downward trend in the Government revenue to GNP ratio
highlights the urgency of mobilizing additional public resources. As a step
in this direction, the Government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in
January 1985.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were systematic through 1982
with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion (5.7 percent of
GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) in 1982. However, in 1983
the current account deficit widened to about $2.1 billion (4.2 percent of GNP)
as merchandise exports and workers' remittances fell short of targets.
Exports rebounded strongly in 1984, growing by 25 percent in dollar terms to
$7.1 billion.  Remittances, too, registered a higher than expected increase,
reaching $1.9 billion (up by 24 percent).  concurrently, there was a continued
large inflow of deposits through the Dresdner scheme ($550 million in 1984).
Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers in
Germany and automatically places these funds at the disposition of the Central
Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an interest rate
commensurate with the Euro-market rate. However, these increases were offset
by a sharp rise in merchandise imports to $10.8 billion (up by 16 percent in
dollar terms). As a result, the current account deficit in 1984 was
considerably higher than projected, reaching $2.1 billion (4.3 percent of
GNP), or about the same level as in 1983.



-5-
1i.      On balance, merchandise export performance has been u,r- ssive over
che 1980-84 period, growing at an average annual rate of about 26 percent in
dollar terms. This growth has been led by the manufacturing sector and has
involved a rise in the share of exports to the Middle Eastern countries.
Industrial exports, comprised primarily of processed foods and textiles, have
risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to 72 percent in 1984. These
results were achieved by a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate
policy and import liberalization) and direct (tax rebates, preferential
credits) measures to enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset
the traditional bias towards producing for the domestic market. The flexible
exchange rate policy was one of the most important factors contributing to the
growth of exports, together with the penetration of Turkish products in Middle
East markets.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, mostly due to exogenous
factors. Imports fell by 1.0 percent in dollar terms in 1982 and rose by only
4.4 percent in 1983.  This reflected price decreases .n both oil and non-oil
imports. Merchandise imports, however, increased substantially in value in
1984. The increase has been most significant in some of the groups (e.g. raw
materials and consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization
in terms of both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of
quantitative restrictions.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Government's Fifth Five Year Plan (1985-89) was approved by the
Grand National Assembly in July 1984. The Plan reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)   an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise imports of
8.2 percent;
(iv)   an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment; and
(v)   a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989.



-6-
18.          While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, certain targets seem optimistic in view of
both past performance and the ismediate prospects for the economy. The Bank's
projections indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
well into 1987, implying a lower growth rate in GDP for the early years of the
Plan and a return to a higher growth path only in 1988. Key economic
variables in the Bank's latest projections for the period 1985-89 are
presented in Table 1:

19.      Bank projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum on
average for the Plan peried, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial year of
the Plan (stabilization period) and a high of 6.3 percent for the final year
(growth period). Achievement of these growth rates will depend on the
performance of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination
to constrain the growth of the public sector in line with public resources and
to create a more favorable investment climate for the private sector. This
translates itself into a projected real growth per annum in public fixed
investment of about 5.0 percent on aveiage for the Plan period, starting with
a modest increase in the early years. The comparable figure for private fixed
investment is 10.6 percent or a little more than twice the growth rate for
public fixed investment. These figures are consistent with the need to meet
the infrastructure requirements of the economy through the public investment
program, while providing for the capacity expansion of the private sector
necessary to meet the export and growth targets.
20.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average 9.4 percent
per annum in real terms. Merchandise imports, on the other hand, are
projected to grow more slowly in real terms through 1986 and then pick up to
an average 7.5 percent per annum in the terminal years of the Plan. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1986
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 would show a deficit of
approximately $2.0 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.7 billion.  The
projected capital account is seen to remain manageable throughout the period
even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization payments in
1985-87 arising from the debts rescheduled during the 1978-80 period and an
imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least two
months' imports. Consistent with the above is an average debt service ratio
for medium and long-term credits for the Plan period of 21.7 percent.
Including short-term debt the average debt service ratio for the Plan period
is 23.7 percent. Gross capital inflows required in 1989, on these
assumptions, would be about $5.9 billion, or about 38 percent higher than the
amount in 1984. Such an inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt service
ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of che Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
chis has evoked from the international financial community and the present
view of future resources and export market possibilities, the Government's
somewhat more L 'itious Plan ta-gets would be feasible provided they are
supported by slightly higher export growth rates and greater success in the
mobilization of public resources. This may be more difficult to achieve in
the early (stabilization) phase of the Plan.
22.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions of
export and import growth rates, a downside risk case has also been developed.
With Turkey's export performaance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such



- 8 -
as the world economic outlook and movements in international prices, a sloaer
growth of merchandise exports (an average of 6.9 percent over the Plan period)
would lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments
situations more external borrowing, a lower CDP growth (averaging about
4.8 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio (22-24 percent per
anmum). In such a situation the Government would have little chance of
absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. Eowever, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion and the
determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for the domestic
market, there is good reason to support the perspective set out in the
mediur-term scenario presented in paragraphs 18 to 21.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
23.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
S7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled same $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements coacluded with official and commercial creditors.
Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in
convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers' credits and $1.2 billion of
non-guaranteed suppliers' credits, were consolidated into mediumrterm loans or
partially converted into Turkish lira obligations. Following the resolution
of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official sources - major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the
estimated tocal debt outstanding of $22.7 billion at end-1984, 81 percent
constituted medium and long-term debt (including IMF). Short-term debt 83 a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
18 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme (para. 14). At
end-1984 the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme are
estimated to amount to $1.8 billion, which would represent about 45 percent of
Turkey's short-term external obligations and 8 percent of its total
outstanding debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 41 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1989. This translates into a
total debt outstanding forecast for 1989 of $30.6 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 23 percent of that total. Dresdner scheme inflows are
projected to be around $600 million per annum throughout this period and to
account for a large part of che rise in the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt outstanding.
24.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits (in relation
to exports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances)
increased from about 14.6 percent in 1981 to a peak of 28 percent in 1983 as a
result of a large repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier
OECD agreements. Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the
coming years and would average about $3.B billion per year in 1985-89.
However, the debt service ratio is seen to decrease from an estimated
25 percent in 1984 to 19.8 percent in 1989. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international comnercial and official sources. There have been encouraging



-9-
signs of Turkey's ability to enter the market for commercial borrowings. From
December 1983 to November 1984, Turkey had secured a little over $500 million
from commercial credits, constituting about 23 percent of the total external
credits received during this period. The Central Bank of Turkey recently
completed the syndication of a $500 million multi-component mediuw-term (seven
years) facility involving a large number of U.S., European, Japanese and
Middle Eastern commercial banks as lead managers.
25.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. The Government purchased the full amount
authorized under the arrangement.  The Government also purchased
three-quarters of a SDR 225 million one-year standby arrangement which was
approved by the IMF in April 1984 and replaced an earlier one-year arrangement
terminated at the request of the Government. Discussions are presently under
way on a further one-year standby arrangement.
PART II - BAME  GROUP OPERTIONS IN TORKEY
26.      Through March 31, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent $5383.5 million 1|
to Turkey, through 81 projects. Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 24 percent, power for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 32 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined (excluding structural
adjustment loans) average 49 percent of appraisal estimates as compared to
50 percent for Tunisia and 49 percent for Morocco. As of March 31, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $239 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a sumnary statement of Bank loans,
-DA credits and IEC investments as of March 31, 1985.
27.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's mrziumrterm objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more r_liance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. SAL V, which was approved in June 1984,
completed the series of five loans which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. Significant progress has been achieved in the past five
years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over. The next phase will
involve the broadening and deepening of the adjustment process at the sectoral
level. Recent econaomic developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 10 -
sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL
period would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment
lending designed to be quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors.
28.      Efforts have already been initiated to develop a series of sectoral
adjustment loans for the major sectors over the next few years, starting with
agriculture. The loans for the agriculture sector would help to support a
mediumrterm action program aimed at increasing the growth of primary
production and exports, rationalizing public investment and strengthening
sectoral institutions.  Sectoral adjustment lending would also support
measures to address the structural problems of the financial sector and
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans could be developed include energy and transport.
29.      Project lending, which will continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, will be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. A portion of project lending would be earmarked for the construction
or rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would
be guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (incLuding improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
30.      The close macroecononic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the five-year development
plan and studies of housing finance, telecommunications and electronics.
Topics to be covered in the future include a review of the public investment
program, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustmrent, a review of
transport investments and studies of engineering and agro-industries.
31.      In addition to this loan to Turkey, other projects being presented to
the Executive Directors this fiscal year include a loan for pulp and paper
rehabilitation, an agricultural sector adjustment loan, and loans for a fourth
power transmission project; a power system operations assistance project, an
industrial schools project and a ports project.
32.      Turk: ,'s debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (pars . 23 and 24). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 12.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 13 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.4 billion in 1984 to $14.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.7 billion in 1984 to $8.8 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is pLojected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 perce.-t in 1984, and to about 17 percent ii 1989.

33.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also inwested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Governmeut with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR
34.      Urbanization has proceeded rapidly in Turkey with the urban
population reaching 23 million in 1983, or 47 percent of the total population
of 48 million. This 4.4 percent per annum rise in the urban population from
1945 to 1983 has been fueled by migration from the countryside which has
accounted for 60 percent of urban growth. Turkey's total population growth
over the same period has averaged 2.5 percent per annum. About one in three
urban dwellers live in metropolitan Istanbul C4.5 million), Ankara
(2.1 million) and Izmir (1.4 million); there are about 30 other urban centres
in Turkey with populations greater than 100,000 inhabitants. Urban
inhabitants are projected to reach 43 million in number, or 65 percent of the
country's total population, by the year 2000. Approximately 75 percent of GDP
is currently being generated in urban areas as compared to 50 percent in
1950.
35.      Rapid urban growth has brought problems in its wake, including the
lack of infrastructure and services, housing shortages. and ineffective
municipal administration.  The Government recognizes that improvemnts in
urban efficiency can significantly reduce economic development costs. Its
main objectives are to improve che management and resource mobilization of
municipal governments, provide adequate infrastructure and services, relieve
housing shortages and improve coordination amongst agencies in the urban
sector.
Urban Infrastructure and Services
36.      About a quarter of the urban housing stock, or one million units, is
located in unplanned and unlicensed settlements called "gecekondus." The
majority of these unplanned settlements are characterized by inadequate water
and sewerage facilities and poor social services. A major effort is essential
to tackle the massive backlog in the provision of services for ge9ekondu
communities, with parallel efforts to ensure that fucure urban growth takes
place on serviced land. Important elements of this effort include the
adoption of appropriate infrastructure and planning standards, improvement in
the level of cost recovery, and simplification of land acquisition and
development procedures. At present, less than of 30 percent of the investment
costs for sewers and roads is recoverable from beneficiaries, and tariffs do
not cover the operation and maintenance costs of sewerage nor, in most cases,
of water supply.



- 12 -
Urban Administration, Management and Finance
37.      Urban management in Turkey reflects a strong tra::tion of financial
and administrative centralization. There are 67 provinces and 1,702
municipalities, 990 of which have a population of over 3,000. The
muanicipalities employ almost 200,000 people. Management skills have been
eroded by the dominance of central agencies which have historically undertaken
most of the planning, design and implementation of investment programs. Since
1980, however, legislation has been passed to create metropolitan authorities,
reorganize the provision of some utility services, increase municipal revenues
and mobilize additional resources for housing development. In 1984, the
Government stated its intention to decentralize authority aad responsibility
to municipal governments. Recent steps taken include the delegation of
authority to local governments in metropolitan areas to approve mater plans,
previously a responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement
(MPWS). However, devolution of authority to municipal administrations will
also require significant changes in their roles and responsibilities as well
as those of the various central organizations so that they mutually reinforce
one another in providing services more efficiently. Much remains to be done
in defining municipal responsibilities and establishing the organizational and
financial framework for more effective local management of urban development.
For example, decentralization will require the adoption of accounting systems
which show the costs of services, and definition of tariffs and charges to
recover these costs.
38.      The Government is undertaking a major effort to mobilize additional
resources for municipalities to overcome past deficiencies and to meet the
needs of rapidly growing urban areas. In 1981 legislation was enacted
assigning local governments five percent of total government tax revenues.
The 1984 finance law provided for the share of central government budgetary
resources for the municipalities to rise gradually, from five percent in 1984
to 8.3 percent in 1986. These funds would continue to be channeled through
Iller Bank (the Municipal Bank), which would receive an additional two percent
of government tax revenues to carry out its own investment program. In
addition, municipalities are authorized to raise local revenues such as local
taxes and water and sewerage tariffs, but a systematic approach to cost
recovery has not been adopted. There may also be opportunities to realize
economies by establishing more independent water supply and severage
authorities and to involve the private sector in providing some public
services such as solid waste disposal or in performing certain tasks on a
contract basis. Such possibilities would be explored under the proposed
engineering project.
The Institutional Framework
39.      In addition to the MPWS and the Ministry of Interior, there are
several central goverrment agencies which assist municipalities in the
planning, designing, implementing and financing of physical facilities. Iller
Bank, an autonomous agency under the MPWS, is a key institution in the urban
development process filling the roles of (i) planning and executing agency for
urban physical infrastructure; (ii) financial intermediary providing funds to
municipalities for infrastructure investment; and (iii) cashier for channeling
government tax revenues to the municipalities. Over half of its investments



- 13 -
are in water and sewerage facilities. The State Hydraulic Works (DSI), under
the Ministry of Energy and National Resources, is responsible for allocation,
conservation and protection of water resources, and also designs and
constructs water production and transmission facilities for towns with
populations over 100,000. Two other agencies under the aegis of the MPWS,
the Real Estate Credit Bank and tne Land Office, respectively provide public
housing finance and acquire land for shelter schemes. The Title and Cadastral
Office, located in the Prime Ministry, is responsible for the titling and
registration of land. In 1984, the Government also created a national housing
fund under the Prime Ministry to finance housing from earmarked taxes and
levies. The lack of effective coordination amongst these agencies, coupled
with overlapping responsibilities, has hindered the efficient operation of the
urban economy.
The Cukur-ova Region
40.      The Cukurova Metropolitan Urban Planning Region (CMUPR) includes the
agriculturally rich Cilician Plain within the provinces of Icel, Adana and
Hatay. The population of these provinces was 3.2 million in 1980 and has
grown by 3.5 percent annually since 1945. The populations of the four major
centres of Adana, Mersin, Iskenderun, and Tarsus reached a total of one
million in 1980, and have grown at an annual average of 5.1 percent since
1945; this compares with a 4.4 percent annual growth rate for all Turkish
cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants.
41.      The CMUPR has experienced and is expected to enjoy continued rapid
agricultural and industrial growth through agriculture-linked industries
(processing and textiles), a variety of heavy industries (including the
largest steel plant in Turkey), as well as a wide range of light industries
which serve the region, the hinterland, and increasingly, export markets. The
region is anchored at either end by the major ports of Mersin and Iskenderun,
both of which are under expansion. There are additional ports at Yumurtalik
(fertilizers), Dortyol (oil pipeline terminus), and Isdemir (iron and steel
mill). New industrial free trade zones are planned for Mersin and Yumurtalik,
with the latter centre also being the site of the proposed Iraq-Turkey gas
pipeline terminal. There are also proposals under consideration for trade
centres at Mersin and iskenderun.
42.      The increase in urban population in the four main cities of the CMUPR
is attributed in large part to immigrants, originally attracted by prospects
of seasonal employment in agriculture, who tend to remain in the region and
are integrated into the industrial labor force. Official planning standards,
which assume construction of multi-family apartment blocks on large plots, do
not reflect the living patterns of low-income rural migrants. As a result,
close to half of the urban population is accommodated in unplanned settlements
on the urban fringes which are inadequately served with water, electricity,
roads and sewerage facilities.
43.      Master plans which exist or are under preparation address a number of
bottlenecks in the supply of urban services. However, despite water supply
programs under implementation, several cities have grown to the point where
local ground water sources have started to become insufficient. This is



- 14 -
exacerbated by the high proportion of unaccounted for water (estimated, for
example, at about 35 percent in Adana), mainly attributable to pipeline losses
and inadequate metering . There are backlogs in the supply of sewerage
services and major schemes are under consideration to install networks and
treatment plants in the main cities of the region. Furthermore, the lack of
adequate services and housing shortages in existing urban areas have generated
proposals for the development of new towns. These proposals. however, do not
appear to take into account more cost-effective options such as rehabilitating
and extending existing areas. There is also scope to improve the plamning and
operational efficiency of water supply, sewerage anu solid waste disposal
services in the four major cities. In addition, investments which are
proposed or under way (para. 41) will have major implications for urban
patterns in the Cukurova Region. These issues would be studied under the
proposed engineering project.
Bank Role in the Urban Sector
44.      The Bank has so far provided one credit of $2.3 million for an
Istanbul Urban Development Project (Credit 324-TU) signed in 1972 and closed
in 1981. The aim of this project was to prepare an integrated urban
development program f:or the Istanbul metropolitan area. The Project
Completion Report (PCR) of May 25, 1982 and the Project Performance Audit
Report (PPAR) No. 4372 dated December 30, 1983 concluded that although the
project stimulated an awareness of the problems of urban management,
particularly the need for changes in institutional arrangements, it was only
partially successful mainly because it was too complex and ambitious. The
reports highlighted a number of problems including lack of an effective
project implementation unit and poor coordination of government agencies. The
proposed engineering loan has been designed taking these findings into account
by inclusion of a Project Coordinating Unit and establishment of national and
local steering committees.
45.      The Bank made a $37 million loan to the Government in 1972 for an
Istanbul Water Supply Project (Loan 844-TU) which was closed in 1981. The
project included expanding the water treatment, transmission, pumping and
distribution systems for the Istanbul metropolitan area. The PCR dated June
1982 and the PPAR (No. 4835) of December 1983 concluded that the main project
objectives were achieved: water production was increased to the levels
anticipated at the time of appraisal and a reorganization of the sector was
achieved through the creation of the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage
General Directorate, an autonomous authority responsible for the planning,
design, construction and operation of water supply and sewerage facilities in
Istanbul. Lessons drawn from the project included the need to address the
problem of unaccounted for water and to pay more attention to institutional
strengthening and training. In 1982, a loan of $88.1 million was made by the
Bank for an Istanbul Sewerage Project (Loan 2159-TU), to increase from 52
percent to 61 percent the portion of the population to be served by sewerage
connections and to provide for adequate sewage disposal facilities. Although
delays have occurred in the award of some major contracts, project
implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily. In addition, a Loan of $6
million for an Ankara Air Pollution Project (Loan S-015-TU) was made in 1979
and closed in 1983. The objectives of the loan were to identify promising
methods of manufacturing smokeless fuel from lignite, and investigate other
possible te_-hnologies which could provide a cleaner fuel to reduce air



- 15 -
pollution in Ankara.  Although the pollution xonitoring control equipment is
working successfully, no suitable method for developing an appropriate fuel
was found. Appropriate technologies to process the low quality of Turkish
lignite remain to be developed.
4b.      Given the importance of increasing urban efficiency for Turkey's
economic development, the Bank has pursued an intensive dialogue based on
sector work in the key areas of urban management and investment in municipal
services and housing. The Government has sought assistance from the Bank in
planning and investment in both metropolitan and secondary centers. The
proposed project is designed to deal with the planning and operation of a
range of urban services, taking the Cukurova Region as a pilot area.
Successful measures there could be replicated more widely in subsequent
projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
47.      A proposed Cukurova Region Urban Development Project (CRUDP) was
identified during a mission which visited Turkey in March 1984 to review and
discuss with the Government a strategy for the urban sector. The Government
subsequently requested an engineering loan to facilitate preparation of the
proposed project. Preparation is also being partially financed by a $600,000
advance from the Project Preparation Facility. The engineering loan was
appraised in November/December 1984. Loan negotiations took place in
Washington, D.C. from March 25 to March 28, 1985 with a Turkish delegation
headed by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Financial and Economic Counselor, Embassy of
the Republic of Turkey, and including a representative from the State Planning
Organization (SPO). There is no separate Staff Appraisal Report. A loan and
project suumary is provided at the beginning of this Report and Annex III
contains supplementary project data.
Project Rationale
48.      The Government's objectives in the urban sector are to decentralize
responsibility for some urban services, improve the management of local
administrations, provide adequate infrastructure and services, and reduce
housing shortages. The proposed CRUDP, which may be suitable for Bank
participation, involves developing an integrated approach to regional and
urban development in the Cukurova Region. Although the Cukurova Region is not
one of the poorer areas in Turkey, it has been selected by the Government to
promote new urban development policies because it is one of the most rapidly
growing regions, because inadequate urban investments may impede future growth
in the region, and because it is necessary to test new policies and procedures
in a pilot area before attempting nationwide change. The project would
include designing appropriate investments and associated policies related to
institutional and operational issues, including coordination among agencies in
the sector, cost recovery, adoption of appropriate infrastructure standards
and simplification of land acquisition and development procedures. It would
also strengthen the capacity of municipal governments to pl.n and deliver
urban services. The Government has sought Bank assistance in preparing this
project through the proposed engineering loan which would finance preparation



- 16 -
of institutional, feasibility and design studies. Bank involvement is
justified because of the scale of the investments involved, the complexity of
institutional issues to be tackled, the innovative nature of several of the
likely components and the economic importance of the region in Turkey's
development strategy.
Project Description
49.      The engineering project would consist of the following main
components:
(i3 establishment and maintenance of a Project Coordination Unit to
monitor and supervise project activities;
(ii) institutional, feasibility and design studies for the CRUDP,
including regional urban growth management planning, municipal
growth management, municipal financial management and local
government staff training;
(iii) a program to complete the cadastral survey of the Cukurova Region
and a study to define a program to accelerate completion of the
nationwide cadastre; and
(iv) special studies.
These components are described further below.
Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
50.      About 405 man-months of expert services would be provided to
establish and maintain the Project Coordination Unit in Adana. The PCU, under
the aegis of the SPO, would be responsible for administration and
implementation of project activities. One of its major tasks would be that of
coordinating local administrations and the various central government agencies
concerned with project design and execution.
Institutional, Feasibility, and Design Studies for the CRUDP
51.      Regional Urban Growth Manaement Planning.  About seven man-moaths of
expert services would be provided to review the experience related to regional
planning in Turkey, and to make recommendations on appropriate regional
development objectives and organizational arrangements.
52.      Municipal Growth. Management.  'To assist the Government in the
preparation of selected urban investments in the Cukurova Region and in
establishing institutional and financial arrangements to sustain them,
institutional and feasibility studies would be undertaken in the areas
described below. The study would also include preparation of engineering
designs and bidding documents, and would assist with the evaluation of tenders
for the works as well as implementation of management recommendations. About
630 man-months of expert services would be provided for these purposes.
(i) Water Supply and Sewerage. Approximately 291 man-months of expert
se-.ices would be provided to review investments as well as



- 17 -
operations and management arrangements for water resource
development, transmission and distribution networks, and sewage
collection and disposal systems which would be consistent with,
and complementary to, other physical investments in the Cukurova
Region.
(ii) Solid Waste Management and Composting. About 34 mar-months of
expert services would be allocated to assess and make
recommendations for improving solid waste collection and disposal
methods and facilities in major cities in the Region.
Opportunities to involve the r-4vate sector in the efficient
provision of such services would be explored.
(iii)  Upgrading Ge;ekondu Sites.  About 145 man-months of expert
services would be provided to assess iuvestment requirements and
make recommendations on institutional and related matters aimed at
eliminating service deficiencies (including roads, street
lighting, refuse collection, social facilities, as well as water
supply, sewerage and drainage services not dealt with in para.
52(i) above) in selected gecekondu areas.
(iv) Development of Urban Expansion Areas. Approximately 135
man-months of expert services would be included to identify sites
and recoammend schemes for land purchase, planning and development
of new urban areas (including infrastructure and social service
requirements), with particular attention to the needs of lower
income-level groups.
(v) Other Investments. About 25 man-months of expert services would
be provided to allow for preliminary assessments of the
feasibility of a range of small investments proposed by Cukurova
municipalities (including construction of wholesale markets and
relocation of transport facilities), and to develop terms of
reference for such items where more detailed study would be
required.
53.      Municipal Financial Management.  Approximately 81 man-months of
expert services would be provided to identify, recommend and assist in
implementing improvements in municipal accounting and financial management in
Adana, Mersin, Iskenderun, Tarsus and Ceyhan. A review of existing and
potential sources of local government finances, rates for taxes and utility
tariffs, and the means for improved collection of revenues would be
undertaken.  Furthermore, the study would assess revenue requirements in the
light of opportunities for privatization as well as estimates of costs of
different municipal services. The project would also include tit.- oirchase of
a micro-computer for each of the above mentioned cities to be utilized for
staff training and for implementation of financial management systems.
54.      Local Government Staff Training.  About 64 man-monzths of expert
services would be included to develop programs for staff training in the major
Cukurova municipalities and to provide training for staff involved in project
implementation. In addition, some seven man-months of expert services would
be provided to make a preliminary identification of training requirements for



- 18 -
municipal administrations on a national basis and to develop a program to meet
these needs.
Cadastral Program
55.      The project would provide equipment for the Cukurova Region Cadastral
Office to advance completion of the cadastral survey program in the region
from fifteen years to three years. This would include mapping about
25,000 km2, title registration in over 2,300 km2 of villages, and
cadastral surveys of some 68,000 plots within municipal boundaries. About
40 man-months of expert services would also be included to prepare a program
to accelerate completion of the nationwide cadastre.
Special Studies
56.      Approximately 45 man-months of expert services would be provided to
carry out a study of Iller Bank to review its policies, programs and services
as well as its role and function in urban development. It would also include
an assessment of its financial planning, auditing and accounting systems. A
second study would be undertaken to review Adana's transportation system and
policies as well as to develop a program to meet the city's transportation
requirements. About ao man-months of expert services would be provided for
this purpose.
Project Costs and Financing
57.      The total project cost is estimated at $10.7 million equivalent.  The
foreign exchat,ge component is estimated at $4.7 million or 44 percent of total
project costs. A physical contingency allowance of seven percent ($0.6
million) has been added to the cost of technical assistance. Price
contingencies (calculated at 5 percent in 1985, 7.5 percent in 1986 and
8 percent thereafter) are estimated at $1.1 million or about 11 percent of the
base cost plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies are about
18 percent of base costs. Technical assistance costs include salaries,
housing, relocation and international travel costs of consultants as well as
the costs of local services such as local travel, subsistence, recruitment and
overhead.
58.      The Bank loan of $9.2 million would finance 98 percent of the
estimated foreign exchange component and 85 percent of the total cost of local
consultants (para. 60) or about 86 percent of total project costs. The United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is providing $0.1 million, on a grant
basis, to finance the Project Director for one year. The Government would
provide funds for financing the Project Director for the remainder of the
project implementation period. The Government would also finance the balance
of project costs. The proposed engineering loan may be refinanced with a
later loan should Bank financing of a subsequent project materialize.
Procurement and Disbursement
59.      Consultant services would be obtained in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The two main consultancies concern the PCU and the institutional,
feasibility and design studies for the CRUDP. The first has been awarded to a



- 19 -
Turkish engineering firm, and the second would be awarded to a consortium of
firms with the various required skills. Aircraft spare parts for the
cadastral component costing approximately $122,000 would be purchased on the
basis of direct negotiations with the original manufacturers, and other
equipment items would be grouped into the largest convenient packages. Since
no equipment package is expected to exceed $250,000, procurement would be by
local competitive bidding. For packages costing less than $50,000 equivalent
(and aggregating no more than US$250,000 equivalent), procurement would be by
local shopping on the basis of at least three quotations. The local
competitive bidding procedures to be followed for awarding contracts for items
to be financed under the proposed loan are acceptable to the Bank.
60.      The proposed loan would be disbursed against:  100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of foreign consultant services and 85 percent of the
total cost of local consultants; ICO percent of foreign expenditures and local
expenditures ex-factory for equipment and materials; and 65 percent of other
local expenditures for off-the-shelf equipment and materials. The
disbursement percentage for local consultants is calculated to be
approximately equivalent to the pescentage resulting from covering the foreign
exchange costs of foreign consultancy contracts. The loan would also
refinance a $600,000 advance from the PPF for expert and related services
necessary for establishment of the PCU. The proposed engineering loan
includes retroactije financing of up to $0.75 million to cover costs incurred
after January 1, 1985 for specialist services necessary for expediting
start-up of the project. In order to ensure that Turkey would have ready
access to foreign exchange, a Special Account would be established in the
Central Bank of Turkey into which an initial deposit of g1 million would be
paid. The Special Account would be replenished against withdrawal
applications as appropriate or when the undisbursed balance of the Account is
equal to 50 percent or less of the amount of the initial deposit. Withdrawal
applications would be supported by appropriate documentation.
Project Implementation
61.      The State Planning Organization is the executing agency for the
project, which is expected to be completed by December 31, 1988. A Project
Coordination Unit would be maintained with representation and under terms of
reference satisfactory to thc Bank and would be headed by a Project Director
whose qualifications and experience would be acceptable to the Bank (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02). An agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, has been
finalized with a Turkish consulting firm to establish and operate the PCU.
Both the Project Director and the team of five professionals selected to staff
the PCU are qualified to supervise and monitor the execution of the
engineering project. To ensure the participation of all agencies concerned, a
national steering committee in Ankara and a local steering committee in Adana,
with terms of reference and staffing acceptable to the Bank, would be
maintained (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). A consultancy contract for the
institutional feasibility and design studies has been approved by the Bank and
is expected to be signed by June 30, 1985. The work would be undertaken in
three phases with Phase I covering identification and pre-feasibility studies;
Phase II would include project preparation and feasibility studies; and



- 20 -
Phase III would cover detailed engineering. Institutional, financial, and
training issues would be dealt with in all three phases (Annex IV contains a
susmary of the terms of reference for the various studies). Execution of the
consultancy contract for Phase I of the institutional, feasibility and design
studies for the CRUDP would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Loan
Agreement, Section 5.01). All interim and final reports by consultants would
be submitted to the Bank. The Government would discuss with the Bank the
actions it proposes to take on the basis of each study carried out under the
project. Following the completion of each phase of the institutional,
feasibility and delign studies for the CRUDP, the Government would furnish to
the Bank, for its review and approval, draft terms of reference, cost
estimates and a timetable for the next phase (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(c)). An implementation program for the proposed project would be agreed
with the Government (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(b) and Schedule 5).
Accounting and Audit
62.      The Borrower, through the PCU, would maintain records and adequate
accounts of expenditure under the project and would prepare a detailed report
of financial activities on a quarterly basis, in an agreed format, to be
submitted to the Bank within 45 days after the end of each quarter. An
external audit would be carried out by auditors and annual audit reports would
be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.01). For this purpose, the Bank's guidelines on
financial reporting would be followed.
Benefits and Risks
63.      The proposed engineering project supports the Government's objectives
in the urban sector to improve the management and resource mobilization of
local governments, provide adequate infrastructure and services, and reduce
housing shortages. It represents an important step in the Government's effort
to resolve some of the institutional issues associated with decentralization.
It would also assist in formulating appropriate regional and urban development
pclicies which may be replicable on a nationwide basis.
64.      The main risk that project implementation might not proceed on
schedule is significantly reduced since agreement has been reached on the
terms of reference of the studies to be undertaken, consultants have been
selected and a contract satisfactory to the Bank has been negotiated, and the
PCU has been established with qualified staff. Given the number of agencies
and municipalities involved, there is also a risk that difficulties may arise
in reaching a consensus on components for implementation in the main project.
This risk has been minimized by the creation of national and local steering
committees.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
65.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of special interest are listed in Annex III of this
Report. Execution of the consultancy contract to carry out Phase I of the



-21-
institutional, feasibility and design studies for the CRUDP would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 5.01).
66.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
67.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

TURKEY - CUKUROVA REGION URBAN ENGINEERING PROJECT
TERHS OF REFERENCE FOR THE INSrITUTIONAL
FEASIBILITY AND DESIGN STUDIES
This Annex contains shortened versions of the Terms of Reference for
institutional, feasibility and engineering design studies (referred to in
paras. 51 to 54 of the President's Report) for a proposed Cukurova Region
Urban Development Project. The Annex sets out the objectives and the scope of
work to be undertaken, the phasing of the studies and consultant manpower
requirements.
I. GENERAL OUTLLNE AND PHASING
1.1 General Outline
1.1.01 The Government is seeking an engineering loan from the World Bank to
finance consultants to assist with strengthening the management capacity of
municipalities in the Cukurova Region and with identification and preparation
of a Cukurova Region Urban Development Project which would be suitable for
external financing.
1.1.02   Government Responsibilities:  The Government will appoint a Project
Director and Project Coordination Unit to be responsible for coordinating all
official activities related to the project, including supervision of the
project and of the consultants during the first three phases of the work. The
municipalities selected for inclusion in the project will provide counterpart
engineers, as required, while components in those cities are under study. The
Iller Bank will contribute at least one water and sewerage engineer to work
with the team. The Government will make available to the consultants copies
of all existing official data and reports relevant to their work.
1.1.03   Consultant Responsibilities:  The consultants shall perform all
necessary technical studies, socio-economic analyses, administrative or
institutional analyses, and any work related thereto as required by the
studies' objectives as described in these Terms of Reference. The consultants
shall rely, to the maximm extent possible, on information which is already
available. They will ensure that any additional requirements, such as social
surveys, legal analyses, institutional investigations, topographical surveys
and soil investigations are carried out so as to serve the needs of all
relevant components.

ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 25
1.1.04   Phasing:  The work will be undertaken in three distinct phases as
described below.
1.1.05   Phase I - Project Inception and Identification (4 months from start
of study). The consultants will review background information on the sector,
iientify cities to be included in the project, identify and make
pre-feasibility studies of potential components and recomend a package of
investments to be carried out during 1987 to 1990 which would be suitable for
external financing. The size and composition of this package will be
recommended on the basis of an assessment of the overall urban investment
program for the Cukurova Region, its size relative to the national program for
urban investments, the feasibility of specific components, and the extent to
which components promise innovations suitable for widespread replication.
1.1.06   The consultants will also make institutional recommendations for
project execution and for the future management of the various urban services
under study. To the extent possible, the consultants will make
recomaendations on improvements which are feasible within the framework of
existing legislation and institutions' mandates.
1.1.07   During the review of the Phase I report, the Goverrment will finalize
the list of cities to be included and select components and alternatives for
which feasibility studies will be prepared during Phase II. Initial decisions
will also be made on institutional arrangements.
1.1.08   Phase II - Project Preparation and Feasibility Studies (8 months
following Government decision oa Phase I recoumendations concerning suitable
project components). This phase would include:
5i) evaluatioa of alternative solutions and preliminary engineering
designs;
(ii) preliminary cost estimates to be divided among foreign costs and
domestic costs, with taxes separately specified;
(iii) procurement arrangements including the number and timing of contracts
for each sub-component;
(iv) financial forecasts showing projected sources and uses of funds
during the implementation period for each agency involved;
(v) economic and financial feasibility analysis;
(a) the economic feasibility of all project components involving
substantial investments in works andlor equipment is to be
assessed. The sensitivity of the economic return to
plausible differences in benefits and costs is to be
estimated;

III. MUNICIPAL FINANCE
3.1 Introduction
3.1.1    Within the framework of Turkey's new economic policy, local
administrations have acquired additional functions transferred from the
central government. These new duties and the increase in services needed due
to rapid urbanization will require adoption of measures to strengthen the
financial position of municipalities. Measures are also needed to endure that
existing resources will be used more efficiently to mobilize additional
revenues.
3.2 Obiectives
3.2.1    This component includes: (i) the identification and definition of
changes in financial and accounting policies, organizations, and systems at
national and local levels, which could help to improve the effectiveness of
the allocation of funds, the mobilization of resources for municipal services,
and the efficiency of services; (ii) advising and assisting in the
implementation of policy and system changes; and (iii) training related
personnel.
3.2.2    Among the most important questions to be analyzed and conclusions to
be sought in this component are: the degree of financial independence which
should be recommended for the municipality as a whole, and for each of the
major service functions such as water supply, sewerage, transportation, and
solid waste disposal; and the contributions which should be made by users of
each major service to cover the capital and operating costs of the service.
3.3 Scope of Work
3.3.1    Phase I
3.3.2    Task 1.  The consultants should prepare a detailed report explaining
existing national and local government (Cukurova Region) financial
institutions, policies, laws, regulations, administrative procedures and
systems of, and relating to, municipal finance. Tables of sources and
applications of funds should be provided for each of the major service
functions including water supply, sewerage, transportation and solid waste
disposal for each component expected to be included in the proposed Cukurova
Region Urban Development Project.
3.3.3    Task 2.  The consultants should estimate approximate financial
requirements of the municipalities for 1985-1990, and should make preliminary



- 35 -
ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 25
determinations of appropriate sources of funds and amounts from each source to
meet the requirements. In making these determinations, user chargers,
taxation, and betterment levies up to full coverage of capital and operating
costs should be analyzed, and commercial lending sources and private equity
capital should be considered in addition to Government funding and external
assistance. Tables of sources and applications of funds for 1985-90 should
indicate separately the determinations made for each major service function
for each municipality, and a consolidated table for each municipality should
be prepared.
3.3.4    Task 3.  The consultants should analyze and provide preliminary
recommendations on the accounting system, auditing, and financial organization
and management of the municipalities. Emphasis should be given to possible
changes in organizational structure, to financial staffing requirements, to
improved financial reporting for management, and to improved systems and
procedures for billing and collection of tariffs, fees, taxes and betterment
levies. Preliminary recommendations should be made as to the appropriateness
of computer applications.
3.3.5    Task 4.  The consultants should assess the need for improvements and
changes in policies drawing upon the findings of Tasks 2 and 3, and should
provide preliminary recommendations indicating those which can be implemented
within existing laws, and those which would require legal changes.
3.4 Phase II
3.4.1    Task 5. The consultants should refine the analysis and determination
of sources and amounts of finance, taking into account the detailed cost
estimates and financial projections prepared in the individual sector
components of the work program. For each projec.- proposed in a municipality,
detailed financing plans should be provided.

IV. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRAINING
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1   Over the past decade, municipalities have faced problems in meeting
staff requiremeats which have been exacerbated by the decline in real wages of
government personnel that have exceeded the decline in private sector wages.
Macy municipalities are not fully committed to staff training. There are few
existing training programs and the Government believes these are inadequate in
scope, quality md volume. In these circumstances, there have been many
proposals for additional training programs, including the establishment of a
national local government training center for which a draft law has been
prepared.
4.2 Objectives
4.2.1    The Government is engaging consultants to:
i)  make recommendations on a strategy for training local government
staff taking into account the proposed law;
(ii) prepare the training component for the proposed Cukurova Region Urban
Develoymet Project. Subject to the outcome of the study, this
component is anticipated to include:
(a) training programs for staff of the municipalities in the Cukurova
Region;
(b) training for central government and Iller Bank staff associated
vith the project; and
Cc) development of a nationwide local government training program; and
(iii) prepare a training program during Phase I for staff related to the
Cukurova Project, to be implaewnted during Phase II of the study.

VI. SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
6.1 Introduction
6.1.1    Solid waste collection in both Adana and Mersin is generally
satisfactory although there is room for improvement in:
Ci) the collection of wastes in low income areas;
(ii) route allocation;
(iii)  selection of collection vehicles; and
(iv) standardization of storage bins.
Adana is currently experimenting with collection by private contractors in
some locations, and other municipalities are also considering similar actions.
6.1.2    Waste disposal methods also present problems and sanitary land fill
procedures are not followed. In most towns contractors recover the more
valuable waste by picking over the dumps. In Mersin, a major composting plant
has been commissioned recently, although the high capital cost of the facility
!makes it unlikely that it will ever generate an economic return on the initial
investment. It is likely that less elaborate methods could provide more
economical and manageable solutions to solid waste recovery than the Mersin
plant and under more hygienic conditions than the present system.
6.2 Objectives
6.2.1    The main objectives are to:
Ci)   review solid waste collection and disposal methods and facilities in
the Cukurova municipalities;
(ii)   identify and evaluate alternative collection and disposal methods,
paying attention to, inter-alia, capital and operating costs, and
opportunities for involving the private sector; and
(iii)   make recommendations for improvement, establish their feasibility
(physical, financial and economic), and provide design and bidding
documents for recommendations proposed.
6.3 Scope of Work
6.3.1    Phase I
6.3.2    Task 1.  A preliminary assessment of solid waste management practices
would be undertaken including the perceived needs and approximate costs to
effect improvement, taking into account any adverse environmental impact.



- 45 -
ANNEX IV
Page 16 of 25
6.3.3    Task 2.  In the case of Adana, Mersin and Iskenderun, a review should
be made of the refuse composition over various seasons of the year, including
collection and disposal methods taking account of the level of service
provided, the extent to which composting and recycling takes place, resources
available (i.e., labour, equipment, finance), management practices and
operational efficiency.
6.3.4    Task 3.  For Adana, Mersin and Iskenderun, an assessment should be
made of the opportunities for improving the efficiency of waste collection and
disposal practices (including transfer stations and vehicle maintenance)
considering each aspect of the service, and listing the alternatives and
options available (including composting and recycling). The capital and
operational costs of the alternatives should be studied and recommendations
should be mLide on a preferred alternative (including consideration of
involvina t-ae private sector).
6.3.5    Task 4.  For Adana, Mersin and Iskenderun, an analysis should be
undertaken on the market for rec,cled ,iacer-als and compost, indicating prices
and quantities for each product, the likely marketing channels and transport
costs.
6.3.6    Task 5.  The design and construction of the Mersin composting plant,
particularly mechanical and electrical engineering aspects, should be assessed
with a view to proposing additional work which may be required to operate the
plant more efficiently.
6.4 Phase II
6.4.1   Following Government decisions after Phase I, feasibility studies
should be prepared for selected alternatives for collection, vehicle
maintenance management, operation, disposal composting and recycling,
including comparison of alternatives and quantification of improvements over
the existing situation.
6.5 Phase III
6.5.1    Designs, working drawings and bidding documents should be prepared
for any civil works, equipment, electrical and mechanical engineering required.
VII. GECEKONDU UPGRADING
7.1 Introduction
7.1.1.   The proliferation of gecekondu settlements, illegally erected and
without satisfactory services, reflects the past failure to address urban
growth in a timely and adequate manner.
7.1.2    The Gover-wnent proposes to address this problem by:
(i)  regularizing gegekondus and providing services;
(ii)  in certain instances, removing gegekondus after offering a suitable
alternative site; and



- 46 -
ANNEX IV
Page 17 of 25
(iii) providing serviced sites for cooperatives, individuals and
developers, with a view to avoiding situations which have hitherto
spawned gerekondu settlements.
7.2 Objectives
7.2.1    This study (in association with the terms of reference for the water
and sewerage program) will deal with part (i) (para. 7.1.2) of the program in
the towns of the Cukurova region and make recommendations on regularizing
gegekondus on the basis of realistic planning standards, providing services
and seeking a substantial degree of cost recovery so as to generate resources
which may be used to extend the program more widely.
7.2.2    Since the water and sewerage component of this study will, inter
alia, assess plans for the provision of water supply and sewerage in
unserviced settlements, this study will focus mainly on other aspects, namely

VIII. URBAN EXPANSION
8.1 Introduction
8.1.1    The challenges for urban growth management posed by rapid urban
growth in the Cukurova Region are highlighted by the proliferation of
gegekondu settlements, illegally erected and without satisfactory sanitary
services. The Government proposes to address urban growth in a more timely
and adequate wanner by developing mechanisms for providing serviced sites for
cooperatives, individuals and developers, reinforcing efficient spatial
patterns of growth, and avoiding excessive encroachment on agricultural land.
8.2 Objectives
8.2.1    The objectives of the component are to;
*            (i)  support the Government's policy of preventing the further growth of
gegekondus and of deflecting growth away from agricultural land in
the Cukurova Region by providing suitable alternatives;
(ii) increase the efficiency of urban development by servicing and selling
"infill" areas;
(iii) provide serviced lots at standards affordable to low and moderate
income households;
(iv) find means for the formal and informal private construction sector to
play a positive role in the urbanization process; and
(v) create, as necessary, organization and management mechanisms for
improved management of land use in the urban areas of the Cukurova
Region which would be self-financing, which would continue to be
active after the completion of this project, and which would provide
a model for replication elsewhere in Turkey.

8.3 Scope of Work
8.3.1    Phase I
8.3.2    Task 1;  Preliminary Economic and Demand Analysis. The consultants
will prepare a preliminary analysis of demand for housing, land for housing,
and associated commercial, industrial and market uses in the Cukurova Region,
including but not limited to the cities of Hersin, Tarsus. Adana, Ceyhan and
Iskenderun, and prepare a preliminary assessment of the likely demand for
urban development in new growth centers. This will include;
(i) a review of all formal sector and government sector housing programs
indicating their past size, success in reaching desired target groups
and future programs;
(ii) estimates of the future demand for housing (disaggregated by economic
group) for 1987, 1990 and 1995 as well as of future supply of
different types of housing in the light of analysis of past trends
and ongoing or committed programs. Caps between forecast demand and
likely supply will be identified for different cities, income groups
id housing types;
Ciii) special attention will be given to the ability of different segments
of the population to pay for shelter, and the identification of
affordable cost ceilings for the shelter package (land, services and
housing);
(iv) an analysis of trends in land prices and sales in relevant areas of
the project cities; and
(v) preparation of a forecast of the land areas to be urbanized in each
town by 1995 together with a recommendation on the size of the areas
to be developed under this project.
8.3.3    Task 2:  Re-iew of Land and Housing System and Institutional
Arrangements.  This task will include a description of the major mechanisms by
Which housing is supplied to different segments of the population, paying
special attention to those mechanisms which have led to unplanned urbanization
and a definition of the factors which have given rise to large unplanned
settlements.
8.3.4    Based on the evidence collected and analyzed, preliminary
recommendations will be made on whether and how (i) the informal private
building sector could be encouraged to develop housing in the nev serviced
sites; (ii) the activities of the informal sector could be encouraged to fit
within sound planning patterns; and (iii) the extent to which the formal
sector developers, including cooperatives, can be involved.
8.3.5    The role, constraints and weaknesses of existing institutions
involved in land use planning, land servicing, housing policy and home
financing would be reviewed.

ANNEX IV
Page 22 of 25
8.3.6    A preliminary analysis would be prepared of the costs and benefits of
urban expansion via gegekondu settlements versus more organized development in
which services are installed ahead of or simultaneously with shelter.
8.3.7    Recomendations would be made for improving the process of urbanizing
land, includinmg, if necessary, identification of alternative organizational
arrangements for the development of land in the expansion areas in a more
organized fashion, indicating the role of the private as well as the public
sector.
8.3.8    Task 3:  Selection of Cities for Expansion Sites.  On the basis of
preliminary analysis of growth patterns, availability of infrastructure,
potential sites and organizational arrangements, the consultants will propose
cities tr be included in this component.
8.3.9    Task 4;  Site Identification and Evaluation. Potential sites in the
Cukurova Region will be identified by the consultants in consultation with the
maicipalities.  Subject to the findings of Tasks 1 and 2, the total area
under the project is expected to include about 500 ha. The consultants will
evaluate and rank potential sites, basing their findings on agreed criteria.
The target group will be families in the lower forty percent of the income
distribution. Some land may be developed under the project for higher income
groups, especially if this is desirable to provide surpluses over cost which
can be used to cross subsidize plots for the target group. Site evaluation
will include an examination of existing conditions and uses including an
analysis of the availability of physical infrastructure, community facilities,
transportation services, employment opportunities, geophysical and
enviromental conditions and land tenure status. The consultants will also
review and make proposals on design standards for different on-site facilities
which may be subject to cost recovery from beneficiaries (esp-cially roads,
water and sewerage, and electricity).
8.4 Phase II
8.4.1    Task 5: Development of Site Plans.  The consultants will carry out
e         all surveys required and prepare alternate site layouts supported by a written
statement justifying the preferred layout.

all complementary installations, in particular the operating budgets of
health, nutrition and education programs.
8.4.6    Task 7:  Detailed Market Analysis.  The consultants should elaborate
on the findings of Tasks 1 and 2 concerning market justification. This task
will relate cost estimates to the ability and williugness of the potential
project beneficiaries to pay recoverable costs, and fees and taxes for
infrastructure services and public utilities.
8.4.7    On the basis of a current study of the financing facilities and the
circumstances of different types of prospective purchasers, the consultants
will also propose methods to facilitate access by low-income families to
long-term credit for plot purchase and for housing construction or improvement
under the project.
8.4.8    Task 8:  Financial Analysis.  The consultants will present specific
proposals on procedures for the recovery of capital and operating costs. The
objective for "on-site" costs (land and infrastructures) is full cost
recovery, preferably with some surplus which could be used for reinvestment in
future programs.
8.4.9    The consultants should analyze the financial impact of the project on
the various agencies concerned in order to determine the extent of self
financing and the requirements for external financing. For each subcomponent,
a statement of sources and uses of funds for a period of ten years and a
five-year operating budget should be prepared.
8.4.10   Task 9:  Economic Analysis.  The consultants shall carry out a cost
benefit analysis of the expansion area components.
8.4.11   Task 10:  Institutional Analysis and Implementation Plan.  The
consultants should present a detailed proposal for the organizational
arrangements for project imvlementation including:

construction contracts, and assist with preparation and evaluation of
prequalification documents and the analysis of bids.
IX. OTHER STUDIES AND PREPARATION OF TERMS OF REFERENCE
9.1 Introduction
9.1.1    The Cukurova imicipalities are considering seeking finance for
several municipal investments in addition to the components set out in earlier
sections. These investments include, for example, a wholesale market at
Mersin and a bus station at Adana. The feasibility of these investments needs
to be assessed as well as a study of the planning and management of urban
transport in Adana.
9.2 Objectives
9.2.1    The objectives are: Ci) to prepare terms of reference for studies of
che feasibility of major municipal investments; (ii) to carry out such studies
in Phase II as may be determined following Phase I; and (iii) to make
recomsendations on the nature of feasibility analysis appropriate for
municipal investments in the future.
9.3 Scope of Work
9.3.1    Phase I
