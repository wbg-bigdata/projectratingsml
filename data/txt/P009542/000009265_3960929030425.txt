MEMORANDUM AND RECOHMEND&TION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A THIRD RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Bangladesh for SDR 79.6 million (US$105 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit would help to finance a rural electrification
project. USAID is expected to extend an existing commitment in order to
cofinance the technical assistance component (US$17.7 million).
2.       Background.  Bangladesh is overwhelmingly a rural society with
about 87Z of its 110 million population living in rural areas and the agri-
cultural sector contributing nearly 502 to its GDP. GOB's development
strategy focuses on the development of rural areas to increase agricultural
production and to enhance industrial development through the promotion of
small scale agro-industries. To facilitate these changes and to improve the
quality of life of the rural populations, GOB decided in the mid-1970s to
extend public supply of electricity to rural areas. In 1S77 GOB created the
Rural Electrification Board (REB) to carry out a national rural electrifi-
cation program. A comprehensive rural electrification master plan was
developed in 1978 by REB, with assistance of USAID-financed consultants,
National Rural Electrification Cooperative Association and Gilbe-t
Commonwealth (NRECAIGC). It envisaged the country-wide rural electrifica-
tion in five phases by the year 2005. Phase I was completed in 1986,
Phase II is expected to be completed in 1989, and Phase III is now underway
with scheduled completion in 1992193. These three phases cover about 40T of
the geographical rural area with a population of about 31 million, at an
estimated cost of about US$405 million. Several dorors (including USAID,
IDA, CIDA, KFAED, Finland, SAUDIFUND) have participated in the program's
financing.
3.       The program is based on the development of autonomous member-owned
distribution cooperatives (Palli Budyut Samities--PBSs) with 33 kV supply
from the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), each covering an area of
900-1,000 sq km and having 20,000-30,000 members. In June 1989, 33 PBSs
were operational, supplying over 7,000 villages and nearly 400,000
consumers, accounting for about 10 of BPDB's total electricity sales
(370 GWh). Seven PBSs are under formation. Annual sales growth averaged
43z during FY83-89; about 75? of energy sales are for productive purposes
(irrigation, industry, commerce).  The prefeasibility study for Phase IV
identified 19 areas to form new PBSs and 22 to be annexed to existing PBSs.
However, considering the economy's absorptive capacity and the scale of the
ongoing program, GOB approved only the development of 11 areas to form new
PBSs and 19 areas to be annexed to existing PBSs. The project would support
the first part of this program ((Phase IV-A) for implementation in 1991-97.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has supported 13 energy
projects, including six power projects (four BPDB and two REB) and an Energy
Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC), to help Bangladesh develop an efficient
energy sector. The ESAC provided a comprenensive long-term framework for
policy actions and forms the basis for IDA's lending for specific energy
investments. A major power subsector priority is to strengthen REBIPBSs
institutionally to improve their operational and financial performance.



-2-
IDA's involvement in the project would support the timely and effective
implementation of GOB's rural electrification program in PBSs where
investments would be economically and financially viable. It would also
assist in resolving BPDBIREB coordination and line transfer issues, promote
energy conservation by introducing effective demand management measures, and
assist in upgrading REB and PBSs' technical and financial skills.
5.       Project Obiectives.  Within the framework of the ESAC sectoral
policy reform program, the project's primary objectives would be to
substitute electric power at least cost for imported petroleum products by
expand .ng existing distribution networks to unserved areas, strengthen REB
and PBSs' fInancial and operation performance, rehabilitate systems which
REB will take over from BPDB, reduce system losses, and improve PBSs'
financial viability and institutional performance.
6.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would includes
(a) installation of new distribution networks in four new PBSs (Comilla,
Dinajpur, Manikganj and Cox's Bazar), all of which show good prospects for
financial viability; (b) expansion of five existing PBS networks and
intensification of existing PBS networks financed by IDA under the First
Rural Electrification Project (Cr.1262-BD); (c) rehabilitation of
distribution lines and substations to be taken over from BPDB; (d) technical
assistance to strengthen REB and PBSs' managerial, financial and institu-
tional performance, and training; and (e) construction of REB central
facilities (offices, training center and workshop/warehouse). The total
project cost is estimated at US$160.2 million equivalent (excluding interest
during construction), with a foreign exchange component of US$101.2 million
(63Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Consultant services and technical support for the expatriate consultants
NRECA/GC are being frnded by USAID up to July 31. 1991.  Following GOB's
request, USAID is considering continuing such financing to 1996. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map highlighting the project areas, IBRD 22134, is
attached. The staff appraisal report No. 8523-BD dated April 9, 1990 is
being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with GOB that it will:
(a) cause BPDB to transfer the backlog of 1,200 km of BPDB's lines to PBSs
as a condition of Credit effectiveness; (b) cause REB to introduce
procedures for the annual determination of PBS Performance Agreements and to
the Association's satisfaction, monitor PBSs' annual performance against
agreed targets; (c) confirm before December 31, 1990, financing arrangements
with USAID or propose satisfactory alternative funding for the Technical
Assistance services required after July 1991. REB has agreed to:
(a) prepare annual draft individual performance agreements to monitor PBSs'
performance; the introduction of the agreements for the 33 operating PBSs
would be a condition for Credit effectiveness; (b) prepare a dated program
to upgrade BPDB substations and hand-over BPDB's lines to the project PBSs;
(c) introduce by December 31, 1990 appropriate load management measures and
time-of-day tariffs for large customers; (d) submit to IDA its audited
accounts and PBSs' audited accounts no later than nine months after the
fiscal year's end; (e) ensure that its operating expenses and interest
payments in any fiscal year shall not exceed a maximum of 75? of the
aggregate interest and other revenues received during that fiscal year; and
(f) ensure that its internal sources of funds, including PBSs' loan
repayments, shall cover at least 1.5 times the debt service requirement.

8.       Benefits and Developmental Impact.  Project benefits would include
improving the power subsector's efficiency and sustainability by
strengthening existing PBSs and enhancing the institutional performance of
both REB and PBSs. It would also enhance energy conservation throug' the
reduction of power system losses; improve both REB and PBSs' operational and
financial performance; expand training facilities; and resolve BPDUIREB
coordination and line transfer issues, which is necessary for the efficient
implementation of the entire rural electrification program.
9.       The project's direct environmental impact would be limited to
construction of distribution lines and substations, and PBS headquarters
facilities. It would have a positive envirormental impact since lighting by
electricity is cleaner aLd less of a fire hazard than kerosene lamps. The
replacement of diesel and gasoline engines would reduce local air pollution,
and the grid generating plants are more efficient and burn mostly natural
gas.
10.      The project would provide employment to the local labor force for
erecting the distribution works. Although in the short teLm there is a
potential for displacement of manual jobs through mechanization, in the long
run the increase in economic activity and productivity induced by the rural
electrification program is likely to create employment opportunities in the
rural areas, which would benefit mostly the low income rural households.
11.      The rural electrification program has a positive impact on the
employment and quality of life of women. Thus, PBSo employ many women in
their rural offices, especially for revenue function. Further, PBSs' Boards
include women advisors, who act as a channel for women's concerns in PBSs'
developments.
12.      No major technical risks are foreseen.  The major implementation
risk concerns possible constraints on GOB's local funds to support the
project. This risk has been mitigated by reducing the program's overall
size, by improved planning and construction supervision by REB, and by
extending the implementation period from five to seven years.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
