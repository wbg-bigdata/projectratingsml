3.     Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1.   Original objective
The project objectives were to substitute electric power at least cost for imported petroleum
products and to strengthen the performance of the Rural Electrification Board (REB) and the system of
rural electricity cooperatives named Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs) by: (a) expanding existing distribution
networks to unserved areas; (b) rehabilitating distribution systems to be taken over from the parastatals,
Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA); (c)
reducing system losses; and (d) improving PBSs financial viability and institutional performance.



2
The Bank had previously supported two rural electrification projects and was well aware of the
situation with respect to the development of rural electrification in Bangladesh under the system of
member cooperatives, PBSs. The objectives were realistic as well as relevant in the context of the low
electricity access in rural areas, and the support necessary to enhance and develop the successful non-
parastatal utility system serving rural areas. The objectives were also appropriate with respect to the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategies developed over the years which emphasized the importance of
capacity building and increasing access to energy/infrastructure services to rural areas. A socio-economic
impact study carried out while the project was operational (in 1995/96) by USAID, the project co-
financier, also provided valuable evidence of the positive impact of the rural electrification program in
Bangladesh and its effect in poverty reduction, economic development of rural areas, improvement of
women's conditions and a number of other areas of concern in rural development. At the time of
appraisal of this project alternative non-grid supply options (such as Solar Home Systems) were generally
not competitive with grid extension (particularly in the project areas) and hence preference to electrify the
areas identified by grid extension alone was justified.
3.2    Revised objective
In general the original objectives remained unchanged. However, though no formal revision was
made, the philosophy behind the take over of distribution lines from the parastatals was substantively
changed in keeping with the sector reform proposals which called for the unbundling of the power utilities
with particular emphasis in establishing separate licensed areas for power distribution. Originally, the
lines which were to be handed over from BPDB and DESA to the PBSs were basically to provide more
consumers to the PBSs, but without any clear principles of demarcation. Thus the original lists of line
hand overs still retained large amount of BPDB and DESA 'pockets' within a larger area belonging to the
PBSs. The objective of the hand overs finally accomplished under the project was to re-demarcate
distribution service areas along principles of rationalization of networks and service territories. These
principles have led to lower network development costs (in some instances estimated at a saving of about
20 percent) and better management of operations. A formal revision was not carried out due to the
uncertainty of the proposed rationalization in the context of resistance from labor unions of BPDB and
DESA. Towards the end of the project however, the Government was able to resolve some of the
differences and relatively large networks were handed over in keeping with the rationalization proposals
which have since been instituted.
3.3.   Original components
The original project scope included: (a) the establishment of four new PBSs including
construction of their initial networks and facilities (office buildings, etc.); (b) intensification of the
networks of seven existing PBSs; (c) expansion of coverage area in five existing PBSs; (d) rehabilitation
of networks handed over from BPDB and DESA in project PBSs; and (d) institutional improvements to
REB (including infrastructure facilities of new office building, workshop and warehouse). The network
development component consisted of 6,035 km of primary lines, 3,015 km of secondary lines, 850 km of
renovation of lines handed over from BPDB and DESA and 18 new primary substations.
3.4    Revised components
The project works closely followed the original quantities except for the extent of lines taken over
from BPDB and DESA which increased substantially from 850 km to 6,307 km. The new substations
constructed also increased from 18 to 20 and in addition six substations were augmented, and seven
substations (taken over from BPDB/DESA) were rehabilitated. The additions to the scope of work was
due to the rationalization principles developed during the course of the project (see para 3.2). The design
of network improvements was carried out efficiently after agreement was reached on the rationalization



3
principles. The system design department of REB reviewed all work plans regularly to ensure that
duplication of networks with BPDB and DESA was avoided as far as possible. The extra work was also
possible on account of the lower than expected costs which materialized during project execution. Details
of the works carried out by PBS is provided in Annex 7C.
3.5    Quality at entry
The quality at entry is rated as "satisfactory". There was no specific QAG review for this project.
The network development plans were well prepared at time of appraisal following REB's area coverage
concept (developed with co-financier, USAID) and detailed information on expected consumer
connections, including 'staking sheets' were available in most of the proposed works. Consideration of
off-grid alternatives was premature at the time of project appraisal.
4.    Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1    Outcome/achievement of objective
The main objectives of the project relate to increasing rural access and improving the
performance of the rural electrification organizations, REB and associated PBSs. A related objective was
also to rehabilitate systems to be taken over from BPDB and DESA. The achievement with respect to
these objectives in many areas is outstanding. In particular, two aspects stand out: the connection targets
by consumer category and taking over of BPDB/DESA lines.
(a) Increasing rural access and consumer connection targets: The consumer connections
achieved at credit closure (429,200 and 254,900 inclusive and exclusive of taken over areas respectively)
is substantially higher than original estimates (160,160). The targets were also exceeded in all consumer
categories although the highest is in domestic (67 percent and 175 percent over estimates inclusive and
exclusive of taken over areas respectively). The large number of industrial consumers connected (3,977
new plus a further 6,542 from taken over areas vs. an estimated target of 2,879) is also a good indication
of an improved consumer mix achieved. Similarly irrigation connections also achieved targets set in new
areas and recorded a 66 percent increase inclusive of areas handed over. The detailed connection targets
achieved is provided in the table below:
Consumer        Connection Targets        Connections achieved as of December 1999
Category           at appraisal
New      Renovation      Total       % achieved
1. Residential     129,653            216,791      140,066       356,857         275
2. Commercial       21,986             24,561        21,314       45,875         209
3. Irrigation        5,642              5,660        3,707         9,367         166
4. Industrial        2,879               3,930        6,524       10,454         363
5. Others                0              3,977        2,651         6,628
Total            160,160            254,919       174,262      429,181         268
(b) Taking over of BPDB/DESA systems and rationalization of service areas: Originally the take
over of BPDB/DESA lines was a minor component of the project with a limited target of 850 km. The
lines to be handed over were to be determined by discussion between BPDB/DESA and REB taking into
account the views of the parastatal staff who did not want to wind up operations in the associated areas.
However, this arrangement created considerable difficulties both for operational performance of the PBSs



4
and the technical planning of the networks. Operationally, PBSs were unable to introduce a different
organizational and management culture as well as appropriate consumer relationship if adjoining areas
were operated corruptly with consumers securing benefits without paying their bills. Moreover
technically, system optimization required that a defined geographic area be supplied by an integrated
network. With partial hand overs cost of networks were of the order of 20 percent higher than what was
achieved with a full rationalization. After much difficulty and opposition from BPDB/DESA staff and
some consumers who benefited from the previous practice, rationalization of the supply networks did
materialize. This meant that BPDB/DESA offices operating such 'pocket areas' were closed down and
the entire networks handed over to PBSs. With the resolution of these difficulties, the network losses of
the handed over lines which were of the order of 30 to 50 percent were reduced to about 15 to 20 percent
after full rehabilitation, which usually took about 12 to 18 months. Further reduction in losses is possible
and REB/PBSs are aiming to achieve a level of 10 to 13 percent losses after all consumers are
regularized. In some instances, REB/PBSs has had to face considerable resistance including law suits,
assaults on operating personnel, damage to offices and property etc. However, with time, it is expected
that the PBSs will gradually upgrade these networks to the operating perfornance level of their own
independent supply areas.
(c) Sectoral objectives: Although sectoral objectives were not specifically targeted in the project
preparation a number of important goals have been achieved during the project. Independent non-
parastatal power distribution authorities were established by the creation of new PBSs. With the
rationalization of networks achieved towards the latter stages of the project it has been possible to
establish reasonable supply boundaries for all of the project PBSs (in addition the same procedure was
emulated in may of the non-project PBSs). The project was carried out with substantial participation of
the local private sector. All construction works are carried out by private contractors. REB also carried
out specific programs to train local linesmen, wiremen etc. and these persons found employment in the
services of contractors, and in private house wiring. The PBS expansion plans were also prepared by
private retainer consultants. The latter were also responsible for maintaining a detailed record of the
network improvements and connections in suitable maps and drawings.
(d) Financial Objectives and Compliance with Covenants: Both REB and all PBSs have been in
compliance with the financial covenants throughout the life of the project. All audits reports have been
submitted within the stipulated time. This is quite notable as without exception project related audit
reports, REB's audit reports as well as audit reports of all PBSs (55 numbers by FY99) were regularly
submitted to IDA on time without any material issues being raised. This indicates the high standard of
financial reporting and discipline being followed by REB and the PBSs. The financial covenants of the
project related only to REB's performance and required REB to maintain a debt service coverage greater
than 1.5 and to limit administrative costs, interest and other charges on debt to 75 percent of its aggregate
income. Throughout the life of the project REB complied with these requirements. At credit closing,
debt service coverage ratio was 2.2 and administrative and other charges were 40 percent of income.
None of the PBSs have defaulted in their payments for the bulk supply purchased. This is in contrast to
the dismal performance in the collection of receivables by BPDB and DESA (the main power sector
distributors) as well as the inability of the newly established Dhaka Electricity Supply Company
(DESCO) to carry out similar obligations.
(e) Institutional Development Objectives: The project was instrumental in further developing the
high standard of performance maintained by the PBSs over a twenty-year period. In particular, a system
of performance target agreements was put in place in which the PBSs annually discuss and negotiate with
REB a range of performance targets (system losses, accounts receivables, debt service coverage,
consumer growth etc.). Employees earn their annual bonuses based on indices worked out on actual
performance against targets (all employees sharing in the overall performance of the PBS). The system
works well, improves the motivation of staff; there have also been instances of a salary cut instead of the



5
bonuses when performance was poor. Another significant aspect is the strong focus on training of both
private sector technical staff and REB/PBS staff carried out by REB. During the latter years, REB
significantly increased its training activities. As an example, trained linesmen increased more that
threefold from 300 p.a about five years back to about 1,000 p.a by 1999. This has enabled sufficient
technicians to be available to the local private sector to carry out the new construction/rehabilitation
works. The enhanced training also enabled REB to recruit staff needed to undertake the take over of
facilities transferred from the parastatals. Additional training facilities provided under the project will
enable REB to continue to carry out this work in the future. REB also carried out a review and revision to
its financial and cost accounting practices during the project with the use of consultants funded by the co-
financier, USAID. In addition, trial programs to computerize the PBS billing system are currently in
progress.
(f) Physical Objectives: The physical objectives (construction/rehabilitation of networks and
substations) were fully achieved. As indicated previously, the extent of rehabilitation works greatly
exceeded initial targets (6,307 km against 850 km) while the other components remained about the same
as estimated. In view of the rationalization of networks accomplished, the effectiveness of the physical
network improvements was also substantially enhanced. The additional work was made possible by
lower than expected prices. Installation of capacitors in the distribution systems have improved the power
factor to around 95 percent (covenant: greater than 90 percent). The original scope of work was also
completed within the estimated time frame while part of the additional rehabilitation works was carried
out during the extended period allowed to complete the rehabilitation of networks taken over.
4.2    Outputs by components
There are no specific outputs related to the project components. The components consist of parts
of the distribution system and as a whole they are able to meet the connected loads. The consumer
connections achieved is provided in section 4.1 above. Substantial loss reduction has already been
achieved in the networks taken over (considering the time required to rehabilitate these networks and
improve consumer behavior developed under the previous utilities). Further improvements are ongoing in
order to bring the performance levels of taken over areas up to the usual standards of the PBSs.
43    Net present value/economic rate of return
The project resulted in several outcomes ranging from the benefits of better household lighting
(higher quality of life, opportunities for study, extra household earnings) to more productive energy use in
industry and agriculture; these benefits are difficult to capture in quantitative terms without conducting
detailed surveys. The methodology used in the economic analysis is a simplified approach based on: (a)
the minimum lighting benefits for domestic and commercial consumers in comparison to kerosene oil
lamp usage (this method quantifies benefits only for the first 10 kWh per month out of an average of 37
kWh/m); and (b) opportunity cost of alternative diesel driven equipment for industrial and irrigation
consumers. Only new consumers connected to the new project PBSs have been included in the analysis
(benefits from consumers taken over have not been included). The E1RR computed on this basis works
out to 95.3 percent compared to 34 percent at appraisal. The net present value is Tk. 3613 million. If the
domestic and commercial consumer benefits are worked on the basis of estimated demand curves the
EIRR works out to a slightly higher value of 102.5 percent. For the PBSs with intensification and
expansion, the benefits attributed to the project consumers are not easily separated, but an approximate
computation leads to substantially higher rate of return.



6
A sensitivity analysis of the EIRR computation on the basis of proportionate reduction of the
benefit rate was also carried out and the results are shown in the table below. The EIRR value is quite
robust with a rate of 24 percent achieved even when the benefit rate is reduced by 50 percent. It is also
found that the EIRR is relatively unchanged for changes in load growth of future years.
Benefit rate as % of computed        100       90       80       70       60       50
EIRR in %                           95.3     85.6    74.9      63.2     50.5    23.8
It is also worth noting that a socio-economic study on the impacts of the Bangladesh rural
electrification program was conducted in 1995/96 (for PBSs electrified prior to this particular project)
under the auspices of co financier, USAID. This study provides a valuable insight on the substantial
impact of electrification towards rural transformation and development, and the consequent positive
effects on alleviation of rural poverty. It is also observed that the benefits increase with age of
electrification. The study is largely representative of the benefits to be achieved in the current project.
Some salient impacts assessed in the USAID study are detailed below:
(a)    average income is about 50 percent higher than that of control households in non-
electrified villages of which 22 percent has been attributed to be due to electrification;
(b)    poverty rate is the electrified households is 34 percent (and drops to 27 percent in PBSs
with longer service record) compared to 41 percent in control villages; Although
electrification has not shrunk the gap between the richest and the poorest (those with
means to invest is reported to reap richer rewards), the level of the lowest 10 percent of
the income group of electrified villages is much higher than that of the similar group in
the controlled households;
(c)    the recipients identified irrigation benefits as the greatest single economic impact of
electrification. Farmers prefer electric pumps and in spite of the on going load shedding,
70 percent have switched from diesel to electric pumps. Improved irrigation facilities has
also enabled more modem forms of agriculture in addition to greater extent of land under
cultivation. Modem Boro crop is the primary beneficiary of electrification (occupied 51
percent of cultivated land against 28 percent in control villages) and productivity rate is
reported to be 8 percent higher than in control villages;
(d)    off farm income is up by 33 percent compared with control villages and 66 percent higher
than non-electrified households in electrified villages;
(e)    households with electricity save 30 percent more money than non-electrified control
households. Correspondingly, they have greater access to credit which in turn has fueled
increased investment in economic activity;
(f)    commercial enterprises have benefited with longer working hours (up from nine to 14
hours per day) and are reported to have increased business tum over by 34 percent. They
also hire more employees and pay higher salaries;
(g)    impact on education of children is significant; 96 percent of respondents identified
electricity as having a significant impact, with longer study hours (assessed at two hours
per day), greater participation of women in children's education; 92 percent of children
(six to fifteen years) go to school compared with 86.5 percent in controlled households,
literacy rates are considerably higher (74 percent vs. 49 percent for males and 62 percent
vs. 36 percent for females);



7
(h)   television viewing has become widespread and along with greater use of radios (over 50
percent vs. 25 percent in control households). There is substantial improvement in
information access and more social awareness;
(i)    PBS lady advisers (who help with member problems and promote electricity usage) are
well known and perceived as a source of assistance;
(j)    health care in the electrified villages is reported to have improved; and
(k)   the conditions of women are reported to have improved substantially. They enjoy more
leisure time and also have more time for activities such as craft making and sewing.
Even incidence of violence is reported to have declined, perhaps as an impact of the
media role and security benefits (street lighting, more people awake during night time) of
electrified villages.
4.4    Financial rate of return
A financial rate of return was not computed at appraisal. The subsidy element required (by soft
on lending terms, low bulk supply tariffs and initial operating subsidies to PBSs) has been acknowledged
and justified on account of the high economic gains and the national importance in improving access to
rural areas. Accordingly no financial rate of return has been calculated in this ICR.
4.5   Institutional development impact
The project has achieved a substantial institutional development impact, a major focus in
successive country assistance strategies prepared during the project life. A performance agreement
system was introduced linking annual employee bonuses/penalties to a set of agreed performance targets.
The process generates considerable enthusiasm and has contributed to staff morale and cohesiveness.
Performance in handling the difficult task of taking over of lines from BPDB/DESA has been greatly
facilitated by this process although initially the staff has had to forego benefits and even face penalties in
certain instances. Another major impact has been in the area of training - both own (PBS and REB staff)
and private wiremen and linesmen. Without the improved training output it would have been impossible
to carry out the ambitious line take over program. The institutional development impact is rated as high.
5.    Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1    Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency
There were no significant factors affecting the project which were outside government or
implementing agency's control.
5.2    Factors generally subject to government control
There was considerable resistance to the hand over of BPDB/DESA lines and facilities to the
PBSs which prevented this activity from being done at the initial stages of the project. The Government's
ability to resolve these issues was weak in the context of strong unionized labor and opposition of
unscrupulous consumers who had previously benefited greatly at the expense of the utilities. Even after
the take over the relationship with BPDB, in particular, is not conducive to a smooth resolution of the
related issues. The PBSs are also greatly affected by the load shedding that has occurred over the past
four years or so. In spite of the fact that the PBSs regularly pay their bulk purchase bills, they are singled



8
out for excessive load shedding in view of the importance that the supply authorities place on the urban
loads. The inability to provide their consumers with an uninterrupted power supply has restricted the
PBSs ability to reduce system losses and enhance collections, particularly in areas taken over. The
technical losses also increase with load shedding carried out in the evening hours due to the nature of the
PBS demand characteristics.
5.3    Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
In general project management was satisfactory. Except for some delay in the contracts related to
the workshops and training facilities (including related equipment), the project works were carried out
expeditiously. The loss reduction and regularization of connections in taken over areas is a key aspect on
which greater focus is required. While it is excepted that considerable resistance is faced by the PBSs in
resolving this matter in a timely manner and that various efforts have been made, the use of a larger task
force in the initial period is essential in carrying out this difficult exercise. There were also a few
instances of procurement delays due to misunderstanding of IDA's procurement principles. REB has also
now carried out a number of IDA projects and should fully comprehend the standards and procedures
which apply to procurement eligible for Bank financing. As described in para 4.1 (d) REB ' s performance
in financial management was excellent as demonstrated in the audit reports and timeliness of reporting.
All PBSs also similarly maintained their financial records up to date and was ably supported by REB in
this aspect.
5.4    Costs and financing
Project financing aspects were satisfactory and there were no delays experienced on account of
counterpart funds.
6.     Sustainability
6.1    Rationale for sustainability rating
The project sustainability is rated as highly likely. The consumer connections has greatly
exceeded estimates and there has been a substantial handing over of BPDB/DESA lines in the project
areas as opposed to the small scale operation expected at appraisal. These factors augur for project PBSs
to become self-sustaining within a few years. The major portion of the line hand overs were carried out in
1999 and current indications are that there is a steady improvement in performance (loss reduction and
improvement of collections) amidst substantial resistance. Many PBSs have taken a conscious decision to
win over consumers to the cooperative spirit by information and motivation campaigns instead of forcing
confrontation. Another aspect affecting the sustainability of the rural electrification program is the
generation shortages presently experienced in the country and the unequal treatment meted out to PBSs.
This issues is expected to be resolved in about three to five years on account of the low cost Independent
Power Projects (over 1,780 MW has been either contracted out or are being processed). Further, REB's
own efforts to secure direct power supplies from small independent power suppliers (in the range of 10
MW each) has been successful, with three such contracts already finalized at costs comparable to the
price of bulk power purchase from BPDB.
6.2    Transition arrangement to regular operations
The formation of the new PBSs establishment of utility operations have been carried out
efficiently and the transition period is already completed. The large scale take over of lines and
consumers from BPDB/DESA has also been completed in the project PBSs, and in spite of considerable
opposition the institutionalizing of this difficult maneuver is substantially completed.

7.    Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1    Lending
Identification of the project components and analysis of technical, financial and economic issues
during project preparation and appraisal was fully satisfactory. It has been accepted that project PBSs
will need some time (estimated at five years in the appraisal) to become financially viable. At the time of
project preparation, sector reform goals were not being pursued by the Bank or the Borrower. Enlarging
the scope of responsibilities of the PBSs by rationalizing operational boundaries with the existing supply
utilities was also not considered to be of major importance. Further, alternative technical developments in
dispersed electricity supplies which could have effectively competed with grid extension were not viable
at the time of project preparation.
7.2    Supervision
The project was regularly supervised by IDA staff - 14 missions were carried out during the
Credit period. There were no issues related to significant deviations from Bank's policies and procedures
related to procurement, disbursement and other safeguard policies. Mid-way through the project, the need
to undertake substantive reforms in the sector became of increasing importance, particularly due to the
poor performance of the parastatals (BPDB and DESA). Accordingly, the network development
philosophy of the project was reviewed in the context of a possible restructuring of distribution service
providers. These efforts led to proposals to rationalize the distribution networks with the hand over of
'pocket' areas previously supplied by BPDB and DESA, to the respective PBSs. Although the initial
discussions proved to be difficult, ultimately it was possible to come to an agreement with the
Government and the sector entities to undertake an ambitious program of line transfers. The substantially
large extent of networks finally transferred from BPDB/DESA (6,307 km compared to the previous 850
krn) speaks to the success achieved in this respect. This was achieved in spite of the poor dialogue on
overall reforms and in the context of opposition from vested interests to retain the networks with the
parastatals. A detailed program of monitoring the performance of areas taken over was also arranged
with the implementing agency. Accordingly, IDA' s supervision activity is rated as highly satisfactory.
7.3    Overall Bank performance
Bank's dialogue with the Government focused on much more than the agreed objectives of the
specific project and a significant contribution to rationalization of rural distribution networks was finally
achieved. Accordingly the Bank's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4    Preparation
The Borrower prepared the project in keeping with the Rural Electrification Master Plan of REB
initially developed in the late 1970s and subsequently updated at various times. The individual PBS
development plans were designed on the basis of detailed surveys of potential loads including staking
sheets for network planning. The network plans followed REB' s concept of "Area Coverage" which
optimizes the overall development of a large area rather than piece meal network extensions that has
traditionally occurred in the grid system of the main sector utility. The borrower's performance in project
preparation was highly satisfactory.



10
7.5    Government implementation performance
Counterpart funds were available in a timely manner, as the Government was deeply committed
to the rural electrification program now in its twenty-first year. However, the Government was unable in
the initial period to resolve the issue of timely hand over of lines and facilities of BPDB/DESA to the
PBSs. The coordinating committee established in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
(MEMR) to resolve differences was unable to bring about a consensus for some time on various issues
that arose (nature and extent of the hand over, compensation to be paid and method of payment, collection
of pervious outstanding dues etc.). In many instances, the committee was also unable to enforce decisions
made and agreed between the parties. However, towards the end, the Government took some decisive
decisions and in the last 18 months of the Credit substantial line hand overs were accomplished. There is
however, still a number of issues to be settled, including requests by BPDB to have the lines returned
back to them. While tentative demarcation principles have been agreed to, final decisions on a more
rational basis is awaited to establish the boundaries of the various distribution entities to further the
program of rationalization commenced with this project.
7.6   Implementing agency
The implementing agency REB and the rural cooperatives, PBSs carried out project
implementation exceptionally well. No difficulties were faced in establishing the new PBSs, securing the
required staff and commencing operations. This is now a well developed practice and REB has shown its
competence in replicating the procedures in many parts of the country. The major training effort
regularly carried out by REB has enabled new technical staff to be made available indicating the
surprising depth of human potential available in Bangladesh if the correct policies are followed. The
exercise may be compared to the establishment of DESCO, a new company under the Companies Act
which was unable to institutionalize its operations for a considerable period and has accumulated
considerable unpaid arrears for bulk power purchase. REB has also set up a detailed monitoring program
on a disaggregated basis to ascertain the progress in the areas taken over (providing monthly information
of system loss, collections, consumer numbers, load growth, etc.) and is providing substantial assistance
to the PBSs in this difficult task.
7.7    Overall borrower performance
The overall borrower performance is rated as highly satisfactory. Although delays occurred on
account of the handing over issue, it should be noted that major changes were made to the policy of rural
distribution and the difficult task of overcoming resistance of vested interests in transferring networks to
the PBSs was finally achieved.
8.    Lessons Learned
The operation provides a good example of successful coordination between privately owned
consumer cooperatives (PBSs) and a government oversight/quasi-regulatory institution (REB). The
system has now gained considerable maturity which is demonstrated by the ability to replicate new
cooperatives and find capable staff in rural areas to man technical and management functions. The ability
to mobilize these cooperatives to take over comparatively large networks previously managed by
parastatals (BPDB and DESA) and deal with consumers who have been used to fraudulent practices
speaks highly of the sustainability of the system.



11
Another lesson to be learnt is the importance of training rural technicians (wiremen, linesmen
etc.) to strengthen the rural private sector to sustain private sector led construction work and to help in
widening the consumer base.
Major lessons could also be learnt from the loss reduction, rehabilitation and regularization
exercise underway in the taken over areas. However, it will be some time before the final results could be
made known and conclusions drawn on the success of various alternatives being followed by different
PBSs
9.    Partner Conmments
(a)    Borrower/implementing agency
The implementing agency, REB, has conveyed its agreement with the Bank's ICR. Key aspects
noted in the Borrower's evaluation are:
(i) good relationship as well as the trust and confidence developed between the Bank and REB staff;
(ii) procurement rigidity, delays and inflexibility of the Bank's procurement procedures;
(iii) customs clearance problems faced by REB;
(iv) successful implementation of projects depends on good communication between the donor
organization and the client. To facilitate this communication and the exchange of consistent views and
decisions REB recommends the designation of one or two staff as contact persons from the World Bank
Dhaka office.
(b)    Cofinancier's comments
The following comment on the ICR report was received from USAID: "We have reviewed the
report and find all the aspects of the project are well covered. We concur with the very favorable
assessment of the REB activities. There is no comment from us except that in the 'Other Financing'
footnote to Annex 2, the technical assistance and training costs met by USAID during that project period
were approximately $ 25 million. We don't have a figure for the Government contributions".

Implementation Completion Mission
Aide Memoire
An implementation completion mission for the Third Rural Electrification Project was carried out
from January 27 to February 5, 2000 by Messrs/Ms. Chrisantha Ratnayake (Senior Power Engineer), Md.
Iqbal (Energy Specialist), Surayia Zannath (Financial Management Specialist), Zafrul Islam
(Procurement Specialist), Saibul Huda (Disbursement Officer) and Raihan Elahi (Consultant). Messrs.
Mohd. Rafiqul Islam (Deputy Director) iMED, Ministry of Planning, Kamaruzzaman (USAID) and
James Ford (NRECA) participated in the discussions and deliberations with REB. A wrap up meeting
was held on February 5, 2000 at which this Aide Memoire was discussed. The Aide Memoire
summarizes the findings and recommendations of the mission and is subject to review and confirmation
by IDA management. The mission would like to express its sincere appreciation to the officials of the
Rural Electrification Board (REB) for their hospitality, cooperation and productive discussions during its
visit.
A. Project Implementation
Overall Implementation Status
A Credit of SDR 79.6 million (US$ 105 mnillion equivalent) was approved by IDA's Board on
May 1, 1990 for the Third Rural Electrification Project (Cr.2129-BD). The Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) and the Project Agreement (PA) for the project were signed on June 18, 1990 and
declared effective on April 15, 1991. The project provides for the electrification of four new PBSs', the
expansion of distribution facilities in five existing PBSs2, and intensification of distribution systems in
seven PBSs3 (originally established under IDA's First Rural Electrification project). A target of 160,000
consumer connections was expected to be achieved under the project. The Closing Date of the Credit
was extended from June 30, 1998 to December 31, 1999 to accommodate additional work associated with
the new line transfers that were carried out in 1998 and 1999 from BPBD and DESA. The final project
cost estimate is provided at Annex 1.
All physical works to be carried out under the project has been completed. New distribution
networks consisting of 6,011 km of primary lines (against 6,035 planned), 3,344 km of secondary lines
(against 3,015 planned) have been erected to cater to the expected consumer growth. The envisaged
substation construction/improvements exceeded planned targets with 20 new and six augmentations
being completed (against 18 new planned). In addition, in keeping with the concept of rationalizing
network development plans and avoiding duplication of investment among supply utilities, 5,620 km of
lines were taken over from BPDB4 and DESAs and rehabilitated (against 850 km planned). The
integration of the networks also resulted in 7 BPDB/DESA substations being taken over and renovated
(no provision for which was made in the original plans). The planned building construction work (REB

headquarters, workshop and warehouse facilities, and buildings for new PBSs,) have also been
completed. The project resulted in the establishment of four new PBSs and improvements to 11 existing
PBSs resulting in the provision of electricity supply to about 430,000 consumers' up to December 31,
1999, substantially exceeding original project estimates of 160,000 connections. The details of project
implementation status as of December 31, 1999 is provided at Annex 2.
Procurement
A total of 213 packages for goods, 37 packages for civil works and two packages for services have
been carried out under the project. Por goods, all packages have either been shipped or delivered except
for three items. For civil works and services, all contract packages have been completed. The mission is
please to record that REB's procurement practices improved over the project period. Some delays are
also faced due to limitation of REB's financial authority (presently Tk. 50 million) and the mission
recommends a suitable increase of this limit in view of the improvement of REB's performance in
procurement work over the years. An ex-post audit for contracts not subject to prior review by IDA was
conducted under an independent audit firm in 1998, covering the period July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1997.
Some weaknesses identified have been communicated to REB (e.g. delay in execution of contracts and
award of contracts through lottery). IDA expects to carry out an ex-post audit for the period FY98
onwards by March 31, 2000. There are certain contracts where the payment of 10 percent due at the
acceptance of goods are still due to be made. The mission informed REB that Credit disbursements can
only be made for payments due and payable (all conditions for payment having been met) by the Credit
Closing Date of December 31, 1999. With respect to the usage of materials secured under the Credit,
REB agreed to prepare a material reconciliation statement and indicate the extent of any balances. Such
remaining balances will be allocated for maintenance and improvement works in the project PBSs.
Training Facilities
The project objectives included the strengthening of REB's training facilities. Over the years,
REB has improved its capabilities in this area and the new facilities provided by the project will be
useful in further improving this important function. Since the PBS responsibilities and network coverage
increased considerably due to the recent large scale take over of BPDB and DESA lines, the need for
qualified technicians has increased considerably. To meet these demands, REB increased its output of
trained linesmen increasing the number of persons trained per year from about 300 in five years ago, to
1,000 linesmen in 1999. Without these improvements, it would not have been possible to accomplish the
large scale line take over carried out recently.
Disbursement
As of January 31, 2000, SDR 76.9 million (US$ 109.6 million) have been disbursed and a further
SDR 0.9 million (US$ 1.3 million equivalent) remain committed. Final Credit disbursement is excepted
to be US$ 110.5 with a possible cancellation of US$ 2.6 million.
Of these consumers 175,000 were previous consumers registered with BPDB/DESA.



Annex 7A
Page 3 of 5
Compliance with Covenants
The status of compliance with covenants is shown in Annex 4. REB is in compliance with all
major covenants. Credit covenants that have not been fully complied are ensuring timely supply of
power to PBSs by upgrading substations (DCA 4.03) and introducing load management measures
including time-of-day metering (PA Sh2-6). The former is outside the control of REB. In addition to
supply constraints at specific locations due to capacity limitations on the BPDB/DESA upstream
networks, there is substantial load shedding on a daily basis due to BPDB's generation shortages. These
supply limitations combined with the predominantly small scale domestic consumers served by the PBSs,
prevent the implementation of effective load management activities. Overall, the compliance with the
credit covenants have been satisfactory during the period of the Credit.
B. PBS Operations
As indicated in para 7 above, the extensive power supply outages is adversely affecting the
performance of the PBSs. The load shedding is also carried out in a disproportionate manner with a
greater impact on the rural consumers. It is estimated that approximately 125 MW of PBS load (of a
possible total of 400 MW) is not generally met during peak hours. The annual energy not supplied is
also estimated at 60 GWh per annum. A number of measures are being taken by REB to address this
issue to a limited extent. A new Rural Power Company (RPC)' has been established and a 2 x 35 MW
power plant established at Mymensing. Contracts have also been issued for three 10 MW independent
power plants (on a BOO basis). These new power projects will provide supply to some of the more
profitable PBSs. A further request for proposals for 10 MW power plants on a BOO basis is being
processed by REB. Recently, agreement has also been reached on equalizing the fuel supply price for the
new 10 MW plant to the same rate as supplied to BPDB.
The second major challenge facing rural electrification program is the need to reform
commercial operations in the areas taken over from BPDB and DESA, to secure consumer billing and
collections in a timely manner. Considerable number of lines have been taken over during the last two to
three years stressing REB and PBS's limited resources to meet the associated challenges. Many
connections in these areas are not legally made, the service connections (even for the legal consumers)
are in a dilapidated condition, and the consumers are not accustomed to a disciplined utility practice. A
major effort is required to regularize all connected consumers, change service connections, rehabilitate
the networks and develop consumer discipline in bill payment. The problems are further compounded by
the fact that PBS tariffs are higher than that of BPDB/DESA, and that load sheddings may increase after
the take over, thus, increasing consumer resistance. While these take overs are beneficial in the long
term in the interest of network rationalization and improved consumer mix for the concemed PBSs, the
challenges are formidable and unless a well-coordinated program is established in a timely manner, the
financial burden will be substantial. While some PBSs have shown commendable improvement of
performance in the taken over areas, there is still substantial work that remain to be done. Further, in
certain areas there is a stagnation in performance improvement (often losses remaining at around 20
percent and collections at around 85 percent for extended periods). Previous supervision missions have
dealt extensively on the associated problems and recommended suitable steps to effectively address this
issue (including the setting up of special task forces and bonus schemes). REB has already taken steps to

implement the special task force program. The mission recomrnmends that REB provides the highest
priority to address this crucial issue.
The overall performance of all PBSs with respect to system losses, collections and accounts
receivables is shown in Annex 5. System losses have gradually increased over the years and the current
average is 18.1 percent. As discussed in para 8 above, the deterioration in performance has occurred in
PBSs with a large share of taken over loads. The performance of a number of project PBSs have been
affected by this issue; these include Manikganj, Comila, Cox's Bazar, Narsingdi I and Chittagong II.
C. REB Finances
Audit Reports and Connected Issues. Throughout the credit period, REB has submnitted the
audit repots including those for disbursements made against statement of expenses (SOEs) and Special
Accounts (SA) in a timely manner, in keeping with project covenants. There are also no material issues
raised in the audit reports. However, a long standing difference of nearly 500 million Taka on loan
balances with GOB remain unsettled.'
Financial Performance and Compliance with Covenants. REB has been in compliance with
the project financial covenants over the full credit period. On the basis of provisional accounts for FY99,
the administrative costs and interest charges were 40 percent of operating revenue against a covenanted
75 percent. The debt service coverage for FY99 records 2.19 times against a covenant of 1.5. Relevant
ext,racts from REB's unaudited financial statements for FY99 are attached at Annex 6. Although REB
remains in a strong financial position (on account of its financing terms2 ) and has not lapsed in its debt
servicing obligations, the sustainability of the rural electrification program depends on improving PBS
finances (dealt with in the succeeding paras).
D. PBS Finances
Audit Reports. The audit reports of all PBSs (including non-project PBSs) have also been
submitted in a timely manner over the credit period and there are also no material objections in these
reports. The mission would like to commend REB and the PBSs on the mannier in which it has handled
accounting issues over the tenure of the project.
PBS Financial performance. The rural electrification program has been designed with certain
subsidies (operating subsidies for initial five years, bulk supply rate and soft on lending terms) included
in its financing terms. It is also expected that the PBSs should develop gradually and become self-
sufficient after a period of time. However, this development is slow in materializing and only about 14
PBSs operate at an operating surplus. There are also several PBSs (serving mostly domestic consumers)
which are unable generate a positive margin after considerable time. Of the four new projects, PBSs only
Comilla PBS II generates an operating profit. However, Manikganj and Cox's Bazaar are capable of
i     These payments were made prior to 1990 when REB was allowed a grace period of five years. In 1990, the grace period
for loans was increased to eight years on all loans (including those made prior to 1990). However, REB was not given the
benefit of nearly 500 million Takas that it had repaid prior to 1990. Although the Government conmmissioned Shilpa Bank to
prepare a reconciliation and adjustment of these pre-payments their recommendations have not been implemented by GOB.

generating a profit once the losses of the taken over lines are reduced. Among the project PBSs under
"intensification", only Narsingdi I generates an operational profit for the moment.
A review of the operational performance indicates that an improved consumer mix brought about
by the proposed rationalization of service areas and integration with "pocket" areas taken over presents
an opportunity to improve the financial performance of PBSs. However, to obtain these results it is
necessary to reduce losses and improve commercial performance in a timely manner. In addition, it is
observed that many line extensions are not justified considering the cost of alternatives, in particular
Solar Home Systems (SHS) for areas which have little industrial or irrigation loads. These twin
approaches of improving the operating performance of existing systems by network rationalization with
BPDB and DESA areas and providing cost effective alternatives (e.g. SHS) for areas that are not suitable
for grid expansion should form the focus of REB's plans for the financial improvement of the rural
electrification program.
Operations Plan
The mission discussed a draft operations plan (Annex 7) and REB agreed to finalize the plan for
operational phase of the project. Some of the performance indices and targets are still under review by
REB and these will be finalized shortly and communicated to IDA by end February 2000. A close
monitoring of project PBSs should be carried out with a view to achieving profitable operations within
the shortest possible time.
Implementation Completion Report
An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared in accordance with IDA's
guidelines for investment projects. The mission discussed the data requirements needed for the
preparation of this report and referred REB to its obligations on preparing the Borrower's Assessment.
REB was also advised on the items to be covered in this report (Annex 8). The report will be published
unedited subject to its limitation to less than 10 pages. It was agreed that REB will forward this report to
IDA by April 15, 2000.

Borrower's Assessment
(a)    Introduction
A Credit of SDR 79.6 million (US$ 105 million equivalent) was approved by IDA's Board on May
1, 1990 for the Third Rural Electrification Project (Credit 2129-BD). The Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) and the Project Agreement (PA) for the project were signed on June 18, 1990 and
declared effective on April 15, 1991. The closing date of the credit was extended from June 30, 1998 to
December 31, 1999 to accommodate additional work associated with the new line transfers that were
carried out in 1998 and 1999 from BPDB and DESA.
(b)    Project Objectives
The objectives of the project ( IV-A and Central facilities) as stated in the Staff Appraisal
Report were:
(i)    expanding existing distribution networks to unserved areas;
(ii)   rehabilitating system, which REB would take over from BPDB;
(iii)  reducing system losses;
(iv)   improving PBSs financial viability and institutional performance by increasing the
density of connections and modifying accounting practices; and
(v)    constructing a permanent Central facilities in order to save money in terms of rent and
creation of convenient working atmosphere for the employees. In order to achieve the
above objectives the modified/ revised project works included the following
components:
Part A
1.    Installation of distribution network in four new PBSs ( Manikgonj, comilla-II, Cox's bazar,
Dinajpur-lI) which covers 27 thanas of the country.
2.    Expansion of distribution facilities in five existing PBSs (Sirajgonj, Rangpur-1 Rangpur-II,
Kushtia, Meherpur) which covers 07 thanas of the country.
3.    Intensification of distribution system in seven PBSs (Madaripur, Barisal-II, Meherpur,
Chittagong-Il, Noakhali, Bagerhat, Narsingdi-I) which covers 28 thanas of the country.
4.     Rehabilitation of distribution lines and sub-station taken over form BPDB/DESA.
5.    Construct a permanent Head quarter-Cum training complex and workshop-cum central ware
House complex for Rural Electrification Board.
6.    Consultant services to assist REB in project engineering and construction supervision.

Part B
1.    14,931 Km of distribution lines will be constructed.
2.     20 nos. 33/11 kV sub-station will be installed, 5 numbers of 33/11 sub-station will be upgraded
under this project.
3.    2,53,828 numbers of different categories of consumers will be connected.
4.     17,336 numbers of villages will be electrified.
(c)    Design
The nominal sub-transmission voltages are 33,000 or 66,000 volts and nominal voltage for
primary distribution is 6350/11000 volts. The system frequency is 50 Hz. The distribution system will
be a multi grounded were design with the voltage being 6,350 volts to ground or 11,000 volts phase-to-
phase.
The source will be a substation supplied by a high tension line of 33,000 or 66,000 volts. The
substation transformers are connected delta-wye with the wye or medium voltage side solidly grounded.
4 to 6 three phase feeders will distribute power from the substation for a distance of some 10 to 12 km.
With single phase branch or tap lines taking off from the three phase line as required to serve single
phase branch or tab lines taking off from the three phase line as required to serve single phase
consumers. Single phase construction can be converted to three phase with the addition of a crossarm
and 2 phase conductors. These structures permit easy conversion of a single phase line to a three phase
line when such conversions are required.
The nominal secondary and service is 230/400 Y volts. The secondary distribution line will be
predominantly two wire, single phase 230 volt supplied through 6,350/240 volt single phase distribution
transformers of 5, 10,15 or 25 KVA capacity. The length of the secondary from a transformer will be
limited. Three phase loads such as deep tube-wells. Small industries, tea garden factories or others, will
be served by installing 3 single phase distribution transformers in a bank close to the load to be served.
One of the advantages of the single phase-Three phase rural system is its flexibility and
adaptability for future loads. Initially the system may be largely single phase which will be adequate
for the light loads anticipated in the early stages of electrification. The investment in such lines will be
minimum and should be low enough so that the cost of the system may be generated from the sale of
electricity.
As the load grows. selected single phase lines can be converted readily to three- phase lines to
meet the new load requirements. Usually, this "heaving up" or conversion process will be done on the
lines nearest the source. The more remote lines and branch circuits usually will remain single phase for
the life of the line. For ease of conversion, the system design must anticipate which lines may be
converted in the future. The pole sizes and spans are then specified for three-phase construction. In
this manner, the lines may be converted by adding additional conductors as required with a crossarm or
pole top assembly to the existing support.
(d)    Implementation
All physical works to be carried out under the project has been completed. The implementation
works of the project ( IV-A & central facilities) are given below:



Annex 7B
Page 3 of 8
(i)  New distribution networks consisting of 6239 km of primary lines have been erected
against 6035 km planned.;
(ii)  3572 km. of secondary lines have been erected against 3015 km planned;
(iii) The envisaged sub-station construction/improvements exceeded planed targets 20 new
and 6 augmentation (against 18 new planned);
(iv) In keeping with the concept of rationalization network development plans and avoiding
duplication of investment among supply utilities, 6307 km. of lines were taken over from
BPDB and DESA rehabilitated (against 850 km. planned);
(v)  The integration of the networks also resulted in 7 BPDB/DESA sub-station being taken
over and renovated ( no provision for which was made in original plans);
(vi) The project resulted in the establishment of four new PBSs and improvement to 11
existing PBSs resulting in the provision of electricity supply to about 4,29,181
consumers. substantially exceeding original project estimates of 160000 connections;
(vii) The planned building construction works (REB Head quarter with associated works,
training hostels workshop-cum-ware house, go-down) have also been completed. In this
regard 61,617 sq m. have so far been constructed;
(viii)  Since the PBS responsibilities and network coverage increased considerably due to the
recent large scale take over of BPDB and DESA lines REB has taken step to train
linemen as a qualified technicians. From 1994 to 1999 about 3782 persons participated
in the linemen training and out of them 2615 have been succeeded; and
(ix)   Consultant service is essential to assist REB in project engineering and construction
supervision. It has two part: a) Local & b) Expatriate 16 (sixteen) local consultants are
engaged in IDA financed project. On the other hand NRECA is providing technical
assistance for expatriate. About 4771.77 Lac Tk. has been estimated for technical
assistance and training purposes.

After testing and commission of 33/11 KV sub-stations, System Operation directorate of REB
taking over the charge for overall inspection, operation and maintenance. The capacity of 33/11 KV
sub-stations is 5 MVA/10 MVA which is constructed by using of 1.67 MVA/3.33 MVA, 33/6.67 KV
power transformer, 328/700 amps 11 KV voltage regulator (Regulating capacity 10 percent max) and
11 KV feeder OCR ( Oil Circuit Recloser). For energy counting each S/S has a programmable quantum
meter. The sub-station is feeding 33 KV source from 132/33 KV BPDB grid sub-station. The base
Voltage of domestic consumer is 230 volt.
System Operations directorate, REB is performing regular repair/maintenance work. During
operation some of sub-stations faced minor and major problem. In case of major break down of S/S
equipment each PBS is capable to restore power with 8 to 10 hrs. For sub-station maintenance work
there is a reasonable spare parts available in PBS store. The PBS substations are maintenance annually
by the representative of System Operation Directorate, REB. There are some specified form related to
sub-station (approve by REB ) to record the information of sub-station of equipment weekly, monthly
and annually. PBS preserves weekly information and System operation directorate, REB and PBS both
preserve month wise and annual information respectively.

The following parameters are constantly monitored for operating the PBS in good manner.
(a) System loss
(b) Load factor
(c) Inspection & maintenance of distribution line
(d) Preventive maintenance of distribution equipment
(e) Repair of damage Oil Circuit Reclosers, voltage regulators
(f)  Consumer hour outage
(g) Maintaining record card for transformers, voltage regulators and meters
Distribution line guy loosing, pole lining, service drop etc. are inspected on routine basis and
recorded in a specified form.
There are six to eight complain centers, two to three zonal offices in PBSs depending on
consumers and load basis. In case of consumer outage line crew keep record in register and nature of
fault etc.
The performance of the equipments installed in distribution line is satisfactory. REB already
getting benefits out of the component so far installed. Annex 1 (enclosed) shows the improvement
system Loss & increase in energy consumption of IDA financed PBSs.
Evaluation Of Borrowers Own Performance
The objective of RE Program is to ensure electrical connection towards the remote rural people
of Bangladesh. In order to implement this gigantic task REB and PBSs work together. During
implementation, it requires land acquisition to set up PBS head quarter and substations, right of way for
electrical distribution line installations. All these activities require harmonic discipline. To effect
timely implementation prior land acquisition, pre-qualification of installation contractors, ready logistic
supplies be ensured.
During implementation of the said projects, it was experienced that land acquisition is a
difficult hurdle to be crossed. Advance timely attempt for land acquisition even at times do not bring
result due to resistance of the land owner, therefore it needs to have legal bindings and support so that
easy land acquisition is possible. Due to the fact that REB employs pre qualified contractors and
training is imparted by REB to the contractors personnel has made it possible to effectively construct
distribution line, substations and REB head quarter buildings and therefore it is felt that pre-
qualification of the contractors and training of their personnel is an effective attempt towards the quality
construction.
Another major hindrance towards the project implementation is the natural calamities, flood,
rain, storms etc. Though it is very difficult to face natural calamities, yet it is possible to overcome this
kind of situation if systematic planning is done and farsightedness is applied. REB has a good way of
planning the sequence of steps of different phases of the overall works and they ensure effectively the
over-coming of hindrances due to natural calamities.
Logistic supplies is another important factor in project implementation. It requires good
planning in producing indents, tendering, its evaluation and shipment. It is experienced that some times
redtapisan at the donors end for the approval of procurement and delay in custom clearance stand in
obstructing the timely implementation. However, from the past experience, REB with the co-operation
of donor has established standard material specification, standard procurement practices for which
during past REB has successfully done the procurement and has ensured smooth logistics supply.



Annex 7B
Page 6 of 8
Under the rationalization policy PDB/DESA are bound to hand over its electric distribution
installations within the PBS geographical areas to the respective PBSs, thereby enabling PBSs to extend
its lines to the remote areas and also stops unnecessary investment by the way of installing duplicate
parallel lines. But in most of the cases PDB is reluctant in hand overing those lines for which normal
progress of project implementation is hampered. It may further be added that PDB has stopped
connecting REB substation through tapping from nearby 33 KV PDB lines, therefore forcing REB to
build additional parallel 33 KV lines which is a mere duplication and is considered to be wastage of
money.
Evaluation Of Bank Performance And Co-Financiers (During Evalution and Implementation Of
The Project)
Effectiveness of the relationship among the Borrower, the Bank, and co-financiers
During the course of the project a good and effective bond of relationship has been established
between the Bank and the REB. Over the time the mutual understanding has been strengthened further
and a cordial working relationship has been developed between both the sides. Due to mutual trust and
confidence built phase IV A and Central facilities project with financial assistance from IDA were
undertaken which reflects IDA's confidence on REB's strength and ability in implementing the rural
electrification program of the country.
(b)   Lessons learned
(i)    Contact Persons at Dhaka Office
Successful implementation of the project largely depends upon timely and efficient
communication between donor agency and borrower. As such one or two officers of Dhaka Resident
Mission should be identified as contact person in order to facilitate flow and exchange of consistent
views and decisions.
(ii)   Periodic Review and Reconciliation
In order to ensure proper utilization of fund, credit is granted for a reasonable period of time.
Disbursement of fund usually takes place evenly during the implementation of the project. It has been
observed that in absence of periodic review and reconciliation, at the end of the project it becomes very
difficult to identify the gaps between donor and executing agency. As such periodic review and
reconciliation is badly needed during different implementation stages of the project.
(iii)   Minimization of Document Approval Time
Timely implementation of the project is key to the success of the project. Sometimes much
time is needed by the donor to accord approval for bid documents. In addition, executing agencies are
required to submit voluminous papers for each contract separately. Requirement also varies from time
to time and contract to contract. It is therefore necessary that requirement for submission/repeated
submission of voluminous papers be reduced to a great extent to ensure timely implementation of the
projects. In addition, requirements for papers can be made uniform in all cases.
(iv)   Provision for Additional Payment in Price Adjustment Cases
Price adjustment clause creates additional complicacy. Because the amount to be paid to
suppliers remains unknown till the supplier claims it and subsequently accepted by the purchaser as



Annex 7B
Page 7 of 8
well as by the donor. On the other hand, Letter of Credit is opened by the purchaser for the contract
value only. As such Letter of Credit does not permit additional payment. Thus, payment procedure for
price adjustment clause, if at all remains effective, should be clearly spelled out.
(v)    Credit closing procedure
During long implementation period, change of personnel dealing with the fund usually takes
place in both donor and executing agency. In addition, expiry of credit requires some special procedures
to be followed by the executive agency in order to close the fund. Credit closing procedures also vary
for different lines of credit. It is therefore important that well acquaintance with the credit closing
procedure be ensured well before credit expiry date.
Plan for operational phase of the project
The PBSs established under the project have already gone into operation. Required manpower
have been employed. The concerned directorates such the PBS Management Operation, System
Operation, and Finance. Dte. are regularly monitoring their respective areas of operation.
Special emphasis has been given to System Loss and Accounts Receivable Monitoring. Some
other Key Performance Areas ( KPA) are also given special importance to improve the overall financial
condition of the PBS's through Performance Target Agreement (PTA) between the Palli Bidyut
Samities (PBS's) and the Rural Electrification Board (REB). This agreement (PTA) is a specific
guideline to assist and provide guidance in the prudent management of all the PBS's. The target will
provide the PBS's and REB with a reliable method for monitoring and controlling cost and activities of
the PBS's and thus more effectively guide them to become a financially viable organization. This will
enable each individual PBS to pay its Debt service Liabilities (DSL) and provide more reliable electric
service to its members at the lowest possible cost.
This, in turn, will enable REB and GOB to receive payment of the debts-owned on a timely
basis. REB is authorized and empowered to establish performance targets for each individual PBS.
REB considers mid-term review of the yearly targets and re-fixes them on the basis of 6 (six) months
actual performance and other related situations.
On the basis of target fixation all the employees of the PBS's try their best to achieve all the
targets given. It is also a motivational tool for the employees, which comprises both reward and penalty.
If the employees can fulfill their respective targets, they are rewarded with bonus, on the other hand
they may suffer penalty.
Under the Annual Performance Target Agreement (PTA) there are some targets and their
weight factors which controls the operational improvement of the PBSs. Out of them there are some
major criteria which play a vital role for each individual PBSs.
The target and their weight factors of the major criteria are given bellow:
1. System loss 12%
2. Accounts Receivable 2.0 months
3. Accounts payable 1
4. Consumer Hours outage (Hours) 30 Hours

Covenant Effectiveness
1.      The selection of covenants has been appropriate. However, the dates for submission of Performance Target Agreements between REB and PBSs, and the evaluation report on the performance of
the PBSs were not realistic and the covenants have been amended in July 1994.
2.      Only limited scope exists for load management (including TOD tariffs) in view of existing consumer characteristics and supply constraints.
