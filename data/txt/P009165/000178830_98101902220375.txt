REPORT AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO "VODOVOD DUBRDVNIK"-
PODUZECE ZA IZGRANDJU I ODRZAVANJE VODOVODA
I KANALIZACIJE-DUBROVNIK
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to "Vodovod Dubrovnik"-Poduzece za Izgradnju i Odrzavanje Vodovoda i
Kanalizacije - Dubrovnik, with the guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of US$6.0 million to help finance a water
supply and wastewater project in the commune of Dubrovnik. The loan would
have a term of 24 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 8
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in November 1972; its
report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" (R74-1) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 2, 1974. An economic updating
mission visited the country in October 1974 and its findings are reflected
in this report. Basic data on the economy are given in Annex I.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        The Yugoslav economy has experienced rapid growth and significant
structural change during the past two decades. GDP at constant prices in-
creased by about 5.5 percent per year and per capita GDP by over 4.5 percent
per year. Average per capita GNP is estimated at around US$900 (1973). The
number of people engaged in agriculture has decreased both absolutely and as
a percentage of the labor force, while the number engaged in industry and
services has correspondingly increased. However nearly half of the labor
force is still engaged in agriculture, most of it on small private farms.
Industry accounts for 23 percent and services for 22 percent of the labor
force.
4.        Two important features of the economy have been strengthened by the
recent constitutional changes. Self-management, whereby the means of produc-
tion used by different workers' collectives are given to them to manage, has
emerged as the fundamental right and obligation of every basic unit of orga-
nized labor in whatever sector. Second, the responsibility for most important
economic and social policy decisions has been delegated to the Republics and
Provinces. Against this background, Yugoslavia has placed increasing re-
liance on the market mechanism and the opening-up of the economy to inter-
national trade.



- 2 -
5.        The leading role in economic and social development has been played
by the social sector, which includes government, most enterprises ankd .itsUtu-
tions such as libraries, hospitals, theatres and schools, and which ee- cunts
for 85 percent of GDP and employs over half of the total labor force. All
the enterprises and institutions are under workers' self-management and re-
sources are under social ownership.    There is a private sector predominantly
comprised of peasant farms (with a 10 hectare limit on land holdings) and
small enterprises (with a 5 person limit on the number of non-family workers),
mainly in handicrafts, construction, trade, transport and tourism. In the
past the private sector has been relatively neglected by government policy.
However, the government has lately been devoting more attention to private
farmers with a view to accelerating the growth of agricultural production.
6.        Despite a policy of fostering accelerated growth in the less-
developed regions, major differences persist in Lhe levels of development
among Republics.   The more-developed regions are located in the north and
include 65 percent of the population.    But even this area includes sizeable
pockets of poverty, particularly in private agriculture. The less-developed
regions are in the south and are generally more mountainous and less densely
populated.   This makes agriculture and transportation more nifficult.    The
soutlhern regions are rich in minerals, coal and hydro-power generating poten-
tial.  The development of these resources has provided the major stimulus for
growth.
7.        Although the economy of the less-developed regions has been growing
at almost the same rate as the more advanced areas, per capita income has
lagged behind because of faster population growth (1.6 percent per year as
compared with 0.7 percent in the more-developed regions). Conseqquently,
regional inequalities have widened.    Average per capita GDP in the less-
developed regions now amounts to about 50 percent of that of the rest of the
country.  Yugoslavia's development policy aims at reducing regional inequal-
ities by transferring investment funds from the more advanced to the less-
developed regions. In 1972 these transfers amounted to almost US$300 million,
about one-third of the less-developed regions' total investment expenditure.
B.        In addition to significant regional income differences there are
substantial sectoral income differences. For example, per capita GDP in pri-
vate agriculture in Kosovo (by far the poorest region), is just over US$100
or about one-ninth of the natioaal average. Many private farmers there sup-
plement their incomes by working in the social sector but are, nevertheless,
unable to maintain an adequate standard of living.    Although incomes in
private agriculture are somewhat higher in other parts of thle counutxy, thlev
remain far below those obtaining in non-agricultural activities,
9.        Thus far, the employment situation in Yugoslavia has remained man-
ageable not least because of the sizeable temporary aigration abroad whiich,
since 1972 has stabilized at a level of about 1.1 million. Open unemployment
is estimated to be around 3.5 percent of the resident active population (mid-
1974), and in the private agricultural sector there is severe underemployment.
There is considerable public concern about the size and composition of. the



- 3 -
emigrant labor force. The Government expects that the economy has now reached
a level and momentum of development which should create an annual increase of
domestic employment exceeding the natural increase in the labor force and
policies are being introduced to encourage the return of skilled and educated
workers and those who have been abroad for some time. However, due to an eco-
nomic slowdown in major recipient countries, job opportunities abroad may de-
cline and migrant workers may return faster than intended with potentially
negative effects on domestic unemployment and on the balance of payments.
Recent Developments
10.       Rapid economic growth since 1968 was accompanied by inflation and
balance of payments problems. Many enterprises experienced financial diffi-
culties primarily as a result of over-zealous investment programs and a lack
of financial discipline. To counter inflation and improve the external pay-
ments position the Government, in 1972 and 1973, adopted measures aimed at
restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditure, temporarily
strengthening price controls, reducing the growth of personal income, improv-
ing the financial structure of enterprises and imposing limitations on ex-
ternal borrowing. In addition, to neutralize the inflationary pressure on
the balance of payments, the dinar was devalued by 16.6 percent in January
1971, and again by 18.8 percent in December 1971. Since July 1973 the dinar
has been floating. 1/
11.       As a result of these measures economic growth slowed from 8.8 per-
cent in 1971 to 4.4 percent in 1972 and 5.1 percent in 1973. Exports in-
creased during the same period at significantly higler rates than imports.
Aided by a sharp rise in workers' remittances (up 36 percent in 1972) the
current account showed a surplus of US$419 million in 1972, the first sur-
plus since 1965. A current account surplus was again achieved in 1973
($464 million).   Foreign exchange reserves increased from the equivalent of
about one month's merchandise imports in 1971, to nearly 4 months by the end
of 1973. There was no slowdown in the rate of inflation, however, and most
prices continued to rise at the rate of 15-20 percent per year through 1973.
12.       In 1974 economic growth picked up again (reaching an estimated an-
nual rate of 7 percent). This higher growth rate has been accompanied by a
rectirrence of the difficulties associ.ted with ripid growth, futrther am-
plified by the changes in the international trade situation. The pace of in-
flation is accelerating and the annual rate of increase in the leading indi-
cator--the overall producer price index--is approximating 30 percent. Li'ui6-
ity problems associated with the rapid increase of investment rate reappearing.
The balance of payments has deteriorated due to the coincidence of worsening
terms of trade, slow growth of commodity exports to countries in the con-
vertible currency area, and stagnation of real net exports of invisibles.
1/   On October 29, 1974 the Yugoslav Central Bank established a new inter-
vention rate of US$1.00 equal to Dinars 17.23, an effective devaluation
of 7 percent.



- 4 -
As a result, a current account deficit of about $1 billion is likely by the
end of the year, and the coverage of commodity import requirements by reserves
would drop to about two months, the minimum level acceptable to the Yugo.lar
authorities.
13.       The Social Development Plan for 1971-75 projected an average GDP
growth of 7.5 percent per year in real terms but it is clear that this will
not be realized. Even if economic growth in 1974 and 1975 reached that level,
average growth during the five years would amount to around 6.8 percent, due
to the slowdown associated with the 1972/73 stabilization measures. Given the
slow population increase this would still be rather high, and would compare
well with growth during the preceding five-year plan period (4.7 percent per
year).
The Energy Sector
14.       On a calorific basis 67 percent of Yugoslavia's energy needs in
1973 were met from domestic sources.   Domestically-mined coal remains an im-
portant source of fuel. Practically all thermal power plants are coal-fired.
About 39 percent of the oil consumed is of domestic origin. Yugoslavia gen-
erates more than half of its electricity from hydro plants despite the fact
that hydra capacity has been developed only to about one-third of its poten-
tial.  The shortages of electricity that are emerging are not due to the lack
of hydro generation potential, coal or oil, but rather to insufficient pla-nt
capacity and delayed construction. Yugoslavia maintains friendly relations
with nearby oil producers.
15.       In spite of Yugoslavia's relatively low dependence on imported oil,
increases in the price of oil are bound to affect the government's efforts
to improve the external payments position.   In 1973 oil imports amounted to
US$259 million, or 6 percent of commodity imports. For 1974 oil import pay-
ments will be of the order of US$900 million, at an average c.i.f. price of
US$100 per m.t. (US$13 per barrel), equivalent to about 13 percent of imports
of goods and services. The impact on the balance of payments will be to con-
tribute to a substantial current account deficit in 1974 and later years,
instead of the surpluses Yugoslavia has enjoyed recently.
16.       The indirect cuDsequences of the world energy crisis are unclear.
On the positive side the availa:oility of coal and hydropower resources should
improve the country's international competitive position, although their de-
velopment would require heavy investment with long gestation periods. On the
other hand job opportunities fo' Yugoslavs working abroad may diminish as eco-
nomic growth in Western Europe slows down. Returning migrant workers would
exacerbate unemployment and housing problems and workers' remittances, whiclh
have played a dynamic role in the economy, may suffer. Moreover, stagnation
in economic activity abroad could affect Yugoslavia's exports. Although the
rise in the cost of automobilc- and air transportation might have unfavorably
influenced tourism, preliminary data showing a successful 1974 season (perhaps
aided by the troubled climate for tourism in the Eastern Mediterranean) in-
dicate that it has not. These conflicting trends are being watched carefully
by the Yugoslav authorities and the Bank.



5-
Capital Requirements
17.       Yugoslavia is dependent to a large degree on imported equipment
for its economic development and the country has borrowed substantial amounts
abroad. Gross capital inflows have more than tripled during the last five
years, reaching US$1,186 million in 1973, mostly in medium-term commercial
credit. However, due to rapidly rising amortization payments, an increase
of US$746 million in gross inflows between 1967 and 1972 resulted in an in-
crease in the net inflow of only US$224 million. The growing discrepancy
between gross and net inflows reflects a shift, following the 1965 Economic
Reforms, from long-term official loans to medium-term commercial credits as
a result of the limited availability of official capital and the liberaliza-
tion of foreign trade and borrowing. The United States, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom have provided most of
the commercial credits. IBRD, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the USSR
have been the principal sources of long-term official capital.
18.       Until recently it was thought that muchi of the foreign exchange
needed to finance imports would come from the growth of exports of goods and
invisibles. However, the energy crisis and other factors make it doubtful
whether this source will continue to expand at its previous high rate and the
country will, therefore, need to maintain a high level of foreign borrowing.
Its gross long-term capital requirements are tentatively estimated at between
US$2.0 and 2.5 billion per year during 1974-79. Around US$500-600 million of
this may be provided in the form of official development assistance from bila-
teral and multilateral sources. The remainder will come mainly from foreign
banks and suppliers. Raising such large sums will be a formidable challenge,
but Yugoslavia's success in the past in obtaining the funds it requires from
the capital markets, and its continued good credit standing, give grounds for
confidence that it will be able to obtain the capital inflow required to fi-
nance its development efforts.
Creditworthiness
19.       In spite of the present unsettled international conditions, the
prospects for Yugoslavia's continued economic growth during the next decade
are good. The country's endowment of natural and human resources, its rela-
tively low dependence on imported energy sources, its pragmatic approach to
economic problems and its readiness to undertake institutional changes, cor,-
bine to give grounds for a favorable assessment of future prospects.
20.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as of Decem-
ber 31, 1973 was US$1,912 million. In addition there was US$2,407 million
non-public external debt outstanding. Total (public and non-public) debt
service payments in 1973 were equivalent to 19 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. With external borrowing projected at around US$2.5 billion per
year during 1974-79, the debt service ratio (public and non-public) is expected
to decline over the next few years then rise again towards the end of the dec-
ade. Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the measures



- 6 -
taken in the past to control balance of payments problems, as well as the pro-
spective growth of production and foreign exchange earnings, Yugoslavia remains
creditworthy for a substantial amount of Bank lending.
21.       Many of the high priority projects in Yugoslavia have a low foreign
exchange component due to the relatively advanced state of Yugoslav industry
and the competitiveness of Yugoslav contractors. Were the Bank to confine
its lending to the foreign exchange costs of projects, an adequate contribu-
tion to Yugoslavia's external capital needs could be made only by spreading
the lending over a large number of projects, including some of lesser prior-
ity. Therefore it seems reasonable to provide for some measure of local ex-
penditure financing in the Bank's lending program.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
22.       The Bank has made 31 loans totalling about US$1,015 million to
Yugoslavia. Of this amount approximately 50 percent (US$531.4 million) has
been for 12 loans for the transportation sector - six for highways totalling
US$180 million, four for railways totalling US$248 million, US$59.4 million
for the Naftagas pipeline loan approved in 1973 and $44 million for the re-
cently approved Port of Bar Project. Bank lending has generally concentrated
on infrastructure including, in addition to the transportation loans. power
(three loans totalling US$135 million), telecommunications (one loan for US$40
million), and three multipurpose projects totalling US$103 million. Nine loans
have also been made for industry, two for tourism and one for agricultural in-
dustries. This would be the second loan for Yugoslavia during the current
fiscal year and the first ever for a water and sewerage project. !FC has made
eight investments in Yugoslavia totalling about US$80 million.
23.       In the last few years delays in loan effectiveness have hampered
project implementation. To some extent delays are inevitable since the clear-
ance of loan documents involves all the Republics and Provinces in every case.
Conditions of effectiveness can rarely be met speedily regardless of how well
the ground is prepared. Yugoslavia has been continually evolving her consti-
tutional processes and the approval of a new constitution earlier this year
should facilitate a bett'r understanding of what is required to get project
implementation off the ground quickly.   There are encouraging signs of this.
Tlhree of the six loans approved .ii FY74 have already been declared effective
and disbursements have started under all three of them. But this problem will
continue to be closely monitored by the Federal authorities and the Bank.
There lhave been delays in the execution of several projects including the
Belgrade-Bar railway project and the Bernardin and Babin Kuk tourisma projects.
Since the Babin Kuk enterprise is helping to finance the proposed project,
steps have been taken to ensure that implementation of the Babin Kuk project
shall proceed on a satisfactor.y schedule in the future (see paragraph 53 and
Annex II). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC in-
vestments as of Oct.eher 31, 1917Z and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.



-7-
24.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are to accelerate
development in the less-developed regions of the country; to promote agricul-
tural development, particularly among the small private farmers by providing
basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm development, equip-
ment and processing facilities; to promote structural reforms in major sectors
of the economy through improved coordination and the strengthening of institu-
tions; and to provide Yugoslavia with long-term external capital and thus
help reduce the country's dependence on short-term external borrowings.
These objectives are basically the same as those which have guided Bank lend-
ing in previous years, but efforts to give special support to the less-
developed regions and the small farmers are being strengthened.
25.       Over the next two years loans envisaged for less developed areas
include power generation, urban pollution control (City of Sarajevo) and two
multipurpose (water supply/sewerage, power and irrigation) projects. Highway,
railway, power transmission and oil pipeline projects will promote structural
reforms in the transport and energy sectors. A high priority agriculture credit
project will assist small private farmers as well as social sector enterprises.
IFC is currently investigating several new investment opportunities to encour-
age joint venLures which would provide technical, management and marketing ex-
pertise as well as long-term capital.
26.       In addition to substantial assistance given in identifying and pre-
paring projects for Bank financing, the Bank is providing technical assistance
in several areas. A series of regional studies of the four less-developed
regions of Yugoslavia was initiated two years ago and two studies, covering
Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, have been completed. This series, when com-
pleted, will contribute to better assessment of development programs and will
assist in formulating development strategies for these regions. Other current
activities include assistance with a study on the Yugoslav capital market de-
signed to help improve resource mobilization and allocation, and assistance
for a training program for auditors of the Social Accounting Service, which
audits all enterprises and Government activities, including Bank financed
projects.
27.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia have averaged about US$100 million
annually in the last three years. Although this has represented only a small
proportion of the country's need for external finance, it has been equivalent
to almost one-third of the annual long-term official capital inflow in conver-
tible currencies. Even assuming that the level of Bank lending continues to
rise substantially during the next five years, the outstanding debt to the
Bank would remain about 10 percent of Yugoslavia's total external debt.
Service on Bank loans as a proportion of total debt service would increase
from 3.2 percent in 1973 to 4.8 percent in 1976.

PART III - THE SECTORS
Water Supply and Wastewater
28.       Water supply and wastewater disposal is the responsibility of local
communities in Yugoslavia. Public service enterprises plan, construct and
operate water supply and wastewater systems in the communes (the basic
political-administrative areas) or cities (two or more communes may join to-
gether for administration of large population concentrations).
29.       The Federal and Republic Governments are interested but not directly
involved in the sector. Increasing national attention is being paid to the
problems of water pollution and to the integrated development of water resources.
The authorities wish to preserve the relatively high quality of their coastal
waters and improve the quality of inland waters. Special attention is being
paid to the Adriatic Coast, the major tourist attraction in Yugoslavia. Sev-
eral cities along the coast are pursuing projects similar to the one proposed
here.
Tourism
30.       Gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism have risen from US$22
million in 1960 to US$630 million in 1973, an average annual growth rate of
about 30 percent. As a proportion of total convertible currency earnings,
tourism receipts rose from 3 percent in 1960 to 15 percent in 1973. Tourism
related employment has grown correspondingly. Since most tourist attractions
are in areas with few other employment opportunities, the beneficial impact
goes far beyond the foreign exchange earned.
31.       Eighty percent of Yugoslavia's tourists go to the Adriatic Coast.
The clear sea water, scenic coastline, mild climate and strong cultural
traditions attract visitors from Europe and North America. Dubrovnik is the
hub of this activity. It is centrally located on the southern Adriatic, is
easily reached by sea or air and has major attractions - a medieval walled
city, summer festivals and pleasant scenery.
PAR' IV - THE PROJECT
32.       Expanded water supply a.nd improved wastewater systems are essential
to service growing numbers of tourists and to preserve Dubrovnik's environ-
ment, especially the coastal waters. Tourist usage of Dubrovnik visitor
facilities grew from about 2 million bed-nights in 1965 to 3.6 million bed-
nights in 1973, an average rate of increase of about 7.8 percent per year.
Additional facilities are under preparation--including the Babin Kuk hotel
complex--and usage is expected to grow at an average annual rate of about 7
percent from 1973 through 1980.



- 9 -
33.       The current water supply system can be satisfactorily expanded but
major changes are needed in the wastewater disposal system. To avoid dumping
raw sewage in the sea through numerous small outfalls, many of which are near
areas frequented by tourists, the sewer network has to be renovated and ex-
panded, a treatment plant built and a proper outfall system installed. In
addition, new regulations are needed if the wastewater system is to be proper-
ly managed.
34.       In the Commune of Dubrovnik (which includes the town and surround-
ing coastal area) the enterprise responsible for the water and wastewater
systems is "Vodovod Dubrovnik" (or Vodovod). It would be the Borrower for
this proposed loan. Vodovod is autonomous in the day to day operation of the
systems but requires Commune approval of its charter and changes in tariff
rates. The Commune coordinates local enterprises, including Vodovod, con-
cerned with the general economic and social welfare of the Commune and may
order Vodovod to carry out public works at the Commune's expense. Vodovod is
technically well managed but needs to strengthen its financial management.
The Project
35.       The project was identified in October 1970 during the appraisal of
the Babin Kuk Tourism Project (for which the Bank is lending US$20 million,
including funds for feasibility studies of infrastructure, Loan 782-YU). Pre-
paration missions in May and September 1971 and in July 1972 assisted with
studies of the marine environment, proposed disposal system and alternative
layouts for the sewer network. The Project was appraised in May/June 1973.
After delays due to difficulties in finding a mutually acceptable date, nego-
tiations were held in August/September 1974 in Washington. The Yugoslav de-
legation was led by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary for Finance,
and included representatives of the Federal Government, the Socialist Republic
of Croatia, Commune of Dubrovnik, Dubrovacjka Banka and Vodovod.
Project Description
36.       The project is summarized in Annex III and described in detail in
the report entitled "Appraisal of a Water Supply and Wastewater Project for
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia", No. 356a-YU and dated October 9, 1974, which is being
distributed separately. It would comprise extensions and improvements to the
existing water supply system and major reconstruction of and minor extensions
to the existing wastewater system.
37.       The water supply component would include:
(a)  expansion of the main pumping station and installation of a
new water main,
(b)  construction of a reservoir at Babin Kuk, and
(c)  renovation and extension of the distribution system.



- 10 -
The wastewater component would include:
(a) modification to existing and construction of additional
sewers, including pumping stations,
(b) construction of a treatment plant and outfall sewer, and
(c) purchase of operations and maintenance equipment.
Project components common to both systems would include acquisition of land,
expansion of headquarters and hiring of consultants for design, procurement
and construction.
Project Execution and Operation
38.       Vodovod would execute the project with the help of consultants.
Final design and preparation of tender documents is currently underway and
site construction is expected to begin in mid-1975. Project completion is
expected by mid-1978. The components which will serve the Babin Kuk tourism
complex are scheduled for completion in mid-1976 to coincide with the opening
of that facility.
39.       Operation and maintenance of the expanded and improved systems
would be the responsibility of Vodovod. In order to effectively discharge
this responsibility Vodovod needs to strengthen its financial management and
improvements in the local regulations governing the use of the wastewater
system are required. A new Financial Director would be hired and Vodovod
would take steps to correct current weaknesses in accounting, outstanding
receivables and tariff rates (see paras. 43 and 44 below). -The Commune has
agreed that regulations governing the use of the wastewater system would be
effective not later than June 30, 1975, and a formal undertaking to this
effect would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (Recital
(I) and Section 7.01(c) of the Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
40.       The total cost of the project (including duties and taxes but ex-
cluding interest durine zonstruction) would be US$9.6 million.    Since Yugoslav
contractors are expected to win most of the bids, the foreign exchange compo-
nent would be only US$2.1 millioii or about 22 percent of total cost. Physical
and price contingencies would represent about 32 percent of the total cost.
41.       A Bank loan of US$6.0 million is proposed.    It would finance about
50 percent of total project costs plus about US$1.2 million of interest during
construction on the Bank loan. The loan would cover about US$2.7 million
equivalent in local expenditure. Under the decentralized Yugoslav system, no
Federal support is available for local investments. Scarce Republican funds,
rationed among all communities, can contribute only a small amount. The major
burden of financing this project thus falls on the Commune. The 60,000 resi-
dents of the Commune would contribute through the tax supported Commune Budget
and by paying increased water and wastewater tariffs. Founders (local enter-
prises functioning as shareholders) of the DtiJbrovacka Banka would forego dividends



- 11 -
to provide a subsidized loan. However, without a significant Bank contribution,
a viable financing plan for such a major investment by so small a community
would not be available.
42.       In addition to project costs of US$9.6 million and interest during
construction on all loans of US$1.3 million, Vodovod requires financing for
US$3.6 million of other capital expenditures in its investment program and for
increases in net working capital during the construction period. Thus, total
financing required between 1975 and 1978 would be about US$14.5 million. The
Bank loan would provide about 41 percent of thiese funds. The remainder would
come from loans from the Republic of Croatia and Dubrovacka ]anka (about 14 pu'-
cent), contributions from Babin Kuk, otlher enterprises and consumers and the
Commune (about 17 percent) and internal cash generation (about 28 percent).
The execution of undertakings satisfactory to thie Bank for the provision of
these loans and financial contributions would be a condition of effectiveness
(Recitals E, F, G, and H, and Section 7.01 (c) of the Loan Agreement). The
Commune has agreed to provide Vodovod with any additional finance that may be
required, and a formal undertaking to this effect would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Recital (H) and Section 7.01(c) of the
Loan Agreement).
43.       To meet the obligations of the project and secure its financial
future Vodovod needs to increase water and wastewater tariffs. The enter-
prise has until recently operated with low tariffs which resulted in modest
profits and declining rates of return and has carried large amounts of out-
standing receivables (equal to about four months revenue). The charges for
wastewater disposal do not cover the operating expenses for that service.
Capital investment has hitherto been financed with long-term, low-interest
loans which are no longer available.
44.       Vodovod and the Commune (which must approve all tariff increases)
have recognized the need for higher tariffs. In July 1973 water rates were
increased about 33 percent and wastewater rates about 25 percent. After dis-
cussions with the Bank, rates were increased again in July 1974--water by 20
percent and wastewater by 100 percent. Further increases of about 75 percent
for water and another 100 percent for wastewater will be needed by 1979, when
the project would become operational and the full impact of the additional
debt would be felt. The Bank has recommended a program of annual tariff in-
creases through 1979 which would meet these requirements and would Drovide
additional cash generation for project investments during the construction
period. Vodovod and the Commune's acceptance of this recommendation is re-
flected in their agreement to set tariffs sufficiently high to generate funds
for construction equal to 4 percent of the gross value of Vodovod's utility
plant, including work in progress, during construction and to maintain a rate
of return on fixed assets in operation of at least 6 percent after the project
becomes operational (Loan Agreement Section 5.05). To obtain a more accurate
reflection of the rate of return, the depreciation rate on major fixed assets
would be increased from 1.5 to 2.0 percent (Loan Agreement Section 5.07).
Vodovod also agreed to use their best efforts to reduce outstanding receivables
to no more than 2.5 months revenue and to keep additional debt within limits
(Loan Agreement Sections 5.04 and 5.06).



- 12 -
45.       The new wastewater charges would allow Vodovod to cover the full
operating costs of that service from its own revenue. The new water charges
would generate sufficient revenue to cover water supply costs and provide the
additional funds needed to meet the enterprise's overall rate of return require-
ments. Because Vodovod supplies virtually every household and enterprise in
the Commune with water, but not all use the wastewater service, some indirect
costs of wastewater service would thus be borne by the water consumers. In
this way virtually all residents would participate in the indirect cost of a
cleaner environment.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Contracts for the supply and installation of equipment and for civil
works expected to cost more than US$100,000 would be put to tender on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement".   A margin of preference for local equipment
mianufacturers of 15 percent or customs duty, whichever is lower, would be
used for bid comparison. Contracts expected to cost less than US$100,000
would be let according to the Borrower's usual procurement procedures which
are considered satisfactory. Vodovod would carry out by force account minor
works such as renovations and modifications to the existing water and sewer
networks. The total value of such minor works is expected to be less than
10 percent of the project cost.
47.       Major supply and civil works contracts are expected to be won by
Yugoslav firms; contracts for some specialized equipment for the treatment
plant and pumping stations would probably be placed witlh foreign subcontrac-
tors.
48.       Tihe proposed Bank loan would be disbursed to finance the c.i.r.
cost of imported equipment; the ex-factorv cost of locally manufactured equip-
ment; 100 percent of the cost of consultants; 35 percent of all civil works
contracts; and interest during construction. The percentage relating to civil
works contracts would be adjusted as necessary to provide continuous Bank dis-
bursements over the implementation period of the project.
Audit
49.       Vodovod's accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting Serv-
ice (SAS), an autonomous govermniiental agency responsible for financial in-
spection of Yugoslav economic enterprises. It audits all Bank financed proj-
ects in Yugoslavia. SAS started a training program in January 1974 under
which its staff are being trained by Coopers and Lybrand of the U.K. in audit-
ing methiods consistent witn internationallv-accepted requirements.   Since it
is likely to be some time before it will be possible to fully realize the
objectives of the pro,ram, Vodovod gave the Bank informal assurances it would
engage other auditors if SAS is unable to achieve a consistent and satisfactory
standard of auditing.

Justification
50.       Tourism is an important sector in the Yugoslavia economy.    It gen-
erates incomes in areas with few other employment opportunities, finances
(through taxation) local social and economic investments, and earns sizeable
amounts of foreign exchange (about 15 percent of total exports of commodities
and services in 1973). As a national leader in attracting tourists, Dubrovnik
not only develops itself through tourism but also contributes to national
development.
51.       Dubrovnik needs adequate water supply and wastewater infrastructure
to continue to attract growing numbers of tourists. Tourism is highly sen-
sitive to environmental conditions. In 1972, for example, a smallpox epidemic
in Kosovo--about 150 km from Dubrovnik--caused Dubrovnik's visitor level to
drop by 7 percent while before then it had been growing every year. If
Dubrovnik's water supply system does not keep pace with growing demand and if
wastewater is not properly disposed of, the environment will be degraded and
tourism will suffer.
52.       The project represents the least cost solution to providing potable
water and disposing of wastewater. Institutional reforms to help maintain
adequate water and wastewater systems in the future would be promoted. With
the agreed tariff structure, the economic rate of return for the water supply
investments would be a minimum of 10 percent. The benefits of the wastewatet
disposal system cannot be so precisely quantified--they wouldi he foundt in clear
harbors and beach waters, less noxious odors, reduced risk of epidemic disease,
and, most importantly from an economic viewpoint, in continued flows of tourists.
53.       About 5 percent of the proposed water and wastewater facilities
would directly serve the Babin Kuk complex, and about US$1.6 million of the
financial requirements for this project would be provided by the Babin Kuk
enterprise. The Babin Kuk project, as reported in Annex II, has been scaled
down drastically in view of the approximately 100 percent increase in con-
struction costs over the estimates at the time of appraisal. I have separately
sought your agreement to the amendment of Loan 782-YU to reflect the scaling-
down of the Babin Kuk project. In the unlikely event that any shortfall in
financing for the proposed project resulted from any failure on cie part of
the Babin Kuk enterprise to honor its commitments, the commune would be res-
ponsible for covering the shortfall.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft loan agreement between the Bank and "Vodovod Dubrovnik"-
Poduzece za Izgradnju i Odrzavanje Vodovoda i Kanalizacije Dubrovnik, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(-ii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
above loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 14 -
55.       Provisions of the Loan Agreement of special interest were noted in
paragraphs 39, 42 and 44.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXtECUTION 1/
Loan 531 Belgrade-Bar Railway:   US$50.0 million Loan of Mlarch 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The completion of this project was originally scheduled for 1973
but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in mountainous terrain
are expected to delay operation of the line at least until 1976. The Closing
Date has been postponed from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $290.0 million.    There is at present a
financing gap of about $35 million. The Federal Government and the Republican
Governments of Serbia and Montenegro have already taken some measures to close
this gap so that financing for all the works to be carried out in 1974, as
well as part of works in 1975, is identified. The necessary financing for
the balance of work to complete the project is expected to be secured in the
course of 1975.
Loan 654 Industrial Projects - 1970: US$18.5 million Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974.
All three sub-projects under the loan have been substantially com-
pleted. The Closing Date was postponed from June 30 to December 31, 1973,
to allow payments of 10 percent retention money under already concluded con-
tracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak, and a second time on December 28, 1973 by
seven months to July 31, 1974, to allow final disbursements of guaranteed
payments. The disbursements have been substantially completed and the remain-
ing balance is expected to be cancelled.
Loan 657 Telecormunications:   US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Delays in civil works have occurred which will delay completion of
the project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite sta-
tion, only preliminary works have been completed.   A cost overrun for orders
already placed amounting to US$5.1 million, is expected due to currency reval-
uations. Following a revision of the disbursement schedule, disbursements
are now in line with the revised projections.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 678 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
After an initial delay of about one vear in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica section because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily and six of the nine sections
have been substantially completed. However, due to delays on the remaining
sections, the Closing Date has been postponed from June 30, 1974 to December
31, 1975.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. On the basis of a re-
vised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 the disbursement
percentage was revised from 43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Dis-
bursement is proceeding in line with the revised projection.
Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions
for effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory
progress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost esti-
mate is expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised on the
basis of more accurate revised cost estimates. Disbursements under the loan
are about one year behind the appraisal estimate.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date; June 30, 1976.
There have been delays in implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective, appointing consultants, providing the
necessary infrastructure and approvals by local authorities. As a result
disbursements are behind schedule. Bids received in July 1974 indicate that
the project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately 100 percent over the originally estimated cost of
IrSS25.6 million. This increase is mainly due to rapid inflation in construc-
tion costs. After discussions with the Bank the project sponsors have proposed
a complex containing some 1,616 beds.   The total cost would be US$35.8 million,
requiring additional financing of about US$10 million. Financing for the
revised project has been arranged and, subject to the agreement of the Execu-
tive Directors to the Bank continuing to disburse under this loan, construc-
tion would start shortly.
Loan 777 Ibar Multipurpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However, the
responsible agency, the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project. It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year later
than originally planned). Disbursements are proceeding in line with the re-
vised schedule.



ANNEX II

Loan 782 Babin Kuk Tourism: US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
There have been delavs in the implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants. According-
ly disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problems have now been
largely resolved, the prolect is almost two years behind schedule. Bids for
civil works and estimates for other components indicate that the project would
cost at least twice as much as originally estimated (US$49.9 million). This
increase is largelv due to rapid inflation in construction costs. After dis-
cussions with the Bank the project sponsors have proposed a complex contain-
ing some 2,034 beds. The total cost would be US$51.5 million requiring addi-
tional financing of about US$1.6 million. Financing for the revised project
has been arranged and, subject to the agreement of the Executive Directors to
the Bank continuing to disburse under this loan, construction would start
shortly.  Provisions for a US$1.6 million contribution to the Dubrovnik W4ater
and Wastewater Infrastructure project are included in the financing plan for
Babin Kuk.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project execution is about one year behind schedule mainly
because of coordination difficulties and inherent delays in reaching agree-
ment among 12 borrowers. All main contracts have now been awarded and manage-
ment consultants are expected to commence work soon to help improve planning,
operation and management of the interconnected power system.    Disbursements
are proceeding in line with the revised schedule.
On July 10, 1974 an Accession and Amending Agreement was signe:d
between the Bank and the eleven original borrowers, JUGEL and electric power
enterprise OSIJEK, allowing the latter to become the twelfth borrower.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia):    US$31 million Loan of Hlay 25, '1"973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan became effective on November 28, 1973.    A recent super-
vision mission found continued strong credit demand with many credit appi,-
cations already received.   Stopanska Banka has already granted numerous smail
subloans and appraisals of several large subloans have been submitted to the
Bank for approval. Disbursements are on schedule.
Loan 916 Naftagas Pipeline:   US$59.4 million Loan of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: June 310, 1977.
This loan became effective on Yiarch 22, 1974, after about fouc
months' delay. Bids received on pipes and equipment exceeded appraisal es-
timates and civil works costs have increased so that project costs are now
about 93 percent above the appraisal estirmate.   Additional local finance for
civil works is being arranged but little additional foreign finance for pipes

and equipment is available. Discussions are in progress with the Borrower to
trim the project of its less essential items and to revise the implementation
schedule for the reduced project.
Loan 947 Kikinda Iron Foundry: US$14.5 million Loan of November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
This loan was declared effective on May 28, 1974 after four months
delay, which was primarily due to the extra time required for the ratification
of the Guarantee Agreement by the Federal Assembly. The implementation of the
project is proceeding on schedule.
Loan 966 FOB Iron Foundry: US$15.0 million Loan of February 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This loan became effective on May 28, 1974, as scheduled. The im-
plementation of the project is proceeding on schedule. Disbursements have
just started.
Loan 965 IUlT Tractor: US$18.5 million Loan of February 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This loan became effective on June 11, 1974 after two weeks delay.
The implementation of the project is proceeding on schedule.

Procurement:         Contracts for the supply and installation of equipment
and for civil works expected to cost more than US$100,000
would be put to tender on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
"Guidelines for Procurement". A margin of preference
for local equipment manufacturers of 15 percent or
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be used for
purposes of bid comparisons. Contracts expected to cost
less than US$100,000 would be let according to the Bor-
rower's usual procurement procedures which are considerec
satisfactory. Vodovod would carry out by force account
minor works such as renovations and modifications to the
existing water and sewer networks. The total value of
such minor works is expected to be less than 10 percent
of the project cost.
