APPRAISAL OF
DUBROVNIK WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Dubrovnik is on the attractive Adriatic Coast, focal point of
Yugoslavia's tourism industry. The town is the country's oldest and best
known international resort, relying increasingly on tourism for its liveli-
hood. Investments in hotel superstructures have recently been substantial
and are expected to grow even larger with construction of the Babin-Kuk
tourism complex, which the Bank is helping to finance. Investments in basic
infrastructure, particularly water and wastewater systems, have not kept pace,
however, with investments in hotel superstructures. The existing water sup-
ply system, basically sound and capable of serving present demand, needs
modest improvement through expansion to accommodate expected increases in
demand. The existing wastewater system is inadequate and needs fundamental
action to improve drainage in the town and to avoid increased pollution of
local waters.
ii.       Vodovod Duhrovnik-Poduzece Za Izgradnju I Odrzavanje Vodovoda i
Kanalizacije Dubrovnik (Vodovod), the local enterprise responsible for water
supply and wastewater systems in Dubrovnik, engaged groups of consultants who
prepared separate master plans and feasibility studies for improving the sys-
tems. Through the water supply component Vodovod will continue to provide
safe and reliable water by means of an increase in pumping capacity and the
extension and improvement of the distribution system. Through the larger
wastewater component of the project Vodovod will renovate and extend Dubrovnik's
existing system, eliminating pollution and ensuring preservation of town and
.arine environments through a comprehensive system of sewers, pumping stations,
treatment and disposal facilities.
iii.      The project will cost US$9.6 million, of which US$2.1 million will
be for the water supply system and USS7.5 million for the wastewater system.
Vodovod would borrow USS6.0 million from the Bank to cover US$4.8 million of
the cost, plus US$1.2 million of the interest during construction. The loan
will finance foreign exchange costs of about US$3.3 million, including in-
terest during construction, and local costs of about US$2.7 million. The
remaining US$3.6 million, together with US$4.9 million required to cover the
balance of Vodovod's investment program will be financed through: loans from
the Republic of Croatia Water Fund and the Bank of Dubrovnik; contributions
from the Babin-Kuk Hlotel Enterprise, other enterprises, and consumers; a grant
from the Dubrovnik Commune; and internal cash generation from Vodovod.
iv.       Preliminary designs for botlh systems were prepared by Yugoslav con-
sultants. Contracts for supply and installation of equipment and for civil
works expected to cost more than US$100,000 will be put to tender on the basis



- ii -
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guide-
lines for Procurement". For locally manufactured equipment, a preference mar-
gin of 15% or customs duty, wqhichever is lower, is proposed. All major equip-
ment supply and civil works contracts are expected to be won by Yugoslav firms;
contracts for specialized equipment for the treatment plant and pumping sta-
tions, may be placed with foreign subcontractors. Civil works are expected
to begin in 1975 and to be completed by the middle of 1978. Vodovod will be
responsible for carrying out the project. Consultants will be needed to as-
sist in final design, procurement, and construction supervision.
v.        Vodovod's financing policy must be directed toward reform from a
low-growth institution relying on soft loans and charging modest tariffs into
an institution capable of expanding its systems extensively to meet increasing
tourist demands and to provide much of the necessary finance through its own
resources. The Bank loan is intended to assist Vodovod in such reform. To
meet requirements for cash, rates of return, and future capital expenditures,
Vodovod's low tariffs will have to be raised regularly so that in four years
water charges will be about 75% higher than at present and wastewater charges
about double present levels.
vi.       Because tourism is highly competitive and extremely sensitive to
environmental degradations, Dubrovnik's water supply and wastewater systems
must be improved so that the town's share in the tourism market is not jeo-
pardized. The Commune, with its small resident population, has indicated
the significance it attaches to the project by its willingness to bear locally
the full financial consequences. The modest improvement of the water supply
system through expansion is the least cost solution to meet increasing demands.
The extensive improvement of the wastewater arrangements is similarly the
least cost solution chosen from various alternatives for collection and dis-
posal. Tariffs for both services will be progressively increased so that,
by 1978, water tariffs will cover long-run marginal costs and overall rev-
enues will generate a reasonable proportion of funds needed for future fur-
ther expansion of either service.
vii.      Agreement having been reached during negotiations with Vodovod on
certain issues, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.0 million to
Vodovod for a 24-year term, including 4 years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
DUBROVNIK TWATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
requested a Bank loan of US$6.0 million to help finance an infrastructure
project for the town of Dubrovnik, costing (including interest during construc-
tion) US$10.9 million. This Bank investment in the water supply sector in-
volves extensions to the existing water supply system and construction of a
comprehensive wastewater system. "Vodovod Dubrovnik" -Poduzece Za Izgradnju
I Odrazznivrej Vodovoda i Kanalizacije Dubrovnik (Vo(dovod, or Dubrovnik Water
and Wastewater Enterprise), a local enterprise which is responsible for water
and wastewater facilities throughout the Dubrovnik Commune 1/, will be the
project entity and the borrower.
1.02      Dubrovnik, on the Adriatic coast in southern Croatia, is the coun-
try's oldest and best-known international resort. It is the site of the pro-
posed Babin Kuk tourism complex, a project for whiich the Bank made a loan of
US$20 million in 1971 (782-YU). When this loan was made the Government under-
took that infrastructure necessary for the town would be completed before the
Babin Kuk project become operational. Funds were provided in this loan to
help finance studies of the infrastructure necessary to support the tourism
development. The first Bank reconnaissance of infrastructure in Dubrovnik
was carried out in October 1970, during the appraisal of the tourism project.
As this mission concluded that reinforcement of the existing water supply
and wastewater systems would be required, several missions have subsequently
visited Dubrovnik to help in project preparation.
1.03      Because tourism facilities are expected to expand along the coast
north of Dubrovnik to meet demand and because water supply will be needed
to support this expansion, Vodovod engaged, in 1970, Yugoslav consultants
(Inzenjerski Projektni Zavod of Zagreb) to complete a master plan and feasi-
bility study for a regional water system. The consultant's report proposed
a system, based on the Dubrovnik River as the source, which would include
pipelines and pumping stations to transmit water northwest along the coast
past Slano to Ston (see Map 1). Undersea pipelines would supply the islands
of Kolucep, Lopud, Sipan, Jacklan, and Mljet. This regional system, which
would be built in four stages, was estimated in 1970 to cost US$20 million
equivalent. When major tourism developments proceed in tihis region Vodovod
will have the plans to construct the necessary infrastructure. To date, how-
ever, this regional system has not been required.
1/   A Commune, in Yugoslavia, is an administrative area.  The Dubrovnik
Commune covers Dubrovnik town and its surrounding communities. In this
report, unless otherwise specified, the expression "Dubrovnik" refers
to the town and "Dubrovnik Commune" or "the Commune" to either the ad-
ministrative area or its responsible governing authority.



-2-
1.04      Yugoslav consultants (Projekt Sarajevo) had been engaged by Vodovod,
before the Bank became involved, to prepare a master plan and feasibility study
for a wastewater system for Dubrovnik. As this study progressed Bank missions
suggested the need for more information on the marine environment, the proposed
disposal system and alternative layouts for the sewer network based on differ-
ent treatment plant locations. Accordingly in the summer of 1971 the Insti-
tute of Oceanography and the Hydrographic Institute of the Yugoslav Navy,
both from Split, completed extensive hydrographic and oceanographic investi-
gations of possible disposal sites. Vodovod then engaged additional consul-
tants, the Institute of Civil Engineering Faculty of the University of Zagreb,
to review Projekt Sarajevo's work in the light of the marine investigations
and to finalize a master plan based on consideration of alternative systems.
The Institute's preliminary report was completed in August 1972.
1.05      An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. B. Grover and D.C. Jones
visited Dubrovnik in May-June 1973. Mr. Jones returned briefly in September
1973 to discuss financial aspects and both officers again briefly visited
Dubrovnik in June 1974. This report is based on information obtained by
the missions and provided by Vodovod, the consultants involved, and Dubrovnik
Commune.
II. ThE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
2.01      The water supply sector in Yugoslavia is not organized at the Fed-
eral or Republic level. Individual communities are generally responsible for
their own water supply and associated wastewater facilities. In most instances,
enterprises serving the communes plan, construct and operate these facilities.
Vodovod is the responsible enterprise for Dubrovnik Commune.
2.02      Increasing attention is being paid in Yugoslavia to the problems
of water and air pollution, and to the integrated development of the water
resources. The authorities wish to preserve and enhance the relatively high
qualitv of their coastal waters, to improve the quality of inland waters by
construction of flow regulating structures and waste treatment facilities,
and to reduce the severe air pollution encountered in certain cities and
industrial centers. Examples of other projects in the sector with which
the Bank is involved are the:
(a) Ibar multipurpose water project in Kosovo, for which the
Bank lent US$45 million in 1971 (Loan 777-YU). The Kosovo
authorities are to undertake studies to find means of re-
ducing water and air pollution from the major industries
to which the project will supply water;
(b) proposed pollution control project in Sarajevo, which will
include facilities to improve water supplies and to reduce
water and air pollution.
2.03      Efforts to improve water supplies and wastewater facilities have
been particularly strong along the Adriatic Coast, principal focus for tourism



- 3 -
in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs wish to preserve and enhance this very attractive
environment, which is generallv unspoiled by any large scale industrial devel-
opment or population concentration. 1/ Wastewater projects similar to that
proposed for Dubrovnik are in various stages of design and construction at
the coastal cities of Split, Herceg Novi and Budva.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A.   Background
3.01      Dubrovnik has long been establishied as a commercial center.  More
than six centuries ago medieval Dubrovnik minted its own money, controlled
building development according to an urban plan and provided many public
services, including a pharmacy, a medical service, a foundling hospital and
a refuge for old people.  By the sixteenth century, the then Republic of
Dibrovnik was a thriving trading state with a rich culture.  W4ooden houses
had been replaced bv masonrv buildings and water supply and drainage systems
were operating.
3.02      In 1667, when its comnercial role was declining, a catastrophic
earthquake levelled Dubrovnik. Recovery was slow and difficult, but by the
second half of the eighteenth century the city, its fleet, and trade were
again prospering.  Although Dubrovnik's independence ended formally in 1808
when the Republic was abolished, the spirit of its citizens today reflects
centuries of independence, confidence and international trading. Dubrovnik
Cormune, the southernmost cormune in the Republic of Croatia, shares common
inland borders with communes in the Republics of Yontenegro and Bosnia-
Iterzegovina (see Map 1).
3.03      The economy of Dubrovnik has changed dramatically over the years
from commerce to tourism.  Dubrovnik is now Yugoslavia's leading interna-
tional tourist center.  When the advent of modern tourism began near the
end of the nineteenth century, tourists were first attracted to Dubrovnik's
unique combination of assets:  warm Mediterranean climate, scenic coastlines,
warr and crvstal clear bathing waters, and strong cultural traditions. Within
the past decade, the completion of the Adriatic highway, with Bank assistance,
and the expansion of the airport have made Dubrovnik accessible to, and popu-
lar with, increasing numbers of tourists, both foreign and domestic, including
many visitors from northern Europe and North America.
13.  Tourism Facilities
3.04      Of the 60,000 residents in the Commnte, 54% live in Dubrovnik.  The
town is an important regional center as well as a tourism focal point.
1/   The three largest towns on the coast are Rijeka (population 185,000),
Split (population 125,000) and Dubrovnik (population 33,000).

Annex 1 contains a breakdown of these figures on an annual basis.  The major-
ity of tourists stay in pensions, camps, and similar lodgings instead of
hotels. Most stay outside Dubrovnik but almost all make at least one visit
to the attractive old town during their stay.
3.05      The Babin Kuk project which the Bank has agreed to help finance
(Loan 782-YU for US$20.0 million) calls for the construction of an integrated
tourism complex with hotels, restaurants, shops, guest services, recreational
facilities and related on-site infrastructure, including water distribution
and sewer networks. Operations are expected to begin in 1976. The site of
the project is the Babin Kuk peninsula, northwest of the built-up area of
Dubrovnik town (Map 2).  The Commune has decided that no further hotels shall
be allowed in Dubrovnik apart from the Babin Kuk complex and the several small
hotels now under construction. This decision takes account of space limita-
tions and potential traffic congestion in the town. Future tourism develop-
ments will be limited to other coastal locations outside the town (e.g. Cavtat,
Slano, Mlini, etc. - see Map 1) where, in fact, recent growth is already evid- #
ent.



-5-
C.  W4ater Supply and Wastewater Facilities
3.06      The water supply system serving Dubrovnik continues to use the
groundwater sources which first brought water to public fountains in the
town-in 1428 1/. Today, the main source is the Dubrovnik River which
emerges dramatically from a limestone formation at Komolac behind Srdj
Mountain. Water is chlorinated, pumped and distributed to almost 4,500 con-
nections, of which 95% are metered. No shortages have occurred, but pumps
operated almost continuously on the 1973 peak day and some 90 requests for
new connections are being held over because parts of the distribution sys-
tem are inadequate. Map 2 and Annex 2 provide details of the existing sys-
tems. Apart from Dubrovnik, Vodovod operates water systems serving five
other areas: Zupa, Cavtat, Airport, Ston and Slano (see Map 1). These
systems are all based on groundwater and together produce water equivalent
to about one third of that used in Dubrovnik town. Annex 2 provides details.
3.074     Dubrovnik's wastewater system, dating back to the storm sewers built
centuries ago in the old town, collects storm drainage as well as wastewater.
Some 30 km of sewers (serving about half of those who have water supply con-
nections) discharge wastes without treatment through 33 separate outfalls
along the coast (Map 3). This causes serious odor problems, particularly
in the Gruz and old town harbors, as well as severe pollution of inshore
coastal areas. Annex 2 provides details. Properties which are not served
by sewers are forced to rely on septic tanks for wastewater disposal. In
many parts of the town these septic tanks have to be pumped from time to
time. No other areas of the Commune have wastewater systems; individual
properties make independent arrangement (septic tanks, etc.) for wastewater
disposal.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A.   Background
4.01      "Vodovod Dubrovnik"-Poduzece Za Izgrandnju I Odrzavanje Vodovoda i
Kanalizacije (Dubrovnik Water and Wastewater Enterprise, or Vodovod) is the
project entity. As with other enterprises in Yugoslavia, Vodovod is con-
trolled by its workers who direct the enterprise through the Worker's Coun-
cil. Ilowever, Vodovod is not entirely autonomous, because the Commune:
(a) approves Vodovod's charter and any changes therein;
(b) approves all changes in Vodovod's tariffs, or if it dis-
approves them guarantees any revenue needed for Vodovod's
efficient operation;
1/   Onforio's large and small fountains are famous landmarks in the old
town of Dubrovnik.



-6-
(c)  may order Vodovod to carry out appropriate public works at
the expense of the Commune; and
(d)  acts as coordinator of the various local enterprises, in-
cluding Vodovod, for the general economic and social wel-
fare of the area.
B.   Organization and Management
4.02      Vodovod is responsible for water supply facilities throughout the
commune. The only wastewater system for which Vodovod is responsible is in
Dubrovnik.
4.03      Vodovod's organization chart is shown in Annex 8.  Staff totalling
111 is reasonably well directed by the managinig director, with policy guidance
provided by the worker's council. The responsibilities of Vodovod have been
modest to date. A qualified technical director was appointed in 1972 and
with the assistance of engineering consultants during project construction
(para 5.03), Vodovod should be able to manage the technical aspects of the
project effectively.
4.04      Financial management in Vodovod has not been strong, particularly
regarding future planning. The finance director has recently retired, giving
Vodovod the opportunity to recruit a qualified replacement to take over and
strengthen this part of the organization. During negotiations agreement was
reached with Vodovod that a satisfactory finance director will be engaged.
4.05      A septic tank service is presently provided by "Sanitat", a sepa-
rate enterprise, which charges the property owners each time the tank is
pumped (see Annex 2). Sanitat's principal activities concern hygienic con-
trol measures for ships and the port; it pumps septic tanks only because
nobody else wants to provide the service. The mission recommends that
Vodovod should become responsible for emptying septic tanks because it
could then:
(a)  select priorities for expanding the sewer networks more
efficiently if it knew from current information which
areas were experiencing most difficulties with septic
tanks;
(b)  gain increased revenues if it were responsible for servic-
ing septic tanks as well as sewers because it could iden-
tify unaccounted-for sewer connections. Vodovod knows of
2,330 sewer connections and 630 septic tanks, which together
are about two-tliirds of the water supply connections;
(c)  by taking over all wastewater services in Dubrovnik, ensure
public support for its expansion program and the associated
charges.
Accordingly Vodovod agreed during negotiations that it will make arrangements
to become responsible for emptying septic tanks in Dubrovnik by December 31,
1975.



- 7 -
4.06      At present no regulations govern the use of the wastewater system
in Dubrovnik. The Commune, in consultation with Vodovod, will have to enact
appropriate regulations which, among other things should:
a)   prohibit introduction of stormwater into separate sanitary
sewers;
b)   compel properties served by sanitary sewers to connect to
those sewers and abandon existing septic tanks;
c)   permit Vodovod to charge appropriate properties for wastewater
disposal through a surcharge on water consumption as now and/or
some other reasonable basis such as a charge per sanitary fitting
or a property assessment;
d)   control the strength of industrial wastes introduced into sewers. 1/
The necessary regulations were discussed during negotiations and assurances
obtained from the Commune that regulations satisfactory to the Bank will be-
come effective in Dubrovnik not later than June 30, 1975. It was agreed that
as a condition of loan effectiveness the Commune would enter into an obliga-
tion, in consultation with Vodovod, to prepare such regulations.
C.   Accounts and Audit
4.07      Financial records are kept according to the standard system laid
down by the Social Accounting Service. The staff are competent and records
are kept manually in a reasonably efficient fashion, but some tidying-up is
required. The information provided by the accounting system is adequate,
with certain adjustments, to produce financial statements along lines familiar
to the Bank. The accounting office could probably benefit from the introduc-
tion of simple keyboard accounting machines but extensive mechanization is
not required. Cost accounts give adequate breakdoxwn of financial informa-
tion about fixed assets, inventories and job-costs.
4.08      All billings are monthly.  Commercial enterprises are billed from
headquarters but domestic consumers make cash payments to meter readers.
The advantage claimed for the latter system is that cash collection is ex-

possible in a small organization like Dubrovnik's. However, although the

bottling beer) produces significant industrial wastes. Town planners
hope to relocate this industry and future ones in an industrial park

present arrangements have built-in checks and appear to be well supervised,
limited improvements should certainly be possible under the new finance
director.
4.09      During negotiations Vodovod agreed that it will review the account-
ing and billing systems in consultation with the Bank to determine what im-
provements are necessary and that it will implement any such improvements
within 12 months of signing the loan agreement.
4.10      As with all Yugoslav enterprises, audit is carried out by the So-
cial Accounting Service. The standards of these audits is currently under
discussion between the Yugoslav authorities and the Bank, with the intention
of establishing within the Social Accounting Service a unit which will audit
the enterprises handling Bank projects to a standard acceptable to the Bank.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that the accounts of Vodovod will
be audited in accordance with sound auditing principles consistently applied
by the Social Accounting Service or another competent and experienced audit-
ing organization. The auditor's report will be sent to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
Summary
5.01      The project consists of facilities to be built by Vodovod during
the period 1975-1978 to improve the water supply and wastewater systems in
Dubrovnik. It is intended to reinforce infrastructure so as to sustain the
town's growing economy, based on tourism. Improvements and expansions else-
where in the Commune than in Dubrovnik are not included. The water supply
component, which involves extensions and improvements to the basically sound
existing system, will enable Vodovod to continue to supply safe and reliable
water. The wastewater component is more complex and involves construction of
a comprehensive system, because existing facilities are inadequate.
Water Supply
5.02      A modest expansion of Dubrovnik's existing water supply system is
required to accommodate the expected increase in water demand, including the
increase resulting from the Babin Kuk tourism project. Preliminary designs
for the pumping station and rising main were carried out as part of the
master plan for the northern regional water system (para 1.03). Consultants
will be required for final design, procurement and supervision of construc-
tion. Map 2 shows the project facilities in red and Annex 3 discusses them
in detail. In summary, this project component comprises:



-9-
(a) extensions of the Komolac pumping station and installation
of two additional pumps;
(b) new 1.4 km rising main from the pumping station to the tun-
nel through the Srdj mountain;
(c) construction of a 2,000 m3 reservoir at Babin Kuk;
(d) extensions and renovations of the distribution system;
(e) acquisition of land; and
(f) engineering design, supervision and project administration.
Wastewater
5.03      Construction of a comprehensive wastewater system in Dubrovnik is
intended to eliminate all existing outfalls, to expand the present sewer net-
work and to collect all flows for treatment and disposal through a submarine
outfal,l. The wastewater component involves major renovations to upgrade the
existing system.  Yugoslav consultants (Project Sarajevo and the Institute of
Civil Engineering Faculty of the University of Zagreb) have prepared prelimi-
nary designs for these facilities as the first stage of a master plan serving
the entire town. Consultants will also be required for final design, procure-
ment and supervision of construction. The wastewater facilities, which are
shown on Map 3 and described in detail in Annex 3, include:
(,a) construction of 13.6 km of network sewers and 8.2 km of
collector sewers;
(b) modifications to existing sewers;
(c) installation of four automatically operated pumping stations;
(d) construction of a treatment plant for comminution and removal
of floatables;
(e) construction of outfall sewer south of the cliff face of
Petka Hill, including 1.3 km of undersea pipeline, terminat-
ing in a diffuser section at a depth of 97 m;
(f) acquisition of land; and
(g) engineering design and supervision and project administration.



- 10 -
5.04      Generally, the existing combined sewer system will be modified to
separate sanitary and stormwater systems. 1/ The sewer network will be ex-
tended gradually, with priority given to the old town and to areas where
septic tanks do not work effectively due to adverse geological conditions.
Some existing sewers will be reconstructed and connections from those pro-
perties which introduce both wastewater and stormwater into existing sewers
will be modified so that a separate sewer system results.
5.05      Vodovod's offices and workshops will be expanded, in line with the
enlargement of the utility's operating responsibilities, and equipment for
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system will be purchased.
Land
5.06      Water pipes and sewers will generally be laid in the streets but
Vodovod must acquire land on which the pumping stations and the wastewater
treatment plant will be constructed. It is understood that the necessary
land will be purchased from the Commune. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with Vodovod that all necessary land, including easements in
the public roadways, will be acquired for the project not later than June 30,
1976.
Ecological Aspects
5.07      By eliminating all existing sewer outfalls the project will gr4atly
enhance the marine environment around Dubrovnik and eliminate obnoxious con-
ditions along the coastline, particularly in the new and old harbors. Expan-
sion and improvement of the sewer networks will also reduce ground pollution
and associated odor nuisance due to septic tank overflows. The pumping sta-
tions and treatment plant will be small structures, sited unobtrusively and
designed for efficient and odorless automatic operation. The project will
accordingly make a substantial improvement to the environment of Dubrovnik.
B.   Cost Estimates
5.08      Project cost estimates, including duties and taxes, but excluding
interest during construction, are shown in detail in Annex 4. These esti-
mates, which show an estimated foreign exchange cost amounting to 22% of
total cost, can be summarized as follows:
1/   Stormwater drainage is the responsibility of another communal enter-
prise, "Institute for the Construction of Dubrovnik", or Zavod, whose
main concern is the operation and maintenance of local roads. Separa-
tion of responsibilities along these lines is not unusual and should
present no special problems.

5.09      Cost estimates for the water supply component are based on prelim-
inary desions by Vodovod's consultants and engineering, staff, incorporating
features from the 1970 master plan (para 1.(03).  Costs for the wastewater
col:Aponent are based on prelimninary designs in tthe 1972 master plan (para
1.04).  During appraisal all costs were reviewed and expressed in prices
prevailing in mid-1973.  During negotiations Vodovod increased the basic
costs in terms of mid-1974 prices, based on Yugoslav cost experience during
tihe previous year. This resulted in an increase of about 22% over the basic
costs at the tiine of appraisal.
5.1(      Physical contingencies of 10% were included for all equipment and
15¾ for civil works.  Prices are expressed in terms of those prevailing in
mid-1974, with annual allowances for future price increases at the following
annual rates:
1974     1975      1976 on
Equipment                   14%      11 %       7.5%
Civil works                18,%      15%,      12%
'..ith allowances for physical and price contingencies totalling 48'5,0 of the
basic costs, the estimated cost for the project is reasonable.
C.   Financing
5.11      Annex 10 gives a forecast of the sources and applications of
Vodovod's fun1ds.  The following table slhows Vodovod's estimated total funds
requirements for the period of project construction (1975-1978) 1/ and the
sources from which they will be met:
1/   Din. 1)0,000 estimated to be spent during 1974 is excluded from the state-
ment, since the loan is assumed to become effective no earlier than
January 1, 1975.

5.12      A Bank loan of US$6.0 million to Vodovod is proposed, which would
cover about half the project costs, plus interest during construction (US$1.2
million). Because of the relatively small foreign exchange component, typical
of Yugoslav projects, the foreign exchange costs are estimated at only US$3.3
million, including interest during construction. The proposed loan would
thus cover US$2.7 million of local currency expenditures which is consistent
with Bank lending policy in Yugoslavia. The proposed loan, assumed to be
at the current Bank lending rate of 8%, would be repaid over 24 years with
a grace period of 4 years. The remainder of Vodovod's total investment re-
quirements for the project construction period, including project construc-
tion costs, will be financed from sources within Yugoslavia.
5.13      The Republic of Croatia has promised a loan of Din 10 million (US$0.7
million) from the Republic Water Fund and its terms provide for interest, which
will amount to Din 871,000 1/, to be capitalized until two years after the end
of the disbursement period. Repayment will be by level annual payments of
combined principal and interest over 40 years with interest at 2% and a grace
period ending 2 years from the completion of disbursements.
5.14      Another loan, amounting to Din 19.8 million (US$1.3 million equiv-
alent) will come from the Bank of Dubrovnik. This bank, a commercial bank in
the city, is understood to have made special arrangements with its founders
(local enterprises acting as bank shareholders) for these funds to be provided
on concessionary terms. Interest will be capitalized during construction and
will be at 2%. Repayment will be by level annual payments of combined princi-
pal and interest over 25 years from the end of construction.
5.15      The Babin Kuk hotel enterprise will make a non-returnable consumer's
contribution of Din 25 million and the Commune will provide a grant of Din 7.6
million towards project construction. Although its resources are limited,
the Commune is to undertake to provide or raise funds necessary to meet cost
overruns. Non-returnable contributions are expected from enterprises and
consumers toward a proportion of Vodovod's investment costs outside the proj-
ect. The remaining requirements are expected to come from Vodovod's internal
funds, necessitating large tariff increases, as discussed in paras 6.10 to
6.16. The contribution from the Babin Kuk enterprise is contingent upon the
hotel project (para 1.02) proceeding, but it has been agreed that the full
amount (Din 25 million) will be contributed, irrespective of the final out-
come of discussions on the eventual size of the Babin Kuk project. Further
delay of the Babin Kuk project could possibly affect the timing of the avail-
ability of funds, but not the amount. The Vodovod project would be virtually
unaffected by any scaling down or delays in the Babin Kuk tourism development
except perhaps for elements of the water supply distribution system, amounting
to some 5% of the total project cost.
1/   Interest capitalized during the construction period only is estimated
at Din 449,000.



- 15 -
5.16      During negotiations it was agreed that confirmation of the various
sources of finance and the various terms and conditions thereof would be a
condition of loan effectiveness. It was also agreed that, as a condition
of loan effectiveness, the Commune would give an undertaking to be respon-
sible for providing or arranging funds to cover cost overruns.
D.   Organization and Management
5.17      Vodovod will be responsible for carrying out the project.  Because
its engineering staff is limited, further progress on the project depends on
the engagement of appropriate consultants (see paras 5.02 and 5.03). Vodovod
intends to assign responsibility for final design and procurement of the proj-
ect, as well as technical advice during its construction, to the Institute of
Civil Engineering Faculty of the University of Zagreb, its wastewater consul-
tants (para 5.03). During negotiations it was agreed that this contract will
be signed in a form acceptable to the Bank before the loan becomes effective.
Construction supervision will be assigned to a separate group of consultants
acceptable to the Bank to be engaged by January 1, 1975. During negotiations
it was agreed that these arrangements, too, would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
E.   Approval
5.18      Before Vodovod can begin construction, the project must be approved
by various Yugoslav authorities. The wastewater component requires the ap-
proval of the:
(a) Bureau of Construction of Dubrovnik Commune;
(b) Sanitary Inspector of Croatia Secretariat for Health; and
(c) Minister for Water of Croatia.
Tne approval of these authorities is expected to be granted without any prob-
lems and during negotiations it was agreed that this would be a condition of
loan effectiveness.
F.   Implementation Schedule
5.19      The project works are expected to begin in 1975 and to be completed
in 1978, with facilities for the Babin Kuk area (including the wastewater dis-
posal system) operational by mid-1976. Annex 5 shows the construction schedule.
G.   Procurement
5.20      Contracts for the supply and installation of equipment and for civil
works expected to cost more than US$100,000 will be put to tender on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guide-
lines for Procurement". Local competitive bidding will be used for smaller
contracts. A margin of preference for local equipment manufacturers of 15%
or customs duty, whichever is lower, has been agreed to. Vodovod will carry



- 16 -
out by force account minor works, such as renovations and modifications to
the existing water and sewer networks. The total value of such minor works
is expected to be less than 10% of the project cost.
5.21      All major supply and civil works contracts are expected to be won
by Yugoslav firms; contracts for some specialized equipment for the treat-
ment plant and pumping stations would probably be placed with foreign sub-
contractors.
H.  Disbursement
5.22      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed to finance the CIF cost
of imported equipment, the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment;
100% of the cost of consultants; 35% of all civil works contracts; and in-
terest during construction. The percentage relating to civil works contracts
would be adjusted as necessary over the implementation period of the project
to ensure disbursement in proportion to total civil works expenditures. On
completion of the project, any unused balance of the loan would be cancelled.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 6.
VI. FINANCE
A.   Background
6.01      Vodovod's revenues are derived from monthly water and wastewater
charges based on metering.  In those few cases where metering is absent,
usually premises with low consumption, charges are based on estimated con-
sumption, related to size of dwelling and number of occupants. For water
consumers connected to the wastewater system, wastewater charges are made,
based on water consumption.
6.02      Charges are made for connections to the water system.  A deposit is
required, based on estimated cost, adjusted to final ascertained cost on com-
pletion.  In a limited number of cases, where a large potential consumer, such
as a high-class hotel, has requested a connection requiring major improvements
to Vodovod's system, a much larger charge has been collected as a cash contri-
bution towards construction. In certain cases, in lieu of these contributions,
consumer enterprises have constructed works and on completion have handed
them over to Vodovod for operation and maintenance. Connection charges and
construction contributions have not been collected, to any significant extent,
for the wastewater system.
6.03      At the end of each year Vodovod is required by law to allocate from
its net income a contribution to a reserve fund, which is required to be set
aside as a special bank deposit. In addition, present law requires each en-
terprise to make a compulsory loan to federal authorities for development of
the nation's less-developed areas. Both the reserve fund contribution and
the compulsory loan are calculated by formulae based on appropriately adjusted
net income. Also, at the end of each year, the workers vote a contribution to



- 17 -
the Collective Consumption Fund, a kind of trust fund managed by the workers
for housing, educational, social and cultural purposes. Remaining earnings
are retained in a "Business Fund".
B.   Past Performance and Present Position
6.04      In the past, Vodovod has raised a large number of low-interest or
interest-free loans to finance capital expenditures. At December 31, 1972, 38
such loans were outstanding, ranging from about Din. 15,000 to over Din. 3
million. The average interest rate is just under 3%, with repayment periods
as long as 50 years. Vodovod's debt/equity ratio at December 31, 1972 was
about 15:85. As a result of these financial arrangements, Vodovod has been
able to earn modest profits and adequately cover its debt service obligations
with tariffs which have earned only a very modest rate of return on fixed
assets.
6.05      Because of its low tariff practice, Vodovod has financed a decreasing
proportion of its increasing investment from internal funds. During the last
few years, Vodovod's finances have become increasingly strained by the need
to finance extensions to its system mainly to meet rising demands from the
tourism sector. This strain on Vodovod's finances has been compounded by a
hardening of the general economic climate in which it operates. Inflation has
been running considerably above 10% annually, price controls have been imposed
and funds have been generally short, affecting all enterprises including Vodovod.
Loans have become much more difficult to raise and those raised are available
only on significantly harder terms than in the past. Recent borrowings by
Vodovod have been at 8% for periods as short as 5 years. Increasingly, Vodovod
has requested capital contributions from beneficiaries to finance extensions
of its system.
6.06      In fixing its tariffs, Vodovod has paid little regard to the relative
requirements of the separate water and wastewater systems. There has been
some separation of directly identifiable expenditures, but separate sets of
accounts have not been kept for each system. In consultation with Vodovod,
and using arbitrary, but reasonable, apportionments of common expenses, the
mission has constructed separate accounts for each service for fiscal years
1970-73. These show that whilst the water supply service has been reasonably
profitable, earnings of the wastewater system have not even covered cash
operating and maintenance expenses, let alone depreciation and interest.
6.07      Vodovod's collection of receivables from consumers has been less than
satisfactory. At the end of 1972, outstanding receivables averaged about 4
montlhs revenue from water and wastewater charges. An analysis of total re-
ceivables shows that some 40% has been outstanding for over three months and
nearly 20% for over six months. Some amounts have been outstanding for more
than two years, particularly from the tourist and building trades.
6.08      Recovery of these outstanding amounts and a general improvement in
collections have been difficult for Vodovod. For one thing, all enterprises
are affected by general liquidity problems currently common in Yugoslavia.



- 18 -
Further, with the area relying on tourism, Vodovod has been reluctant to, or
dissuaded from, enforcing disconnections, because of the bad image which would
result for the town. Recently, Vodovod seems to have given increasing atten-
tion to this problem and the results of their efforts are awaited. The Social
Accounting Service has recently introduced a regulation requiring a specific
provision for bad and doubtful debts. Because this regulation will result in
removing accrued revenue from the amounts which workers could legally claim for
income or collective consumption, workers are likely to place additional pres-
sure on Vodovod to pursue more vigorous collection policies. During negotia-
tions agreement was reached with Vodovod that it will use its best efforts to
reduce its receivables from consumers to no more than the equivalent of 2.5
months' revenue from water and wastewater charges by December 31, 1978.
6.09      In 1970 Vodovod earned an overall rate of return on fixed assets of
5.6%. This rate increased slightly in 1971, but fell to 3.2% in 1972 because
of a general asset revaluation in accordance with Yugoslav law. Vodovod's
financial position is worse than these rates suggest because the depreciation
rate of 1.5% charged on its water and wastewater systems is relatively low
and because the recent revaluations of fixed assets, being mainly related
to exchange rate changes, have not fully allowecl for internal inflation, thus
overstating rates of return.
C.   Tariffs
6.10      Tariff increases of 30-35% for water supply and 25% for wastewater
were implemented on July 1, 1973 (see Annex 13), thus accentuating the inade-
quacies of wastewater tariffs relative to those for water. However, following
discussions with the Bank, wastewater tariffs were doubled on July 16, 1974
and water tariffs increased by an average of about 20%, which was a signifi-
cant step towards increasing revenues and reducing relative inequities be-
mteen the services. Present water tariffs per m3 are Din. 1.60 (domestic)
and Din 3.20 (commercial).  The wastewater tariff is Din. 1.00 per m3 of
water. In the years 1973 and 1974 a return of about 8% on fixed assets will
be earned by the water supply service. The wastewater service which in 1973,
nearly doubled its losses over 1972, will, in 1974, reduce them to about the
same level as in 1972.
6.11      If present tariffs remained in force, and inflation continued as
projected, (See Annex 12), Vodovod would begin to suffer increasingly large
cash shortages, and taking both services together, rates of return would fall
from about 5% in 1974 to nil by 1979.  By 1979, when the full effects of debt
charges should be felt, Vodovod's cumulative cash shortage would be Din 25.
million, circumstances under which it would be impossible to operate effect-
ively, if at all.
6.12      Further tariff increases are required if Vodovod is to meet cash
and rate of return requirements and to finance future capital expenditure
without excessive additional borrowing. To meet the above requirements, the
most significant tariff increases would need to be made before 1979, by which
time the project assets come into operation and the burden of additional debt



- 19 -
service is felt. By then, water tariffs would have to be about 75% and waste-
water tariffs about 100% above present levels. While quite high rates of
return could be achieved during the construction period with lower tariff
increases, gradual increases are appropriate over this period so that the
required 1979 levels are reached by stages. This has the following advantages
over the alternative of treating each year's requirements in isolation:
(a) consumers should find regular gradual increases more acceptable
than fewer, erratic, and larger increases;
(b) additional cash generated during the construction period, can be
used to finance more of construction costs; and
(c) as a consequence of (b) less borrowing will be necessary.
6.13      In addition to the tariff increases recently imposed by Vodovod
(para 6.10) further increases will be necessary early in 1975. It is in-
tended that these increases as well as those in later years will be applied
to both services but that after operating costs are met for the wastewater
system, additional revenues needed for overall rates of return to be accept-
able wil-l be collected throughout the Commune by further increasing water
charges. 1/ This procedure has two important advantages.
(a) because Vodovod supplies virtually every household in the
Commune with water some indirect costs of the wastewater
system, for example the costs of capital implicit in rate
of return requirements, will be borne by all residents of
the Commune, to whom indirect environmental benefits will
accrue;
(b) additional charges to water consumers will help cushion the
impact of the large increases necessary for the wastewater
system because the water supply system has a larger tariff base.
6.14      Based on present financial projections, the tariff increases neces-
sarv to meet the above requirements are:
(i) water tariffs should increase by 10% on January 1, 1975 and
by 15% on January 1 in each year thereafter until 1978;
(ii) wastewater tariffs should increase by 20% on January 1, 1975
and by 20% on January 1 in each year thereafter until 1982.
1/   Water charges are the same throughout the Commune.  Although wastewater
systems do not operate outside Dubrovnik, all water consumers in the
Commune benefit to some degree from improvements to the town's waste-
water system.



- 20 -
Annex 13 elaborates on these proposals. Should there be a reduction in water
sales as a result of any scaling down of the Babin Kuk project (para. 5.15)
tariffs might have to be slightly further increased in certain years to com-
pensate for the resulting loss of revenue. Agreement was -reached during nego-
tiations that tariffs will be set by Vodovod, with approval by the Commune
(para 4.01) so as to satisfy the following objectives:
(a) individual revenues for the water and wastewater services should
cover operating expenses, including depreciation, for that service;
(b)  during each year of project construction the internal cash ratio 1/
will exceed 4%;
(c)  overall rates of return on fixed assets will exceed 6% in the
first full year of project operation and in every year thereafter.
It was further agreed that, as a condition of effectiveness, the Commune would
give assurances, in satisfactory form, that it would undertake to approve all
tariff increases necessary to enable Vodovod to meet the above requirements.
6.15      Because of continuing inflation, fixed asset values in each year
will be understated for the purposes of ratemaking. Because of this, the rate
of return tends to overstate the true rate, which is probably around 4%. How-
ever, since accounting regulations do not permit annual revaluations of fixed
assets, book values, revalued in accordance with Yugoslav law and practice, 2/
or by some other method acceptable to Bank, should be the fixed asset base for
ratemaking purposes.
6.16      The relatively low overall rate of return is acceptable for several
important reasons:
(a)  while the wastewater revenues would cover only operation, main-
tenance and depreciation costs, the water revenues would earn
a rate of return of about 15% in 1979, falling to about 11.5%
in 1982 (even if assets were revalued the rate of return would
not be less than about 8% in any year);
1/   "Internal cash ratio" is defined as net operating income; plus deprecia-
tion; less debt service; less changes in non-cash working capital; less
contributions to the collective consumption fund and compulsory invest-
ments; all divided by gross plant in service plus fixed assets under
construction (see Annex 17).
2/   Whilst assets are not revalued annually, the Yugoslav authorities have,
in the past, required ad hoc nationwide revaluations on specific dates,
related to some extent, to currency devaluations.



- 21 -
(b), apart from the Bank loan, all other capital finance has been
provided at some sacrifice to the local community through in-
creased taxation, water fund contributions, construction con-
tributions and (because of concessionary loans to Vodovod)
dimininished returns on local bank investments;
(c)  there is a strong case for Communal subsidy of the wastewater
system because of its benefits to the environment as well as to
consumers - present proposals represent a compromise to preserve
Vodovod's operational and financial autonomy;
(d)  Vodovod's funds requirements will be adequately covered.
D.   Future Performance
6.17      Vodovod's immediate future financing policy must be directed toward
rapid reform from a low-growth institution relying upon soft loans and charging
modest tariffs into an institution capable of expanding its systems extensively
to meet increasing tourist demands and to provide much of the necessary finance
from its own resources. In particular, the finances of the wastewater service
should be overhauled so that users, as well as residents and enterprises of
the area who will benefit from its expansion and improvement, pay charges
covering operating costs.
6.18      If the tariff proposals referred to in paragraphs 6.10 to 6.16 are
implemented, Vodovod will be able to finance internally a reasonable proportion
of its investment program until 1982. Its debt service coverage will rise from
2.3 times in 1979 to 2.7 times in 1982. During negotiations, it was agreed
that Vodovod would not raise further loans without Bank approval unless its
net cash earnings before depreciation and interest exceed 1.5 times its debt
service in any future year, including debt service on the amount to be borrowed.
6.19      The 1.5% depreciation rates charged by Vodovod on its water and
wastewater systems are the minimum prescribed by law but are considered by the
mission to be inadequate. Vodovod may increase them if it wishes and during
negotiations agreed that the rates be increased to 2%. The financial projec-
tions assume that these increases will take place.
VII. JUSTIFICATION
7.01      With tourism to Dubrovnik Commune expected to expand in the future,
accommodation is also expected to expand to meet demand. In 1972 facilities
were available in the town to accommodate tourists equal to 50% of the resident
population (Annexes 1 and 7). This proportion is expected to increase to 60%
by 1980. Accommodation in the surrounding community is expected to grow even
more rapidly than in the town, with the result that by 1980 the total capacity
for tourists is expected to equal 90% of the Commune's resident population.



- 22 -
7.02      Despite its natural advantages as a tourist center, Dubrovnik is
aware of the sensitivity of the volatile tourism market to any degradation of
the environment. In March 1972, for example, an outbreak of smallpox in
Kosovo spread to other parts of Yugoslavia. Although no cases reached
Dubrovnik, the fear of this epidemic caused substantial losses to the economy
through a significant drop in tourism. Total tourist bednights in the town
dropped over 7% from 1971, whereas the growth in the previous year had been
8% (Annex 1). The difference between a theoretical 4% growth in tourism in
1972 1/ and the actual results represents some 50,000 bed-nights. With each
tourist conservatively assumed to spend an average of US$10 daily, the loss
in revenues associated with this decline in tourism in Dubrovnik in 1972 must
have been in excess of US$500,000.
7.03      Dubrovnik's success as a tourist resort cannot be sustained, let
alone expanded, without adequate and reliable basic infrastructure, of which
water supply and wastewater systems are vital elements. Although the water
supply system has kept pace with demand it needs to expand in order to avert
future shortages. The wastewater system is presently inadequate and is in-
creasingly polluting local waters, particularly the popular harbors, and
making them increasingly objectionable. If these coastal waters are not
aesthetically attractive, particularly in the water recreation areas such
as those for the Babin Kuk complex (see map 3), Dubrovnik stands to lose
tourists in this highly competitive market.
7.04      The expansion of the water supply system is the least cost solution
to meet increasing demands. Sales are expected to increase at about 10% an-
nually in the near future as Babin Kuk begins to operate, then grow at 3%-4%
annually thereafter.  This compares to sales which have increased on average
just over 6% annually for the past four years.
7.05      The wastewater component was selected from various collection and
disposal alternatives as the least cost solution to meet the reasonable ob-
jectives of the project. The project facilities will substantially improve
Dubrovnik's environment and will enable the town to comply with Yugoslav
standards for coastal water quality.
7.06      The project is expensive for such a relatively small community but
the community is proposing to meet about half of the capital costs from limited
local resources and to pay user charges adequate to meet operating and main-
tenance expenses, service debts and generate funds partially to finance future
system extensions.
7.07      The benefits of the wastewater system do not accrue to the individual
water consumers, particularly since most are already connected to the existing
I/   A reasonable assumption, since the average rate of increase of tourist
bed-nights in Dubrovnik town in the preceding six years 1965-1971 was
4% annually. See Annex 1 for details.



- 23 -
but admittedly unsatisfactory system. Instead, the principal benefits result-
ing from considerably improving the present system accrue to the general envi-
ronment. The consumer's willingness to pay for these facilities is therefore
not a relevant measure of benefits. The appropriate way to evaluate the bene-
fits would be to quantify the environmental improvement (e.g. cleaner harbors,
less noxious odors, improved bathing, reduced risk of epidemic disease, in-
creased tourism, etc.). However, these benefits cannot be quantified.
7.08       Based on present financial projections, water consumers connected
to the wastewater system would pay (in constant prices) a total unit tariff
of Din 3.85/m3 in 1978, 1/ the year the project comes into operation. This
could be seen as representing the currently evaluated long-run incremental
unit cost of water (Din 2.40/m3) 2/ plus a contribution (Din 1.45/m3) towards
wastewater costs. For water consumers not connected to the wastewater system
(mainly outside Dubrovnik) the unit charge in 1978 would be Din 2.65/m3, re-
presenting the long-run incremental cost of water (Din 2.40/m ) plus an en-
vironmental tax (Din 0.25/m3) as a contribution towards the wastewater system.
These tariff proposals indicate that the pricing policy for water is economic-
ally reasonable, with tariffs approximating long-run marginal costs. Expressed
another way, the economic rate of return for the water supply investments
could be regarded as a minimum of 10%, the discount rate used in calculating
the long-run incremental unit cost.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACIIED AND RECOMIMNDATIONS
8.01       During negotiations, agreements were reached that:
(a)  a satisfactory finance director will be engaged by Vodovod
(para 4.04);
(b)  Vodovod will make arrangements to become responsible for
emptying sectic tanks in Dubrovnik by December 31, 1975
(para 4.05);
(c)  draft wastewater regulations will become effective in
Dubrovnik not later than June 30, 1975 (para 4.06);
1/   In current prices in 1978, the average unit tariff for all water expected
to be sold is estimated at Din 4.72/m3 and that for wastewater at Din
2.08/m3, giving a total unit tariff of Din. 6.80/m3/  (See Annex 9).
2/   With all incremental costs (in constant 1973 prices) and incremental
sales volumes for the next 30 years discounted to the present at 10%.
Major system expansions after the project and associated extra sales
(above an annual increase in sales of about 3%) are excluded.



- 24 -
(d)  Vodovod will review its accounting and billing systems in
consultation with the Bank to determine what improvements
are necessary and Vodovod will implement any such improve-
ments within 12 months of signing the loan agreement
(para 4.09);
(e)  the accounts of Vodovod will be audited in accordance with
sound auditing principles, consistently applied, and the
auditor's report sent to the bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (para 4.10);
(f)  all necessary land, including easements in the public
roadways, will be acquired for the project (para 5.06);
(g)  consultants will be engaged to assist in final design, procure-
ment and supervision of construction in accordance with the
Baank Group's I'Uses of Consultants!! (para 5.17);
(h)  Vodovod will use its best efforts to reduce its receivables
from consumers by December 31, 1978 (para 6.08);
(i)  tariffs will be set in such a manner as to satisfy acceptable
expense coverage, rate of return and cash generation objec-
tives (para 6.14);
(j)  Vodovod will not raise further loans unless its net cash earn-
ings before depreciation and interest exceed 1.5 times its debt
service in any future year, including debt service on the amount
to be borrowed (para 6.19); and,
(k)  2% rates of depreciation on water and wastewater systems will
be implemented (para 6.20).
8.02      Before the loan becomes effective:
(a)  the Commune should have entered into an obligation to prepare
wastewater regulations (para 4.06);
(b)  confirmation should have been received of the various sources
of finance for the project (para 5.16);
(c)  the Commune should have given an undertaking to provide or
arrange funds to meet cost overruns (para 5.16);
(d)  Vodovod should have signed satisfactory contracts with en-
gineering consultants (para 5.17);
(e)  all necessary approvals for project construction should have
been received (para 5.18); and,



- 25 -
(f) the Commune should have given assurances in satisfactory form,
that it will undertake to approve all necessary tariff increases
(para 6.14).
8.03      On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations on the issues
referred to above, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.0 million
to Vodovod for a 24-year term including 4 years of grace.

DUBROVNIK WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER PROJECT
EXISTING FACILITIES OF VODOVOD
WATER SUPPLY
1.        Vodovod operates a total of six water supply systems throughout
the commune, the largest of which serves Dubrovnik town. The areas served
by each system are shown on Map 1. Statistics for 1973 for the various
supplies can be summarized as follows:

2.        All of the systems rely on groundwater which is pumped, after
chlorination, into the distribution system.  Two sources, the Duboka Ljuta
and Prahivac springs, supply the interconnected Zupa, Cavtat and Airport
systems. The systems for Dubrovnik town, Slano and Ston are physically
independent.
3.        Projections of future water production and sales are shown graphi-
cally in Annex 7 and outlined in Annex 9.
DUBROVNIK TOWN WATER SUPPLY
4.        The town of Dubrovnik has had a water supply for more than five
hundred years. The original system, using water from the Sumet springs in
Komolac valley, first operated in the year 1428. A covered channel conveyed
water to the town from the source over a distance of some 11 km (see Map 2).
These springs, which yield from 5 to 100 liters per second, continue in
service today, along with much of the original aqueduct. Two famous land-
marks in the old town are Onforio's large and small fountains, which were
built by and named for the architect responsible for the original water sup-
ply system.
5.        Early in this century, the distribution system was improved to
provide direct connections to the houses. Demand increased accordingly and
it was necessary to augment the spring supply by pumping directly from the
Dubrovnik (ombla) River at Komolac to the reconstructed original channel.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 5 pages
6.        Fifteen years ago, as the town grew and tourism became increasingly
important, plans were made for large-scale expansion of the system. The ob-
vious source was the Dubrovnik River, which emerges dramatically from lime-
stone mountains at its origin near the town. Although the hydrology of this
source is not completely understood, it is clear that it is basically a
spring for which the recharge area is the watershed of the Trebisnjica River.
In Karstic regions inland from Dubrovnik, this river disappears with no sur-
face outlet (see Map 1). Solution channels in the limestone convey the water
to the sea at Dubrovnik in abundant quantities: the metered flow of the
Dubrovnik River has never been less than 2.0 cubic meters/second, or some
fifteen times the amount of water pumped on an average day in 1972.
7.        The water is normally quite clear and requires no treatment except
precautionary chlorination. After it rains heavily in the recharge area, the
emerging river is reported to be slightly turbid. This situation only lasts
a few days during the winter season.  Construction of a new dam on the
Trebisnjica River in the recent past has reduced this periodic turbidity, no
doubt due to the sedimentation which occurs in the reservoir. The maximum
turbiditv measured in the past reached 100 units 1/ but it has not exceeded
50 units since the dam was built.  In normal conditions the turbidity is al-
wavs less than 10 units and usually less than 3 units. In any case Vodovod
receives no complaints about water quality from its consumers, so provisional
plans to install treatment facilities for this slight and infrequent turbidity
have not been pursued.
8.        In 1961 and 1962, the system (see Map 2) was substantially expand-
ed. A new pumping station was built near the original one at Komolac on
the river with three electrically driven centrifugal pumps, with characteris-
tics of each pump as follows:
Hlead                -          85 meters
Flow                 -       140 liters/second
Motor power          -        180 kilowatts
The original station continues to pump water to the aqueduct which serves
properties along the river. At the new station two pumps are used together
and the third acts as a standby. On the peak day in 1973, two pumps operated
for 23 hours.
9.        A 500 millimeter diameter steel pressure pipe leads the water 1,400
meters from the pumping station to the entrance to a tunnel through the Srdj
mountain. Inside the 3 kilometer long unlined tunnel is a concrete channel
(capacity 400 liters/second) which terminates in an underground reservoir
(capacity 5,000 cubic meters) with a top elevation of 74 meters.
1/   Turbidity measured as milligrams of silica (SiO2) per liter of water.
These units can be converted to Jackson Turbidity Units (JTU) by
multiplying by 0.4.

10.       There are two main pressure zones in the distribution system serv-
ing the town. The lower zone which includes the Babin Kuk area, Gruz and the
old towm, supplied from the reservoir at the end of the tunnel. The higher
zone, from 55 to 120 meters, is supplied from a 2,000 cubic meter reservoir
situated at elevation 135 meters. Water is pumped automatically to this
reservoir from the station at the tunnel exit, which has three electrically
driven pumps with the following characteristics:
Head                  -    80 meters
Flow                  -    30 liters/second
MIotor Power          -    75 kilowatts
11.       Facilities on top of Srdj mountain (where the tourist cable car
terminates) are supplied with water from a 100 cubic meter reservoir. Water
is pumped to this reservoir from the station at the middle reservoir which
has two pumps with the following characteristics:
Head                  -   165 meters
Flow                  -    15 liters/second
Meter Power           -    75 kilowatts
12.       The distribution system consisted of some 62 km of pipes at the
end of 1972, as follows:

In addition there are some 29 km of galvanized iron pipes, mostly 1/2 inch,
which are regarded as house-connections.  It should be noted that most of
the distribution pipes are very small. Only 43% are larger than 100 mm dia-
meter.



ANNEX 2
Page  4 of 5 pages
13.       At the end of 1973, there were 4,727 connections to the distribu-
tion system, of which 95% were metered. There were some 90 requests for new
connections pending in mid-1973 which could not be supplied, mainly because
of the inadequate distribution system.
WASTEWATER
14.       Throughout the commune, there are two basic methods of wastewater
disposal, either to the sea via an outfall sewer or to the ground via a
septic tank and/or soak pit.  Generally, the property owner is responsible
for making the necessary arrangements to dispose of his wastewater. Only in
Dubrovnik town is there a fairly comprehensive system, for which Vodovod has
been responsible since 1966.
Dubrovnik Town Wastewater Facilities
15.       The sewers in Dubrovnik town, which are shown on Map 3, have a
total length of some 30 km, as follows:
Concrete and
Masonry           Concrete          Vitrified
Channels            Pipes           Clay Pipes          Total
Length
(meters)      16,260          13,160              700              30,120
16.       The original system in the old town is hundreds of years old and
is a combined system, removing storm drainage as well as wastewater.  Its
capacity is inadequate-and flooding of low places occurs after heavy rains.
Because of its age and location, these sewers are difficult to inspect or
repair.
17.       All sewers in Dubrovnik dispose of their contents to the sea.
There are presently some 33 outfall sewers, as indicated on Map 3, most of
which concentrate these untreated wastes in the harbors of Gruz and the old
town. The resulting odors are quite unpleasant due to this gross pollution.
To prevent pollution of the beaches along Sumartin Bay, where many new hotels
are located, a 500 m long tunnel was excavated beneath Petka hill (see Map 3).
Storm drainage and wastewater from this area of town enter the sea at the
cliff face where the tunnel terminates. Surface currents prevent any con-
tamination of beaches in Sumartin Bay.
18.       Vodovod knows of only 2,330 connections to its sewers, or just
over 50% of the number of water connections. There are 630 known septic
tanks and/or soak pits, but added to the number of sewer connections, this
only accounts for two-thirds of the water supply connections. Undoubtedly,
some of the septic tanks receive wastewater from several buildings, but it is
also likely that many properties have connections to the sewers of which
Vodovod is unaware.



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 5 pages
19.       A typical "septic tank" in Dubrovnik is little more than an unlined
hole in the ground, dug in an irregular shape (according to the nature of
the ground) to a depth from one to three meters, with a concrete cover. In
several sections of the town (marked on Map 3), the limestone is relatively
impermeable and the septic tanks have to be emptied periodically by pumping.
This service is provided by an enterprise called "Sanitat", whose principal
interests concern hygienic control, disinfection and anti-pollution measures
related to shipping and the port. This firm has two 5 ton pump trucks which
make a total of about 400 trips annually while emptying septic tanks. It is
estimated that the average septic tank contains some 7 cubic meters, meaning
that the 400 truck loads would empty some 300 septic tanks annually. The
manager of "Sanitat", the only firm providing this service in Dubrovnik, es-
timates that the volume of pumping is increasing at about 15% annually.
20.       The charge for the service of pumping septic tanks is Din 250 to
280 (US$16 to $18) per truck load (5 tons which are 5 cubic meters). In
many parts of Dubrovnik access to the septic tanks is extremely difficult
for the truck, and in cases where pumping over a long distance is required
the additional charge is Din 150 (US$10). "Sanitat" reports that none of
Dubrovnik's hotels require this service.
21.       Many properties in Dubrovnik have a garden.  The summer is fairly
dry so irrigation is required for luxurious plant growth. Homes which have
septic tanks nearby frequently use this polluted water for irrigation.

DUBROVNIK, WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWJATER PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.        The project comprises investments to be made by Vodovod in the
period 1974-1978 to improve the water supply and wastewater facilities serv-
ing the town of Dubrovnik.  These components are discussed separately.  New
water supply facilities are shown in red on map 2 and wastewater facilities
on map 3. Cost estimates are provided in Annex 4 and its construction sche-
dule in Annex 5.
WATER SUPPLY COMPONENT
2.        The existing Komolac pumping station at the Dubrovnik River would
be enlarged to meet the growing demands for Dubrovnik town and in anticipa-
tion of demands in the near future along the north side of the river towards
Zaton. Preliminary designs call for the installation of two pumps, each with
a capacity of 370 liters/second. This capacity will be reviewed during final
design to take account of projected peak demands, reliability of existing
pumps and necessary spare capacity.
3.        River flows averaged some 40 m3/second with minimum flows of about
2 m3/second, which is more than ten times the water presently pumped for
Dubrovnik. Thus the source has adequate capacity for the proposed expansion.
Rising Main
4.        A second rising main would parallel the existing one from the
Komolac pumping station to the entrance to the tunnel through Mount Srdj.
This steel pipe, with a length of 1.4 km and a provisional diameter of 600 mm,
would reduce punping energy requirement and would provide security and flex-
ibility by augmenting the existing line.
Reservoir at Babin Kuk
5.        The reservoir on the Babin Kuk peninsula would serve the tourism
development there. It would be built of reinforced concrete with a capacity
of 2,000 m3 and a top water level of approximately 74 m above sea level.
Extensions to the Distribution System
6.        Some 2.7 km of pipes will be laid along the west side of Gruz
Harbour to improve service in that area and to supply the Babin Kuk develop-
ment. Preliminary designs call for pipes as follows:



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5 pages
Asbestos Cement         -   300 mm diameter         758 m
-   350 mm diameter        598 m
-   400 mm diameter        189 m
Subtotal                                    1,545 m
Plastic                 -   250 mm diameter       1,130 m
Total                                       2,675 m
The plastic pipe would be laid along the harbor edge near the salt water and
would replace pipes which have been corroded.
Renovations to Existing Distribution System
7.        Many bad pipes in the existing distribution system cause leakage
and reduce pressure. Vodovod intends to continue its program of identifying
pipes which are corroded or whose capacity is restricted and to replace them
to improve the system.  It is estimated that about 2 km of pipes (less than
2% of the existing pipes) will be replaced in this program.
WASTEWATER COMPONENT
Sewer Construction
8.        Collector sewers will be built to intercept sewers which now flow
to the sea and to collect wastewater from existing and proposed branch sewers
in order to direct all wastewater to the Lapad treatment site. Networks will
be built gradually, particularly in areas where septic tanks require frequent
puniping (Annex 2 and Map 3). Data concerning the proposed collectors and
network sewers which feed into them are outlined as follows:
Item              Length (km)      Diameter (cm)            Description
Collector I           3.3          30 to 100        Collecting wastewater from
(also 240 m     west side of Dubrovnik, in-
of tunnel)       cluding old town, to Lapad
treatment plant.
Network I             6.8          25 and 30        Supplying collector I
Collector II          3.2          30 to 60         Along Gruz harbor, inter-
cepting 11 existing out-
falls. Includes 175 m of
pressure pipe.
Network II            4.2          25 and 30        In areas draining into Gruz
harbour.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 5 pages
Collector III         1.7          30 and 50        Through the center of the
old town, then 900 m of
pressure pipe from the Pile
pumping station.
Network III           2.6          25 and 30        In the old town and adjacent
areas on the west side of
Dubrovnik.
Total           21.8
Modifications to Existing Sewers
9.        About 1,500 existing connections which introduce both stormnwater
and liquid wastes into combined sewers will be modified so that separate
connections are made to the storinwater drainage system and to the sanitary
sewers. No stormwater will be allowed to enter the Vodovod sewer system,
except in the old town (where a combined system already exists) until new
separate sewers are eventually installed.
10.       Old sewers of inferior quality will be reconstructed to serve in
the expanded svstem. This work is generally restricted to masonry channels
which are not strong enough for current traffic loads.
Pumping Stations
11.       Four pumping stations are required to direct wastewater to the
treatment site. All stations will have electrically driven pumps which will
operate automatically and will have one spare pump for standby. Characteris-
tics of each station are as follows:
No of     Capacity per      Pumping
Location       Pumps      Pump (l/s)        Hlead (m)             Remarks
Gruz              2             74             14          In port.
Gliman            3             96             18
Pile              3            134             42          In moat outside Pile
gate of old town wall.
Lapad             3            328             24          Lifts all wastewater
to treatment plant.
Treatment Plant and Outfall Sewer
12.       Before any decisions were made concerning the optimum disposal
process a thorough investigation was made of the marine environment along
the Dubrovnik coastal area. During four months in the summer of 1971 three
research vessels and divers collected considerable data and made numerous



ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 5 pages
observations along the coast. These investigations, by the Institute of
Oceanographv and Fisheries in conjunction with the Hydrographic Institute of
the Yugoslav Nav , both from Split, resulted in the publication of a compre-
hensive three volume report titled "Oceanographic and Biological Properties
of the Coastal Area Dubrovnik."
16.       Consultants from the Civil Engineering Faculty of the University
of Zagreb studied various disposal alternatives, including combinations of
different degrees of treatment and various outfall locations, and used data
provided by the foregoing investigations. The consultants concluded that
the most economical disposal system which would meet the qualitv standards
for the coastal waters 1/ consisted of a limited degree of treatment combined
with a submarine outfall sewer terminating in a diffuser at a depth of about
95 m.
14.       The treatment process will consist of comminution and removal of
floatables. Commiinttors will desintegrate all solids in the wastewater in a
grinding process.  Anv floating material, including fats and oils, will be
skimmed off in a specially designed flotation tank which will utilize com-
pressed air. These materials will be periodically removed in sealed con-
tainers to an inland disposal site.
15.       Dubrovnik town is not expected to grow much in the future, since
no further hotels are to be permitted after the Babin Kuk complex. Tf, how-
ever, wastewater quantities were to increase significantly or if the receiv-
ing water standard becomes more stringent, more intensive treatment could he
provided at the plant site by adding facilities for chlorination. Space
requirements would be modest because of the small flows involved.
1/   Croatian regulations define three categories of coastal waters:
1 - Sea water suitable for the cultivation of ovsters and shellfish.
2 - Sea water suitable for beaches, recreation and water sports.
3 - Rest of the coastal area.
Standards are most stringent for category 1 and least for category 3.
The coastal waters around Dubrovnik are classified as category 2 and
the criteria for this water quality are as follows:
Indicator                                 Limit
a.   Suspended solids                Less than 10 mg per liter
b.   Most probable number of         Less than 20,000 per 100 mil
coliform organisms
c.   Oil, mineral oil and            Nil
associated products
d.   Visible wastes                  Nil
e.   Color                           Nil



ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 5 pages
16.       The Lapad treatment plant site is on a gently sloping section on
the north side of Petka Hill, about 100 m inland from the coast and 50 m in-
land (and uphill) from the only road. The entire hillside is in forest so
the relatively small plant will be well screened from the hotels in the area.
Odor problems are not expected and the prevailing winds are from the hotel
zone towards the plant on the hillside, almost never in the opposite direction.
17.       After this partial treatment the wastewater will flow by gravity
to and through a 60 cm sewer in the existing tunnel beneath Petka Hill. An
outfall sewer will convey the effluent some 1,300 m into the sea, from the
tunnel exit on an uninhabited and rocky cliff face to a depth of about 95 m.
Twin plastic pipes of 45 cm diameter laid on the seabed will terminate at a
speciallv designed diffuser section, some 64 m long with about 20 ports of
15 cm. diameter each. An initial dilution in excess of 1 to 400 will be
provided. After allowances for dispersive dilution due to currents (approxi-
mately 0.1 m per second at the diffuser) and for bacterial die-off, the pro-
posed disposal system is expected to preserve the coastal waters in accord-
ance with the Croatian seawater standards.

DUBROV4IK WATER AiD WASTEWATER ENTERPRISE (VODOVOD)
Assumptions For Financial Forecasts
A.   General
In each financial statement explicit provision has been made in
capital and operating costs and in capital receipts and operating revenues
for the effects of inflation from mid-1973. Inflation in operating expenses
has been assumed to be 20% in 1974, 16% in 1975 and 10% thereafter.
Operating expenses and fixed asset costs for the separate services
of water supply and wastewater disposal are, where possible, specifically
identified from the accounts. Expenses on commlon services are arbitrarily
allocated 75% to water supply and 25% to wastewater disposal, a close approx-
imation to the ratio of connections for each service at the end of 1972.
B.   INCOME STATEMENTS
1.   Revenues
The tariffs assumed for water and wastewater are shown in Annex 13.
A weighted average tariff was calculated for ships in 1974 and the proportion
of foreign to Yugoslav ships assumed to remain constant thereafter.
Meter rents are assumed to be an average of Din. 6 per connection,
monthly, in 1974, increasing thereafter for inflation. Other revenue has
been assumed to increase in relation to the numLber of connections.
Connection charges are based upoII estimates of connection costs
derived fromn experience in the years 1970-1972.
2.   Operating Expenses
Salaries and wages, power and materials for maintenance were esti-
iatea on the basis of increased production of water and upon requirements
for the new wastewater systems.
Insurance costs are related to the value of fixed assets in opera-
tion, adjusted for price changes.
Other expenses, taxes and contributionis and extraordinary losses
have been increased relative to water sales.
Provision for bad debts is based upon a formula imposed by the
Social Accounting Service, adjusted to allow for expected limited improvements
in collection patterns.



ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 4 pages
The estimated depreciation rates for water and sewer systems have
been increased from the 1.5% currently used by Vodovod to 2.0%. The remaining
rates used by Vodovod have been continued unchanged. The approximate rates
used are therefore as follows:
Water and sewer pipes,
buildings and reservoirs          2.0%
Electrical equipment                 6.0%
Office equipment                     7.0%
M4echanical plant                   10.0%
Vehicles                            12.0%
Stores and laboratory
equipment                        10.0%
Office furniture                     8.0%
3.   Interest
Interest on loans has been clharged to construction until the end of
1978.
4.   Distribution of Net Income
Contributions to the collective consumption fund are based on the
estimates of Vodovod staff. Contributions to reserves are based on the form-
ula currently in force. In the case of Vodovod the annual reserve fund con-
tribution amounts to 2% of net income before salaries and wages, bad debts
provision, taxes and contributions, extraordinary losses and about 20% of
other expenses.
The remainder of net income is transferred to the Business Fund.
5.   Collective Consumption Fund
All transactions relative to this fund have been excluded from
Vodovod's accounts, the fund itself being treated as having separate accounts.
C.   FUN'DS FLOW STATEMENT
1.   Borrowings
(a) IBRD Loan - Din. 91.5 million, (US$6.0 million
equivalent) including capitalized interest, for
24 years with a 4 year grace period and interest
at 8% per annum;
(b)  Republic Water Fund Loan - Din. 10.0 million
plus interest capitalized until 1980 (Din. 0.87
million), repayment over 40 years, with interest
at 2% per annum;



ANNEX 12
Page  3 of 4 pages
(c) Bank of Dubrovnik Loan - Din. 19.8 million
with interest capitalized during construction
(Din. 0.89 million repayment over 25 years, with
interest at 2% per annum.
2.   Contributions and Grants
(a)  Contribution from the Commune of Dubrovnik - Din.
7.6 million towards the project;
(b)  Equity contributions towards proportions of works
constructed outside the project;
(c)  Contribution from "Babin Kuk" hotel enterprise - Din.
25.0 million towards the project.
3.   Investments and Advances
Based on current practice, additional investments and advances are
assumed to be compulsory investment of the reserve fund and a compulsory loan
for underdeveloped areas.
D.   BALANCE SHEET
1.   Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are shown at current price costs.
2.   Current Assets
The level of inventories has been increased annually to reflect
changes in the size of the system and increasing material costs.
Receivables from consumers represent 4 months sales at the end of
1973 reducing to about 2-1/2 months sales by the end of 1978 and at a constant
ratio thereafter. The receivables figure includes provision for payments by
Vodovod to be recovered from the Collective Consumption Fund. It is also
net of the current provision for bad and doubtful debts.
3.   Equity
No information is available about the extent to which the balance
of the Business Fund on December 31, 1969 includes contributions from con-
sumers and grants from the Commune. For the period from 1970 onwards these
have been shown separately. The Business Fund balance includes the surpluses
arising from various asset revaluations. Consumer contributions in 1970-1972
include assets constructed by consumers and vested in Vodovod on completion.
The negative balance in 1971 arises because assets originally though to be
debt-free were subsequently related to a loan taken over by Vodovod from
another enterprise.

ANNEX 14

DUBROVNIK WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER PROJECT
Suramary of Financial Principles and Regulations
For Enterprises in Yugoslavia
A. Summary of Principles and Regulations
1.        The most important form of business organization in Yugoslavia is
the "Enterprise." The enterprise is independent and has powers to conduct
essentially all transactions necessary to carry on a business.
2.        The "means of production" (fixed assets and working capital) are
"social property" and therefore cannot be sold to increase the personal
income of the working community, which otherwise possesses certain rights in
relation to the socially-owned means of production managed by it.
3.        The Yugoslav constitution provides that the working organization
(enterprise) has the right to decide on the use of socially-owned means and
their disposal and to employ these means so as to gain the greatest returns
for the working organization and the social community.
4.        The Workers' Council, a body elected by the employees of the
enterprise, has the right, among other things, to make decisions about the
distribution of income after payment of costs of operation other than wages
and bonuses, payment of creditors, and payment of taxes.
5.        Essentially the distribution of income is made to cover the
following:
-    obligations towards employee (personal income);
-    obligations towards funds of the enterprise.
6.        The personal income of the employees is subject to the income of
the enterprise after settlement of contractual and legal obligations. If the
latter cannot be met from the income after depreciation, which is regarded
as part of the operating costs, depreciation funds can be used for repayment
of debt.
7.        In determining personal income, the Workers' Council normally
takes into account:
-    that the average minimum rate for a given branch of
industry is maintained;
-    that sufficient funds are provided for "enlarged
reproduction" of the enterprise (funds for plant
expansion);



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2 pages
-    that sufficient funds for maintaining the social
standard of the employees are provided (joint
consumption fund for housing, rest homes, additional
schooling and professional training); and
-    that a reserve fund is established and maintained
for financial contingencies.
8.        In accordance with the relative priority of the various obligations
which have to be met from the income of the enterprise, the Yugoslav account-
ing system recognizes two stages of "profit or loss." However, these inter-
mediate balances in the calculation are better defined as surplus or deficit,
since in the Yugoslav accounting system the cash flow concept is more dis-
tinctly recognizable than the earnings concept.
9.        The first stage in the calculation determines the balance available
to meet legal and contractual obligations; the second stage determines the
balance available to meet requirements for the funds of the enterprise. At
each stage the inability of the enterprise to provide sufficient income to
meet the requirements constitutes a default, which is considered more serious
in the first stage than in the second stage.
10.       The Yugoslav accounting system recognizes depreciation primarily as
a cost of operations. Accumulated depreciation funds are used mainly to
finance replacement of assets. In case of material changes of price levels,
such as those experienced up to 1965, special laws provide for revaluation
of assets and corresponding adjustments in depreciation. Asset revaluations
were made following the January 1971 devaluation of the currency. Repayment
of debt from accumulated depreciation is only allowed in exceptional cases.
B. Conclusions
11.       The financial principles and regulations followed by Yugoslav en-
terprises result in a different presentation of financial results than that
common in non-socialist countries. However, the -basis of accounting is the
same double-entry system used by business firms in non-socialist countries.
12.       The Yugoslav system recognizes the need to generate from revenue
sufficient funds to cover all operating expenses (including depreciation)
and to provide funds for debt service and reserves for replacement of assets
and additional investments in the business or in social facilities for the
employees.
13.       A presentation of financial forecasts for Vodovod in the form of
common in non-socialist countries is not in conflict with Yugoslav financial
practice, even though the format of future actual financial statements for
Vodovod would be different. Covenants for financial performance can be based
on the format used for projections, since the future actual financial state-
ments of Vodovod can be converted into this format for purposes of supervison.

Internal Cash Ratio
As explained in the text of the report (para 6.12) Vodovod's present
tariffs require to be progressively raised over the next few years so as to
generate adequate funds for construction during the project construction per-
iod and for debt service and contribution towards future development after
the project becomes operational.  A suitable standard rate of return covenant,
relating net income after depreciation, but before interest, to net fixed
assets in operation will achieve the desired results once the project is in
operation. However, during construction, project costs will be excluded from
the conventional rate base, even though internal funds are required towards
these costs. Consequently, a rate of return in the conventional range of
6%o-8% will easily be achieved without the tariff increases necessary to fi-
nance a reasonable share of construction costs and without providing for the
progressive tariff increases explained in para 6.14. One remedy would be to
include project construction costs as part of the fixed assets base until the
assets are brought into operation. A reconmnended alternative is to calculate
"internal cash ratios". These ratios relate net cash availability, after
neeting contractual obligations (e.g. debt service), and other cash require-
ments (e.g. dividends), to the organization's gross fixed asset values, in-
cluding fixed assets under construction. The appropriate ratio is determined
uniquely for each entity and does not lend itself to interfirm comparisons.
Hlowever, adherence to a required ratio directs attention towards the way in
which compulsory or discretionary prior cash requirements reduce the funds
available for expansion of the entity's activities. In the case of Vodovod
Dubrovnik, this is particularly meaningful because, as well as allowing for
debt service, it also highlights the effect of the compulsory investments and
contributions to the Collective Consumption Fund.
Details of the "internal cash ratios" for Vodovod Dubrovnik are shown
on the following table indicating that a requirement of about 4% during proj-
ect construction will achieve satisfactory results.  5%/ will be achieved dur-
ing the first year of construction (1975) only if tariff increases are imple-
mented on January 1, 1975.  This may not be possible for administrative rea-
sons, and the cash ratio requirement for this year has been left at 4%.
