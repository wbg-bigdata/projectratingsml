INTERNATIONAL BANK FM RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEIOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATEON OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
BDTSWANA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
1        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Botswana Development Corporation with the guarantee of the
Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of $4.0 million to help finance the
import component of sub-loans and investments made by this development finance
company. The loan would bear interest at 7-1/4 pereent per annum and the repay-
ment schedule would conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization
schedules for sub-loans and the fixed repayment schedales for investments. A
3/4 of one percent commitment charge would be applied only on the amounts not
withdrawn after sub-loans or investments have been authorized by the Bank.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Although no economic report has been produced on Botswana since
1971 (Report No. AE-18), the staff has been following economic developments
and the following is based on current information. A special creditworthiness
mission visited Botswana in February 1974, and an economic mission began
work in the country in May. Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.        The population of Botswana is currently estimated at 640,000, with
approximately 50,000 citizens absent, mainly as migrant laborers in South
Africa. Domestic wage employment is estimated at approximately 30,000, and
is projected to grow to 60,000 by 1978. The majority of the population
remains dependent for their livelihoods on subsistence agriculture with
household incomes frequently supplemented by remittances from relatives in
wage employment.
4.        The climate of Botswana is semi-arid, with erratic and inadequate
rainfall. In recent times the country has experienced drought seven years
out of ten, and suffered a major loss of livestock at least once a decade.
Nevertheless, the country's semi-arid range lands are well suited for
extensive ranching, and cattle are the mainstay of the rural economy.
Arable farming is a hazardous occupation, although with sound crop husbandry
a subsistence yield can almost always be obtained and in good years crop
production can even be highly profitable.
5.        The country is well endowed with mineral resources, particularly
diamonds, nickel, copper, and coal, which have only recently been discovered.
A major obstacle to their exploitation is the shortage of water. There are
no perennial rivers, except in the north-west, where the Okavango spreads
out in a wide delta. Possibilities for the exploitation of the large water
potential of the Okavango are being studied through a major technical assis-
tance project funded under the United Nations Development Program. Most of
the population and livestock presently depends on underground water, which
in many instances is not being sufficientlyrecharged from rainfall.



- 2 -
6.        Together with Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland, Botswana belongs
to the Southern African Customs Union. Under this union, which has been in
existence from 1910, all customs, excise and sales duties collected in the
customs area are paid into a common revenue pool administered by South Africa.
In 1969, the customs union agreement between the four countries was renego-
tiated; this provided the three smaller countries with substantially increased
revenues. Under the customs agreement, there is also a free flow of funds
and goods within the area, which allows Botswana's industries duty free access
to the large South African market. Few industries have been started so far,
but the Botswana Development Corporation, created in 1970, is making advances
in this direction. A number of projects have been identified, and a few are
ready for implementation.
7.        The country's infrastructure is poorly developed.    The main roads
have gravel or unmade surfaces, to which most villages are linked by sand
tracks. A railway runs only from north to south through the populated eastern
side of the country, linking South Africa with Southern Rhodesia, and the
nearest port is over 1,000 miles away. Power is available only in the main
urban centers and is expensive, being produced locally from small generators.
8.        Botswana's economic position has improved remarkably during the
past five years. The gross domestic product has risen from $64 millior. in
1967/68 to $132 million in 1971/72. Gross national product is tentatively
estimated at $109 million for 1971/72. For the 1968/72 period it is estimated
that the real rate of growth of GNP has been approximately 15 percent per
annum. The growth in the value of exports during the past four years was
nearly 50 percent per annum, rising from $19.5 million in 1969/70 to $64.5
million in 1972/73. These high rates of growth in production and exports are
largely attributable to two factors. First, there has been a rapid growth in
the value of livestock production, stimulated by a highly favorable inter-
national market for beef, with export sales rising from $10.5 million in 1966
to $30 million in 1972. Second, a large mining sector has been developed.
The De Beers diamond mine at Orapa (developed with an investment of approxi-
mately $33 million) went into full production in 1972 with total sales of
approximately $30 million per annum. The Shashe mining complex at Selebi-
Pikwe (developed with an investment of about $270 million in mining and
processing facilities and infrastructure) commenced production in 1973. The
mine will produce nickel, copper and sulphur. The value of annual production
is likely to be over $75 million at present prices. Although mining develop-
ment is very capital intensive and is not expected to absorb the natural
increase in the labor force, a substantial portion of the expected benefits
will accrue to the Government through royalties, taxes, and dividends which
the Government will be able to use for general development purposes.
9.        In recent years there has been a dramatic improvement in Botswana's
public finances. In 1967/68, the first full year of independence, the total
recurrent expenditure amounted to $18.75 million of which $8.85 million was
financed by Britain. In 1972/73, although recurrent expenditure had climbed
to $43.4 million, there was sufficient domestic revenue to generate a surplus
of $4.4 million. Botswana is therefore now able to devote a portion of its
domestic resources to funding the public sector investment program.



- 3 -
10.       Botswana has pursued a progressive economic and social program,
with a major effort being made to implement well-defined policies for rural
development and a more egalitarian income distribution. The Government has
a well-staffed and effective planning organization. Botswana has recently
adopted a National Development Plan (N.D.P. 1973-78), which provides a
comprehensive statement of national policy and priorities. The Plan has
two central aims: (a) to create 30,000 new jobs by 1978, equivalent to a
9 percent per annum growth in wage employment; (b) to improve the welfare
of the mass of the population who live in the rural areas. The Plan places
particular emphasis on agricultural development and on improving rural
services (e.g., roads, education, health, water supplies). The Plan provides
a comprehensive assessment of resources and specifies their proposed uses.
11.       The Plan projects GNP (at factor cost in constant 1973 prices) to
reach $239 million in 1978, representing a real rate of growth of 14 percent
per annum. This high growth rate is forecast primarily on the basis of pro-
spective mining developments together with related increases in public
utilities, civil construction, and services, and implies that GNP per capita
will rise from $176 in 1971 to almost $330 in 1978. These estimates for
future growth, however, are considered to be very conservative, and a more
realistic assessment could imply that GNP per capita will exceed $500 in 1978.
The NDP contains a total investment program of $350 million (1973 prices)
over the next five years of which about two-thirds ($231 million) is expected
to be contributed by the public sector. The Plan estimates that $67 million
will be provided from domestic revenue for public investment during 1973/78
(about 29% of the total requirement), and that a further $164 million is to
be sought from external sources. The likelihood is strong, however, that
Botswana will be able to finance almost half of the public investment program
from domestic revenue. The main bilateral sources of assistance are expected
to be Britain, Sweden, and Canada, who will finance a wide variety of projects.
In addition, Germany, USAID, and Denmark have agreed to provide finance for
road development and Norway for rural development.
12.       The major constraint to the implementation of the Plan is the
shortage of trained and experienced manpower.   Botswana reached independence
with very few citizens possessing any post-primary education. Ten years ago
less than 30 pupils completed five years of secondary education each year.
A remarkable expansion of secondary education has taken place with total
enrollment rising from some 1,500 in 1966 to 5,500 in 1972. Vocational
training, however, has lagged behind and only recently has an adequate plan
been prepared for the training of artisans and technicians. Although a
Vocational Training Institute was established in 1973, it is still doubtful
whether sufficient job-oriented training can be undertaken through existing
facilities.
13.       Despite the large borrowing for the infrastructure for the Shashe
complex, the overall public debt burden of Botswana is not great. Total
disbursed public debt amounted to $69 million in mid-1973, or approximately
50 percent of GDP, and is expected to rise to $120 million by 1978. Taking
into account the estimated income effects of the :.mbitious public sector



investment program, this would represent 42 percent of GDP. The estimated
cost of servicing the public debt is 3.6 percent of domestic revenues and
2 percent of export earnings in 1973/74 and Ls projected to amount to 6
percent of domestic revenues and 2.7 percent of export earnings in 1977/78.
As a result of Botswana's consistently high level of economic management and
the country's favorable export prospects, the Bank has reviewed Botswana's
ability to service debt on conventional terms and considers the country
creditworthy for Bank loans.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERAIIONS IN BOTSWANA
14.       Bank Group operations commenced in the territory that is now
Botswana, before it became independent in 1967, with a road project in 1964.
To date there have been seven projects, financed by six IDA credits amounting
to S16 million, and a loan of $37.5 million. A $3.0 million credit for an
urban development project in Francistown was signed in May 1974; this project
will be a major step towards coping with the rapid rate of urbanization. The
IDA credits have also financed two road projects, a water supply project, a
livestock project, and engineering studies on the infrastructure relating to
the Shashe mining complex. The latter credit was partially refinanced by the
subsequent Bank loan for the Shashe Infrastructure Project. As of December 31,
1972, the Bank Group's share in Botswana's total debt (disbursed and undisbursed)
was 54 percent, while its share in Botswana's total debt service payments in
1973 was 53 percent. A summary statement of the Bank loan and IDA credits to
Botswana is given in Annex II, together with notes on the execution of on-going
projects. No IF C loans or investments have been made in Botswana.
15.       The overall performance of Botswana in the planning and execution
of development projects has been satisfactory. The completion on schedule
of the major parts of the large Shashe mining complex (para 8) has been a
remarkable accomplishment, although a substantial cost over-run has been
encountered. A supplementary loan of US$5.5 million to help finance the cost
over-run of the Shashe Infrastructure project was signed in June 1974. The
progress on the Gaborone-Lobatse road is ahead of schedule although the execu-
tion of the Gaborone-Lobatse water supply project has been slow due to poor
performance by the civil works contractors.   The credit for the livestock proj-
ect became effective in April 1973, and implementation is now underway.
16.       We propose to continue our active support for the Government's
strategy for social and economic progress as spelled out in the National
Development Plan. We propose to concentrate our future lending in three
areas (a) the raising of rural income levels by improving livestock production,
which is the major occupation, (b) the linking up of population centers by
helping to develop the transportation system, and (c) the establishment of
light industry to provide employment. The Government, assisted by the Bank
Group and other agencies, is preparing suitable projects in these sectors.



PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
17.       Botswana has, as yet, few industries.   In the past, the lack of
knowledge of the country's resources, the poorly developed infrastructure,
the absence of services and trained manpower, and the small size of domestic
markets have all impeded investment in industry. Since independence, however,
Botswana has made a major effort to promote industrialization. Furthermore,
with the revision of the Southern African Customs Union Agreement (1969), the
earlier arrangements which gave the products of South African industry un-
restricted entry into Botswana without any reciprocal arrangements, were
largely removed.
18.       The contribution of manufacturing to the gross domestic product is
approximately $12 million per year, of which nearly 80 percent is derived
from the operations of the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC). It is estimated
that the value added of the manufacturing sector doubled in the past five
years and employment grew from about 2,000 in 1969 to about 2,700 in 1972.
19.       In April 1973, there were 29 manufacturing enterprises licensed
under the Industrial Licensing Act (1968), which requires licensing of all
manufacturing establishments either employing over nine workers or using
25 horsepower or more of energy. In addition, however, there were a number
of small non-manufacturing enterprises such as service industries, construc-
tion firms, quarries, mines, and mills. Most of these industries are located
in three towns: Lobatse, Gaborone, and Francistown.
20.       Tne Botswana Government gives the highest priority to the creation
of new job opportunities. As the scope for increasing employment in the
agricultural sector is limited by the semi-arid climate and the scarcity of
water, emphasis has to be on the mining, industrial, commercial and related
sectors. The National Plan envisages the creation of over 3,000 new jobs
during 1973/78 by the expansion of manufacturing and processing industry.
This is estimated to require an investment of over $22 million.
Scope for Industrial Development
21.       Botswana's small population and low income levels limit the local
market available to new industries. The Southern African Customs Union
Agreement, however, provides for unrestricted access by industries that may
be established in Botswana to the rich South, Africa market. Therefore,
there is a potential market for a variety of goods which Botswana firms could
manufacture. The fact that about $900 million worth of manufactured goods
were imported into the Southern African Customs Union during 1971, indicates
the gap between local demand and production.
22.       The development of mineral deposits is bringing about a transformation
in the Botswana economy which should provide the stimulus for industrial and
commercial development. The diamond mine at Orapa is of necessity an enclave
development, which will induce little further development. The copper-nickel



- 6 -
mine at Selebi-Pikwe, however, should form a focus for secondary and tertiary
development and the proposed development of further mineral deposits will
provide additional foci for such development linkages. There is scope for
the creation of industries linked to mineral production such as a jewellery
industry for the production of industrial abrasives and semi-precious gemstones,
a chemical industry using sulphur, brine products and coal, and a glass industry
based on soda-ash deposits. There are also known to be resources of clay,
gypsum, limestone and silicacious earths. The United Nations Industrial Devel-
opment Organization has been asked to assist in planning for a group of indus-
tries to use these materials to manufacture such products as low-tension
electrical insulators, tiles, crockery, refractories, tablewares and building
materials.
23.       The agricultural sector also offers opportunities for industrial
development. Using the by-products of the meat industry, it is proposed to
develop a tannery and other processing industries such as those for the
manufacture of wax and candles, soap and brushes. Milling enterprises could
be established using locally-produced agricultural products.
24.       Some scope also exists for the establishment of labor-intensive
manufacturing enterprises such as ready-made garment industries and light
assembly plants for bicycle and agricultural implements. Some of the other
sectors which hold promise for industrial development are referred to in the
later sections dealing with the Botswana Development Corporation (para. 45).
25.       The Government is aware of the need to design a strategy for
industrial development which would allow it to take full advantage both
of its resources and the Customs Union Agreement of 1969. The Bank Group
is attempting to assist the Government in this task by including an industrial
economist in its 1974 economic mission who would try to analyze and advise
on an appropriate policy framework and identify priority areas for external
technical and capital assistance.
Incentives for Industrial Development
26.       The Government has taken significant steps in the last few years
to establish the institutional and legal framework, provide incentives for
investment, and develop the necessary infrastructure for attracting and
inducing the growth of enterprises. In 1970 the Botswana Development
Corporation (BDC) was set up to promote industrial and commercial ventures
and to manage the Government's existing investments in industry, commerce
and tourism. In 1972 the Batswana Enterprises Development Program
was initiated with the goal of assisting in the creation and development
of enterprises owned and managed by local entrepreneurs. The program is
now being carried out by the Batswana Enterprises Development Unit (BEDU)
which is providing capital, technical expertise and training. The Unit is
located in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which was created in
April 1973 to formulate industrial and commercial policy.



-7-
27.       Another development-oriented institution, the National Development
Bank (NDB), was established in May 1964 to lend for the development of agri-
culture, livestock, and housing. At the end of 1972, NDB had granted approxi-
mately 3,000 loans totalling R 1.3 million. In 1968 and 1969, before the
establishment of BDC, NDB made loans totalling R 250,000 to small businessmen
in commerce and industry, but since then its lending has been directed towards
agriculture and housing. It is expected, however, that NDB will provide
financial assistance to Batswana entrepreneurs under the Batswana Enterprises
D vlopment Program. NDB loans are made at 8% per annum (p.a.) for a maximum
o1iU years.
28.       There are two London-based commercial banks, Barclays Bank and
Standard Bank, that operate in Botswana. Most of their loans are short term
in nature, with lending rates ranging between 9% and 11% p.a. Most loans are
extended to cattlemen on a fluctuating overdraft basis at 10% p.a. Until now,
these commercial banks have not been active in providing term finance to the
economy.
29.       Botswana's tax system offers generous incentives to prospective
investors. For instance, (a) new manufacturing plant qualifies for a 25%
free investment allowance, (b) capital expenditure may be written off imme-
diately and any tax losses incurred may be carried forward to future years,
and (c) the rate of income tax on companies is only 30%. In addition, to
further Government's policy of localization, 125% of the costs of approved
training schemes can be charged as an expense for tax purposes. Moreover,
Botswana is permitted (under the Customs Union Agreement) to protect infant
industries by applying duties to imports from South Africa, as well as from
countries outside the Customs Union. At the same time, if any industry in
Botswana is able to supply over 60% of the demand in the entire Customs
Union for a particular commodity, it can apply for protection against imports
from outside the Union. Such protection, if granted, would apply to imports
into the whole of the Customs Union.
30.       The Government is also attempting to provide sufficient serviced
land for the location of industry: over 250 hectares of serviced land is
being provided for industrial use during 1974-78 at Gaborone, Francistown,
Lobatse and the new township at Selebi-Pikwe.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Botswana Development Corporation"
(394a-BT) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A Loan
and Project Summary is provided as Annex III.
Background
32.       An identification mission visited Botswana in March 1973 for dis-
cussions with BDC, and concluded that given BDC's important role and need
for resources, Bank assistance would be desirable. An appraisal took place



in October 1973 and negotiations were held in Washington in mid-May 1974.
The Botswana delegation was led by Mr. H.C.L. Hermans, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning and inlluded Mr. Ralph C. Stephens,
Managing Director of the BDC.
33.       The Botswana Development Corporation (BDC) was established in
April 1970, as a limited liability company whose share capital is wholly
owned by the Government, to promote and facilitate the development of indus-
trial, commercial, and agricultural enterprises within the framework of the
Government's plan for economic development. BDC's Memorandum of Association
gives it considerable flexibility in determining the scope of its operations.
It states that BDC "shall conduct its business affairs upon a commercial
basis, and in a prompt, efficient and economic manner. It shall exercise
special care and give due regard to the economic and commercial merits of
any undertaking it promotes, assists, finances or manages, so that, taking
one year with another, it shall not be allowed to operate at a loss; however,
though each such undertaking should be evaluated on its strict merits, never-
theless such evaluation should include consideration of the overall, long-term
economic interests in and benefits to Botswana." By necessity, BDC performs
a basic entrepreneurial role in conceiving and developing projects and is the
principal instrument of the Government for accelerating the development of
commercial business enterprises in a variety of sectors. Unlike most develop-
ment finance companies, BDC has had to develop many of its operations through
subsidiaries for which it endeavors to find external management.
Capital Structure and Resources
34.       As of March 31, 1974, BDC had a net worth of about R 2.9 million.
The Botswana Government owns 100% of the paid-in share capital of R 1.95
million, which was subscribed with cash, a transfer of Government assets
(mostly in tourism), and capitalization of revenues from the sugar trade.
With respect to the sugar trade, BDC is acting as the Government's agency
for purchasing sugar, and is receiving the revenues resulting from the dif-
ferential between the market price and the import price. The Government has
also made available to BDC a loan of R 160,000 to help finance BDC's office
building, and a loan of R 2.5 million, mainly for development of the commercial
center of Selebi-Pikwe. A Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) loan
of R 430,000, was also made for the office building, and represents BDC's
only foreign debt.
Management and Organization
35.       BDC is managed by a Board of eleven directors including the Chairman,
who is the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning, and the Managing Director. All the Board members are appointed b.y
the Government. Besides the Managing Director there are five official members
who represent various Governmental agencies and five who are professional men
engaged in agriculture, banking and commerce.



- 9 -
36.       The Board has delegated all its operational responsibilities to an
Executive Committee of four directors, which has been meeting every two months
and is performing well. At present, BDC's activities are primarily carried
out by its investments department, but it intends to move progressively towards
an organizational structure comprising various sector divisions under the
overall direction of a Management Committee made up of the Managing Director,
the Chief Accountant, the Administration Officer, and two senior investment
officers.
37.       The Managing Director is an able investment banker.   He has been
with the BDC since 1972 on a two-year contract which has recently been re-
newed for another two years. He has developed an effective and very enter-
prising staff of eleven professionals, of whom two are Batswana. Attempts
are also being made by BDC to further localize its staff through a program
of training and scholarships.
Operating Policies and Procedures
38.       BDC's original policy statement, adopted in April 1972, specified
only two investment limits and did not provide sufficient guidelines for
all of BDC's proposed activities. Based on Bank recommendations,BDC has
agreed to adopt a more comprehensive policy statement. The salient provisions
of this statement are:
(i) BDC will not normally invest more than 25% of its net worth
in the form of loans or share capital in any one project,
and will not, except in the case of subsidiary companies,
finance more than 50% of the project's cost;
(ii) BDC will not normally manage enterprises; although it will
take special care to ensure sound management arrangements for
the projects it finances;
(iii) BDC's aggregate equity investments will not exceed its net
worth;
(iv) BDC shall protect itself against foreign exchange risk and
charge lending rates which are compatible with the market
rates and which will enable it to earn a reasonable return.
39.       So far, BDC has either acquired or set up subsidiaries for
commercial property development, housing construction, transport, and leas-
ing operations. Financial and insurance subsidiaries are also planned (para.
46). Since BDC either manages its subsidiaries directly, or at least super-
vises them closely, they could become a fairly heavy administrative burden
as additional subsidiaries are set up. Where necessary, steps would need
to be taken to acquire additional managerial expertise for these subsidiaries,
in accordance with the new policy statement.



- 10 -
40.       Most of EDC's lending until now has been to its own subsidiary
companies in the form of loans on demand, for which no loan agreements have
been drafted. These arrangements are now being modified. In future, BDC's
subsidiaries will be capitalized with adequate equity and loans with fixed
amortization schedules. Moreover, prior to its first submission of a project
to the Bank, EDC will submit for approval a draft standard loan agreement.
41.       To date, most BDC loans have been made at an interest rate of 9% p.a.
So far, no loans have been made in foreign currency. In accordance with its
Policy Statement, BDC has decided to raise its annual lending rate to 10% p.a.,
which is in line with interest rates currently charged by commercial banks.
lTe only exception relates to projects which are economically and socially
desirable but have low financial rates of return. In these cases, BDC will
charge less than 10% p.a., but will limit the total amount of such loans to
10% of its net worth.
42.       Given BDC's promotional role, BDC initially relies on feasibility
studies made by experts--most of whom are paid under foreign technical
assistance--or by foreign sponsoring firms. BDC reviews the feasibility
studies and prepares memoranda for the Executive Committee, assessing the
alternatives and the financial and economic merits of project proposals. It
also reports on the development of the projects so that the Executive Committee
is informed of the evolution of each project. Since BDC is a young and small
institution, with a prominent role in promotion, this procedure appears
adequate for BDC's present activity. BDC has been informed, however, that
the Bank would need full appraisal reports on each project to be financed
out of the Loan at the time of authorization, and BDC has agreed to prepare
such reports.
43.       The financial analysis of projects has been done well but the
economic analysis has been less satisfactory. Because of this, BDC's Board
decided in 1973 that all projects should be the subject of a thorough cost/
benefit analysis, including an economic rate of return analysis. The Bank
is assisting BDC in developing its skills in this area. On the technical
side, BDC has relied on foreign consultants, either to make feasibility
studies or to check technical studies submitted by its potential foreign
associates.
Operations and Pbrtfolio
4h.       As of March 31, 1974, BDC'c portfolio comprised loans and investments
in 24 enterprises, with loans totalling about R 2.1 million in 12 enterprises
and investments totalling about R 220,000 in 21 enterprises. About 26% of
BDC's portfolio comprised former Government loans and investments in tourism
(hotels) which were passed on to EDC during FY73. Loan size has averaged about
R 200,000 with the largest loan (R 58o,000) being made to its commercial



- 11 -
property subsidiary. Most enterprises in which BDC has made loans or
investments are profitable. BDC's profits after taxes amounted to 29%
of average net worth in FY73.   Net worth increased by about 100% between
FY72 and FY73, primarily because of the capitalization of revenues from the
sugar trade. This increase in net worth, combined with a forecast reduction
in sugar revenues, is expected to cause profits after taxes and provision for
losses as a percentage of average net worth to decline to a low of 2.5% in
FY75, after which the percentage will start increasing with loau and investment
income. Revenues from the sugar trade (para. 34) represented 79% of all income in
FY73, but are expected to decline to 16% in FY76 and 11% in FY78. However,
expenses in all years from FY73 to FY78 are expected to be covered by income
from sources other than the sugar trade. Total assets are forecast to in-
crease substantially during the period FY73-FY78, from R 2.5 million in FY73
to R 11.6 million in FY78. The debt/equity ratio is also forecast to rise
from zero in FY73 to 2.3/1 in FY78. BDC has agreed to a maximum debt/equity
ratio of 3/1 as a borrowing limit. BDC's debt service capacity will be
adequate; interest and principal coverage will reach a low of 1.4/1 in FY75,
increasing to 1.7/1 in FY78.
45.       BDC's loans and investments cover the rather varied fields of transport,
tourism, real estate development, industry, construction and financial serv-
ices such as insurance and leasing. At the Government's request BDC has also
recently purchased four farms and has taken over the Government's sharehold-
ings in an irrigation company. In particular, BDC has achieved significant
progress in three main areas:
(a) identifying loan and investment opportunities in the manufacturing
sector. It has conducted studies, identified and developed
specific projects, and contacted potential investors and
sponsors (abroad and in Botswana), resulting in a consider-
able pipeline of potentially viable projects;
(b) developing commercial properties, primarily in Selebi-Pikwe
where, at the request of the Government, it took charge of
the development of the commercial center; and
(c) promoting the development of tourism including the taking
over of the Government's investments in hotels.
Recently BDC has sponsored a feasibility study on tourism possibilities in
Botswana to determine investment opportunities. The annual number of foreign
visitors is excpected to increase from an estimated 57,000 at present to
100,000 in 1977. Because of the acute shortage of good accommodations in
the south-eastern part of the country, BDC is also developing hotel projects
in that area.
46.       In keeping with the Government's objectives, the BDC has increasingly
focused its attention on the identification of loan and investment opportunities.
Most of the proposed ventures are still at the planning and negotiation stage, but
a few are quite advanced. These include a tannery (estimated cost R 1 million),



- 12 -
a ceramics project (estimated cost R 2.5 million), a beverage project (estimated
cost R 2 million), a bicycle assembly plant, hotels at Selebi-Pikwe (estimated
cost R 875,000) and Francistown, and further development of a tire plant (which
was promoted by BDC). BDC also has plans to create new institutions, such as
a full line insurance company and a finance company. The latter would likely
be developed in association with Standard Bank, Barclays Bank, the NDB, and
the Sardanis Group (Zambia) for the purpose of performing financial services
that the commercial banks do not offer at present. At the start, this new
institution, whose total resources are expected to amount to R 1 to 1.5 million,
will focus on hire purchase schemes for vehicles and provide loans for construc-
tion of houses and buildings.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
47.       Projections of BDC's operations envisage commitments totalling R 11.3
million between FY1974 and FY1978. The largest proportion of these commitments
are forecast to be made in commercial property (32%), followed by industrial
enterprises (23%), and tourism (15%).  Commitments in agricultural enterprises,
industrial estates, transport, and residential property account for the remainder
(30%). BDC's portfolio is expected to consist of 70% loans and 30% equity. BDC
anticipates that commitments will amount to R 2.85 million in FY75, R 2.65 million
in FY76, and R 2.0 million thereafter.  In FY75 and FY76, 56% of its commitments
are expected to be in productive enterprises, 33% in property development, and
11% in industrial estates. The import component of the commitments is estimated
to average 75% and, since BDC will not normally finance more than 50% of a
project's total cost, its commitments would usually finance less than the
import component.
48.       The proposed Bank loan of $4.0 million would be used to finance approx-
imately 70% of BDC's foreign exchange requirements (50% of its total requirement)
through FY 1976, including $800,000 for the commercial development of Selebi-Pikwe.
The other major projects would include the tannery, the beverage project and the
hotel in Selebi-Pikwe. These projects are expected to be profitable, and have
satisfactory economic rates of return. The remaining financial requirements would
be met by the Government through its recent R 2.5 million loan, or by new borrowings.
Terms of Proposed Loon
49.       The proposed Bank loan would be to EDC on the normal terms and conditions
for lines of credit to development finance companies. In line with Bank policy
regarding relatively new institutions, BDC would be allowed concessional treatment
for the commitment charge (i.e., the charge would only apply from the date sub-
loans or investments are authorized by the Bank). The sub-borrowers of the Bank
loan would normally assume the foreign exchange risk except for small loans (below
$75,000) t,ich are typically made to small enterprises and which are expected to
absorb only a small portion of the Bank loan proceeds. The Government has indicated
that it intends to protect BDC against any substantial net financial losses resulting
from exchange rate fluctuations on BDC's sub-loans. The amortization schedules for
BDC's sub-loans would not normally extend beyond 15 years from the date of approval
by the Bank. The Bank would require prior approval for each project using $75,000
or more' of the proposed loan. The aggregate free limit would be $800,000. The pro-
posed loan would be used to finance the c.i.f. cost of imported goods, the foreign
exchange cost of ancillary services, and the foreign exchange component of civil
works and imported goods purchased locally through normal trade channels.
The loan would not be used for property development projects, except



- 13 -
for a maximum axount oif $800,000 to help finance the commercial development
in Selebi-?ikwe (para. 48).
50.       Since commitnents for some sub-projects to be financed from the
Bank loan proceeds have already been made by EDC and since disbursements
were started after the sub-projects had been reviewed by Bank staff during
the appraisal nrssian, the proposed loan includes an amount of up to $300,000
for retroactive financing of B)C's expenditures since February 1, 1974, subject
to the prior approval of the smb-projects by the Bank.
Benefits and Justif ication
51.       The size of the Botswana economy and the lack of private entre-
pretneurs required the creatlon of a multi-purpose development agency which
would identify investment possibilities, evaluate their economic and finan-
cial merits, attract foreign enterprises by offering participation and support,
assist potential business ventures by providing financial and management
assistance, and take over and manage the Government's existing investments
in productive enterprises. In 1970, the Botswana Development Corporation was
set up to perform these functions.
52.       Although the BDC is a young organization, it has already made a
significant contribution to the economy through its investments in 24 enter-
prises, many of which were also promoted and established by the BDC. The
organization has good prospects to expand its operations and to possibly
assume an even larger role in channeling productive investment into the
industrial sector by assisting in the creation of new financial institutions.
BDC's relationship with the Bank Group should also enable it to improve its
economic appraisal and investment skills, resulting in improved resource
allocation in the Botswana economy.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Botswana Develop-
ment Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Botswana and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
56.       Except as regards the special features referred to in paras. 44
arnd 50, the draft aKreements conform to the normal pattern for loans to
development finance companies.



- 14 -
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION--
Credit No. 233      Gaborone-Lobatse Water Supply Project:    $3.0 million
credit of February 10, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
The Project is expected to be completed shortly -
almost 2 years late - primarily because of the poor
performance of civil works contractors. The closing
date has been extended to March 31, 1975. Because of
exceptional rains in 1971/72, no major water supply
problems are expected at Lobatse as a result of the
construction delays. The provisional arrangement under
which the khter Utilities Corporation's Gaborone-
Lobatse Division was staffed through agency agreements
has now been replaced by permanent staffing arrangements.
Loan No. 776         Shashe Infrastructure Project:  $32 million loan of
June 31, 1973; Closing Date: November 1, 1975. $5.5
million supplemental loan of June 7, 1974.
Work on the Infrastructure Project has proceeded satis-
factorily with the main aspects nearing completion. Power
and water were made available to the Mining Company (BCL)
on various dates well ahead of the agreed target date of
October 1, 1973. A net increase in the cost of the
project is to be met in part by a supplemental Bank loan
signed on June 7, 1974.
Credit No. 303       Second Road Project:  $2.0 million credit of April 27,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976
The construction of the Gaborone-Lobatse road is ahead
of schedule. The quality of the contractor's work and
the consultant's supervisory services is good.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered and action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Credit No. 325         Livestock Development Project:  $1.65 milliol credit of
June 30, 1972; Closing Datet June 30, 1977
The Project was declared effective on April 30, 1973 and
implementation is now getting underway. Some delays were
experienced in recruiting the requisite key personnel but
they have now taken up their positions and are recruiting
staff, purchasing equipment, and developing a work program.
Credit No. 471         Francistown Urban Development Project:  $3.00 million
credit of May 9, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is not yet effective.

WAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Botswana Development Corporation
Guarantor:                 RepubLic of Botswana
Amount:                    US$4.0 million equivalent
Terms:                     Repayable substantially in conformity with the
aggregate of the amortization schedules for sub-
loans and investments for which withdrawals from
the loan amount are made; interest at 1-1/4 percent
per annum; commitment charge of 3/4 of one percent
on the amount of each sub-loan or investent to accrue
as from their various dates of approval by the Bank.
Relending Terms:           BDC would normally lend at prevailing market rates,
currently 10 percent per annum. BDC would normally
pass on the foreign exchange risk to its borrowers,
except in cases of small loans (below $75,000). The
Government has indicated that it intends to protect
BDC against any substantial net financial losses
resulting from exchange rate fluctuations on
BDC's sub-loans.
Purpose:                   The loan would assist EDC in meeting its estimated
commitments for financing the import component of
its sub-projects.
Free Limit:                Us$75,ooo for individual sub-projects; US$800,000
aggregate linit.
Debt Covenants:            Maximum debt/equity ratio of 3:1
