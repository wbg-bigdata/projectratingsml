INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO FOR A SECOND IHIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$29 million to help finance
a project for highway construction and maintenance. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Morocco' (R71-220) was distributed to the Executive Directors in September
1971. More recent economic information is given below. An economic mission
visited Morocco in September 1973, and is currently preparing its report. A
country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Morocco's traditional social and political order has been essentially
maintained since independence in 1956, despite two abortive attempts against
the monarchy, while the country's economic structure has been changing grad-
ually. In agriculture, the small modern sector has expanded, specializing in
commercial crops mainly for export, but subsistence farming remains the main-
stay of more than half of Morocco's active population. In industry, the rel-
ative importance of modern manufacturing has risen slowly, but phosphate mining
is still the main industrial activity. Traditional crafts and services have
continued to provide substantial employment. International tourist traffic
has been attracted to Morocco and tourism has become the economy's most dy-
namic sector. Despite these changes, the economy remains vulnerable to
droughts which from time to time set back agricultural output and incomes.
With only moderate economic expansion and rapid population growth, unemploy-
ment and underemployment have reached high levels. The differences in cultural
and economic status between regions and population groups remain substantial.
Past Developments
4.        The growth of the Moroccan economy at an average annual rate of 2.7
percent barely kept pace with population increases from 1956 to 1967. Invest-
ment, which showed a moderate expansion, was only about 13 percent of GNP by
1967. With the implementation of the Second Development Plan (1968-72), there
was a sizeable increase in public investment. Private investment which did
well during the initial years became more sluggish later because of economic
and political uncertainties in 1971 and 1972. Total investment ranged between
13 and 15 percent of GNP, compared to the Plan target of 17 percent. Aided by
favorable weather and consequent good crops, economic growth nonetheless ac-
celerated to an average annual rate of 5.6 percent in 1967-72, thus exceeding
the Plan target of 4.3 percent. Agriculture grew by 6 percent a year and
manufacturing by 5.3 percent during the Second Plan period.



-2-
5.        At the same time, the implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal
policies resulted in a significant improvement in Morocco's financial position.
Domestically, a combination of new tax measures, higher income from state en-
terprises and expenditure restraint led to an increase in Government savings,
but private savings remained relatively low.   Externally, Morocco's balance
of payments began to move into surplus in 1969 attaining a level of $75 mil-
lion in 1972. Current receipts increased in the last four years by 11 per-
cent annually mainly due to tourism, workers' remittances and phosphate ex-
ports. Gross public capital flows also increased initially but, when invest-
ment stagnated in 1972, they fell to about their old level of $130 million a
year. Stagnation of investments also lowered the import of equipment goods.
The improvement in Morocco's foreign accounts explains why net foreign assets
climbed in December 1972 to $279 million, equivalent to 3.5 months of 1972 im-
ports (goods and non-factor services).
6.        Economic expansion was not enough, however, to absorb all new addi-
tions to the labor force during the Second Plan period. The annual addition
to the labor force is estimated at 100,000 per year. Emigration relieved the
unemployment situation; an estimated 250,000 Moroccans were working outside
the country in 1972 and about 30,000 workers per year emigrated during 1970-
72. Despite increases in the work relief program, there were still more than
350,000 unemployed or 15 percent of the labor force outside agriculture.
The Short-Term Outlook
7.        The outlook for 1973 is dominated by a poor cereals crop (about 30
percent smaller than in 1972) due to drought conditions in the southern half
of the country. This has reduced farm income and slowed down the growth of
domestic demand, while leaving the country with the need to import at least
1 million tons of wheat during the 1973/74 season. Short food supplies and
price increases imported from abroad have also caused a bout of price infla-
tion in the second half of 1973. Government investment may decline by as
much as 10 percent in current prices mainly because a six-month delay in
issuing the country's new development plan for 1973-77 led public agencies
to postpone the start of new investment programs. Private investment may
rise somewhat; it is beginning to recover currently as a result of the
firmer political situation and the publication in August 1973 of new meas-
ures to encourage private investment and exports of manufactures. The poor
performance of agriculture and low level of investment will probably lower
the rate of economic growth to around 2 or 3 percent in 1973, despite con-
tinued increases in exports, tourism and workers' remittances. Morocco's
financial situation remains sound. Domestically, credit expansion is mod-
erate due to the sluggish growth of Government spending and private invest-
ment. Externally, the continued good performance on current account resulted
in a further rise in net foreign assets to $453 million at the end of August
1973.
8.        These favorable financial developments may not continue much longer,
however, since several factors are expected to increase the need for domestic
credit expansion and to put pressure on the external accounts in coming months.
There will be a pick up in public and private investment, covered in part only



by official external financing. There will a'lso he the need to import cereals,
at least unti.l mid-1974, as well as internediate and eeuipmert goods.  Finally,
there. w'i bhe large transfers abroad by foreign farmers whose lands were ex-
pronriated by the Government in Hiarch, 1973, and by foreign investors who
under "inarocanization" measiures .'f ' av 1973 have to sell at least half of
their shares in tee concerne4i oisinesses to Moroccan nationals.  Compensa-
tion measure' are being discussed with the parties concerned.
Lona-ten-.De,velaent Prospects
91        Thu late 10, th. Government began a revisiun s-f its dvrelopment
pttl.ci.Q .-MI, .ne.reasing attention has boeen naid to a iumhrr -f --c:Ja1 objec-
tives incrlu.ding the need to expan? cdiication, improve ineome distribution and
ac_p.-itn'-R! ;and refornm.  These, together with the faster i'-JIsion making ap-
parent re-:ently, the adoption of a n-w tax syste-m, the adoption of a new
eeonoi..e .1e-elopment plan and a xev-isetl in'iestment code give hope of acceler-
ateJ dvreltopment and improved performance in the longet perspective of the
new plan p-rlodL
10.       Th.- Third Five-Ye3r Plan (1973-17) embodies the new orientation and
proposes;
to sustain real. CDP growth of 7.5 percent a year from 1973
to 1977 mainlv throtugh a fast rise in goods and non-factor
services exports by 10 percent a year, and a doutbling of
puhlio and private investment compared to the Second Plan
neriod; and
to improve the distribution of growth benefits among the
1toroccan people mainly througk further land distribution
in agriculture, more emphasis on dry cultivation zones,
the replacemnent of foreigners with Moroccans in industry
and services, more progressivity in the tax system, changes
in the prices of basic agricultural commodities, and large
in-reases in Government spending on social services and low
const houising.
In accol 1anre with the export-oriented strategy, the Plan gives priority to
the seetoro contribtiting heavily to foreien exchange receipts (agriculture,
fishi.ng, mi-nIng, CNood nro-essing, sub-contracting industries, transportation
ar.d           This in reflecte.d in the allocation of Government resources to
these .-z- rn, and in the measures that were taken in August 1973 to encourage
privacz, icnestment and exports.  A.s a departutre from past financial orthodoxy,
the rIm accents the prospect that domestic prices may rise by about 5 percent
a year.  _t recognizes that despite faEter growth, a continuing work program
and emigration, unemployment may rise in absolute and relative terms.
11.       The onbectives and strategy of the Plan generally respond to the
pressiag needs of the Moroccan economyT, with the notable exception of employ-
ment. 5r'wever, tho Plan's economic targets are high compared to past perform-
ance and the proposed social objectives could be achieved only wiLh ex-
ceptional ef0orts.   Morocco has considerable potential for growth, partic-
ularly i, irrigated agriculture. manufacturing and tourism. The economic



- 4 -
targets seem ambitious in relation to the capabilities of the public and
private sector, with the exception perhaps of the export target because ex-
ternal demand for Moroccan goods and services is likely to remain strong.
There is the possibility of significant shortfalls on planned public invest-
ment because the 1973 outturn is much below the required level and it will
take time to build up the Government's implementation capacity, particularly
in the new priority sectors such as dry farming and low cost housing. Simi-
larly, the private sector would have to make up for the sluggish 1973 invest-
ment performance and there is doubt that the Government will be able to induce
the required dynamism in the private sector. The economic mission is currently
in the process of making a more detailed assessment of prosDects for investment
and GDP growth.
12.       The Plan assumes that sizeable increases in external financing will
be obtained to supplement rising private and public savings for the financing
of projected investments. The inflow of private external capital is expected
to double in 1973-77 compared to 1968-72. Regarding the public investment
program, the Plan calls for $1,250 million in gross external financing com-
pared with $850 million during the Second Plan. This large increase implies
strenuous efforts on the part of the Government to improve project preparation,
particularly in the priority sectors, and aid coordination. At the end of 1972,
Morocco's external public debt amaounted to an estimated $815 million on a dis-
bursement basis. Service paynients on this debt decreased somewhat to a level
of only 7.4 percent of goods and services exports. Morocco retains the cap-
acity to service substantial additional debt, although implementation of the
new Plan and other factors noted in paragraph 8 will probably put the balance
of payments under more pressure than before and the debt service ratio is
likely to rise to higher levels.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
13.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco consists of 18 projects amounting
to $325.2 million (net of cancellations), of which $121 million was lent over
the last two years. Four projects have been financed under IDA credits total-
ling $36.8 million. IFC investments amount to $2.9 million. The implementa-
tion of projects is often slow to start, frequently due to cumbersome Govern-
ment disbursement procedures, but with time perfonnance usually improves.
The Sebou irrigation project (Loan 643-MOR of November 13, 1969 for $46 mil-
lion) on which little progress was made for a long time, is a case in point.
Initially, management difficulties, the slow processing of necessary land
reforms and a flood of unprecedented magnitude in 1970 substantially delayed
progress. At present, however, the project is showing satisfactory progress.
Project implementation by the three autonomous financial institutions in
agriculture, industry and tourism to which the Bank lends, is generally
satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1973, and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.



-5-
14.       The Bank Group strategy in Morocco is to support the Government in
its formulation of development-oriented policies and to help it implement them
particularly in rainfed agriculture and land reform, education, expansion of
private enterprises and exports, employment and income distribution. Past
lending has been concentrated in irrigated agriculture, private industry and
to a lesser extent, education and infrastructure. When the Bank has completed
its review of the new Plan, discussions will be held with the Government on
how the Bank can best assist with its implementation. ,lowever, the pace at
which Bank Group lending can be carried out will continue to depend largely
on the speed with which the Government prepares projects and takes related
policy decisions.
15.       In the financing of agricultural projects the Bank has so far helped
develop large scale irrigation schemes and agricultural credit and further
projects are under preparation for Bank Group consideration. In this connec-
tion, the Bank has stressed the importance of efficient organization of the
sector, of land reform and of the development of small scale farms. The Gov-
ernment has recently accelerated land distribution and is presently preparing
projects for small farmers for which it is expected to seek financing.
16.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.    Two
IDA credits have been made for education and a third project is under prep-
aration for later consideration. The first two projects, however, have en-
countered some difficulties (see Annex II) but performance has recently im-
proved. A UNESCO project idetification mission, in the framework of the
Bank UNESCO cooperative program, visited the country in September 1973 to
review the sector's development and to help identify a third project.
17.       The financing of industry and tourism has so far been extended
through the two DFC's (Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique
and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier). While these DFC's are expected to con-
tinue to be main channels for Bank lending in these sectors, the Bank has
recently appraised a large phosphoric acid project and is helping to prepare
a tourism infrastructure project as Executing Agency for a UNDP financed
study. Projects in these sectors help Morocco to enlarge its foreign ex-
change earnings and provide an opportunity for the Bank to help improve
sectoral policies and encourage the creation of employment opportunities.
Bank involvement is thus reflected in a study of the interest rate struc-
ture in Morocco and the recent enactment of a new investment code. The
latest loan to BNDE (Ln 890) signed on May 14, 1973 aims at improving the
consideration of employment effects of BNDE financing.
18.       The first transportation loan, a $14.6 million Bank/IDA blend, was
for a highway project and included financing of a sector review which is now
serving as a basis for future transport investments as well as recommendations
on transport policy.
19.       The first Bank financing of public utilities in urban areas was the
$48 million Water Supply loan signed in July 1972. A second loan of $25 mil-
lion for a power project was signed on October 5, 1973. By means of these
two projects the Bank is trying to help the Government to bring about much



- 6 -
needed improvements in the organization of public utilities. The social
problems due to currently rapid urbanization are also expected to be tackled
directly through a site and services project which is being prepared with the
Bank's assistance.
20.       A consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April, 1967.    It
includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, the Netherlands,
Spain, the U.K., the U.S., IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African Development
Bank and the European Investment Bank. The Group last met in October, 1971,
when it welcomed the Government's new polices and affirmed continued support
for Morocco. The next meeting of the Group is tentatively scheduled for the
spring of 1974. It will consider Morocco's Third Five Year Plan (1973-77).
Gross inflow of official foreign assistance to Morocco has shown a rising
trend, from a total $129 million in 1966, to $168 million (of which $18 mil-
lion in grants) in 1971, but temporarily fell to $126 million in 1972. The
major sources of aid were the U.S., Germany, the Bank Group and France.
21.       At the end of 1972, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's external
public debt was 12 percent on a disbursement basis, and 25 percent including
undisbursed amounts. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was 13 per-
cent in 1972. Future trends in these shares will be easier to establish after
the Government's program of external borrowing during the Third Plan period
(1973-77) has been reviewed by the current economic mission and considered
by members of the Consultative Group for Morocco in spring 1974. The Bank
Group's share in public debt and debt service will in the medium term probably
remain on the same level.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN MOROCCO
22.       Morocco's transport system, largely concentrated in the coastal
plain between the Atlas mountain range and the Atlantic, is reasonably well
developed. Although the density of the transport network is adequate, in-
vestments need to be made in rolling stock for rail, some port improvements,
and especially in road improvement. The third Five-Year Plan for the trans-
port sector covering the period 1973-1977 emphasizes these needs. Tne Plan
has been approved at a total of DH 1,221 million.   Investments in the highway
sector amount to DH 412 million which is about a 50 percent increase over the
actual investments of the previous plan. The objectives of the new Plan re-
flect the results of the recommendations of a recent transport survey con-
ducted by consultants (Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre-
tier, BCEOM).
23.       The principal agency in charge of transport policy is the Ministry
of Public Works and Communications (MTWC). It prepares the initial five-year
plan proposals for the transport sector as a whole as well as for individual
modes. The planning mechanism is by and large satisfactory, and the evalua-
tion of projects is increasingly based on economic considerations.



24.       Financing of transport infrastructure is provided from general
public funds. However, annual revenue from highway user charges is about
four times total highway expenditures (including capital costs). Since
highway user charges provide a convenient tax base for the collection of
general revenues and fall mainly on car owners, the present level of charges
is reasonable in the Moroccan context. Railways and ports generate revenues
which approximately equal their operating costs.
25.   Transport policy aims to control all services offered to the public
and to restrict private services which may compete with the public sector.
This regulation is most strict in the rail/road freight market; the MPWC
through the Office National des Transports (ONT) controls the licenses for
common carrier trucks, determines freight rates and fares for rail and road
transport, assigns cargoes directly to road common carriers, and issues and
collects the bills for services rendered by these carriers. The existing
system is costly to the Moroccan economy causing higher freight rates than
under a competitive situation and resulting in low utilization of equipment
and facilities which are foreign exchange intensive investments. In the
transport survey the consultants have recommended complete deregulation of
the industry and the Bank has opened discussions with the Government on de-
regulation. The MPWC recognizes the problem and is taking an active interest
in the matter. It is seeking information from other countries, notably France
and has started its own study of this issue. Three experts to be financed
under the proposed project, will assist the MPWC with this study. All in-
terested parties in Morocco, including users and private unlicenced carriers,
are to meet at a Government-sponsored colloquium in March 1974 to decide on
a strategy to improve the service provided by the industry. During negotia-
tions the Government agreed to continue the dialogue with the Bank on the
deregulation issue.
Highways
26.       The highway network is basically well developed, consisting of some
51,500 km of roads of which about 21,500 km are paved and a further 4,000 km
are earthroads of good serviceability. It is generally adequate in coverage
and length, but design characteristics are becoming insufficient to handle
growing traffic. The vehicle fleet, fuel consumption and traffic on the
network have grown since 1965 at an average annual rate of about 6 percent;
they are expected to increase at about the same rate in the future. On aver-
age, vehicle density is relatively high with the heaviest concentration of
traffic on trunk roads in the northern half of the Atlantic coastal plain.
Many roads have deteriorated and are below standard for current traffic, so
that a backlog of highway investments has accumulated. A start on improve-
ment works was made with the rehabilitation and modernization of the most
important roads in greatest need under the First Highway Project (Loan 642-
MOR and Credit 167-MOR of November 13, 1969 for $7.3 million each or a total
of $14.6 million).
27.       The MTWC has responsibility for the maintenance and development of
the primary and secondary road network. Its efficiency has recently been
improved through the establishment of a Directorate for Roads which replaced
two regional offices previously in charge of these operations. For highway



- 8 -
planning, project preparation and for supervision the ?IPWC relies on a tech-
nical office. The MPWC does not as a matter of policy undertake departmental
construction of roads. All construction, reconstruction and improvement works
are carried out by contractors. In addition to large contractors the Moroccan
road construction industry includes a number of small contractors who use
labor almost exclusively and work mostly on periodic maintenance or as sub-
contractors for larger contractors on construction. An additional feature
of the industry is the Government-sponsored "Promotion Nationale" which pro-
vides the equivalent of about 26,000 full time jobs annually on technically
simple road projects with high inputs of unskilled labor such as the recon-
struction of tertiary roads.
Railways
28.       The railways are government owned and run by the Office National
des Chemins de Fer (ONCF) under the jurisdiction of the MPWC. The system
comprises 1,178 km of standard gauge track, of which 730 km are electrified,
including 161 km of double track carrying phosphate from KLouribga to
Casablanca. The track in general is in reasonable condition; however, roll-
ing stock and locomotives, except on the phosphate line, are inadequate for
present traffic. The Government is contemplating investments in rolling
stock, locomotives and some track renewal.
29.       The backbone of railway business is the movement of bulk commodities,
in particular of phosphates (63 percent of total freight carried). The modal
split of passenger and freight traffic between rail and road is highly regulated
by the Government. Overall, the railways make a small financial profit, al-
though this is based on inadequate provisions for depreciation of fixed assets.
Ports
30.       Morocco has six major ports which in 1970 handled a total of 18.5
million tons of cargo. Present port capacity is adequate and operations are
efficient. Some renewal and reconstruction are required, but no major port
improvements are needed in the near future. The ports of Casablanca and
Mohammedia are administered by a separate Director of Ports, while the others
are administered by the MPWC. The Government is considering establishing an
autonomous port authority for all ports.
Airports
31.       Morocco is served by eight airports with regularly scheduled flights.
Besides these main airports tl-here are a number of smaller airfields. The Gov-
ernment plans to raise the standard of the airports at Tangier and Fes to ac-
commodate transoceanic flights in support of the expansion of the tourist in-
dustry. The country is servecd by its own international airline providing
service to Europe. The importance of air transport in Morocco is closely
linked with the growth of the tourist industry which accounted for about
90 percent of total passengers in recent years. Total air passenger traffic
increased by 11.5 percent annually during 1962-1970 to over one million.
Airport administration is carried out by a separate agency of MPWC.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project Morocco
(143a-MOR)" is beinig distributed separately. A loan and project summary
is attached as Annex III. The proposed Second Hlighway Project was appraised
in November/December 1972. Negotiations were held in Washington on October 1
to 5. The Borrower was represented by Mr. Lukasch, Director of the Budget,
Ministry of Finance and Mr. Kabbaj, Director of Roads, Ministry of Public
Works and Communications.
Description
33.       The Government of Morocco, in agreement with the Bank, contracted
consultants in 1971 to carry out detailed engineering for the Casablanca-
Rabat expressway for which a feasibility study financed under the first high-
way project had shown a satisfactory Economic Return (ER). A Bank identifi-
cation mission in September 1972 recommended the construction of the     irst
phase of the expressway, the improvement of various road sections, purchases
of highway maintenance equipment, traffic studies and technical assistance.
The proposed project thus provides a continuation to the rehabilitation and
modernization of important roads and the replacement of obsolete maintenance
equipment begun under the first highway project.
34.       The proposed project is a key element in the Government's develop-
ment plan for the road network and supports the Bank Group's lending strategy
(para 14) throughi institution building and by improving road transport for
agricultural exports and tourism. In particular, the project is designed to
improve several roads, mostly in the coastal plain, which carry high traffic
volumes, including a major part of agricultural exports and tourist traffic.
It aims at improving maintenance administration and overall transport and
project planning through the establishment of a Central Equipment Division
within the Directorate of Roads and a transportation planning office in the
tiPWC.
35.        The proposed project comprises:
(i)  construction of two lanes of the uncompleted part (33 km)
of Primary Road 36 (RP 36) from Casablanca to Rabat;
(ii)  improvement of sections, totalling 679 km, of 17 primary
and secondary roads;
(iii)  purchase of highway maintenance equipment;
(iv)  traffic studies in Casablanca and Rabat;
(v)  the establishment of a transportation planning office in
the MPWC; and
(vi)  detailed engineering of two road sections.



10 -
36.       The estimated total cost of the project, including contingencies,
is equivalent to $43 million. The propcsed loan of $29 million would finance
67 percent of estimated total project costs, eqluivalent to the estimated for-
eign exchange component. Detailed cost estimates are summarized in Annex III.
The MPWC, assisted by consultants, will bear the main responsibility for the
execution of the project: it will supervise the construction and improvement
works, for which it is staffed adequately, and qualified consultants will un-
dertake the traffic and transport studies and the technical assistance.
37.       Both highway construction and improvement works are scheduled to
start in the first half of 1974 and be completed by the end of 1976. The
contracts for maintenance equipment will providle for one third to be de-
livered during the second half of 1974 and the rest by the middle of 1975.
Consulting services will start in the beginning of 1974 arnd be completed
18 months later, i.e. end of 1975.
38.       The detailed engineering study of the Kenitra-Larache road would
be financed retroactively under the proposed project.   Construction of this
road was expected to be included in the project but due to budgetary limita-
tions the Government has decided to postporne construction for the time being.
Construction of RP 36 (Casablanca-Rabat)
39.       All traffic between Casablanca, the commercial center of the country,
and Rabat, the capital, as well as between the south and north of the country,
is at present served by a railway and two roads Located in a traffic corridor
of a maximum width of 5 km. Traffic on these roads has been increasing by
about 11 percent annually.  In   iew of the poor traffic conditions on the two
roads, the Government in the :Late 1950's decided to link both cities through
a modern expressway.  Since then, a 28 km section of a two-lane highway (RP 36)
has been completed at the Rabat and as part: 2f the expressway. At the Casablanca
end, a section of 6.8 km has been constructed with four lanes, and an adjoining
5 km long section with two larnes. The proposed r'roject includes the completion
of the missing link between the two cities consisting of -about 33 km of two-
lane highway, including two interchanges, three overpasses and one underpass
for the future expressway. Construction of the other two lanes and additional
interchanges, underpasses and overpasses to complete the full expressway planned
will be undertaken in a few years when justified by traffic growth.
Improvement Works
40.       The project includes road inmproveMienc works totalling 679 km on 12
primary and 5 secondary roads with a total length of about 4,300 kin, which,
based on economic priority, h;ave been selected by the Government for improve-
ment under the project.  Thes;_ sections represent a major part of the road
improvements to be undertaken during the first chree years of the third
Five-Year Plan.

PurchasesX of Highway Maintenanc  Equipment
41.       Under the First Highway Prc¶ect, maintenance equipment costing
about $3.0 million was purchased to renew part of the most urgently needed
equipment. A further list of equipment for urgent renewal, together with
spare parts costing $2.4 million, is included in the project.
Urban Traffic and Transport Studies in Casablanca and Rabat
42.          view rf the proposed expressway's implications for the urban
tra. f4z c  a:terns in Casablanca and Ranat, the project includes two urban
traffi-r and tran.spnrt studies,  At the Casablanca end of the expressway the
cormvlex traffic dispersal problems would be the main focus of the studies.
These studies would also foculs on any short term improvements that would be
needed in the traffic patterns in Casablanca, as well as on any needed in-
frastru,ture investments. At the Rabat end of tthe expressway, the studies
would focus on the likely methods of traffic dispersal from the expressway,
the t.echnical and economic feasibility of any bypass routes needed to divert
throligIL traffic, and on the establishment of a longer term transport plan
for th-e lrban area of Rabat, in the context of ongoing Master Plan work.
The studies would also ferm a potential link with proposed urban extension
projects in the Rabat area for which the Government is likely to request
Bank Group financing. Both studies will be carried out by qualified
consultants.
Technical Assistance
43.       To improve its own planning on transport investments, the MPWC has
requeted the technical assistance of a highway traffic engineer, a railway
engineer and a transport economist to be recruited from a consulting firm.
These exirerts will assist the MPWC for a total of 5 man-years in establishing
a small transport planning office, initiating operations and training Moroccan
counterparts.
Procurement
44.       Contracts will be awarded after international competitive bidding
accordirng to the Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement". For the highway
imprcvnment. works the whole three-year program will be advertised once, with
notifinat'nn to local representatives of 3ank member countries and Switzerland,
whereaP-e each specific lot or lets will be notified to all those who have
exprespeAd interest. The works have beer. arranged to make contracts of a size
which is attractive to both local and foreign bidders, who will be allowed to
bid for one or more contracts, separately or in combination. For the purpose
of bid evaluation domestic bids for maintenance equipment and spare parts
with a local value added of not less than 20 percent would be accorded a
margin 'f preference of 15 percent or the actual customs duties, whichever
is lowr.



- 12 -
Disbursement
45.       Disbursements will be made on the basis of:    65 percent of expendi-
tures for the construction and highway improvement program expected to be
carried out as a joint venture of local and foreign contractors; 80 percent
of expenditures for consulting services; the c.i.f. cost of imported items
and 73 percent of expenditures for domestically procured items of maintenance
equipment, including spare parts. These percentages represent the estimated
foreign exchange component of the related expenditures. The Government has
asked for retroactive financing of $1.3 million, representing the foreign
exchange costs of studies for the Casablanca-Rabat expressway and the Kenitra-
Larache road, which were undertaken in 1972 with the Bank's agreement. This
amount, covering the consulting work as from January 1, 1972, is included in
the proposed loan.
Benefits
46.       The project is economically well justified.    Quantified benefits
are estimated to yield an ER of 16 percent on the Casablanca-Rabat expressway.
Sensitivity tests show that the ER would be 12 percent if construction costs
were 20 percent higher than the best estimate, or if benefits were 25 percent
lower. The road improvements have a combined ER of 62 percent, with indiv-
idual rates per section ranging from a minimum of 17 percent to over 100 per-
cent. The purchases of road maintenance equipment are justified by savings
in the cost of maintenance, repair, and operating the existing equipment which
is over ten years old and is to be replaced. Benefits from the other project
elements have not been quantified, but technical assistance, the urban trans-
port studies, and detailed engineering are clearly justified by improved
transport planning, better project preparation, and on-the-job training for
MPWC staff.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANI) AUTHORITY
47.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of ltlorocco and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of the resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for highway projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONL/
Cr. No. 79 First Education Project: US $11 million Credit of October 11, 1965;
Closing Date: September 30, 19740
Considerable delays have affected the implementation of the project,
which has been considered a problem project since 19680 However, performance
has improved significantly since September, 1972; construction and equipment
of all schools (except industrial equipment in two schools) has been completed,
and all schools are in use, project management is now satisfactory, construc-
tion accounts have been brought up-to-date, local funds have been released for
the project and the Association's procurement procedures for international
bidding for furniture and equipment are being followed. The Closing Date has
been extended three times from the original date of June 30, 1971, to Septem-
ber 30, 1974, to allow for rebidding of the industrial equipment and comiiplete
disbursements.
u'r. No. 266  Second Education Project:  US $8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Closing Date: April 30, 1976.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific sec-
tions of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems of the Borrower,
and technical assistance for project administration and school maintenance.
Subsequently the Association agreed not to finance the two Vocational Training
Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an estimated
amount of US $1.0 million or 11.8 per cent of the Credit, representing the
financing of the above-mnentioned project items, has been transferred to the
unallocated category for future reallocation and/or cancellation.
T'he project is about ten months behind schedule due to early delays
in the appointment of consultant architects and in the recruitment of local
personnel and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit. Implemen4
tation has progressed significantly since September, 1972, but no disburse-
ments had been made by the end of September, 1973. The project is nevertheless
expected to be completed by the Closing Date of April 30, 1976.
!/These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Ln. No. 6)2. Cr. No. 167   Highway Project,    IT; $1iJ.6 million of 1iovember 13,
1969;    osinz Date:   Feb":a:r i2,,  7L-
The first highway project. ls progressing satisfactorily, after some
initial delays.  By September 1973 $6.0 million was stLill undisbursed out of
the combined credit /loan, mainly because of cumbersome ck.vernment disbursement
procedures. Ways if expediting payments were discussed by the last super-
vision miso' on in JJuly JQ73 and at the negotiations for the Second Highways
project.
Ln. No. ',i3 Trrigation Prodect; US $L6 million Loan of November 13, 1969;
.l-'sng isiate.  Noverber .30, 197g.
The project experienc1 initial management difficulties, but manage-
ment ha3 now improved. In 1970 a flood of unprecedented magnitude occurred
causing delays in project implementation while also indicating the need for
additional flood protection work.   The distribution to small farmers of foreign-
owned lands to be expropriated proceeded slowly as Government revised its
policy on land reform on a national basis.   In March 1973 it decided to recover
all foreign owned lands and distribution procedures are only now under consider-
ation. Experience gained in the course of project implementation has shown
that the cultivation of sugar cane and sugar beet in the project area would
require the construction c' a new sugar cane factory and reinforcement of the
road network. A second project to provide for the additional investment now
required is being appraised.
Ln. No. 704   First Hotel Development Project;  US $10.0 million of August 12,
1970; Closing Date: Decemher 31, 1973.
Disbursements have been lagging behind comnitments as construction of
some hotels ran into difficulties in 1971-72. By the end of September dis-
bursemeerts amounted to only $5.3 million, although the loan was fully comrmitted.
Cancellation of a limited amount of the loan is possible.
Ln. No. 736 Fifth BNDE Project; ITJS $35 million of May 20, 1971; Closing
Date:  June 10, 19(5.
The Terminal Date for the submission of projects has been postponed
from June ?-0, 1073, tc Tieosmber 30, 1973, because of likely cancellations of
present comrd.itments.  Due mainly to sluggish investment activity, disburse-
ments fell Ie--.ind coramitmeFrts in 197. and 1972, but with the return of
investor^' cnnfidence diE ursements are expected to pick ulp the lag.

In. No. 848  Second Hotel Development Project;  US $15 million of June 30,
1972;  Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Commitments are lagging behind expectations due to sluggish invest-
ment activity and the loan should be fully committed by mid-1974, as against
original estimates of year-end 1973. With the improved investment climate
and with the publication of the investment code, conmitments may pick up.
In. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US $48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project is limited to a number of institution building measures.
Only when these were substantially implemented was the loan declared effective
on May 2, 1973. A supervision mission visited Morocco in June and confirmed
that substantial efforts have been made by the Government to clarify ONEP's
functions, strengthen its financial autonomy, and enforce water tariffs
applicable to distribution agencies. Although some important problems remain,
particularly relating to procurement, progress is acceptable.  The Bank keeps in
close touch with the situation.
Ln. No. 861, Cr. No. 338  Second Agricultural Credit Project;  US $34.0 million
of October 10, 1972; Closing Date: August 31, 1976.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily and disbursements
had reached $4.1 million by the end of September, as compared to the appraisal
forecast of $8.3 million.  The lag is due to initial delays following a misin-
terpretation of disbursement procedures by the Borrower, which has subsequently
been cleaned up.
Ln. No. 890  Sixth BNDE Project;  US $24 million of May 114, 1973;  Closing
Date: December 31- 1976.
The original date of effectiveness which was August 20, 1973, was
extended to September 10, 1973, to allow time for the transmittal of necessary
documents. The loan was declared effective on that date.
