(POWER VI)
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Total Energy Consumption and Resources
1.01      Nigeria's total energy consumption in 1978 was estimated at about
15.4 million T.o. e. (0.19 T.o.e. per capita) of which 8.2 million T.o.e.
correspond to commercial sources 1/ and about 7.2 million T.o.e. (a very rough
estimate) correspond to non-commercial sources. 2/ A recent energy study for
Nigeria (para. 1.08) forecasts that the country's total energy consumption
will rise to 43 million T.o.e. by the year 2000, which indicates an average
annual growth rate of 10%.
1.02      Table in Annex 1.01, page 1, shows the development of commercial
energy consumption during the three fiscal years 1976, 1977 and 1978 and the
consumption pattern of the three major categories: residential, industrial
and transport. During this three-year period, consumption has grown at an
average of 21.5% p.a., which is much higher than the 17% average growth over
the previous 5 years (1971 thru 1975). Presently, about 50% of the commercial
source energy is consumed by the transport sector.
1.03      Compared to most other West African countries, Nigeria is well
endowed with energy resources. At present, Nigeria's largest energy source
is in the form of hydrocarbons, with estimated reserves of 2,790 million tons
of oil and 2,700 million T.o.e. of natural gas. At the present annual produc-
tion rate of about 100 million tons, these oil reserves could be depleted in
28 years. Table 1.1 presents an estimate of Nigeria's main commercial energy
resources. The potential annual production of nonrenewable sources has been
calculated for depletion periods of 30 years.
1/ Petroleum products, natural gas, coal and hydroelectricity.
2/ Wood, charcoal and organic wastes.

1/ 45,100 GWh, converted at 0.26 kgoe/kWh
2/ 6,000 kcal/kg.
3/ 5,500 kcal/kg.
The above figures may substantially change, especially regarding the less
known sources such as coal and lignite, as a result of additional energy
sector studies (para. 1.06). As shown in Annex 1.01, page 1 only 1.25 million
T.o.e. of associated gas was utilized in 1978, representing 6% of the produc-
tion, the rest was.flared out. Presently NEPA is by far the largest consumer
of associated gas (about 80% of total consumption or 5% of total production).
Associated natural gas is currently, and for the future, the cheapest energy
resource in Nigeria, if the gathering system is designed within suitable cost
and economic parameters.
1.04      Information on commercially exploitable coal resources in Nigeria
is scarce.  According to NEPA, the major coal deposits are located in Anambra,
Benue, and Bendel states, with a present maximum production of about 250,000
tons per year from a number of scattered small mines in the states.   This coal
production could generate about 500 GWh, equivalent to a plant capacity of
about 90 MW.  Since NEPA needs to expand its generation capacity by approxi-
mately 600 MW annually during the period 1984 thru 1987 (see Annex 1.01,
page 3), the present level of coal production is totally inadequate to merit
serious consideration as an energy source for electricity generation. More-
over, current coal production appears to be heavily subsidized.



-3-
1.05      Table 1.2 shows prices of the main commercial fuel products presently
sold in Nigeria and the equivalent in US$ per million BTU of fuels used for
heating purposes. The cheapest commercial fuel appears to be coal; however,
no production cost figures for coal were available, and as already mentioned
the price here stated appears to be heavily subsidized. On the other hand,
the relatively high price charged by NNPC to NEPA for associated natural gas,
reflects the high gathering cost due to the short life attributed to the
specific gas fields tapped, and the correspondingly short amortization period
for the gathering facilities. NEPA does not accept this price which is about
100% higher than that charged in 1979, and has turned to Government to resolve
the issue. For Nigeria to be able to use its natural gas efficiently it is
essential that designs for gas gathering systenw be optimized.
1.06      There is consensus at government planning levels, that a national
energy pricing policy should be established to encourage the utilization
of Nigeria's manifold energy resources in the most rational way. During
negotiations, this and other policy issues were discussed. Assurances were
obtained that NEPA would, in consultation with the Bank, commission the
updating of the previous study (para. 2.03) to determine the optimal use of
alternative primary energy resources for future power generation (para. 2.18).

1.07      Under the assumption that associated natural gas could be obtained
at reasonable cost from the oil fields of the Delta area, the feasibility
of the construction of a gas pipeline of about 380 km from the Delta area to
Lagos to supply both industry and the 800-1,200 MW (Igbin) power generating



-4-
plant (para 4.04) in the Lagos area has been considered. For this purpose,
NNPC commissioned Earl and Wright Engineering Consultants (E&W) to prepare a
feasibility study for the gathering, compressing, treating and transmitting
associated natural gas to the Lagos area. 1/    According to the gas consumption
forecast, a 26" diameter pipeline with a capacity of 16.2 x 106m3/day (580
MMSCFD) was recommended. The total cost of the project was estimated at
around US$1,220 million (at 1979 prices). At government planning levels, this
cost is considered to be extremely high and a revision of this estimate is now
being carried out.
1.08      Government commissioned Motor Columbus, Consulting Engineers to
carry out a study of Nigeria's energy requirements and resources, the report
of which was submitted in March 1980. Taking a 30 year horizon (1980-2010),
the study provides a wealth of energy related material, pulling together
available information from a great variety of sources including international
literature, and sets out an analytical framework for demand projections and
optimization procedures. The analysis itself needs to be extended, refined
and above all, operationally oriented. Thus, the study lacks practical policy
recommendations on major energy issues of immediate operational importance,
e.g., utilization of natural gas, particularly of associated gas that keeps
being flared, inter-fuel substitution and national energy pricing. Nor does
it provide a plan for further action necessary to widen and deepen the data
base across the board, improve coordination and institutional capability and
get energy planning established as a going concern.
1.09       Progress towards an articulated energy policy has been slow since the
incoming civilian government encountered a number of disparate, uncoordinated
and inadequately staffed organizations within the energy sector. These staff
and management constraints must be removed to permit more time and effort to be
devoted to coordinated planning on a national scale. However, given the present
limited internal demand on her abundant and varied energy resources, Nigeria
has some short-term flexibility in their allocation. Ne-ertheless the Bank
continues to urge on Government the necessity for early formulation of compre-
hensive energy guidelines to enable such entities as NEPA to plan their long-
term investment programs within a coherent national energy policy. The
government is well aware of the need for such a policy and is taking positive
action to ensure greater coordination in the energy sector. As a first step,
the President has appointed as his special advisor for energy and power the
former general manager of NEPA who strongly encouraged the former government
to go ahead with the recent Motor Colombus energy study, and the Delta/
Lagos gas pipeline study.
1/   The Bank assisted NNPC in the preparation of terms of reference.

II. POWER SECTOR
Power Sector Organization
2.01      The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) is the Federal Govern-
ment parastatal organization in charge of planning, construction and opera-
tion of the public electric power system in Nigeria. NEPA was created in
1972, by a merger of the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) and the
Niger Dams Authority (NDA); the latter was organized in 1962 for the multi-
purpose development of the Niger river, of which the Kainji hydro-electric
scheme was the first step. A small proportion of the public service elec-
tricity supply is provided by t:he States through their own generating faci-
lities or by power purchased from NEPA. Private power generation for both
industrial and residential use increased considerably during 1977/78 due to
persistent power shortages in NEPA-s system.
Past Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.02      The Bank has made five loans for the development of the Nigerian
power sector, as indicated in table below:
Loan No.    Date            Amount      Borrower    Description
(US$ million)
372-UNI      19)64         30.0         ECN         Transmission system at 330
and 132 kV. Sub-transmis-

fication.

- 6 -
With the exception of the power lines and substations located in the areas
affected by the civil war of 1967-70, the works financed under Loan 372-UNI
were completed in time and within cost estimates.   The Kainji project financed
by the Bank with Loans 383-UNI and 572-UNI experienced substantial cost over-
runs due to an increased volume of civil works, higher than estimated equip-
ment costs, and delays caused by the civil war. Two additional generating
units financed under Loan 847-UNI started operating in 1976; whilst the
second Kainji-Lagos line was put into service in mid-1977, also one year late
due to the Lagos port congestion. The numerous power distribution systems
financed by the same loan (847-UNI) have been generally completed with some
delay.
Role of the Bank in the Sector
2.03      Through the first four of the five loans to assist the power sector
development in Nigeria, the Bank effectively contributed to the consolidation
of the sector planning, development and operations.   The Bank role, which
culminated in the creation of NEPA, made possible the integration into one
organization the separate and to some extent, rival ECN and NDA. The merger
was aimed at optimizing the use of the scarce specialized human resources
available. Bank assistance during that period also made possible the prepara-
tion of the first systematically-integrated power development master plan for
the country (para. 2.18), which was carried out with the assistance of con-
sultants under Loan 847-UNI, and the institution within NEPA of a high level
Planning Committee.
2.04      The accelerated growth of Nigeria's economy, caused by the dramatic
increase of the oil revenue, resulted in an extremel.y high and continLuous
growth rate in electricity demand (20% per year) over the past three years.
For the same reasons this rate of growth is expected to-continue in the coming
four to five years (para. 2.11). Meeting such a huge demand is very difficult
even for well advanced countries. In a country at Nigeria's state of develop-
ment and needs, existing weak overall infrastructural facilities, limited
experience, and shortage of qualified man-power resources are serious con-
straints. The Government therefore requested the Bank to resume its support
arq assistance to strengthen the institutional capability of NEPA and enable
i. .o undertake the needed expansion program.
2.05      The Bank's renewed support to NEPA through the fifth power project
played an important role in the decision of the outgoing Government, to amend
the original draft of the country-s new constitution which provided for the
responsibilities for the electricity supply and distribution service in
Nigeria to be delegated to the individual states. In the final version of the
constitution this provision was deleted and NEPA retains the major sector
responsibilities for generation, transmission, and supply, and leaves to the
individual states responsibiity for power distribution in geographical areas
where NEPA does not provide service. However, pressures for decentralization
of the power sector are likely to persist. Bank involvement in the power
sector, such as through the proposed project, could exercise a moderating
influence to maintain the type of organization that best suits the country's
needs.



-7-
2.06      Like the Power V project, the proposed project will provide an
important opportunity for the Bank to further assist NEPA in strengthening
the operation and planning of its distribution sub-sector. This is becoming
increasingly important for the efficient and full utilization of power from
recently and soon to be completed generation and transmission facilities.
Traditionally, throughout the industry, the distribution sub-sector has been
given much lower priority than generation and transmission activities because
of its complexity and the continued encroachment of more pressing day-to-day
problems.
2.07      Past Bank involvement has been an important factor in Government
authorization of tariff increases of 30% in 1977 and about 60% in 1979 which,
although insufficient to compensate for the country's inflation, made an
important contribution to NEPA's financial viability and stability. Further
the proposed project, by allowing the Bank to maintain this influence, would
encourage the sale of electricity at prices based on the principle of full
cost-recovery to reduce distortions in demand and to encourage conservation.
2.0P      Another important institution building objective addressed in the
Power V project which would be further pursued under the proposed Power VI
project would be the strengthening of the competence and capacity of NEPA-s
staff. This is a difficult task owing to the existing constraints such as the
general scarcity of qualified Nigerians and the severe salary restrictions
affecting government-owned institutions like NEPA (para. 3.09). The training
program (initiated in Power V) and the salary study components of the proposed
project are aimed at the improvement of staff performance (para. 3.10). NEPA
has appointed a training manager and has called for proposals to implement
the training program. In addition, NEPA has received Government approval to
proceed with the salary study and has called for proposals from a selected
number of consultant firms based on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
However, this action will take time to achieve full effect. For the short
term several steps have been discussed with NEPA to alleviate the effect of
qualified staff shortages as quickly as possible. These include making use of
outside services and/or contractors to perform some functions presently
performed by NEPA, namely maintenance and repair of vehicles, distribution
transformers, etc.
2.09      In the longer term, Bank involvement would help pursue the action-
started under past operations and support further progress in primary energy
planning, improvement in NEPA's internal organization and strengthening of the
institutions-s financial planning and borrowing capacity.
Supply and Demand
2.10      Global load forecasts for the country are prepared by a permanent
NEPA unit which works in close contact with the Government planning agencies
and the private sector. The methodology used is the conventional analysis of
the consumption pattern for each of the consumers categories (small, medium
and large residential, commercial and industrial), modified by expected trends
in different regions utilizing population and other macro-economic factors.
Connections of discrete large industrial consumers are incorporated separately.

in similar areas with service. The global projections are compared with
aggregated projections of regional and major load centers (para. 2.20). Com-
parison betwen actual and forecast consumption has been reasonably accurate
in the past.
2.11      Annex 1.01 page 3 shows the actual (1972/73-1979/80) and forecast
(1980-1987) peak power demand and electricity consumption, generating capacity
and energy availability and growth rate of NEPA-s power system. It can be
seen that the past annual growth rate of electricity consumption of about 20%
is expected to gradually decrease to about 16% by 1987. The country's total
gross electricity consumption in 1979 was 6,770 GWh 1/; which represents 80
GWh/capita, an increase of 120% over the preceeding 5 years. Assuming non-NEPA
supply were to remain at 5% of total consumption and based on growth forecasts
per capita consumption would reach 240 Kwh by 1987.    About 20% of Nigeria's
population is estimated to have access to electricity service. This percentage
is increasing following incorporation of new areas of the country into the
interconnected system which previously did not have electricity.
2.12      During the decade 1978 thru 1987, the evolution of NEPA's elec-
tricity sales and load pattern is predicted to be as follows: Industry demand
will grow at annual rate of approximately 23% and will account for 43% of
total consumption by 1987 compared to 33% in 1978. Government and commercial
demand will grow at annual rate of 17% but the overall share of consumption
will decline marginally from 17% to 14%. Residential demand growth will be
17% but overall share will decline markedly from 50% to 43%. This future
growth and demand pattern indicates the increasing importance of industry.
Existing Facilities
2.13      Public electricity service in Nigeria is delivered through alterna-
ting current at 50 Hz 2/ as in all West African countries except Liberia. At
December 1979 NEPA-s installed generating capacity and energy availabiltiy was
1,743 MW and 1,595 MW respectively and is detailed in Annex 2.01 page 1 by
generating plant. Map IBRD 15006 shows the location of NEPA's main generating
facilities.
2.14      Generation centers are connected to the main load centers of
Lagos, Benin, Onitsha, Kaduna, Kano, Jos and Birnin-Kebbi (supplying point
of the 132 kV line to Niger) through 3,440 circuit-Km of 330 kV transmission
lines and 8 main step-down substations and 330/132 kV and about 3,800 circuit-
Km of lines and about 60 substations at 132 kV which feed the sub-transmission
and distribution systems supplying the individual consumers at 33,11 and
0.4 kV. The systems National Control Center is located at Oshogbo in Oyo
State.

2.15      At the end of 1979 NEPA provided service to 830,000 consumers in
Lagos and 23 major cities and towns throughout Nigeria, including the other 18
state capitals.
Power System Expansion Program
2.16      Generating projects under construction.   The power generation
availability for the coming seven years up to and including FY 1986 shown in
Annex 1.01, page 3 is based on NEPA's present expansion program. Details of
the power generation expansion are shown in Annex 1.01, page 4. According to
it, NEPA plans to put into operation about 4,200 MW of new generating capacity
and to retire from service about 175 MW during the period 1980-1986. The most
important components of this program are: completion of the Sapele steam
plant, with 700 MW plus 300 MW in gas turbines; the Shiroro (600 MW) and Jebba
(540 MW) hydroelectric schemes now under construction on the Kaduna and Niger
rivers respectively, and the Igbin steam station in the Lagos area (800 MW),
which is at the initial stage of construction. To meet the growth after
completion of the Igbin plant at least another 600 MW needs to be added to the
system by 1986.
Future Generating Projects
2.17      The most important generating project under consideration by NEPA,
has been until recently the Lokoja hydroelectric development. This project
basically consists of a dam located immediately down-stream of the junction of
the Niger and Benue rivers, which will form a reservoir flooding part of
both river valleys. The dam would regulate water flows for power generation
and navigation, as well as for down-stream flood control. The area to be
inundated is of the order of 7,400 km2. The regulated flow for power
generation is estimated at 5,400 m3/sec., the maximum head utilization would
be 34 m and the average annual energy generation is estimated at 10,200 GWh. 1/
The major problems that NEPA would have to face in the construction of this
project are the resettlement of the population living in the areas to be
flooded (estimated at 270,000) and the huge cost of the project, estimated by
MC in 1979 at about US $3,000 million (for an installed capacity of 1,800 MW).
Although this project could provide for a renewable source of energy at
reasonable cost, Government has not yet decided to proceed with the construc-
tion of Lokoja, due to the magnitude of the resettlement problem. Therefore,
NEPA is now investigating the feasibility of a number of thermal options at
Makurdi, Kaduna and elsewhere utilising either residual fuel oil or associated
gas to bridge the shortfall beyond 1985/86.
2.18      NEPA has thus far followed the power development master plan financed
under Loan 847-UNI (para. 2.03). This plan which covers the period 1974-1995,
is based on a detailed assessment of future power demand and of the generation
potential both hydro and thermal, including coal, oil, natural gas, lignite
1/   3,300 MW of ultimate installed capacity, assuming a capacity factor of
0.35.

and nuclear power. It considers alternative power system development plans
in terms of their economic unit generation and transmission costs and deter-
mines the optimal one. Prepared some six years ago, this master plan needs
to be updated and extended to take account of past and prospective changes in
energy prices and power demand for at least the rest of this century. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that a) NEPA would appoint consultants
to update the study with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, b) send
the report to the Bank for its review and comments when available. Finance
for the cost of the study is provided for in the loan.
2.19      Transmission. To transmit the power generated at the new stations,
the 330 kV national system would have to be reinforced by adding a 160 km line
between Jebba and Os'Aogbo and a 270 km line between Benin-Onitsha and Aba,
with the corresponding substations. The interconnecting facilities of the
Igbin power station to the 330 kV national system are part A of this proposed
project (para. 4.03). The 132 kV system will be expanded to interconnect
areas of the country presently isolated in the northeastern and eastern
regions and to support the expansion of the existing distribution systems
throughout the country.
2.20      Distribution. Distribution facilities at 132 kV, 33 kV, 11 kV and
low tension will be expanded to serve the incremental demand to be connected
at this voltage level, currently estimated to increase by about 2,500 MW
between 1980 and 1986. The expansion of the Lagos distribution system to
accomodate its growth has been financed under Power V, whilst expansion of the
distribution system for the next 23 major cities and towns would be financed
under the proposed project.
2.21      In mid 1978, NEPA engaged British Electricity International (BEI)
as consultants to carry out, under terms of reference agreed with the Bank,
a feasibility study of the power distribution expansion required for the 18
state capitals plus five of the largest cities in Nigeria (the 23 cities)
listed below:
State Capitals (State)
1.  Abeokuta (Ogun)          10.  Kaduna (Kaduna)
2.  Akure (Ondo)             11.  Kano (Kano)
3.  Bauchi (Bauchi)          12.  Maiduguri (Borno)
4.  Benin (Bendel)           13.  Makurdi (Benue)
5. Calabar (Cross River)     14. Minna (Niger)
6.  Enugu (Anambra)          15.  Owerri (Imo)
7.  Ibadan (Oyo)             16.  Port Harcourt (Rivers)
8.  Ilorin (Kwara)           17.  Sokoto (Sokoto)
9.  Jos (Plateau)            18. Yola (Gongola)
Cities (State)
19.  Aba (Imo)                22.  Warri (Bendel)
20.  Onitsha (Anambra)        23.  Zaria (Kaduna)
21. Oshogbo (Oyo)



The study covers the ten-year (1978-1988) distribution expansion requirements
for the 132-33-11 kV and low voltage (0.4 kV) power facilities. Starting with
a power market study carried out separately for each of the 23 cities, the
study analysed the alternative solutions to serve the power demand during the
period. It also reviewed NEPA's power distribution design practices and
equipment standards.
2.22      For the power market study, BEI followed a similar methodology to
the one used by NEPA for Nigeria's global projections of power demand (para.
2.10) which seems adequate for the planning of the development of the power
distribution requirements. The total energy consumption (sales) and percentage
distribution by category of consumers, actual (1978/79) and forecast (1988/89)
for the 23 cities is summarised in Annex 2.01 (page 2), other detailed tables
in Annex 2.01 show the actual and forecast energy sales (page 3) and peak
demand (page 4) of the 23 cities for the period 1976/77 thru 1988. According
to these tables the energy consumption (sales) has grown at an average annual
rate of 18% during the last 6 years and is expected to grow at a rate of about
12% for the next 9 years.  The growth in consumption for each particular city
shows great variation. In general, the highest expected consumption growth
corresponds to those towns with present low per capita consumption, such as
Bauchi, Makurdi, Minna and Yola.  The table in Annex 2.02 shows the population
and consumption per capita for the 23 cities. The population for 1977/78 has
been estimated by BEI on the basis of all available information in the field
survey of 1978. Consumption per capita is expected to grow from 262 kWh/year
to 552 kWh/year, from 1977/78 thru 1988/89. The electricity service coverage
of the 23 cities which in 1977/78 was estimated at about 60%, is expected to
increase to about 80% in 1988/89 as a consequence of the project.
III. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
3.01      The Borrower and beneficiary of the proposed loan would be NEPA.
The struc'ture and role of NEPA are governed by Federal Decree No. 24 of 1972.
Iits mandate is to maintain an efficient, coordinated and economic system of
electriLity supply for all parts of the Federation, including generation and
distribution. NEPA has the status of a quasi-independent corporate body. Its
operations fall under the general surveillance of the Minister of Mines and
Power, who is responsible for approving important policies and decisions.
NEPA is controlled by a Board of Directors, comprising five senior officials
of relevant Government Departments, three additional non-government members
appointed by the Minister of Mines and Power, together with NEPA's General
Manager. The General Manager is responsible to the Board for NEPA's day-to-
day operations.
3.02      There are six Assistant General Managers (AGM's) reporting to
the G.M., each responsible for a division of NEPA's activities. These divi-
sions are engineering, operations, distribution, commercial, finance, and
administration. Engineering handles system expansion, planning, and construc-
tion. Operations is responsible for the operation and maintenance of all



- 12 -
generation facilities, the HT transmission system down to but not including
the 33kV level, and operation of the systems National Control Center. Distri-
bution is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the distribution
system of 33kV and below to supply individual customers. The commercial
division works closely with the distribution division in handling all aspects
of customer relations. The finance division produces NEPA's financial and
management accounts, capital and revenue forecasts, manages NEPA's cash flow,
is responsible for the internal audit function, and operates NEPA's data
processing facility. The administration division is responsible for all
personnel matters, training, procurement, properties and administrative
services. The senior management operates from a centralized headquarters
located in Lagos. NEPA's organization chart is shown in Annex 3.01.
3.03      The distribution division is sub-divided into 20 districts each with
its headquarters established at various key stations throughout the country.
Each district is under the responsibility of a district manager who reports to
the AGM (distribution) through the regional headquarters, and has its own
staff, including engineers, commercial staff and accountants. Districts are
responsible for planning, design and construction of distribution networks up
to 33 kV level, with limited assistance from headquarters. Each district has
its own stores system, operated in conjunction with the main store in Lagos.
Districts are also responsible for operation and maintenance of distribution
systems up to 33 kV and for metering, billing and other customer-related
activities. For these purposes, some districts have sub-offices, as necessary.
An organization chart of a typical district is shown in Annex 3.02. As a link
between headquarters and districts, there are four regional headquarters each
under the control of a regional director (distribution). One serves Lagos and
the others are located to serve the northern, eastern and western regions.
Each of these regional headquarters has a cadre of technical staff not required
on a permanent basis by districts but which are made available as required.
3.04      NEPA's organisational structure appears appropriate to its present
level of operations and has worked well up to now. However, to cope with the
projected rapid expansion of NEPA's generation and transmission system and its
customer coverage over the next five years, the organisation should be subject
to periodic review, including the possibilities for greater delegated authority
and responsibilities to the districts.
Operations
3.05      Although no interruptions of power supply due to energy shortages
affected NEPA's system during 1979, service reliability in general did not
substantially improve during the year. Frequent unscheduled interruptions,
originated by a number of different types of incidents, has caused NEPA's
public image to remain at a relatively low level. Several measures have been
discussed with NEPA to improve service reliability. One of the first steps in
this direction, proposed during the appraisal of Power V project, was to
create a special operating unit that would establish a monitoring information
system that would permit to quantify in a systematic manner- the overall
system performance, identify the most frequent causes of failures and concen-
trate corrective action in the weaker areas of the supply system. Whilst



- 13 -
NEPA has been studying methods adopted by other utilities for this purpose,
for which the Bank has supplied information, no substantial progress has been
achieved up to now. Assurance was obtained during negotiations that NEPA
will establish such an operating unit suitably staffed and with appropriate
terms of reference and authority by June 30, 1982. The Bank agreed to assist
NEPA with the drafting of suitable T.O.R. and implementation pLan.
Staffing
3.06      NEPA's performance is affected by a serious shorta6e of well-trained
and experienced staff at middle and low levels. Top management is obviously
competent, as evidenced by the fact that it is succeeding in operating and
maintaining such a rapidly expanding and complex utility operation, under
adverse conditions. The levels of department director and section manager
also contain a sizable number of competent and experienced people, but even
this level of management is affected by the staff shorta6es endemic to NEPA.
Consequently, directors and managers are fully occupied in maintainin6 day-to-
day operations, and have little time for planning, systematic decision-idaking
or on-the-job training of their subordinates. There exist, however, fairly
obvious cases of overstaffing at lower levels. The following table shows
the growth of NEPA's staff over the period 1974 to 1979, related to the
growth of operations.
FYs                   1974      1975       1976      1977      1978      1979

3.07      The number of consumers relative to staff, appear to have risen by
about 62% from March 1974 to March 1979, suggesting improved eLficiency.
However, the figures must be regarded with caution. Firstly data on numbers
and classification of staff positions in past years have been unreliable.
Secondly, there has been a high number of reported vacancies. The following
table shows the classification of staff at end of December 1980 together with
an indication of vacancies:

Unskilled Labor                  3,947        3,997    22.1     (50)
Others (Clerical, Secre-
tarial, etc.)                 7,662       5,312     29.4   2,350     30.7
TOTAL              20,878      18,075   100.0    2,803     13.4
3.08      For the last two categories (Unskilled Labors and Others), there are
a large number of sub-categories for which numbers of authorized positions are
unreliable. However, some sub-categories of unskilled labor can be safely
asserted to be significantly overstaffed, compensated for by vacancies else-
where. NEPA-s management has indicated that freezing the number of positions
for non-skilled staff is not possible due to the continuous power system
expansions within Nigeria and the social problems arising from staff reloca-
tion. During negotiations NEPA agreed to continue the undertaking given
during the Power V project negotiations to endeavor to maintain the present
trend of improving the ratio of consumers per employee.
3.09      The serious staff shortages especially at senior levels is due
primarily to the Federal civil service salary scales which NEPA, in common
with most other government controlled organisations, is compelled to operate
within. These salary scales are far too low, in comparison with private
industry and commerce, to attract or retain sufficient numbers of well-trained
and motivated staff. Government is well aware of these problems and is sympa-
thetic to the need for authority to be delegated to the Board to establish
appropriate salary scales. Unfortunately, whilst Government is both sympathetic
and anxious to see NEPA gradually move to a more commercial operation, the
political and practical problems of NEPA severing its links with the civil
service regulatory authorities are considerable. Nevertheless, as a first
step, the Minister of Mines and Power has authorised NEPA to commission an
independent study on its salary scales and conditions of employment and
consultants have been appointed. This study will include a comparison of



- 15 -
NEPA-s salaries with those of other Nigerian large parastatal organizations
such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) (wnose salaries are
not linked to the Civil Service), power authorities in comparable countries,
and the private sector, focusing on the impact on personnel turnover.
During negotiations, assurance was o'btained that NEPA will send the results of
the study to the Bank as soon as such results are available. In addition to
the study, Government has appointed a special commission to examine tae
adequacy and competitiveness of parastatal organizations' salary packages
vis-a-vis the comparable private sector.
Training
3.10      In addition to improving the competitiveness of its salary package,
NEPA must also intensify and expand its in-house training program to secure
and maintain an adequate and competent staff. NEPA's five year expansion
program will require in the top three grades alone the recruitment of an
additional 1,300 staff. For many years, NEPA has provided training both
in-house and outside for various staff categories and specific skills. Due to
these ever increasing staff requirements, accentuated by the recent heavy
staff turnover, a thorough analysis of NEPA's training needs and capacities
was carried out during the preparation of the Power V project. As a result of
the analysis, a training component of US$4.3 million, with a foreign cost of
US$3.0 million was included in the Power V Bank Loan No. 1766-UNI. The
training component included expansion of existing and new teaching facilities,
necessary equipment, and provision of technical expertise to upgrade and expand
NEPA's in-house training capability. As indicated in para. 2.08, NEPA is
making progress with the implementation of the training component, albeit with
some delay due to the difficulties in appointing a Director of Training who is
now in post. The proposed project includes funds for financing an extension
of this training and staff development program (para. 4.09). Disbursement of
this part of the project will be conditional on the successful implementation
of the training program financed under Loan 1766-UNI. The criteria for
successful implementation are set out in Annex 3.03.
Accounting and Financial Management
3.11      NEPA's financial department has qualified staff at the assistant
general manager and directors' levels, but is acutely affected by the staffing
shortages at all lower levels as outlined above. Accounts are kept in accor-
dance with accepted U.K. accounting principles. Part of the accounts records
keeping (e.g., revenue, customers, expenses) is decentralized to the districts
which report monthly figures to headquarters for consolidation. NEPA prepares
quarterly financial and management statements but in FY80 preparation was
unduly delayed due to staff shortages. NEPA prepares annual operating and
capital budgets, and has established budgetary controls and long range
forecasts.
Inventory Control
3.12      NEPA's first comprehensive physical inventory of stocks since its
inception in 1972, was carried out in January 1979, and revealed an inventory



- 16 -
shortfall of about N20.0 million (US$36.0 million) when compared to the
FYi979 year end book value of N72.5 million (US$132.0 million). The auditors
therefore qualified their audit report on the FY1979 annual accounts due to
the uncertainties regarding NEPA's level of inventories. This could also
imply uncertainty regarding the level of inventory consumption during tne year
audited and during prior years and, therefore, the accounting results of tnose
years. NEPA feels that this inventory shortfall stems from shortcomings in
the physical inventory itself which might have omitted part of the stores
and/or inventory-in-transit. Another physical inventory of stores was carriea
out in January 1980; analysis of the results is still to be finalized. Tne
delay in completing the analysis is due to the staff constraints and other
more pressing priorities.   NEPA continues to work on improving the inventory
procedures to reduce significantly such inventory differences in future, ano
plans to intensify its efforts as soon as sufficient experienced and competent
accounting staff can be recruited.
Customers Receivables
3.13      At the end of FY1979, gross customer receivables amounted to N92.9
million (US$168.9 million) equivalent to 6.8 months billings (1.5 to 2.0
months of which represent the normal billing/collection cycle). Included in
the gross customer receivables were Government agencies receivables which
amounting to N18.0 million (US$32.7 million). NEPA continues its efforts
to speed up collection by reducing billing delays, improving thie analysis of
arrears and, most of all, by proceeding to large scale disconnections of
consumers. However, resistance of consumers to pay their electricity bills
is frequently very strong. NEPA's billing problems are aggravated botn by
shortages of experienced staff and the fairly rapid staff turnover in such
critica'l revenue producing areas as Lagos and Ibadan. NEPA is presently
exploring with the Federal Ministry of Mines and Power, improved arran6ements
and procedures for collectinrg outstanding Federal and State Government electri-
city bills on a regular basis. Part of the past problem has stemmed from the
inertia of the public accounts siystems coupled to the generally held view that
NEPA is just another arm of goverlnment funded by the Federal Government.
Reserves for doubtful customer receivables at the end of FY1979 amounted to
N11.9 million (US$21.6 million), equivalent to 12.8% of total customer
receivables, or 15.9% of receivables other than Government, whicn wouLd appear
sufficient. However, in view of NEPA's proposed expansion program and coInse-
quent substantial increase in customer numbers, it is appropriate that NEPA
should review all aspects of its billing and collection system to inmprove
both its effectiveness and cost efficiency. During niegotiations, assurance
was obtained that a) NEPA will engage consultants to review its billing and
collection systems and make detailed improvement proposals, and b) NEPA will
review periodically with the Government and the Bank the arrangements for
prompt recovery of overdue accounts including those of Government and other
parastatals. Finance is provided under the loan to engage qualified con-
sultants on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank to undertake the
billing and collection review.

Revaluation of Fixed Assets
3.14      When the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger
Dam Authority (NDA) were merged to form NEPA, the fixed assets of the two
former corporations were revalued as of April 1, 1972 (date of inception)
by professional independent valuerc and transferred as NEPA-s initial assets.
Since April 1, 1972, all subsequent asset additions have been included in
fixed assets at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight line method,
and consequently the value of assets appearing in the Balance Sheet is the
written down value of both the original revalued assets and subsequent addi-
tions at cost. No further independent revaluation of assets has been under-
taken since the original exercise in April 1972. The written down value of
the assets in operation are considerably below the replacement cost of those
assets. During the preparation and negotiation of Power V project, methods of
revaluation of fixed assets in operation for the purpose of rate of return
calculation were discussed. NEPA did not accept a commitment to any specific
method of revaluation, but assurances were obtained that acceptable revalua-
tion methods would be discussed at appropriate times and agreed upon, between
NEPA and the Bank. During appraisal of the proposed project and a subsequent
mission, the matter was further discussed and agreement reached that NEPA will
annually revalue its fixed assets in operation for the purpose of rate of
return calculations. However, NEPA is still unconvinced of the effectiveness
of any of the proposed methods in view of the lack of agreement and acceptance
among professional accountants. In NEPATs rolling forecast produced every two
years an attempt is made to include a revaluation factor to determine their own
rate of return targets. This factor is not sufficiently developed to present
as an alternative to the Bank's proposed options. NEPA agreed that it will
endeavor to develop the indicies to provide an acceptable method of revaluing
assets by December 31, 1982 which would be applied to the December 31, 1982
annual accounts. Should NEPA's management need technical assistance to
clarify the implications of alternative procedures for asset revaluation,
financing for this purpose is available under Loan 1766-UNI (Power V). Mean
while it was agreed that the method employed by the Bank in project appraisal
for determining the rate of return on revalued assets would continue to be
used as proxy in the absence of an agreed alternative acceptable method.
Procurement Limits
3.15      The present limits of authority (in line with civil service regula-
tions) for the approval and award of NEPA contracts together with NEPA's
proposals to Government are as follows:
NEPA-s proposed
Present limits    increased limits
N million         N million
General Manager                       up to 0.25       up to 0.5
NEPA Board                            0.25 to 1.0      0.5 to 3.0
Ministerial Committee
(Mines and Power)                   1.0 to 2.0       3.0 to 5.0
President in Council                  over 2.0         over 5.0



- 18 -
In the light of inflation and the magnitude of NEPA's expansion program, the
present limits are unnecessarily restrictive and are leading to costly delays
in capital works implementation. There are both indications and precedent
(NNPC) that Government is receptive to some relaxation in limits. During
negotiations, Government indicated that it was studying the implications of
extending the limits not only for NEPA but also for other parastatals and
government ministries.
Audits
3.16      External audits are carried out by Balogun, Ayanfalu, Badejo and Co.
in association with Price Waterhouse and Co., both firms of professionally
qualified auditors. The auditors are acceptable to the Bank. Previous Loan
Agreements provide for NEPA to have its accounts and financial statements
audited by acceptable, independent auditors within four months of the end of
each fiscal year. Given the dispersed nature of NEPA's activities and govern-
ment's slow approval procedures, the four month accounts submission deadline
is unrealistic. Assurance was obtained at negotiations that the audited
annual accounts would be submitted within six months of the end of each fiscal
year.
3.17      In addition to external audit arrangements, NEPA operates a system
of internal audit. However, it suffers from the same staffing difficulties as
the other elements of NEPA-s financial management.
3.18      NEPA insures against all normal commercial risks, including damage
to major structures, machinery and goods in transit, vehicles insurance, as
well as appropriate public utility insurance. Most of NEPA's risk is carried
by the National Insurance Corporation.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project objectives are:
(1) to continue the strengthening of NEPAPs organisation and capability
through support for its manpower development program and specific
assistance for known weak areas of management;
(2) to continue support for strengthening NEPA- financial capability
through implementation of appropriate tariff structure changes which
in turn will improve NEPA's internal generation of funds. Thereby
reducing its dependence on Government funding and establish NEPA's
credibility as a potential international borrower;
(3)  to continue with the strengthening and expansion of the national
distribution facilities to ensure that the benefits of NEPA's
generation and transmission expansion program are extended throughout
Nigeria to all sectors of the population by the most economical
means and at the same time raise the standards of service reliability.

Project Description
4.02      The proposed project is the second phase of the power distribution
expansion initiated in Lagos, under Power V, and would consist of three
parts:
Part A.   The Igbin interconnection which would provide the con-
nection between the Igbin thermal power station (to be constructed in Lagos)
and the national 330 kV grid and to the 132 kV Lagos distribution network.
Part B.   Continues the strengthening of the distribution network to
the 23 cities listed in para. 2.21.
Part C.   Training program support and consultant services for the
continued strengthening of NEPA's management and organisation.
Part A. Igbin Interconnection
4.03      The Igbin interconnection would provide the off-take link from
the 1200 MW Igbin power station to the 330 kV grid and to the 132 kV Lagos
distribution network through transmission lines and four substations located
at Igbin, Ikeja-West, Victoria Island, and Ikorodu. (see schematic diagrams
Annex 4.02 pages 1 and 2). This would complete the expansion of the distrib-
ution facilities for Lagos metropolitan area initiated in Power V.
The main components are:
4.04      Transmissions lines
50 km  330 kV double circuit    Igbin to Ikeja-West
30 km  330 kV                   Igbin to Victoria Island 1/
19 km  132 kV                   Igbin to Ikorodu
4.05      Substations and transformers
For the operation of the above-mentioned interconnecting lines, the
corresponding substation terminals have been included in the project at Igbin,
Ikeja-West, Victoria Island and Ikorodu. The transformer capacity to be
installed in these substations is detailed as follows:
Igbin:  four 225 MVA, 16/330 kV transformer units,
two 150 MVA, 330/132/33 kV transformer units.
Victoria Island:   two 60 MVA, 132/33/11 kV transformer units.
No additional transformer capacity has been proposed to the existing facili-
ties at Ikeja-West, since this substation will be a main switching pcoint
only.
1/   Initial operation at 132 kV.

Part B. Power Distribution to 23 Cities
4.06      This project component provides both for the rehabilitation and
expansion of the distribution network to the 23 cities (listed in para. 2.21)
to meet the expanding demand and at the same time improve service reliability,
and would cover expansion of the 132 and 33 kV distribution feeder lines and
substations required to support the medium (11 and 6.6 kV) and low tension
power distribution system for the period 1983-1988.
4.07      The facilities covered under this component of the proposed
project include:
Transmission lines: about 83 circuit-kilometers of 132 kV
about 238 circuit-kilometers of 33 kV
Substations transformer capacity of:
about 1260 MVA of 132/33 and 132/11 kV
about 615 MVA of 66/33/11 and 33/11 kV
4.08      Annex 4.01 page 1 summarizes the line length and transformer capa-
city to be installed under the proposed project at each of the cities men-
tioned above, whilst pages 2 and 3 of Annex 4.01 detail the transformer
capacity to be installed under the project and retirements contemplated during
the project period for each of the substations operating in the 23 cities.
Part C. Training Program and Consultant Services
4.09      Part C of the proposed project provides financing for:
(i) general design and supervision of Parts A and B of the project;
(ii) the extension of the on-going training program, financed under
Loan 1766-UNI (para. 3.10);
(iii) the preparation of the Completion Report of Loan 847-UNI (para.
4.26);
(iv) a study for the improvement of the billing and collection systems
(para. 3.13); and
(v) the updating of the power development master plan financed
under Loan 847-UNI (para. 2.18).
4.10      The cost of Part C item (ii) to be financed under the proposed
loan has been estimated on the basis of 150 man-months of specialists at
US$8,800/mm for salaries and foreign travel expenses (NEPA would provide
housing); whilst the cost of items (iii), and (iv) have been estimated on
a total of 30 mm of short-term consultants at an inclusive monthly cost of
US$13,000 (including local hotel and subsistence expenses).

Project Cost
4.11      As summarized in Table 4.1 and detailed in Annex 4.04, the esti-
mated total project cost is US$218.6 million equivalent, net of taxes of
US$5.6 million, and excluding interest during construction. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$148.5 million of which the Bank would
finance US$100 million under the proposed loan. The base cost of Part A of
the project is estimated at US$60.5 million which represents an investment
cost of US$71.7/kW of generating capacity of the Igbin power station, which is
reasonable. The base cost of Part B is estimated at US$103.2 million, repre-
senting an investment cost of US$81/kVA of transformer capacity added to the
11 kV distribution systems of the 23 cities. Adding to the cost of Part B,
the cost of the distribution facilities not covered under the proposed project
(11 kV and low tension distribution plus the ongoing 132 and 33 kV program),
estimated at US$160 million, the unit investment cost of the incremental
demand of 813 MW expected during the project period would be about US$412/lbW4,
which is reasonable in terms of costs prevailing in West Africa.
4.12      Cost estimates correspond to price levels of June 1981. They
include contingencies calculated as a percentage of direct cost, as follows:
Part A: power lines and substations based on recent evaluation of
all Part A bids with 5% average physical contingency.
Part B: based on recently updated global estimate at June 1981 using
a 10% average physical contingency.
Total cost estimate includes price contingencies based on calculation factors
as follows:
Foreign exchange component:   1981:     9%
1982:   8.5%
1983:   7.5%
1984:   7.5%
1985:   7.5%
1986:   6.0%
Local cost component: 15% per year.
Project Financing
4.13      The Bank loan of US $100 million would finance 45% of total project
cost and would cover some two thirds of the foreign exchange requirements.
The remaining part of project cost would be financed by NEPA itself, either by
way of borrowing from the Federal Government or by internal cash generation.
NEPA should have no difficulty in assembling sufficient funds to cover the
balance of project costs as the project forms part of NEPA-s ten year develop-
ment plan that has been endorsed by the Federal Government.

4.14      It remains part of NEPA-s longer term technical strategy to broaden
the basis of its financial support by borrowing from a broader range of
lenders than hitherto. In order to assist NEPA in this endeavour, the Bank
sought to join with the EIB in cofinancing the Fifth Power project for dis-
tribution in the Lagos area (Loan 1766-UNI). Negotiations with the EIB for
a US$35 million loan took longer than were originally envisaged and the
processing of the Bank loan therefore proceeded independently of that from the
EIB. Nevertheless, since the EIB loan was signed in late 1980, it may be said
that the aim of assisting NEPA to seek new sources of external finance was
achieved in substance.
4.15      In somuch as the proposed Bank loan   falls short of the project's
full foreign exchange cost by some US$48.5 million, the opportunity still
exists for NEPA to fill the gap by borrowing from abroad rather than from the
Federal Government. The Bank will continue to assist NEPA locate suitable
sources of finance if so requested.
Engineering and Project Execution
4.16      NEPA has entrusted Shawmont (Canada) with the feasibility study,
general design, coordination and supervision of the construction of the Igbin
thermal plant and interconnection of this plant with NEPA's power system. The
interconnection constitutes Part A of the proposed project. Shawmont carried
out the general engineering, including route studies of the transmission
lines, prepared bidding documents, and would assist NEPA in the award of
contracts and in the construction supervision of the works. The Igbin-Victoria
Island line has required special field studies for design of the foundations
of the structures, because part of this line will be built over shallow areas
of the Lagos lagoon. The transmission lines under Part A would be constructed
under final design, supply and erection contracts. NEPA has successfully used
this type of contract for its high voltage lines in the past. Although the
general power flow conditions of the interconnection with the Lagos 330 kV and
132 kV systems has been determined, NEPA should supplement the power flow
analysis of the Igbin connection under normal and contingency conditions to
refine adjustments of voltage levels and protection system design and opera-
tion. During negotiations assurances were obtained that a) NEPA will under-
take the power flow study by no later than December 31, 1981 and will send the
report of such study to the Bank by no later than December 31, 1982, and b)
NEPA will prepare and send to the Bank schedules showing the proper integra-
tion of the Igbin interconnection with the commissioning of the Igbin thermal
plant, the first such schedule to be sent to the Bank by September 30, 1981.
4.17      The terminal substations at Victoria Island and Ikorodu are similar
in design to that of the existing substations of the Lagos area. The Ikeja-
West terminal consists of two additional bays to the existing 330 kV substa-
tion to be undertaken by NEPA and has appointed M.C. to prepare the design
which is nearing completion. NEPA proposes to negotiate the contract for the
construction with the contractors who built the original substation. The cost
of this extension does not form part of the project.



- 24 -
4.18      NEPA entrusted British Electricity International (BEI) with the
study of the power distribution expansion for the 23 cities which constitute
Part B of the project. BEI made a thorough review of NEPA's design standards
for lines and substations, on which basis specifications of Part B have been
prepared.
4.19      The power distribution expansions for the 23 cities have been
designed to comply with standards of voltage regulation and to maintain
distribution losses at acceptable levels. On the average, distribution losses
measured from the 132 kV side of the feeding substations and the low-tension
side of distribution transformers are expected to decrease after the project
completion, from 12% to around 10% or below.
4.20      NEPA is negotiating with BEI for the preparation of bidding docu-
ments and the supervision of construction of Part B of the project, but
has not yet reached agreement on the terms of contract with BEI. The appoint-
ment of BEI would be acceptable to the Bank. However, if NEPA is unable to
reach agreement with BEI, NEPA should invite proposals from other consultants
known to NEPA. As a condition for Board presentation, NEPA should have
appointed consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
Procurement
4.21      All Bank-financed goods and services would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Locally manufactured equipment or materials, such as electric conductors, may
not be eligible for the margin of preference as stipulated in the Bank's
guidelines for bid evaluation due to its low added value in the manufacturing
process. For the 330 and 132 kV transmission lines, NEPA would continue their
past practice of design, supply and erection contracts. For the substations,
procurement would be done in separate contract packages for (i) power trans-
formers, (ii) design, supply and erection of structures, switchgear, control
and protection equipment and (iii) civil works (mainly buildings).
Disbursement
4.22      The Bank loan of US$100 million would be disbursed during the five
year period 1982-1986 as follows:
Part A - Igbin Connection
Sixty percent of foreign expenditures or ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured goods for transmission lines totalling approximately US$9.4
million, and transformers and other materials for substations totalling
approximately US$23.5 million.
Part B - Distribution for 23 Cities
Sixty percent of. foreign expenditures or ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured goods for transmission and distribution lines totalling approxi-
mately US$4.8 million, and transformers and other materials for substations
amounting to approximately US$39.6 million.



- 25 -
Part C - Consultant Services, Studies and Support
100% of foreign expenditures for:
(i)  general design and supervision of Parts A and B totalling approxi-
mately US$6.2 million;
Vii)  extension of ongoing training program totalling approximately
US$1.5 million; and
(iii)  other studies and support totalling approximately US$5.0 million.
Unallocated. An unallocated amount of US$10.0 million.
Retroactive Finance. During negotiations, retroactive financing of up to
US$2.0 million was agreed to against expenditure incurred after June 30, 1980
and before the date of the agreement on Part C consultant services for design
and engineering work on Part A and B of the project.
The disbursement schedule relating to the Bank loan of US$100 million is shown
in Table 4.2. The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.3.
4.23      The time schedule for the Project execution is shown in Annex 4.03.
To avoid delays caused by interpretation of existing Government legislation on
Nigerianization of enterprises doing business in Nigeria, the Government and
the Bank agreed during negotiations to extend the understanding obtained
during negotiations of Loan 1766-UNI, that foreign companies executing Bank
assisted projects would not be affected by Federal guidelines, requiring
incorporation within a year of their arrival in Nigeria. The bidding documents
will require that all companies should employ Nigerian staff to support
expatriate staff, in order to promote the transfer of technologies. In addi-
tion, specific agreements to promote the transfer of skills and technologies
will be incorporated in bidding documents to apply equally to all bidders.
Environmental Aspects
4.24      The 330 kV transmission line routes for Part A of the project have
been carefully studied to assure high safety standards for the population
living in the neighboring areas and minimize adverse aesthetical effects. The
crossing of the Lagos Lagoon of the Igbin-Victoria Island line has been
designed to provide adequate clearances for the circulation of barges to the
inner areas of the lagoon. The extension of 132 and 33 kV facilities in the 23
cities covered under the pruject would not produce adverse environmental
effects as they have been designed in routes providing adequate space from
buildings or recreation areas.
Project Monitoring and Reporting
4.25      During negotiations assurances were obtained that NEPA will submit
progress reports, on a quarterly basis, of the project execution and of
the monitoring indicators shown in Annex 4.05. Particular emphasis will be

placed upon financial indicators, including those relating to the collection
of receivables. Assurance was also received that NEPA will prepare a comple-
tion report of the project. If NEPA staff is not available for this purpose,
NEPA would commission the preparation of the completion report to the consul-
tants in charge of project supervision, or would hire outside professionals.
Nepa will also adopt the same proccedure for the preparation of the completion
report for the ongoing Loan 1766-UNI.
4.26      Difficulties have arisen in obtaining adequate information from
NEPA's files to prepare the completion report for Loan 847-UNI (closing date
June 30, 1980); the problem is compounded by technical staff shortages within
NEPA (para. 3.06). NEPA has agreed to prepare this completion report with the
assistance of an outside specialist. Financing for this assistance has been
provided in this loan (para. 4.09).
Project Risks and Safeguards
4.27      A major risk which could cause delays in the execution of NEPA's
works is the long time taken by the Federal Government authorities to approve
awards of contracts. During negotiations of Loan 1766-UNI (Lagos Power
Distribution Project, Power V), agreement was reached that the Government
would take all necessary measures to expedite approvals of contracts under
that project. A similar assurance was received during negotiations from the
Government for the approval of contracts under the proposed Power VI project.
Furthermore, the Bank will continue to support NEPA-s proposals to the Govern-
ment for raising the value of contracts that require Government approval, from
Nl.0 million to N3.0 million (US$5.5 million) (para. 3.15).
4.28      Another risk which could cause delays in the execution of NEPA's
projects is limited availability of counterpart staff (para. 3.06) even with
the present arrangement of strong support from consultants at different
project stages. As the resolution to its staffing problems will take some time,
NEPA would have to increasingly rely on external support in the project-s
preparation and execution, as well as consolidate contractors responsibilities
in "supply and erection" contracts for transmission lines and the main substa-
tion components. These measures would alleviate the shortage of NEPA's high-
level professionals and will be taken into account in the project execution.
V.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Igbin Interconnection (Part A)
5.01      Part A of the proposed project will provide the means to transfer
the power generated at the Igbin power station (with an initial capacity of
800 MW) to Nigeria's national grid, at three points: Ikeja West, Victoria
Island and Ikorodu. The first of these points is to the main switching
substation of the 330 kV national grid, whilst the other two can be con-
sidered as reinforcements of the power distribution system of the Lagos



- 29 -
metropolitan area. The Ikeja-West substation was selected as the main
interconnection point as the benefits outweighed the disadvantages of high
proportion of power concentrated in this single substation and resultant
vulnerability. The benefits considered were easy access from Igbin, short
construction time required, and infrastructure economies compared to creation
of a new substation along the Sapele 330 kV line, further to the Northeast.
5.02      Igbin's outgoing transmission capacity required to transfer the
initial generating capacity under a single contingency condition (one circuit
of one of the outgoing lines out of service) could be achieved by means of
one double circuit 330 kV line (to Ikeja West) and three double circuit 132 kV
lines (two to Victoria Island and one to Ikorodu). As the overall cost
differential is not mlaterial between the two alternatives of two double-circuit
132 kV lines or one double-circuit 330 kV to Victoria Island, the latter
solution was adopted due to the reduction in number and cost savings on
foundations (para 4.16). However, the circuit would only be operated ini-
tially at 132 kV. Undar this solution, the most important load centers of
the Lagos metropolitan area (Lagos, Ikoyi and Victoria Islands) will have
ultimately two 330 kV feeding points (Akangba and Victoria Island), which
would substantially increase service reliability. For the Igbin/Ikeja-West
line, three different routes were considered with lengths of 54, 62 and 72 km.
The shortest route would have to cross some congested zones in the Northern
section of Lagos. The 62 km route was selected as the least cost solution.
Distribution for 23 Cities (Part B)
5.03      In the process of project preparation a systematic approach has been
followed through the analysis of demand projections, carried out for each
city, and optimization of design standards. Several alternatives to meet the
demand growth for the next 10 years were analyzed by NEPA's consultants and
the least cost solutions were selected. In the 23 cities studied, the distri-
bution systems at 11 or 6.6 kV are fed from 132 kV incoming lines through
step-down substations at 132/33/11, 132/33 and 132/11 kV. Annex 5.01 shows
the expected demand and transformer capacity during the project period in the
23 cities.
Internal Economic Rate of Return on NEPATs Development Program
5.04      The Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR)   for the project cannot
be computed per se but a fair yardstick for NEPA-s expansion program required
to serve the incremental power demand of the 23 cities covered under the
proposed project for the period 1982/83-1986/87 could be given by equalizing
the present value of the stream of incremental system investment with the
present value of the stream of forecast incremental net revenues (attributable
to the incremental investment) from sales of electricity at current tariff
levels over the life of the facilities of the incremental investment. A
shadow exchange rate of US$1 = NO.72 has been adopted for conversion of
foreign cost. Labor cost was evaluated at market prices, as in Nigeria there
is no unemployment of skilled or semi-skilled workers required for the execu-
tion of the project. Other assumptions made for the IERR calculation are



- 30 -
detailed in Annex 5.02. The IERR so calculated is 17.5% (see Annex 5.03).
The main uncertainties which may affect this return are possible investment
cost increases of the proposed project and lower than expected electricity
sales. Should the project cost increase by 10% and revenues decrease by 15%
than estimated (combined effect of decline in sales and tariffs reduction),
the comparable return would be 13%. As the system net revenue from sales of
electricity is being used in the analysis as surrogate for system benefits,
all estimated economic returns are understated as they do not capture the
consumer surplus which might be generated, which by its nature eludes mea-
surement.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
6.01      The following figures summarize NEPATs income statements for the
fiscal years 1975 to 1979. Details are given in Annex 6.01--Income Statements
--which are based on audited accounts. The auditors have given a qualified
opinion on the annual accounts for FY 1979, due to the difficulties with
the accuracy and recording of inventory (para. 3.12).

6.02      During the last five years NEPA has experienced a phase of accel-
erated growth; from FY 1975 to 1979 the volume of GWh sold increased by an
annual average of 16% whilst related Naira revenues increased by an annual
average of 24%. For FY 1979 power sales reached 4,178 GWh, and NEPA's revenues
amounted to N166 (US$302) million. Revenues have more than covered operating
costs which have grown approximately in proportion with revenues, and the
operating ratio remained stable at about 84%. The rate of return on historical
cost net fixed assets in operation has also remained stable at around 3 to 4%.
1/   FYs 1978 and 1979 net income is after providing for foreign exchange
losses of N4.3 and N10.0 million respectively arising from the
revaluation of long term foreign loans at current year-end exchange
rates.

6.03      However, based on estimated revalued net fixed assets, NEPA's
earnings performance has been disappointing. The operating ratio increased
from about 92% in 1975 to 100% for 1979; FY 1979 yielded a net loss of N13.5
(US$24.5) million. The rate of return on estimated revalued net fixed assets
in operation has stayed around zero for the last five years, whereas the
revenue covenant of Loan 847-UNI (Power IV) had set an 8% rate of return
target. The following summary figures are based on an estimated revaluation
of NEPA's fixed assets, using appropriate price indices; details are shown in

6.05      The above table shows that NEPA has been engaged in a large con-
struction program, financed increasingly by loans. Construction is expected
to continue and expand during the next five years, requiring further large
injections of funds. In recent years, a number of loans have been raised from
foreign sources. However, these loans have provided only a small proportion
of NEPA's funds. The majority of NEPA's loans have come from the Federal
Government, on soft terms. Interest has been at 5%, with repayment over 25
years, including a 5-year moratorium on interest, and a 5-year grace period on
principal repayments. The effective interest rate on such loans (allowing
for the interest moratorium) has been about 3%. The debt:equity ratio
increased from 35:65 at the end of FY 1975 to 75:25 at the end of FY 1979 on
historical basis, reflecting the decreasing contribution from internally
generated cash and the increasing reliance on long term loans to finance the
capital expenditure program. There was no sizeable adverse impact on the debt
service coverage during this period because of the grace periods on principal
and interest for Government loans.
6.06      Balance sheet figures summarized below are based on the estimated
revaluation of net fixed assets as shown in Annex 6.06.

Electricity Tariffs
6.07      The tariff revision introduced on August 1, 1979 is expected to have
raised NEPA-s average tariff level by about 60% to 6.5 Kobos per KWh (US$11.8).
The August 1979 tariff schedules reflect the three existing types
of supply:
(A) single-phase 230 volts service, applicable to residential and small
commercial/industrial consumers;
(B) three-phase 400 volts service for small commercial/industrial
consumers not exceeding 75 kVA of connected capacity; and
(C) three-phase service supplied at several voltage levels up to
132 kV, with discounts depending on supply voltages for the larger
commercial/industrial users.
The present service classification appears adequate and of easy application.
The single-phase tariff schedule consists of a fixed monthly kW connected
capacity charge and the usual kWh consumption charge. Small circuit-breakers
are currently being installed, at every connection, set at the connected
capacities for which the consumers have paid. As well as limiting maximum
demand, the system permits a more orderly registration of consumer requirements
and facilitates NEPA-s generation and distribution systems planning.
6.08      Prior to August 1979, price schedules had all been on the declining
block system, which did not serve to discourage excessive and wasteful consump-
tion. Furthermore, the application of this system to residential services did
not provide a satisfactory way to achieve social objectives. The tariff
structure introduced in August 1979 has begun to address these concerns.
The following table shows average prices per kWh for six typical cases,
based on the new tariff.
kW         kW        kWh per    Average Price
Case      Type      Connected     Demand      Month    k/kWh    USU/kWh
Al    Residential        1           -          25     10.0       18.2
A2    Residential        2           -         100      8.0       14.6
A3    Residential        4           -         400      6.7       12.3
Bl    Industrial         -          10       2,000      7.8       14.2
B2    Industrial         -          56      20,000      7.7       14.0
C     Industrial
(11 kV supply)    -         244     100,000      7.2      13.1
6.09      However, as can readily be perceived, residential tariffs are
still unsatisfactory from a social point of view. For the smallest consump-
tion, representing the basic electricity needs of most of the low-income
population, the average unit price is about 50% (previously three times)
higher than the average price for the larger residential consumer with wide
use of electrical appliances, which is typical of high-income consumers.



- 34 -
6.10      The cost of supplying electricity to the larger, densely-populated
areas, especially Lagos, is obviously less than supplying to the smaller
cities with lower population densities. At present, NEPA-s policy, supported
by Government, is to maintain uniform tariff levels nationwide.
6.11      In view of strong public reactions against the new tariffs intro-
duced in August 1979, which in some cases it was claimed resulted in increases
of up to 100%, the incoming Government instituted a review. For this purpose,
it appointed a special committee with participation of NEPA, to modify the new
tariff schedules to reduce excessive increases. The committee was expected to
conclude its review and make recommendations to the Minister of Mines and
Power by the end of 1980. The committee has submitted its recommendations but
no public announcement has yet been made. It is understood that the committee
recommends a modest marginal overall reduction with the largest benefits going
to the smaller residential consumers. The recommendations if implemented are
expected to have only a marginal inpact on NEPA-s future revenues. Further
refinement of the tariff structures must await the establishment of economic
cost of supply for different classes and levels of consumption, about which
NEPA has little information at present. However, NEPA has taken preliminary
steps in this direction by seeking the assistance of consultants, Electricite
de France (EdF), to carry out a tariff study under terms of reference accept-
able to the Bank. During negotiations assurances were obtained that a) NEPA
will send the results of this study to the Bank for its review and comments,
and b) NEPA will take all necessary action to revise its tariff structure and
levels taking into account the recommendations of the study.
Future Financial Performance
6.12      The following figures summarize NEPA's earnings for the six FYs
1980 to 1985, based on the detailed projections through FY 1988 shown in
Annex 6.02. Annex 6.07 includes forecasts of financial data which would
reflect the revaluation of fixed assets based on indices shown in Annex 6.09.
The financial projections were prepared by the Bank mission, L,tarting from
NEPA's April 1978 Ten Year Financial Forecast (the last long range projections
NEPA has prepared) and updating them by taking into account major cnanges
indicated by NEPA's April 1980 Load and Capacity Forecast. (Revenue/Income

capacity at Sapele and Afam in 1980/81 and 1981/82 and of the hydroelectric
schemes at Shiroro and Jebba in 1983/84, NEPA's power sales are projected to
increase from 4,178 GWh for FY79 to 11,918 GWh for FY85 which represents an
average annual increase of 19.1%. The substantial increases in the GWh sales
volume, together with the tariff change implemented on August 1, 1979 is
expected to enable NEPA to achieve a net income of about N69 (US$126)
million in FY80 and about N112 (US$204) million in FY81 based on historical
cost of fixed assets. The rate of return on revalued fixed assets in opera-
tion is estimated at 4.4% for FY81 and for FY82. This compares to the
latest covenanted rates of return (Loan 1766-UNI) of 4% for 1981 and 3% for
1982. The revenue covenant of loan 1766-UNI also requires, starting with
FY83, for NEPA to take the necessary steps to achieve an 8% rate of return on
its net fixed assets in operation. Assuming the inflation rates shown in
Annex 6.09 and the increase in GWh sales mentioned above materialize, no
tariff increase seems necessary before April 1982 to achieve these goals,
beginning fiscal year 1983 an increase of about 15% to 20% would be necessary
to meet the 8% rate of return. During negotiations NEPA reconfirmed the
assurances reached under Loan 1766-UNI.
6.14      NEPA's projected assets and liabilities are summarized below.
Details are given in Annexes 6.05--Balance Sheet Projections and 6.07--
Revaluation of Fixed Assets Projections.
1/   NEPA's annual accounts for FY80 have been drafted by NEPA and await
audit. Delay has been due to Minister of Mines and Power's wish to
appoint fresh auditors. However, the Minister has now agreed to reappoint
existing auditors up to December 31, 1980. Draft FY80 accounts indicate
that net income is better than forecasted, but is subject co fI nal
adjustment at audit.

6.15      The debt: equity ratio based on historical cost fixed assets will
continue to go down to 81:19 by end FY 1982 due to NEPA's continuing heavy
capital expenditure program financed mainly by long term loans. Thereafter it
is expected to gradually improve with NEPA's increasing retained earnings and
should reach about 75:25 three. years- it--er-  i*T  m;uch more favorable
on the basis of revalued fixed assets.   When the revaluation increment is
included in equity the most unfavorable ratio, at the end of FY 1982, would be
62:38, which is still acceptable. At the end of FY 1985 it would have improved
to 55:45.
6.16      The contribution to capital expenditures from internal cash genera-
tion as well as the debt service coverage are shown in detail in Annex 6.03
- Funds Flow Statements, and summarized below:

6.17      The contribution of internally generated cash to the financing of
the capital expenditures will remain in the order of 15%, until the introduc-
tion of the tariff increase necessary to reach an 8% rate of return, projected
for the beginning of FY1983. Following this tariff increase the cash contri-
bution should exceed 20% and, assuming that NEPA continues to achieve an 8%
rate of return, could reach close to 50% for the fiscal year 1985.
6.18      Debt service coverage is expected to be around 2.0 or better, except
for FY 1982 when it could drop to 1.7. Previous loan agreements contain a
covenant assuring that NEPA will raise loans only with the consent of the Bank
unless expected debt service coverage in any future year, including debt
service on the amount borrowed, will be 1.5 or better. This assurance was
reconfirmed during negotiations.

6.20      NEPAs estimated funds requirements for the five year period 1982
through 1986 total about N5.3 (US$9.5) billion, of which, about N4.2
(US$7.6) billion would be for investment in fixed assets (including NO.1
(US$0.2) billion identified as the Bank project), NO.4 (US$0.7) billion
would be for interest during construction, and the remaining NO.7 (US$1.2)
billion would be for the increases in working capital necessary to support the
substantial expansion of NEPA's operations.
6.21      For the same period, net internc-lly generated funds are expected to
generate about N1.9 (US$3.4) billion towards NEPA's funds requirements. The
remaining N3.4 (US$6.1) billion, apart from minor consumer capital contribu-
tions, would come from loans.
6.22      The proposed Bank loan would be US$100 million, equivalent to N55
million.  Interest would be at the standard rate with repayment over 20 years,
including 5 years of grace.



- 39 -
6.23      Loans covering almost 62% of total funds requirements are assumed to
come from the Federal Government in accordance with current practice. During
the project period, such loans are expected to total about N3.2 (US$5.9)
billion. It is assumed that these loans would carry a 5% per annum interest
rate with repayment over 25 years, including 5 years of grace. In due course,
other foreign loans, on different terms, might well be substituted for a pro-
portion of the Government loans. These other loans could conceivably include
further loans from the Bank, together with co-financing or independent com-
mercial lending. Loan 1766-UNI (Power V) provides that the Federal Govern-
ment will periodically discuss with the Bank its proposals for the financing
of NEPA's investment program. However, due to recent NEPA senior managment
changes, and the changeover to civilian government, no such discussions have
yet taken place. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained that joint
discussions would be held annually between NEPA, Federal Government and the
Bank. The first meeting would be held when the next five year capital and
revenue forecast is available.

Page 3 of 3
A simplified one-line diagram of the Igbin substation covered under
the proposed project is shown on page 1 of this Annex. The 330 kV substation
is of the coventional double-bar three-breaker arrangement, which feeds a
double 132 kV bus far through two 330/132 kV auto transformers. The 132 kV load,
consisting of the Ikorodu line, the power supply to the Igbin neighboring area
at 33 kV and to the Igbin station services at 11 kV, is fed through two 132/33/11
kV transformers. This scheme allows for adequate alternative sources of supply
for the station services and provides ample flexibility for the operation of
NEPA's interconnected system. Although the general power flow conditions of the
interconnection with the Lagos 330 kV and 132 kV systems has been determined,
NEPA should supplement the power flow analysis of the Igbin connection under
normal and contingency conditions to refine adjustments of voltage levels and
protection system design and operation.

ANNEX 5 .02

ASSUMPTIONS ADOPTED IN THE IERR CALCULATION
FOR TUE DISTRIBUTION PROJECT OF 23 CITIES
Cost Assumptions
The IERR of the proposed project has been calculated by equalizing
the costs and benefits corresponding to the incremental demand between 1986/87,
at which most of the project components will be fully Ltilized, and the
commissioning date of the project in 1983. The cost of the project has been
estimated at US$78.5 million, assuming a shadow exchange rate of US$1 -
NO.72. The annual operation and maintenance fixed cost of the proposed
project are estimated at 5% of the investment cost.
The estimated incremental demand for the period is 615 MW. It has
been assumed that to serve this demand, a generating capacity of 770 14W will
be required. Generating investment and operating cost has been estimated on
basis of information corresponding to the Igbin thermal (steam) station
presently under construction, but that would be installed in the Delta area,
and on basis of burning natural gas (associated) from the gas-oil fields.
The unit investment cost of the Igbin plant at prices of 1980 is 565 US$/KW.
Annual operation and maintenance fixed cost are estimated at 2% of investment
cost. The variable generation (fuel) cost has been calculated at the esti-
mated opportunity cost of associated gas (exporting as LNG) of 0.038 US$/m3,
a consumption rate of 0.256 m3/kWh, and transmission energy losses of 20%
An average transmission distance of 350 km between the generatinc
station and the center of gravity of the load of the 23 cities has been assumed.
The investment cost of lines under this basis is estimated in 100 US$/kW and
50 US$/kW for the associated substations. The annual operation and maintenance
fixed cost of transmission has been estimated at 4% of the investment cost.
The cost of distribution at 11 kV and low voltage, in the 23 cities,
which is not covered under the proposed project, has been estimated on basis
of the cost estimates of the feasibility study for the distribution expansion
prepared by BEI, updated to prices of 1980. The unit investment cost for this
component is 130 US$/kW of the estimated incremental demand, plus 20% for
reserve capacity. The annual operating and maintenance fixed cost are esti-
mated at 6% of the investment cost.
Benefit Assumptions
Benefits are estimated to be at least equal to the value of sales
at the present average tariff levels paid by the consumers in the 23 cities,
which is 0.0718 N/kWh.

ANNEX 6 .08
Page 1 of 2
NIGERIA - NEPA
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
General
1.        The financial projections shown in Annexes 6.01 to 6 .05 were
prepared by the Bank mission, starting from NEPA's April 1978 Ten Year
Financial Forecast, the last long range projections NEPA has prepared.
These projections have been updated by taking into account major changes
indicated by NEPA-s April 1980 Load & Capacity Forecast, such as the
anticipated delay in the commissioning of the Shiroro and Jebba hydro schemes,
and construction of additional thermal generation capacity.
Income Statements
2.        Sales of electricity are based on the latest available forecast
from NEPA, i.e. the April 1980 Load & Capacity Eorecast. The August 1979
tariff revision is assumed to have resulted in an average increase of about
60% The tariff is then assumed to remain stable through the end of FY 1981/82,
with further increases thereafter as necessary to maintain an 8% rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets in operation.
3.        Operating costs reflect the growing volume of NEPA's operations;
they also include an assumed inflation rate of 15% p.a.  Fuel costs (mainly
gas) are based on the GWh output of the gas-fired steam plants and gas-turbine
plants forecasted by NEPA, and a gas price NO.54 per 1000 cubic feet for
1980/81. Further fuel price increases of 15% p.a. are included in the projec-
tions. Depreciation charges are assumed to be 3.6% p.a. Interest costs have
been based upon the known terms of loans already contracted and upon the loan
terms referred to in paras. 6.22 and 6.23.
Funds Flow Statements
4.        After allowing for appropriate internal funds generation, based
on tariff levels referred to in paragraph 2 above, the remainder of NEPA-s
financing, with very minor exceptions, is assumed to come from loans.
Specific provision is made for the terms and conditions of the proposed
Bank loan, as explained in paragraph 6.22 of the main report.   The balance
of financing is assumed to come from Federal Government loans, on terms
and conditions explained in paragraph 6.23 of the main report. It is
understood that other loans (particularly foreign loans) might be substi-
tuted, in due course, for some of the Federal Go'ternment financing.
5.        Estimated capital expenditure is based upon NEPA's investment
program, adjusted as explained in paragraph 1.
6.        Debt charges are based upon known or expected terms and conditions
of currently contracted and expected identifiable future loans and upon the
assumptions relating to Federal Government loans already referred to.

ANNEX 6 .08
Page 2 of 2
Balance Sheets
7.        Fixed assets are shown in Annex 6.04 at historical costs.    Annual
increases in inventories reflect the growth of .NEPA's operations and price
escalation. Consumer receivables, expressed as a percentage of sales
revenue, are estimated to gradually fall from about 50% in 1979/80 to about
30% by about 1987/88. Included in other receivables are advance payments
for contracts and supplies. Increases in estimated cash and bank balances
reflect the growth of NEPA's operations.
8.        No changes are assumed in Government equity contributions. Assump-
tions regarding long term loans are explained in para. 4 above and in paras.
6.22 and 6.23 of the main report. Accounts payable represent 2.5 months cash
operating expenses, excluding salaries and wages. Contract retentions
represent about 10% of fixed assets under construction, excluding capitalized
interest. Payments to contractors are assumed to be made within one month of

9.        Annexes 6.06 and 6.07 show estimates of revalued fixed assets
figures prepared by the Bank mission, i.e., gross values, accumulated
depreciation, net fixed assets in operation, as well as revalued work-
in-progress. They are based on indices shown in Annex 6 .09. Weights are
65% for international, and 35% for local inflation. International inflation
is adjusted for changes in the Naira/US$ parity. Annual revalued deprecia-
tion amounts are derived from the revalued gross fixed assets and taken into
account for calculating the net income figures and rate of return ratLos
shown in these Annexes.
