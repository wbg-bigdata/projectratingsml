SECOND PROVINCIAL IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Indonesia
Amount:            $89 million equivalent (including capitalized front-end
fee)
Terms:             Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace,
at the standard variable rate
Project
Description:    The main objective of the project is to strengthen the
irrigation services of eight selected Other Island pro-
vinces, particularly in project preparation, implementa-
tion, and operation and maintenance capabilities.
The proposed project is the second to focus on building up
the capacity of the Provincial Irrigation Services (PRIS)
and project actions include institutional strengthening of
eight PRIS; strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture's
services for land development and water management exten-
sion; a three-year time slice of the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI's) Fourth National Five-Year Development
Plan (Repelita IV) for design and construction program in
the eight provinces for small-scale irrigation schemes,
serving 5,000 ha of design and 34,000 ha of irrigation works
at full development; a three-year time slice of the design
and construction program for medium-scale irrigation schemes
to serve 45,000 ha for design and 26,200 ha of irrigation
works at full development; and consulting services for
training. More efficient project selection and greater
involvement of farmers and local authorities in the project
cycle will lead to a greater impact from irrigation and
steadily increasing farm output and incomes. Risks
associated with the project include failure to recruit
adequate staff, delays in land development, and inadequate
operation and maintenance standards. These risks are
addressed by the project.

1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank assistance for
a second provincial irrigation development project /1 to (a) strengthen the
provincial irrigation services (PRIS) which serve eight Other Island provinces
(in Sumatera: Riau, Bengkulu, South Sumatera and West Sumatera; and in
Sulawesi: North, South, Central and Southeast); and (b) finance a three year
"time-slice" of the PRIS design and construction programs for small-scale
(kecil) and medium-scale (sedang) irrigation schemes./2 The project includes
designs for about 5,000 ha of kecil systems and construction of 34,000 ha of
kecil systems in these eight provinces; and nine sedang schemes of 45,000 ha
in the eight provinces and construction of an additional six schemes (26,200
ha) in Bengkulu, West Sumatera, and Central and South Sulawesi. The major
project objectives are (a) improve the capacity and efficiency of the eight
PRIS to handle small and medium scale irrigation, thus reducing demands on the
Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD) which will focus on
major irrigation works and multipurpose water use development; and (b) to
strengthen the Directorate of Agricultural Area Expansion (DAAD) and the cor-
responding Departments of Agriculture in the eight provinces. DAAD is
responsible for land development for irrigation and water use extension
services.
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.02      The Government's major objectives for the agricultural and rural
sector are to: (a) create productive employment to raise incomes of the rural
poor; (b) increase domestic food supply, especially rice, to keep pace with
rising demand; (c) expand agricultural exports, particularly of smallholder
tree crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's land,
water, and natural resources.
1.03      Food crop production forms 60% of agricultural GDP and 18% of total
GDP. Rice is the most important food crop. Between 1968 and 1981, rice
production grew substantially in response to government interventions,
including expansion of the irrigation network, major changes in rice growing
technology, and price incentives. Production gains of other major food crops,
while not so impressive as those for rice, have exceeded population growth,
although some crops, for example corn, are encountering market constraints.
1.04      GOI food crop production and investment policies, INPRES programs,
and the strong linkages and multiplier effects between agricultural incomes
and other rural industries, have had a substantial impact on living standards
in rural areas. These factors have also resulted in some reduction in rural
poverty, even though this remains a major problem. Increases in income have
/1   The first (East Java Province) is supported by Loan 2119-IND.
/2   Kecil schemes (previously called Sederhana schemes), have an average area



-2-
not been uniform especially for dry-land farmers. Inadequate infrastructure
also contributes to slow growth in food crop output and needs to be addressed
through further investments such as rural roads.
1.05      The Bank, in cooperation with GOI, has undertaken a series of sector
studies related to food crop production: (a) Irrigation Program Review,
October 1978, Report 2027a-IND; (b) Review of Support Services for Food Crop
Production, December 1978, Report 2060a-IND; (c) Supply Prospects for Major
Food Crops, March 1979, Report 2374-IND; and (d) Policy Options and Strategies
for Major Food Crops, April .1983, Report 3686b-IND. In June 1982, a Bank
mission reviewed the irrigation work program and budget for the next five-year
development plan (Repelita IV-GOI FY 1984/85 to FY 1988/89)./3
The Irrigation Sector
1.06      Irrigation and Rice Production.  Rice is the dominant irrigated crop
and production has shown remarkable progress over the last decade. Paddy
production has grown from 19 million tons in 1970 to about 33 million tons in
1982. This is reflected both in increased per capita rice consumption and
reduced dependence on imports. Estimated rice consumption per capita rose
from 92 kg in 1967 to 130 kg in 1981. Rice imports in 1981 and 1982 were
about 0.6 million tons, about: a quarter of 1977 and 1980 levels.  Neverthe-
less, demand is projected to grow; faster than production, and supply deficits
of the order of 1-2 million ltons are foreseen by the 19'30s unless additional
irrigation investments of somTe $300 million per year are  made in GOITs
Repelita IV.
1.07      Almost all rice production gains since 1968 have resulted from
improvements in irrigated and wetland rice farming. It is difficult to quan-
tify the contributions made by irrigation expansion and improvement, modern
varieties, and fertilizers since they are all interdependent.  Nonetheless, it
is estimated that about 16% of production increases between 1972 and 1981 are
associated solely with expansion and improvements in irrigation; about 9% to
improved rice varieties and fertillizer use while some 75% is due to joint
interaction of these factors.
1.08      Improved rice varieties and fertilizer use are lilcely to play a
lesser role in increasing Indonesia's future rice production. The use of HYVs
is already high (about 80% of the irrigated and wetland crop) and is unlikely
to expand beyond 90% in 1990. Several traditional varieties are preferred for
taste and ceremonial reasons, and are better adapted to difiEicult growing
conditions such as saline, f]ooded or water-short areas. Fertilizer use is
also high, particularly on Java where about 135 kg nitrogen and 50 kg phos-
phate per hectare are currently applied. There is evidence that nitrogen
applications above this would. be wasted and cause crop losses due to lodging
and greater insect damage.  With such already high fertilizer and HYV use,
future yield increases will cepend primarily on improving the quality of
irrigation and water management.
/3   Irrigation Sector Review:  An Issues Paper, October 1982.



1.09      Investment Needs.  To satisfy projected demand in 1990, GOI plans
sufficient 4irrigation investment in Repelita IV to provide for additional
production of about 1.2 million tons of paddy. In addition, investments are
needed to reclaim tidal swamp areas for transmigration areas; to develop
municipal water supplies and hydropower; and for flood control. Investments,
in current dollars, during Repelita IV are expected to be about $5.4 billion,
including $1.6 billion foreign exchange costs, with annual GOI budgets
(DIPs) /4 of about $750 million. GOI expects to borrow about $340 million
annually for the irrigation sector, with disbursements from both new loans and
already committed loans of about $140 million per year.
Role of the Bank
1.10      Major Objectives.  Since 1968, the Bank has provided $864 million
for irrigation in Indonesia. The early Bank supported projects were designed
to quickly increase rice output by rehabilitating and upgrading major systems,
and constructing drainage and flood protection works. The Bank's inputs then
shifted to installing tertiary networks in the major rehabilitated or upgraded
systems; establishing water user associations; and training officials and
farmers in improved irrigation practices. These efforts were accompanied by
complementary projects to expand and improve agricultural extension services,
and research programs. More recent projects include measures to strengthen
institutional capacity, especially in planning, programming, budgeting
(Irrigation XV, Cr. 995-IND); management information systems (Irrigation XVII,
Ln. 2119-IND). Such Bank support is building up the project appraisal and
evaluation capacity of DGWRD's Directorate of Planning and Programming
(DPP). DPP appraised the sedang schemes to be constructed in this project,
and will be responsible for appraising the yearly packages of kecil schemes
(para. 4.02). DPP is already responsible for appraising subprojects under the
ADB-assisted Bali Irrigation Sector Loan. Other DPP activities are project
monitoring and evaluation systems, starting in East Java (Ln. 2119-IND), and
project completion reports for Bank-assisted projects (starting with
Irrigation V, Cr. 514-IND).
1.11      Present Strategy.  The Bank has developed a close dialogue with GOI
on the Indonesian irrigation program through its support for the 17 projects
assisted so far, and its sector work program (para. 1.05). GOI and the Bank
agree on the need now to strengthen the provincial irrigation and agricultural
services so as to enhance their ability to construct, operate and maintain
irrigation systems, which is the focus of this project. Technical assistance
provided with Bank support has successfully trained many local consultants and
GOI staff, but large and complex irrigation works, especially those presenting
difficult economic choices, still require Bank assistance, especially if co-
financing packages are to be sought by GOI. During Repelita IV, Bank assist-
ance in the irrigation sector will focus on institution building; forward
planning and programming and selection of priority investments; strengthening
provincial irrigation services; and major or technically complex projects.
/4   These budgets do not include foreign borrowing.



- 4 -
1.12      Other major priorit:ies for Bank inputs into the irrigation program
will be directed towards improving farm level water use efficiency; improving
system operation and maintenance (O&M); and ensuring adequate cost recovery.
Better water use at the farm level is being approached by supporting water
user associations for tertiary networks.  Such associations assist in planning
these networks and, following construction, are responsible for operating aLnd
maintaining them. Training of oi-ficials responsible for the water users;
water user association leaders; and key farmers is under way (Irrigation XVI,
Ln. 2118-IND) and this project includes also agricultural extension service!
training and demonstrations in efficient water use, together with land
development programs.  Current standards of O&M of the main systems are
frequently inadequate, though GOT has consistently raised the level of funds
allocated for cash purposes, and has decided in FY84/85 to slow the rate of
new irrigation construction and divert development funds to improve O&M
standards.  Bank assistance in O&M is designed to improve the organization and
training of the provincial servizes which are responsible for all O&M
activities, and to develop and demonstrate new techniques (Irrigation XVII,
Ln. 2119-IND, and this project). Cost recovery through the IPEDA tax is
efficient, and links levies to the productive capacity of farm lands.  The
amount collected fully coverS the O&M costs of the main systems, and farmers
themselves pay in kind for O&M of tertiary networks. Capital cost recovery is
however normally less than 10%, though this is an equitable position con-
sistent with the poverty and small farm sizes of most beneficiaries. The same
principles are followed in this project (para. 5.23), especially since many of
the beneficiaries are recent transmigrants. Bank assistance regarding cost
recovery will seek a more direct linkage of IPEDA levies to O&M allocations,
and seek to ensure that O&M funds are spent effectively, a prerequisite for
any future increases in irrigation cost recovery levels.
1.13      Project Performance Audits.  The first five Bank-assisted irrigation
projects have been completed. Project Performance Audits have been issued by
OED for four of them,/5 and a follow-up Impact Evaluation Report on the first
project (Cr. 127-IND) was released by OED in July 1983./6
1.14      The most serious implementation problems were construction delays
and cost overruns. The delays arose because of GOI-s then cumbersome locaL
bidding, contracting and fundl release procedures, and shortages of local
funds. Cost overruns were due to additional quantities of work required after
detailed design and increased unit costs due to rapid inflation and construc-
tion delays. However, cost increases were more than offset by higher rice
prices and economic rates of return are expected to exceed 40%. Other problem
areas include the need to improve operation and maintenance services (O&M) at
provincial levels; provide technical and administrative support to water user
associations; and to promote efficient water use. These problems are
recognized in the strategy adopted for Bank assistance (paras. 1.11 and 1.12).

1.15      The impact evaluation on the first irrigation project (Credit 127-
IND), prepared five years after the Project Performance Audit, confirms that
in terms of its specified goals the project continued to be a success. Total
production of paddy had by 1982 already exceeded the target set for full
development in 1985. Real per capita incomes of farm families, already above
the projected target in 1975/76, continue to increase. The skills of project
staff have been upgraded significantly. Water user associations however have
had limited success, especially where dry season water is in short supply.
Employment and income distribution would be favoredin suitable areas by
promoting additional dry season secondary crops.
1.16      Disbursement Performance. Disbursement of Bank irrigation loans
currently runs at about 61% of appraisal estimates. Performance has improved
(disbursements were below 50% in FY80) through more intensive supervision by
Bank staff; accelerating start-up activities and using statements of expendi-
tures for small civil works contracts. In addition, short lists and proposed
direct invitations for consulting services are agreed with the Bank prior to
loan negotiations, and those for civil works for the first year's construction
are usually tendered and contracts negotiated prior to loan effectiveness.
This, together with otner continuing Bank assistance to accelerate contracting
procedures and improve the domestic construction industry, should further
reduce implementation delays.



2. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Focus
2.01      The three most pressinlg weaknesses of irrigation development in
Indonesia are probably:
(a)  overly-centralized water resource organization and management, due
mainly to the inadequate number and technical capacity of provincial
irrigation service (PRIS) staff;
(b)  inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M); and
(c) poor end-use impact o[ irrigation facilities.
2.02      These three weaknesses require major strengthening of the institu-
tions responsible for the irrigation program, especially at the provincial and
kabupaten level, and better coordination among them.  GOI is attempting to
delegate responsibilities to the PRIS for all except major irrigation works
since (a) it is more efficient and cost effective to implement smaller schemes
through the PRIS, (b) there will be continuity between construction and O&M,
and (c) the greater involvement of local governments and farm communities
should result in more efficient use and better maintenance.
Selection of Provinces
2.03      Eight provinces /7 have been selected by GOI, assisted by Bank
staff, for strengthening of irrigation activities, based on (a) their
irrigation potential and pr,ssent irrigation activity (Table 2.1); (b) regional
development potential through transmigration; and (c) government priority for
provincial irrigation development. The irrigated area in the eight provinces
represents 45% of all irrigation in the Other Islands (17% of the irrigated
area in Indonesia). The potential for future irrigation so far identified in
these provinces forms 39% of all new irrigation areas identified for develop-
ment in Indonesia during Repelita IV, and 48% of the area to be constructed in
the Other Islands (Table 2.1).

The Selected Provinces
2.04      In most of the selected provinces, irrigation development started
fairly recently, and generally until the 1940s there were only small and
simple village constructed systems of up to 200 ha each. The 1963
Agricultural Census records that in three of the provinces (Bengkulu,
Southeast Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi) there was no irrigation but, as shown
in Table 2.2, there has been a 205% increase in the selected provinces since
then.

2,05       Most irrigation development was encouraged by the transmigration
program which brought Javanese and Balinese rice farmers tc, the Other
Islands.  Over time, many sites have been upgraded to semi-technical kecil and
technical sedang schemes./8 Over 85% of the irrigation systems in these
provinces today are sedang, kecil or village systems as opposed to large-scale
systems constructed by DGWRD (Table 2.3).

The Kecil Program
2.06       Kecil schemes are sma:Ll, simple, low cost irrigation projects.  They
cover generally less than 1.,000 ha (averaging about 400 ha per scheme) with a
total cost of about $1.500 per hectare. The systems were originally
nontechnical schemes designed to last approximately 5-10 years, with simple
diversion structures used and canals lined only where absolutely necessary.
They are now constructed to be more permanent and productive. Most kecil
areas consist of land formrerly irrigated by village systems (pengairan
/8   Technical systems have a water supply system separate from the drainage
system and the volume of incoming water can be measured at several
delivery points. Semi-technical systems have fewer permanent structures,
have only one water measuring device (usually at the major intake) and
the supply and drainagie systems are not always separate.

2.07      A total of 47 kecil schemes covering about 22,000 ha have been
completed each year in the selected provinces (Table 2.5). The kecil program
has had a significant impact on rice production. The harvested area in many
former rainfed areas increased by up to 50%, and yields increased by 2-3 tons
per ha. The net impact of the kecil program over the last eight years,
including the use of high-yielding varieties and fertilizer, is estimated to
have increased paddy production by about 1 million tons and improved the lives
of about 800,000 farm family members in 24 provinces.

2.08      GOI's national kecil program began in 1974 when 164 schemes were
constructed in 24 provinces to irrigate about 37,000 ha. Another 980 schemes



- 10 -
have been completed since then, tc irrigate about 400,000 ha.  USAID has
supported the kecil program since 1975 through two loans,/9  Experience has
been generally good, and GOI now has the capability to select, prepare and
construct about 100 new schemes a year to satisfactory standards. Selection
criteria and technical specifications of a typical kecil scheme are shown in
Annex 3. End user performance has been mixed however, as; in some Bank assis-
ted irrigation schemes.  Slow land, development, lower than expected yields and
cropping intensities, and inadequate system management and maintenance
sometimes occur. USAID program ncw gives more attention to the continued usie
and functioning of kecil schemes than to their construction. A USAID-
supported program (HPSIS) is testing the closer involvement of farmers in
system development and management, the role of community organizers, and the
coordination of Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Home Affairs, and
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) services for water user associations.
Evalution of the HPSIS program (in late 1985), together with Bank experience
in water user training, community organizers, and coordinatirng the three
Ministries under Loan 2118-IND should be useful for improving the impact of
future irrigation programs.
The Sedang Program
2.09      Sedang schemes are fully technical schemes ranging from 1,000 ha to
10,000 ha with an average of 3,50C ha. Like the kecil program, sedang schemes
were started at the beginning of Repelita II (1974/75) mostly in rainfed sawah
areas of Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi. Most of the schemes in the Other
Islands were identified in existing transmigration sites where rainfed rice
and secondary (palawija) crops are cultivated.
2.10      Since 1972 GOI has implemented about 138 new schemes covering about
126,000 ha (Table 2.6). Planning, design and investigation generally take two
to three years. Construction requires another three to four years resulting
in an implementation period of five to seven years. The technical parameter.s
of typical sedang schemes are shovrn in Annex 3. Unlike kecil schemes, the
larger sedang schemes have more water control structures and measuring
devices. The drainage system is a,lso more intensive at main and tertiary
levels.  Access roads for O&M are also constructed for all main and secondary
canals and on-farm access roads are built. The investment cost of sedang
schemes varies from $3,500 to $4,500/ha. Costs are higher than kecil schemes
because of: (a) greater intensity of control structures; (b) more forest
clearing and land development; (c) road infrastructure; and (d) more remote
location of sites.

The Irrigation Services in the Selected Provinces
2.11      Organization.  Each PRIS headquarters is organized into five
subservices for: (a) planning and design; (b) irrigation construction; (c)
river and inland swamp construction; (d) equipment; and (e) O&M. In addition,
there is a secretariat for monitoring, personnel, legal, finance, and adminis-
tration. The planning and design subservice is responsible for: (i) prequal-
ifying design consultants for the province; (ii) evaluating proposals of
consultants; (iii) preparing design and survey contracts; (iv) supervising the
design and verifying surveys; and (v) approving payments to consultants. The
irrigation construction subservice is responsible for: (i) prequalifying
contractors; (ii) preparing and calling tenders; (iii) preparing contracts;
(iv) making site inspection visits and preparing changes in design; (v)
authorizing payment to contractors; and (vi) certifying completed works. The
O&M subservice is involved in preparing the O&M budget and in ensuring proper
operation and maintenance in the provinces.
2.12      The present staffing of each of the subservices in the eight
provinces and planned staff requirements are shown in Annex 7. Each PRIS is
supported by offices at the seksi level (a seksi covers between 20,000 and
60,000 ha). When the irrigation area of a province is large enough, a
wilayah office coordinates and supervises the work of several seksis./10 The
seksi office plays a key role in planning, executing and monitoring day-to-day
operation and maintenance activities. It is supported by subsection
/10 A wilayah normally oversees about 100,000 ha of irrigation.

(pegaatan) offices each with ditch tenders or jurus covering 700-1,000 ha.
They are the most junior members of PRIS field staff and are responsible for
making direct contact with village water officials (ulu-ulu, jogotirto, raja
bondar, etc.) concerning water distribution matters. This organizational
structure is illustrated in Chart 25075. Staff needs at present are greatest
at the technician level (STM) and the diploma level engin.eer (BIE).
2.13      The seksi offices are divided into subsections for operations,
maintenance, and tertiary construction; some also have a design office. They
are headed by a BIE level engineer, all other staff being technicians. Seksi
operations are almost entirely focussed on O&M, monitoring, and some
construction supervision for tertiaries.  The operations section of each seksi
is responsible for directing and controlling the subseksi. offices which are
headed by an irrigation inspector (pengamat). He directs abciut 5-8 overseers
who control the gate operators. The maintenance section of the subseksi is
responsible for maintenance, inspection, and monitoring, directing laborers
for maintenance (grass cutting, minor canal repairs, etc.) and supervising
contractors on desilting and structural repair work.
2.14      The major weakness in O&M is the result of insuffic:ient staff at
seksi and subseksi levels.  Staff limitations have often resulted irn portions
of the main irrigation system bein,g unattended during operation. Maintenance
is also neglected.  Poor O&M of the main system has often been attributed to
budgetary constraints. In the selected provinces however, budgets for O&M
have been increased at the rate of 19% per year. O&M bucigets only show
shortfalls in two provinces, South Sulawesi and West Sumatera (Table 2.7).

2,15      Funding of PRIS Irrigation Activities.  Expenditure on irrigation
activities between 1979/80 and 1981/82, summarized in Annex 7, Table 4,



- 13 -
amounted to Rp 124 billion ($191 million). Eighty percent of these funds
originated from the national budget (APBN) and 20% from the provincial govern-
ment. The O&M and routine expenditure was only 12% of the total budget,
development expenditure accounting for the remaining 88%. Almost two thirds
(65%) of the expenditure was for kecil, sedang and tertiary programs. Another
22% was for inland swamp reclamation (8%); rehabilitation (7%); river improve-
ment works (4%); other minor expenditures (2%); and village irrigation (1%).
Provincial staff salaries are excluded, but project overheads and incentive
payments for staff are included in each expenditure category.
2.16       PRIS Implementation Capacity.  The expected completion of irrigation
and swamp reclamation areas in Repelita III for the eight provinces is shown
in Table 2.8 and Annex 7, Table 5. Of the 96,800 ha of new irrigation works
that will be completed by 1983/84, 89,300 ha are sedang and kecil schemes.
Over the five year period, the average provincial implementation capacity for
these schemes has averaged about 11,000 ha per province (2,200 ha/year).
However, there is wide variation among the provinces, from 17,700 ha for West
Sumatera to 4,700 ha in Riau, mainly due to staff limitations and, in some
areas, contractor capacity.

2.17       To evaluate contractor capacity an examination of the type of
contracts indicates that there are more registered contractors for each level
than contracts tendered each year per province (Annex 7, Tables 6 and 7). For
example, the average number of contracts tendered per province in 1982/83 was
36, of which 9 were over Rp 100 million ($140,000) which accounted for about
78% of total contracted values. There are 43 contractors registered and



- 14 -
prequalified for the larger contracts, and over 200 contractors registered for
smaller jobs, which far exceeds the number of contracts tendered. Although
the number of contractors seems to be sufficient, contractor capacity is
sometimes inadequate, and requires stricter prequalification measures and
close supervision during construction.
2.18      PRIS Budgets.  Generally there is very little carryover of budgets
(SIAPs) from year to year. SIAPs for 1980/81 and 1981/82 for the kecil,
sedang and tertiary programs (Table 2.9) indicate that nmost budgets are
utilized within the fiscal year, or at most carried over to the first few
months of the next year.

3. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The main objective of i:he project is to strengthen the irrigation
services of eight selected Outer Island provinces, particularly in project
preparation, implementation, and operation and maintenance capabilities. By
the end of Repelita IV, PRIS staff will perform their own design work for
kecil schemes, and be able to properly supervise local consultants who will
continue to design the more complex sedang schemes. A second objective is to



- 15 -
assist in financing a three-year time slice of the PRIS construction programs
for kecil and sedang irrigation schemes in the eight provinces. To accomplish
these objectives, the project will:
(a) increase the provincial irrigation engineering and technical staff;
(b) train provincial staff to required professional standards;
(c) apply established DGWRD standards and procedures to ensure uniform
quality control during project implementation, operation and
maintenance;
(d) provide better DGWRD technical support to assist the provincial
irrigation services; and
(e) strengthen DAAD's land development and extension services.
Project Description
3.02      The project has five components:
(a) institutional strengthening of eight PRIS, by increasing staff
numbers; training; and the provision of facilities, equipment and
vehicles. Four of the provinces are in Sulawesi (North, South,
Southeast and Central Sulawesi) and four in Sumatera (Bengkulu,
Riau, West Sumatera and South Sumatera). Support would also be
provided for the Directorate of Irrigation-s (DOI-s) Subdirectorate
of Medium- and Small-Scale Irrigation Construction (Binlak II) which
will assist the PRIS;
(b) strengthening of the Directorate of Agricultural Area Development
(DAAD) within the Director General of Food Crops Agriculture (DGFCA)
and its provincial offices for land development (Diperta) and
organizing and training farmers in new irrigation systems through
training; provision of facilities, equipment and vehicles and
conducting site specific trials and demonstrations;
(c) a three-year time slice of GOI's Repelita IV design and construction
program of kecil schemes which will serve about 5,000 ha for design
and 34,000 ha for irrigation construction in the eight provinces;
(d)  a three-year time slice of GOIs Repelita IV design and construction
program of sedang projects which when completed will serve about
45,000 ha of designs in all the project provinces and will expect to
serve about 26,200 ha of irrigation in four provinces Bengkulu, West
Sumatera, Central and South Sulawesi.
(e) consulting services for training PRIS, DAAD and Diperta staff.

Institutional Strengthening of Eight PRIS and the DOI Binlak IT
3.03       Staff Numbers.  Each PRIS has subservices for planning and design;
irrigation construction; river and swamp construction; O&M; and logistics (see
para. 2.11). Table 3.1 details the PRIS staff increases to be implemented
between 1983/84 and 1987/88. An additional 67 Irs and 106 BIEs (engineers)
and 279 extra technicians wilL be employed by the eight PRIS. Strengthening
of Binlak II, to support the PRIS and supervise project implementation, will.
require the staffing increases shown in Table 3.2. Further details are given
in Annex 6./11 GOI will place the numbers of staff, as established in Tables
3.1 and 3.2 by May 1 of each year. An additional 10 Ir (civil engineers); 16
BIE (diploma holders);and 40 STM (technicians) for the various provinces have
already been appointed for the 1933/84 requirements.

3.04      The main sources of professional staff for PRIES and Binlak II will
be from scholarship students bonded to DGWRD, private sector recruitment and
DGWRD staff released from special projects which are being completed. There
should be little difficulty in obtaining additional staff, since the number
available considerably exceeds requirements for the project (Table 3.3).
Existing arrangements for DGWRD scholarships appear adequate and do not need
Bank support.

3.05      Staff Training.  PRIS professional and technical staff will take
part in (a) formal training in the MPW Regional Training Centers (Diklats);/12
(b) special training courses in the PRIS, conducted by consultants; and (c)
on-the-job training by consultants attached to the PRIS.
3.06      Formal training for technicians will be conducted in the Diklats
whose facilities and training courses are being strengthened through Loan
2258-IND (Report No. 4173-IND, March 1983). These training facilities should
be adequate and the project provides only participants' per diems. Technical
training will focus on (a) surveying and mapping, (b) drafting and costing,
(c) construction supervision and (d) operation and maintenance. Courses will
be of three and a half months duration. Eighteen technicians per province
will be trained annually, and over the three-year project: period, some 432
technicians (57% of the technical staff) will participate.
3.07      Special training for prafessional staff will be provided partly by
the Diklats, and the balance by PRIS consultants.  For Diklat courses, which
/12 Wilayah Diklats at Yogyakarta and Surabaya; and at t:he Bidang Diklat at
Jakarta (Center for Construction Guidance and System Control (CGSC)).



- 19 -
are general in nature (see Table 3.4), participant per diems and travel costs
will be provided by the project. In addition, courses covering planning and
implementation of kecil and sedang programs,         will be conducted by
expatriate consultants assisted by local consultants, and counterpart DGWRD
and DGFCA staff. These courses will be attended by Provincial Public Works,
Provincial Agricultural Services, and Central DGWRD and DGFCA staff. Short-
term specialist consultants will provide support to the training program by
preparing and conducting training courses in specialized areas. Staff from
DPMA, universities, and other Government agencies will also participate.
Forty-eight professional staff will be trained each year in the Diklats; a
total of 144 over the three year period. In addition 410 professionals will
receive training from consultants over the same period. Table 3.4 lists the
formal training to be provided under the project. Materials and guidelines
which were developed by DGWRD and consultants to the two USAID assisted kecil
projects (para. 3.16) will be used for training and implementation (Annex
3). These materials require only minor reorganization or expansion to cover
the sedang program.
3.08      On-the-job training will be provided at PRIS and Binlak II offices,
and at DAAD and Diperta, for all phases of the kecil and sedang programs,
in: project management, planning and budgeting; project identification and
evaluation; project selection for survey and design; survey and design by PRIS
staff; survey and design contract administration; project selection for
construction; tender and contract procedures for construction; operation and
maintenance; and monitoring and evaluation of projects during and after
construction.
3.09      Facilities, Equipment and Vehicles.  Provinces which do not have a
design unit (Riau, South Sumatera, North Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and
Central Sulawesi) will be provided with 300 sq m buildings. These buildings
will be used for additional office space; drawing rooms; lecture rooms;
duplicating rooms; and storage and will be furnished, including drafting and
office equipment. Each of the eight PRIS will be provided with additional
survey, soil testing, hydrologic testing and water quality testing equipment

and farmers. Selection of the pilot areas sites will be made in consultation
with the project manager of the National Agricultural Extension Program to
ensure close association with Rural Extension Center (REC) facilities and
activities. Each area will require the following buildings and equipment (as
detailed in Annex 1, Table 17) to complement REC facilities: (a) an office
building and equipment, staff and consultant housing, storage facilities and
furniture; (b) agricultural machinery and equipment including soil and water
testing instruments, weather monitoring instruments, equipment for water
metering and control, hand tractors, sprayers, threshers, rotary weeders and a
generator; (c) vehicles (jeeps and motorcycles) for each pilot farm; (d)
training of 840 PPLs, PPMs and PPSs to be conducted by senior GOI staff and
consultants (see Annex 1, Table 14). The PPLs, PPMs and PPS will train water
user group leaders and key farmers.
Kecil Irrigation Design and Construction
3.12      A three-year time slice of design of 10 kecil schemes covering 5,000
ha and the construction of about 80 new kecil irrigation schemes in the eight
provinces will be included in the project, which would expect to irrigate
about 34,000 ha at full development. The estimated area and number of
projects which will be evaluated and selected by each PRIS annually, is given
in Table 3.5. Selection standards and technical criteria (Annex 3), and other
procedures (para. 4.06) have been agreed with GOI during negotiations (para.
6.01(b).

provinces (West Sumatera, Bengkulu, South Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi)
serving a total area of about 26,200 ha (see Table 3.6). I'he six schemes for
construction have been appraised. by DPP with the assistance of consultants
(Binnie and Partners)/13 and have been reviewed by the Bank. All have a
minimum ERR of 12%, no social problems, and a maximum of 5% of land presently
under permanent crops. The Mentawa scheme is typical, and is analyzed in
Chapter 5.

Water Supplies and Demand
3.14      Estimated water requirements are based on rainfall, evapotranspira-
tion and soil type. Average annual rainfall over most of the eight provinces
is 2,300 mm to 2,700 mm, though in drought years (one in five-year lows)
rainfall is estimated at 1,900 mm to 2,100 mm. Evapotranspiration, estimated
using the Penman method, is 1,300 mm to 1,400 mm. Deep percolation after
puddling is between 1 mm and 3 mm/day for most of the soils where rice is
grown. Based on these parameters and using standard crop coefficients,
maximum water duties for canal design range between 1.3 1/s to 1.6 l/s per
hectare. Water supply calculations are based on actual river flows. All
available sources of rainfall data and runoff are used to estimate the one in
five-year low wet and dry season flows. Because actual flow data and rainfall
records may be sometimes inadequate, they are checked against standard flow
estimates for each sub-region prepared by the DGWRD Institute of Hydrology
(DPMA). Regional flow estimates of catchment yields are usually 30 1/s per sq
km for the wet season and 10 1/s for the dry season. Special attention is
paid to assessing firm water supplies and scheme requirements by DPP and DPMA
hydrologists before PRIS proceeds with detailed design. Schemes are designed
so that available water provides, as a minimum, irrigation for a wet season
rice crop over the whole service area.
Consulting Services
3.15      Expatriate consultants will be recruited by DOI to serve both DOI
and PRISs. For DOI, expatriate consultants will provide 11 long-term advisors
and six short-term specialists (250 man-months). Each PRIS will have one



- 24 -
expatriate and one local consu:Ltant resident over a 20-month period. There
will be two expatriates and one local consultant in Binlak II based in
Jakarta. For DAAD, there will be two expatriate consultants providing 16 man-
months for SDAE, and 16 man-months for SDWM.  They will supervise eight local
consultants (12 man-months each, one in each province) for SDAE and four local
consultants (24 man-months each) for SDWM.
3.16      Award and completion of all GOI procurement controls of contracts
for the foreign and local consultant services will be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para. 6.02). For continuity, expediency, and economy, GOI
intends to employ the same consultants who trained DOI and DAAD staff between
1976 to 1983 under the USAID Sederhana I and II loans. These consultants
developed standards and training material for kecil irrigation and for land
development. However, the consultants were based in Jakarta and paid
intermittent visits to PRIS, with limited impact on staff training and devel--
opment. It has been decided therefore to emphasize the training function with
one consultant in each province under this project. Consultant inputs are
summarized in Table 3.7.
Status of Project Preparation
3.17      Strengthening of eight PRIS and DAAD.  Terms of reference and
invitation documents for foreign and local consultants for training were
reviewed with the Bank at loan negotiations, and contracts will be awarded
prior to April 1984. All equipment lists and vehicles to be procured have
been agreed, and award of contracts (which will be procured locally) will be
finalized by April 1984.
3.18       Kecil Construction.  For 1984/85 construction scheimes have been
selected and designed according to procedures agreed with the Bank. Designs
are complete, and contracts for the first year's construction will be awarded
in April 1984. For subsequent years (1985/86 and 1986/87) scheme selection
and evaluation will be completed by September 1 of the previous GOI fiscal
year. Tendering for construction will be completed prior to the start of the
new GOI fiscal year, so that contract awards are made by April each year. For
new projects not yet designed, selection will be completed by July 1 and award
of consultant contract for design will be by August 1.
3.19      Sedang Construction.  The DPP prepared appraisal reports in March
1983 for the six selected schemes. These have been reviewed by the Bank. All
design work for the six schemes has been completed. Tendering and preparation
of contract documents will be completed by March 1984, and contracts will be
awarded in April 1984. Similar procedures will be followed for subsequent
years.

3.20      Implementation Schedules.  The kecil implementation targets are
modest in terms of what has been achieved elsewhere in Indonesia. The target
for sedang schemes is slightly higher (20%) than past performance, since
designs are completed. The implementation program for the project is
presented in Chart 25231.
Cost Estimates
3.21      Total project costs /14 attached are estimated at $150.4 million
(including $2.0 million of taxes and $0.2 million for the front-end fee) of
which $51.2 million (34%) will be foreign exchange (Table 3.8 and Annex 1).
All project costs are expressed in mid-1983 prices. For kecil construction, a
three-year time slice of projected expenditures between FY1984/85 to 1986/87
is included. The unit rates for kecil schemes are based on similar civil
works in each province between 1980 and 1982. Unit rates of sedang schemes
are based on ongoing contracts for similar work in the provinces concerned.
Estimated man-month cost (including salary, costs, fees, international travel
and subsistence) of local and foreign consultants are $2,500 and $12,000
respectively and are based on recent contracts (Annex 1). A 10% allowance has
been included for physical contingencies. Expected price increases of 28%
have been calculated on projected local cost inflation of 20% for 1983, 15% in
/14 "Total project costs" refers to expenditures incurred in the first three
years of works which will take five years to complete. 71% of overall
costs will be incurred during the three year time slice (Annex 1,

Financing
3.22      The proposed Bank loan of $89 million will finance about 60% of
total project costs including the front-end fee./15 The Bank loan will
finance the foreign exchange costs ($50.7 million) of the project excluding
reserve procurement of vehicles ($0.5 million) and $38.3 million of local
costs. GOI will finance the balance of project costs of $61.4 million
(Table 3.9), together with another $61.6 million to complete the program
beyond the 3 year time slice financed by the Bank.

Procurement /16
3.23      Civil Works.  Procurement is summarized in Table 3,10.  Civil works
for irrigation ($102.2 million) will be widely dispersed, small in scale, and
will require close interaction with villagers, both as beneficiaries and as
laborers. At least 65% of the civil works contracts will fall in the range of
$0.2 million to $1.5 million. Because of their size, dispersion, and nature
of construction, they are unlikely to be attractive to foreign contractors.
Accordingly, all will be tendered by the PRIS on the basis of GOI's local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank.

Review of Procurement
3.25       Civil Works.  For civil works the Directorate of Irrigation
(Binlak II) and the Procurement Control Unit (DGWRD) will review awards pro-
posed by the PRIS and authorize all contracts over $0.2 million. In addition
SEKNEG /17 approval will be obtained for contracts over $0.5 million.
Contracts below $0.2 million will be authorized by the PRIS concerned. The
Bank will review prior to tendering and award about twenty contracts ($36 mil-
lion), each over $1.5 million, covering an aggregate of about 30% of the value
of civil works. Another 130 contracts, totalling about $6b million and
ranging from $0.2 million to $1.5 million in size, will be reviewed on a post
award sample basis. Contracts smaller than $0.2 millicn (total of $6.2 mil-
lion) will not be reviewed by the Bank. and will be financed fully through the
GOI budget (Table 3.10).
3.26       All consultant invitation documents, proposed awards, and contracts
will be reviewed by the Bank.
3.27       Equipment procurement will not be reviewed by the; Bank because of
its simple nature and small value.
Disbursements
3.28       Loan funds will be disbursed against.
(a)  75% of the cost of civil works contracts of value $0.2 million or
above for kecil and sedang construction;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment, 95% of
local expenditures (ex-factory prices) for locally manufactured
equipment and 65% of locally procured equipment;
(c) 100% of consultant services costs; and
(d) 100% of costs of trairing, and related materials, and buildings.
3.29       The allocation of loan proceeds is summarized in Annex 1, Table 2.
Quarterly statements of expenditure (SOE) will be used (Annex 5) to disburse
against (a) progress payments tc, civil works contractors w'ith contract docu-
ments held by DOI for inspection by the Bank, and (b) training costs. SOE
procedures have been used extensively for Bank supported irrigation projects
in Indonesia with favorable results.  Disbursements for equipment and services
will be against contract documerLtation.
/17 SEKNEG: The State Cabinet Secretariat is required by Presidential Decree
(Kepres 14A of 1980) to review and authorize all contract awards above RP
500 million ($532,000).

3.30      Disbursement of about 80% of the loan amount is geared to the draw-
ing down of expenditures from GOI's FY84/85 to 86/87 annual budgets for kecil
and sedang construction, which are procured each year mostly through 12-month
contracts. Accordingly the disbuirsement profile follows GOI experience with
annual budget performance and current carryover (SIAP) ratios (para. 2.18). A
nine-month delay between contract: payments and loan disbursements has been
included; thus disbursements should be completed over 45 months (Annex 1,
Table 3).
Accounts and Audits
3.31       Detailed accounts and records are kept by DGWRD and the PRIS for
each budget item for each budget year, and carryovers (SIAP) are permitted for
two years. Because SIAPs are permitted, cash books and accounts are not
closed until the budget for t:he line item has been fully spent. All accounts
are subject to two audits: (a) by the Inspector General of MPW and (b) by the
Director General of State Financial Control (DJPKN). The State Auditor-s
short-form reports analyze income and costs, and check that the costs have
been properly incurred. Consultant accounting advisors are being engaged
under the Irrigation XVI Project (Ln. 2119-IND) to review the accounting
systems of the provinces. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations irn
respect of maintaining adequate accounts, retention of all contracts, orders,
receipts, etc. for all SOE disbursements for one year after closing of loan,
independent auditing by DJPKN, and timely submission to the Bank of financial
information for each PRIS (para. 6.01(f)).
Environmental Protection
3.32      Conversion of easily eroded grassland and dryland farming areas to
irrigated sawah provides greater ecological stability since (a) erosion is
much reduced and (b) farmers" incomes from rice are raised sufficiently to
deter their continual march into catchments for slash and burn cropping.
Nevertheless, encroachment by shifting cultivators will be difficult to con-
tain in the long term without prDtective measures. Measures must be designed
for each specific scheme since catchment condition varies widely, and may
require adjustment of existing and planned nature reserves or protection of
forestry boundaries. Priority will be given to sedang schemes to be con-
structed under the project, since kecil schemes are small. The Ministry of
Forestry (MOF) assisted by PRIS will review the need for catchment protection
measures for each sedang scheme and prepare and implement suitable control
measures (including demarcation, facilities, forest guards, vehicles and
equipment, reforestation and if necessary resettlement). An assurance to t:his
effect has been obtained from GOI during negotiations [para. 6.01(e)].
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      DGWRD through the Directorate of Irrigation (DOI) will be
responsible for overall project coordination, assisted by the Directorate of
Planning and Programming (DPP) in the evaluation and appraisal of proposed
kecil and sedang schemes (see Chart 25082). Each PRIS will be responsible for



- 31 -
implementation of all work in their respective provinces. DGFCA through DAAD
and Diperta will execute the land clearing, sawah formation, and farmer
advisory components. DOT and DAAD will be the funding channel to the PRIS for
loan an government funds, in keeping with GOI's requirement that only central
government entities administer external assistance. MOF will prepare and
implement catchment protection measures for each sedang scheme. Agreement to
this effect was reached during negotiations (para. 6.01 (a)).
Kecil and Sedang Construction Programs
4.02      Kecil schemes are usually identified through consultations between
farmers and local government officials. Afterwards, the PRIS completes a
standard data form which gives salient features such as available water
resources and present land use. On the basis of this data, DOITs Binlak II
jointly with DPP assesses the likely technical, economic and social viability
of the schemes. This initial screening is followed by a site visit by Binlak
II and DPP staff and confirmation of data. If appropriate, DOT makes the
decision to proceed to detailed survey and design. Sedang projects are
identified in much the same way, but more frequently come from PRIS initia-
tives. The DPP with SDPD prepare an appraisal report for each sedang scheme
before the project proceeds to detailed design. The PRIS is responsible for
contracting and supervising local consultants for both kecil and sedang survey
and design work. As PRIS capabilities improve (para. 3.01), the share of
kecil design work contracted to consultants will diminish, and will be phased
out by about 1988. Sedang design will continue to be done by consultants
supervised by PRIS, and reviewed by DOI's Design Subdirectorate in Bandung.
4.03      Once design is completed, PRIS prepares quantity and cost estimates
and incorporates the schemes in their annual budget proposal. Budgets are
first reviewed by DOI. DPP is responsible for (a) consolidating all irriga-
tion budget proposals into a DGWRD budget request including assigning priori-
ties among programs, (b) negotiating the annual budget with GOT,and (c)
preparing approved budgets, within which DOI may adjust kecil and sedang
priorities and work schedules if necessary.
4.04      On the basis of authorized budgets, construction is contracted by
PRIS, which supervises work on a day-to-day basis. PRIS staff report monthly
on progress/18 and expenditures to Binlak II, whose staff visit each site at
least every quarter (or whenever problems arise) to independently review
progress and ensure quality control. The Director of Irrigation receives a
quarterly supervision report from Binlak II covering the kecil and sedang
programs. Following construction, final payments and release of bonds to
contractors by PRIS are contingent on Binlak TT-s certification of
construction.
4.05      These procedures, set out in Charts 25072 and 25073, have been
followed under the USAID supported loans (para. 2.08), found satisfactory, and
will be followed under the project. DPP-s sedang project appraisal reports
were reviewed in the field by Bank staff and found to be satisfactory also.

- 32 -
4.06      The procedures involve not only adherence to technical and economic
specifications to be agreed with the Bank (Annex 3), but to agreements to be
obtained from farmers at various stages of the project cycle, including: (a)
their commitment to irrigation and their willingness to participate in the
pencatakan sawah, which will be obtained at the identificatilon stage; (b)
location of tertiary canals and structures and the commitment to form water
user associations (P3A) within the tertiary block, which will be obtained at
the design stage; and (c) prior to completion of construction, certification
of the water user association, fees to be collected, and membership. An
assurance to this effect has been obtained from GOT at negotiations covering
these features (para. 6.01(d).
National Level organization anad Management
4.07      A project office wi:Ll be set up in DOI's Binlak II (see Chart
25080), to implement institutLonal strengthening and monitor irrigation
construction. The project manager will be the chief of Binlak II. The
project office will be established within the existing Binlak II, Sections IV
(for Sumatera) and VI (for Sulawesi) and Unit VII for foreign aid admin-
istration and training which are headed by engineers (Sections IV and VI) and
an administrator (Unit VII).
4.08      Binlak II will coordinate the kecil and sedang programs with the
Subdirectorate of Planning and Design (SDPD), DPP and PRIS for project
identification; selection for survey and design; selection for construction;
evaluation, monitoring and certification. Sections IV and VI will undertake
field supervision of kecil and of sedang schemes at various stages of
construction and will prepare a quarterly supervision report for Sulawesi (by
Section VI) and for Sumatera (by Section IV). The forma.l arnd on-the-job
training to be performed by consultants will be the responsibility of the
Chief of Binlak II, coordinated by Unit VII.  SDPD and BinlaLk II will review
all training material and evaluate the impact of the trainirng program
annually, and mutually determine with the Bank changes to be incorporated so
that training objectives are met.
4.09      Unit VII will be responsible for:  (a) ensuring the staff build-up
in the eight provinces; (b) coordinating the training oi PRI:S technicians; (c)
coordinating formal training with. SDPD, DPP, PRIS; and consultants within
PRIS; (d) collating civil works procurement documentation from the PRIS and
SPDP, obtaining necessary GOI approvals, and preparing withdrawal applications
and forwarding them to the Bank's Resident Office.  Agreement has been reached
during negotiations that DGWRD will prepare a quarterly progress report for
the Bank with Sections IV and. VI on the status of staff development and
training; and the selection, design and construction progress of kecil and
sedang projects and submit such reports to the Bank (para. 6.01 (c).
4.10      Binlak II has had Extensive experience in administering two USAID
loans (Sederhana I and II). Binlak II's performance has been generally
satisfactory, but staff will neecL to familiarize themselves with Bank
procurement and disbursement procedures.



- 33 -
Provincial Level Organization and Management
4.11      Each PRIS will establish its own project office to execute the
project. The PRIS project office will consist of the three subservice offices
of planning and design, irrigation, and construction and O&M, headed by the
chief of the PRIS who will nominate his deputy chief for managing the day to
day operation of the project (see Chart 25076). Each PRIS project office will
prepare standardized project monitoring reports /19 on a monthly basis for
kecil and sedang project implementation, and on a quarterly basis for staff
build up and training.
Land Development and Institutional Strengthening of DAAD
4.12      National Level.  These components will be coordinated at the
national level by DAADs two subdirectorates: Area Expansion (SDAE) and Water
Management (SDWM) (see Chart 25230). The SDAE will be responsible for: (a)
coordinating the planning, designing and budgeting for the pencatakan sawah
program; appointing consultants; and coordination with Binlak II; (b)
appointing local consultants for training; (c) coordinating and procuring
equipment and vehicles for UPP and Diperta; (d) coordinating the training of
Diperta staff; (e) monitoring land development activities in the eight
provinces and (f) preparing quarterly supervision reports. The SDWM will be
responsible for: (a) developing standard specifications for pilot farms and
monitoring construction on these farms; (b) coordinating procurement of
equipment and vehicles; (c) recruiting local consultants for training; (d)
standardizing the training material to be used by the Diperta staff for
training PPLs; (e) supervising training activities and water management
extension; and (f) preparing quarterly supervision reports on water management
training.
4.13      Provincial Level.  Within each Diperta, a subservice (subdinas) is
responsible for extension and for land development. The subdinas for land
development will supervise the field sectional offices (UPPs) (see Chart
25079). The subdinas for extension will be responsible for supervising the
pilot farm water management program. Both subdinas will be responsible for
the on-the-job training using local consultants.
Coordination of Irrigation and Land Development Activities
4.14      To reduce delays, DOI, DAAD, and Agraria /20 have agreed to the
following: (a) topographic maps of 1:2000 scale will be submitted by each PRIS
to the corresponding Diperta as soon as surveys are completed; (b) each
Diperta will submit to the corresponding provincial Agraria 1:1000 survey maps
to be used for preparing the land use zoning plans; (c) tertiary layout maps

will be submitted by each PRIS to corresponding Diperta for review prior to
strip surveys; and (d) each Diperta will map the areas to be developed and
submit them to corresponding provincial Agraria for cadastral mapping see
Chart 25081).  To improve coordination between agriculture and irrigation
activities the following will be undertaken: (a) the Subdirectorates of DAAD,
Binlak II and SDPD will meet every quarter in Jakarta to discuss project
implementation in the eight provinces; and (b) PRIS and Diperta will meet
monthly in each province to review, project implementation ancl ensure
coordination.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.15       Under Irrigation XVII (Ln 2119-IND) a project monitoring and evalua-
tion system which closely follows experience in the Philippines is being
introduced by DPP and the East Java Irrigation Service (EJIS').  Progress
however is insufficient to judge how far and how fast this system should be
introduced throughout the irri.gati.on sector. Accordingly, this project will
follow monitoring systems that: halve been prepared by BinLak II and by DAAD
with the help of USAID./21  Reporl:s for each crop season wil:L be submitted to
the head of each provincial irrigation service, and reviewed by the Provincial
Irrigation Committees before t:he next crop season. Quarterly and seasonal
monitoring and evaluation will be submitted to Binlak II and DAAD who will
prepare quarterly implementation reports which compare performance against
planned progress, determine constraints and action, and extract lessons for
planning future irrigation development.  Agreements have bee.n reached with GOI
at negotiations that such reports covering design and construction implemen-
tation activities will be submaitted to the Bank (para. 6.01(c)).
5.  BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
5.01       Strengthening the provincial irrigation services, and improving
their coordination with agricaltural and local government services, will lead
to important economic benefits. The benefits include improved efficiency in
constructing smaller scale irrigation systems through better selection and
design, and improved operation and maintenance at farm level through greater
involvement of local communities in these processes.  These are more difficult
to quantify than the increased rice production expected from kecil and sedang
schemes. In the eight provinces concerned, rice production is expected to
increase by about 200,000 tons per year at full development benefitting about
60,000 low income farm families, many of which are recent transmigrants.
PRIS and DAAD Institutional Development
5.02       Development of PRIS staff skills wiLll result in better identifica-
tion, design and construction of irrigation systems, and recluce project costs
through greater accuracy, lower consultant costs and improved operation of
structures.  Costs may decrease by as much as 5-10%, up to $35 million during
Repelita IV in the eight provinces.  Similarly, improvements in operation and
maintenance through increased, staff numbers and improved skills through PRIS
/21  Project Monitoring Guidelines, November 1980 (Revised '982).



- 35 -
training should result in more efficient operation. This in turn will
increase irrigated areas particularly in the dry season, by an estimated 5%
(25,000 to 30,000 ha per year) and yearly rice production by 60,000 to 80,000
tons. Increasing the PRIS staff and their skills for design work should
reduce the need for consultant inputs (which will cost about $0.75 million per
year) by the end of Repelita IV. Based on performance during Repelita III,
the expected improvement in the ability of DAAD and Diperta staff to
accelerate land development is likely to result in an additional 4,000 ha
coming into production each year. Water management demonstrations will also
help farmers to adapt their cultivation to newly irrigated areas and increase
production more rapidly. As result, full crop production may be accelerated
by about 2 years.
Assumptions Used In Analyzing  riaio   cee
5.03      Financial and Economic Pricing.  Economic and financial prices for
major agricultural inputs and outputs used in the analyses are shown in
Annex 2, Table 1. Economic prices for rice, soybean, maize, groundnuts and,
fertilizers were based on world market price forecasts produced by the Bank's
Commodity Division, adjusted for transportation, processing and handling cost
to the farmgate level. The remaining inputs not traded on the international
market have been expressed in terms of actual (farmgate) prices. The level of
subsidy or implicit taxation experienced by farmers is indicated by the
difference between financial and economic prices. For example, the economic
price of rice is about 30% higher than the financial price and subsidized
financial prices for fertilizer are less than half the economic farmgate
price. Despite the fact that the implicit taxation of paddy sales amounts
between two and five times the subsidization of input purchases, few paddy
farmers are diverted from growing rice by GOI control of the rice price.
5.04      Financial costs have been converted to economic costs usinlg the
conversion factors in Annex 2, Table 2. Agricultural labor has been priced at
75% of its actual price due to the somewhat limited employment opportunities
in the project area.
5.05      Foreign Exchange.  In March 1983, GOI devalued the Rupiah by 28%
from Rp 703 to Rp 970 = US$1.00. The resulting impact on domestic inflation
and the prices of traded goods, while domestic prices adjust to the change,
has been taken into account in the economic analysis. A standard conversion
factor of 1.0 has been used since the present exchange rate is considered to
reflect the value to the economy of the foreign exchange used in constructing
the project and saved through increased grain production.
Economic Analysis of a Typical Kecil Scheme
5.06      Cropping Pattern and Yields.  A review of experience of 980 kecil
schemes completed with USAID assistance indicates that an average kecil
irrigation scheme (serving about 400 ha), results in increased cropped areas,
and wet and dry season yields as summarized in Table 5.1. At present, pro-
duction in the dry season is negligible (annual cropping intensity 75%).

Irrigation typically permits a reliable second crop of 100 ha paddy and 100
ha palawija (dry season) crops,/22 doubling total cropping intensity to
150%. Wet season paddy yields increase on average from about 2.5 tons/ha to
about 3.5 tons/ha, and the area planted to rice increases from 185 ha to 500
ha. In the dry season, yields of 2.5 tons/ha are projected because of poorer
water supply. Maize yields iacrease slightly from 1.0 ton/ha to 1.2 tons/ha,
but more importantly, an upgrading of crops from cassava to soybeans becomes
possible. Annual rice production from a typical 400 ha scheme is expected to
increase from about 440 tons (wet season only) to about 1,650 tons (wet and
dry season).
5.07      Construction and Land Development Schedule.  Construction of the
weir and main system of a typical scheme commences at the beginning of 1984/85
and is completed at the end of 1985/86. Tertiary construction which also
forms the drainage system /23 would commence in 1985/86, and finish at the end
of 1986/87. It is estimated that land development would take four years,
beginning in 1986/87 and ending in 1989/90. Full agricultural development
would be achieved in the eighth year of the scheme, in 1991. The scheme is
assumed to have a life of 15 years. Annex 2, Table 3 presents a detailed
expenditure schedule.
5.08      Operation and Maintenance.  Operation and maintenance (O&M)
requirements are estimated to be Rp 12,000 per ha at full development.
5.09      Economic Rates of Return (ERR).  Using the foregoing assumptions,
the economic rate of return is estimated to be 32%. The flow of economic
costs and benefits over the project life is shown in Annex 2, Tables 4-6.
5.10      Impact of Production Changes.  If there were insufficient water for
a dry season irrigated rice crop each year /24 and the palawija crop was
unaffected, the ERR would fall to 24%. Similarly if insufficient water
decreased rice yields in the wet and dry seasons to 3.0 tons/ha and 2.0
tons/ha respectively, and yields on maize to 1.0 ton/ha, soy yield remaining
unchanged, the ERR would fall to 18%. If the dry season rice crop was cut by
half to 50 ha due to water constraints, the ERR would fall to 28%. Total
agricultural benefits could fall by about 32% for a crossover value associated
with a 12% discount rate.
5.11      Impact of Delays.  Delays in benefit buildup may result from slow
land development or slow construction. If land development in a typical 400
ha scheme is delayed by two years, and the construction period for tertiary
canals is also delayed by two years, full agricultural development would not
be achieved until 1993, the tenth year of the scheme, and the ERR would fall
to 29%.
/22 This is a conservative estimate based on predicted water availability.
/23 Kecil schemes being small do not always possess separate drainage
channels for reuse of water.
/24 See para 3.14.



- 38 -
5.12      Impact of Poor Maintenance.  With poor maintenance, perhaps due to
an O&M budget decreased by one third to Rp 8,000/ha, it is likely that 30% of
the area would receive limited irrigation service. Assuming the impact is
predominantly on the rice crop, dry season yields would be expected to fall
30% to 1.75 tons/ha. The wet season yields may also be affected, with only
about 70% of the area (280 ha) receiving good irrigation, the yield on the
remaining 120 ha falling to an estimated 2.5 tons/ha. With these assumptions,
the ERR would fall to 20%.
5.13      Impact of Cost Overruns.  If costs were to increase by about 25%
the ERR would fall to 13%.
Economic Analysis of Sedang Schemes
5.14      Cropping Pattern and Yields.  The Mentawa scheme, to be constructed
under the project, is a typical sedang scheme. It lies largely within the
Toili transmigration area in Central Sulawesi. Of the 4,200 ha command area
(4,000 ha irrigable area), 40% is currently under dryland cultivation.
Current production is limited by low yielding local varieties, unreliable
water supply and poor cultivation techniques. The construction of a weir and
irrigation distribution network on the Mentawa River would permit an expansion
of the cultivated area, particularly in the dry season, and increase cropping
intensity from 0.5 currently to 1.8 at full agricultural development. The
area expansion results primarily from conversion of dry land and a small area
of forest, bush, and swamp to irrigated sawah. Annual rice production will
increase from 2,025 tons of upland rainfed rice to 18,160 tons at full
development. This increase, of about eight times, is due to the expansion of
cultivated area and an improvement in yields. For palawij-a crops, the
improvement in yields is not so substantial and the main production increase
results from an expansion of the cultivated area indicated in the crop budgets
presented in Annex 2, Table 7. Land use changes and agricultural economic
benefits are shown in Table 5.2.
5.15      Construction and Land Devrelopment Schedule.  ConstruLction of the
weir, main drainage, and tertiary system will take four years and be completed
by 1987/88. Land clearing and sawah formation is estimated to take five years
and will be completed in 1990.  Full agricultural development will be achieved
four years later, the eleventh year of the project. Development costs for the
Mentawa scheme are shown in Annex 2, Table 8; costs for a:Ll project schemes
during the project period are shown in Annex 1, Table 8.
5.16      Operation and Maintenance.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs
have been estimated at Rp 17,500/ha per year reflecting the more technical
nature of these irrigation schemes. The full sum will be incurred in 1994
with full agricultural production.  Equipment for O&M ($0.26 million) will be
replaced in 1996 after a life of ten years.
5.17      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  With the foregoing assumptions, and
assuming a scheme life of 20 years, the ERR is estimated at 16% (Annex 2,
Table 10).



- 39 -
5.18       Impact of Production Changes.  If water constraints completely
eliminated the dry season rice crop, other crops remaining unchanged, the ERR
would fall to 10%. If agricultural benefits are reduced by 20%, for instance
if the wet season rice crop yield is 3.0 tons/ha, and the dry season yield is
2.5 tons/ha, the ERR would fall to 10%.
5.19       Impact of Delays.  In this scheme, an extensive area requires land
clearing and sawah formation./25 Although the initial assumption of four
years for this is regarded as reasonable, the impact of delays on the scheme
must be estimated. If the buildup of benefits is delayed by another two years
as the result of land development or construction delays, the ERR would fall
to 14%.
5.20       Impact of Poor Maintenance.  If it is assumed that O&M is not
executed at an efficient level due to a 30% reduction in budgets, the area
served by the scheme in the dry season would decrease proportionately.
Assuming also that in the wet season only 70% of the area receives good
irrigation, the yield on the remaining 1,200 ha could fall to 2.5 tons/ha.
Under these circumstances, the ERR would fall to 10%.
5.21       Impact of Cost Overruns.  If total investment costs increase by 20%,
the ERR falls to 13%.
Farm Incomes and Cost Recovery
5.22       The current Bank estimate of the absolute poverty line for rural
areas in Indonesia is $112 per capita per annum. Based on representative farm
models, Table 5.3 shows that the majority of potential beneficiaries live on
incomes below this. These are comparable to figures reflected in a rec:ent
Bank review of transmigration sites./26 Incomes in the kecil schemes are
expected to almost double to $169 (Annex 2, Table 11). Incomes in sedang
schemes even without the project are expected to rise by 110% due to the
change from upland rice to rainfed sawah, as a result of land conversion by
farmers, and an expansion in the area.  The area for palawija crops also
increases, the area growing maize increasing from 360 ha to 1400 ha. With the
project, however, incomes in the sedang schemes are expected to rise much
more, by an average of about 170% (to about $370), most of the increase being
due to the project (Annex 2, Table 12).
/25 1,110 ha of forest and 1,450 ha of grassland require clearing and swah
formation. 1,600 ha of upland will be converted to sawah.

5.23      Indonesian farmers pay land taxes (IPEDA) and make contributions to
village watermasters who are responsible for tertiary network operation and
maintenance. Project beneficiaries are expected to increase these annual
payments on average to about $22/ha per year in sedang schemes and to about
$12.6/ha per year in kecil schemes with full project development (Annex 2,
Tables 12 and 13). These payments, with all investment and O&M costs
discounted at 10%, achieve complete O&M cost recovery and result in cost
recovery indices of less than 6%. This level of cost recovery is considered
reasonable, because of the low incomes of project beneficiaries and from a
equity viewpoint.
Risks
5.24      The major risks which may be encountered, and their likely impact,
are discussed below.
(a) Delays in land development and coordination problems between
irrigation construction and conversion of service areas will be
minimized during the irrigation system's planning. Conservative
assumptions have been made for reaching full production (10 years
after construction starts) and even longer periods (a delay of 2
years) would not reduce ERRs to unacceptable levels as detailed in
paras. 5.11 and 5.19;
(b)  Inadequate operation and maintenance standards are a cause for
concern throughout the irrigation sector and are addressed under the
project by (i) increasing O&M staffing and training; and (ii)
involving farmers more closely in planning and design of their



- 42 -
irrigation systems.  During negotiations agreements were reached to
this effect (para. 6.0I(gi, (h) and (i)). Poor (&M reduces the
water delivery and control effectiveness thus reducinag the irrigated
area and rice yields. The kecil schemes have a high margin for such
risks, since ERRs are about 32%. For the larger sedang schemes
(ERRs about 16%), output reductions of up to 20% can be withstood
without jeopardizing their viability;
(c) Environmental Risks. New irrigation systems in Outer Island
locations face the threat of continued forest clearing in catchment
areas, leading to reduced water deliveries in thes dry season;
flooding during peak rainfall; damage to diversion structures;
increased siltation; and reduced agricultural production, or
increased maintenance costs. Reduction of such risks requires
intervention by provincial forestry departments (undier existing
legislation) and is the subject of an agreement with GOI (see para.
3.32); and
(d) Inadequate PRIS Staff Numbers and Delays in Training. Failure to
appoint or recruit thes additional staff, or delays in training, will
result in reduced control over subproject selection, design and
construction, diminishing the projected cost reductions and incre-
mental benefits.  While the institutional objectives will be jeopar--
dized, the risks for the project construction are small because in
this event, DGWRD will continue to provide the functions, though
less efficiently than the PRIS.

/a All world prices are based on Bank projections with adjustment to mid-1983
constant dollars by an (MUV) index of 1UO%, 100.5% and 107.0% for 1981, 1982
and 19d3 respectively.
/b  90/ of world price based on spot checks and regressions.  See paper IBRD/
AiPiA 1979.
/c kates (end-1982) are approximately US$15/ton freight charges and US$15/ton
insurance and other costs. Source: BULOG.
/d Source BULUG. Includes port costs, transport to warehouse, spraying and
fumigation, unloading, warehouse rents. losses are 0.5% at unloading and
1.0%  at the warehouse.  [These costs are based on predevaluation estimates,
February 19b03.
/e Improvements in milling technology have resulted in an increased conversion
rate from 63Xo to b5%. For a detailed discussion, see Leon A. Mears, "The
New Rice Economiy of Indonesia," Gajah Mada University Press, 1981, pp. 486--
4b7.
/f  Net of value of byproducts and including milling/storage losses incurred by
the miller and handling charges.
/g Includes cleaning and drying before milling. iosses are assumed to be 5%
and other costs amount to Rp 7,1UOO/ton of farm-gate gabah.
/h Converted at an estimated exchange rate of Rp 970 = US$1.00
/i Surplus project area soybeans would be sold within the prov:Lnce.
fj  Equal to standard price, CIF Rotterdam, minus $20/ton freight and insurance
from Gulf port to Rotterdam.
/k  Assuming Indonesia is a net exporter of corn, the export price (FOB Palem-
bang) is estimated at world market price plus a US$15 transport premium.
/1 Includes physical losses, storage and packaging.
/m  Surplus project area groundnuts would be sold within the province.
In  Urea is valued ex-PUSRI plant, Palembang.  Price projections for bagged
urea, Fu6 turope, have been adjusted to Asian markets by adding a transport
premium of US>15/ton.
/o  Assuming that the devaluation results in a price change of only 20% by 1990
and 3b% by 1995, since theses ares officially controlled prices and unlikely
to initially rise by the full amaount of the devaluation.
/p  The economic price of seed is equivalent to the econamic farm-gate price of
tne products, assuming that with the project, increased area and production
of seed will be at the cost of either imports or exports of the relevant
products.  A covenant in the IBLD Seeds II project requests GOI to raise the
official price of seeds to cover full production costs. The average price
differential between rice seed and grain (extension seed quaLlity or lower)
is about 50% and about 30% for palawija (See seeds II, for cletails).
/q  NO distinction is made between traditional and high-yield variety seeds.

day. In the future with project, demand for family labor is high (360 man-days per
year) precluding off farm agricultural labor. In addition, since Mentawa is a transmi-
gration site, opportunities for off-farm labor exist in the present (100 man-days at

Statements of Expenditure
1.        Quarterly statements of expenditure will be used for Bank
disbursement of 75% of the progress payments made for civil works contracts
ranging from $0.2 million to $1.5 million in size, amounting to $49.6 million
of Loan Funds. Civil works will be procured through a number of small
contracts, tendered according to LCB procedures. Contract documentation
will be held by DOI and available for periodic sample inspection by Bank
staff.
2.        Quarterly statements of expenditure will also be used to disburse
100% of training costs of $2.2 million. Standard costs for training will be
agreed upon during project implementation.
3.        Statements of expenditure will therefore be used to disburse 58%
of Loan Funds. These procedures have been used widely in other ongoing Bank
irrigation loans in Indonesia, with good results.
