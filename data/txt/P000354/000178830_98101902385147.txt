FORESTRY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      United Republic of Cameroon
Amount:        US$17.0 million
Terms:         Twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at an annual
interest rate of 11.6 percent.
Co-financing:  Commonwealth Development Corporation
Project
Description:   The main objectives of the project would be:  (1) to expand.
the contribution of the forestry sector to the national economy
through establishment of about 11,000 ha of plantations to
provide fuelwood in the northern parts of Cameroon, and raw
material for the pulp industry in southwestern Cameroon; and
(2) to increase the capacity of the responsible Government
agencies to maintain continuous regeneration of the forests,
and to control the logging operations of forestry conces-
sionaires. These objectives would be achieved over a five-year
period through:
(a) the establishment of a plantation of about 5,200 ha of
pines and 3,600 ha of eucalyptus at Edea;
(b) establishment of plantations of about 1,000 ha of eucalyp-
tus in blocks and 200 ha in pilot village woodlots near
Maga, and a plantation of 750 ha of pines and 250 ha of
eucalyptus at Ngaoundere;
(c) provision of 16 man-years of specialist services in
plantation management and financial control;
(d) overseas specialized training of selected personnel,
and studies (including preparation of a possible follow-up
project); and
(e) provision of logistical, material, and operational
support for DEFC to improve its capacity for tax and
royalties assessment and collection.

Benefits
and Risks:   The project would produce some 19 000 m3 of fuelwood after
six years (increasing to 26,000 mi after 14 years), and
about 330,000 m3 of pine and eucalyptus which could be used
as raw material by the pulp industry. The supply of plantation-
grown pulpwood would reduce the industry's harvesting and pulp-
ing costs (by 33 and 20 percent respectively). The project
would also produce about half of the seed required for future
FNFP plantation programs. The proposed establishment of
village woodlots would provide experience which could help
reverse the continuing degradation of dry-zone forestry
resources in Cameroon.
The project presents no major or unusual technical risks.
There are, however, some risks associated with marketing of
the plantation-grown pulpwood, should CELLUCAM (a pulp manufac-
turing enterprise in which the Government holds a majority
share) not purchase the entire production. This is considered
unlikely. Nevertheless, other markets are available (albeit
less profitable) where trees could be sold as woodchips,
utility lumber or building and transmission poles.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON FOR A
FORESTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of US$17 million
to help finance a Forestry Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period, at an annual interest rate of 11.6 percent.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) has agreed to participate in
project financing with a loan to Fonds National Forestier et Piscicole (FNFP)
amounting to US$7.4 million equivalent. The CDC loan would be made on the
same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "United Republic of Cameroon - Economic Memorandum"
(No. 2877-CM), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 30, 1980.
Annex I provides basic country data.
Background
3.        Cameroon was a federation from the time it gained independence in
1960, until the United Republic, which unified the anglophone western and
francophone eastern parts of the country, was formed in 1972. The Government
has concentrated on fostering a sense of national unity among the different
parts of the country: the sparsely populated eastern region, the relatively
small but densely populated western part of the country, the sahelian zone in
the north with Muslim traditions, and the southern tropical regions.
4.        Cameroon has a population of 8.4 million (1980) and covers an area
of 475,000 km2. It is one of Africa's most diversified countries, with a
wide range of climatic zones, ecological conditions, population densities,
ethnic groups and traditional cultures. Its main opportunities for develop-
ment lie in the expansion of agricultural, livestock, and forestry production;
the exploitation of energy and mineral resources; and the processing of
agricultural, forestry and mineral products for domestic consumption and
export. Cameroon became an oil producer in 1978 and is believed to have
exported about 4 million tons of crude petroleum in 1981. Further increases
in crude petroleum production are expected. In 1981, Cameroon began producing
refined petroleum products. The country also has unexploited gas potential.
1/ The text of this Section is substantially the same as in the President's
Report for the Post and Telecommunications Technical Assistance Project
which was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 12, 1981.



5.        Cameroon's main economic centers are separated by large areas of low
population density and the country-s port facilities and transport network
also serve landlocked Chad and the Central African Republic. Adequate port
and trunk transportation systems are essential for promoting agriculture,
forestry and industry, and for strengthening internal and international
communications. With the growth of industry, transportation, construction and
services, Cameroon is becoming increasingly urbanized. About 30 percent of
the population now live in towns, with the heaviest concentrations in Douala
the major port and industrial center, and Yaounde the capital.
6.        Cameroon subscribes to a philosophy of planned liberalism, and
the country's economic development has been pursued within a five-year
investment planning framework. The Fourth Plan period ended in June, 1981,
and the Fifth Plan is now in effect. Cameroon-s development and macro-
economic policies have been rather cautious, with the result that, while
growth has not been exceptionally rapid, the country has enjoyed noteworthy
economic stability.
7.        Growth.  Over the  past fifteen years Cameroon has experienced
accelerating rates of output and population growth. The real GDP growth
rate during the Second Plan Period (1966-71) averaged 4.2 percent; in the
Third (1971-76), it rose to 4.5 percent; and in the Fourth (1976-81), it
is estimated provisionally at 7.1 percent. Population growth in the three
periods was about 1.8, 1.9 and 2.3 percent a year respectively. Per capita
GNP rose between 1966 and 1980 at an annual rate of about 3.1 percent.
8.        Within the overall pattern of accelerating growth, there was some
unevenness in the performance of key productive sectors from one planning
period to another. During the Third Plan in particular, both agriculture and
manufacturing experienced periods of slowdown, although services grew strongly.
Contributing to the agricultural slowdown were decreases in the output of two
major export crops--cocoa and arabica coffee--related to declines in producer
prices compared with food prices, and to the termination of a fertilizer
subsidy program for arabica coffee. Forestry output dropped towards the end
of the period because of reduced Western European demand and some transporta-
tion bottlenecks. Growth of the manufacturing and mining sector slowed as a
result of the declining momentum of import substitution activities, which had
produced rapid increases in manufacturing output during the Second Plan years,
and deteriorating terms of trade. The acceleration in growth during the
Fourth Plan was helped by rapidly rising construction output, reflecting
sharply higher levels of investment, by recovery in cocoa and robusta coffee
production, as farmers responded to higher producer prices, and by recovery in
forestry output. Since 1978, the start-up of oil production has contributed
significantly to aggregate growth.
9.        Investment and Savings.  Underlying the longer term rise in GDP
growth have been rising proportions of investment. The investment/GDP ratio
averaged over 15 percent during the Second Plan, about 19 percent during the
Third, and close to 24 percent during 1976-80. Investment priorities have
shifted over time. The First Plan emphasized directly productive projects
(53 percent), and the Second, infrastructure and social projects (58 percent).



- 3 -
During 1976-80, directly productive activities were again favored (63 percent),
with heavy emphasis on manufacturing, mining and energy (52 percent). Despite
the rising investment/GDP ratios, the mobilization of domestic savings more
than kept pace, due largely to increased public savings. Gross domestic
savings rose from about 84 percent of total investment under the Second and
Third Plans to about 87 percent during 1976-79. After allowing for net factor
service and current transfers and the amortization of foreign medium- and
long-term loans, reliance on foreign financing fell from about 33 percent of
total investment during the Second Plan to about 30 percent during 1976-79.
10.       Public Finance.  Budgetary revenues amounted to about 15 percent
of GDP during the Second and Third Plans, and increased slightly during
1976-79. Public savings after debt service declined from about 39 percent
of total public investment during the First Plan to about 36 percent during
the Second; however, it rebounded to 55 percent during 1976-79, thanks to
substantial contributions from the agricultural export stabilization Funds.
11.       Balance of Payments.  Overall, the balance of payments has not posed
particular problems, apart from some short-term deterioration during the
1974-76 period. In 1977-80, exports rose substantially (at an average annual
rate of 26 percent) but imports also increased (at an average annual rate of
20 percent) because of more rapid economic growth and higher investment.
International reserves were rebuilt in 1976-80, in part by the use of IMF
credits, rising in 1980 to a gross level equivalent to about seven weeks of
imports and to a net level of about five weeks. This was low by international
standards, although still acceptable because of Cameroon-s membership in the
Central African Monetary Union.
Development Prospects and Issues
12.       Short- and Medium-term Developments.  Oil production is bringing
with it significant changes in the Cameroonian economy. Historically,
Cameroon has been dependent on the export of agricultural products for the
bulk (72 percent in 1977/78) of its export earnings. Cocoa and coffee alone
accounted for 53 percent of the value of 1977/78 exports. However, oil exports
which represented about 1 percent of total exports in 1977/78, are estimated
to have risen to about 28 percent in 1979/80, with the share of agricultural
products dropping to close to 50 percent. Exports of oil are understood
to have continued to rise sharply in 1980/81, further reducing the propor-
tional importance of agricultural exports; this trend is expected to persist
for at least two more years.
13.       The outlook for agricultural and industrial growth in absolute
terms during 1980-86 is nonetheless quite favorable. Agricultural growth
expectations are based on some increase in cocoa output above 110,000 tons;
recovery of robusta coffee; continuing expansion for arabica coffee; in-
creased production of most food and other crops, as well as livestock; and
expansion of forestry production. Growth of industrial and mining production
is expected to result from existing and expanded manufacturing facilities
(particularly those for food, beverages and construction materials), from some
new industrial projects and from new mining ventures. An impact on the



-4-
structure of the economy is expected from the Fifth Development Plan invest-
ment program (1981-86). The proposed investment/GDP ratio under the Fifth
Plan is 23 percent. The investment program stresses support to agriculture
and expansion of the supply of technical and professional manpower, while
energy, mining and industry will receive diminished emphasis.
14.       Longer-Term Developments.  Cameroon's promising potential in areas
outside agriculture implies a longer-term shift towards a somewhat more
diversified industrial base. Agriculture will play a critical but less
dominant role, and a shift in priorities towards increased food production for
the growing urban population appears probable. The rate at which agricultural
productivity increases will be a crucial determinant of the pace of economic
development, and will call for an appropriate mix of public intervention and
private initiative.
External Borrowing and Creditworthiness
15.       Total debt outstanding and disbursed rose from US$514 million at the
end of 1976 to over US$2 billion at the end of 1980. Debt service payments
rose from US$39 million in 1976 to US$132 million in 1979, while exports
increased from. US$715 million to more than US$1.3 billion during the same
period. Notwithstanding a hardening of average loan terms in the 1970s,
Cameroon's debt service ratio was still less than 10 percent at the end of
1979, and is projected to stay in the 12 to 14 percent range throughout the
present decade. Borrowing on non-concessionary terms is expected to account
for about two-thirds of total new commitments, and average terms are expected
to harden during the period. Because of higher debt service payments, pro-
jected net disbursements will probably be less than in the past but, with
Cameroon's favorable export and savings prospects, are expected to be suf-
ficient to allow an investment rate above 25 percent of GDP, as well as the
restoration of a strong foreign reserve position.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
16.       Bank and IDA commitments in Cameroon as of September 30, 1981
amounted to US$600.9 million and covered 37 projects: 17 in agriculture,
11 in transportation, 3 in education, 2 in public utilities, 2 small- and
medium-scale enterprise projects and 2 technical assistance projects.
Transport accounts for the largest share (45 percent) of these commitments,
followed by agriculture (41 percent). IFC has invested in seven enterprises,
with total net loan and equity commitments of US$12.6 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as
of September 30, 1981, including notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
Although delays and setbacks have occasionally been encountered in implementa-
tion, the Government has consistently shown willingness to collaborate with
the Bank in finding solutions to such problems.



-5-
17.       The Bank's initial investment strategy in Cameroon was to support
the Government's development efforts in three main directions: (i) streng-
thening and extending the road and rail trunk systems and expanding port
facilities; (ii) raising agricultural output and net exports, with emphasis
on the establishment of modern industrial plantations, and (iii) providing
assistance to education. Through 1975, apart from one water supply project,
Bank lending was concentrated entirely in the transport, agriculture and
education sectors. Since 1975, lending has become more diversified, extending
into other areas including the development of small- and medium-scale enter-
prises and the provision of technical assistance.
18.       For the future, projects are being prepared in agriculture--to
consolidate existing tree crop operations, extend rural development efforts,
and strengthen agricultural research--and to rehabilitate and expand the
transport and communications infrastructure. Additional education and tech-
nical assistance projects are also planned, as well as further SME and initial
urban and water supply/sewerage projects. The Bank has carried out sector
studies in forestry, energy, industry, and telecommunications, and additional
projects in these areas have been tentatively identified. Thus, the trend
towards further sectoral diversification of Bank lending, reflecting the
growing complexity of Cameroon-s development needs, will continue.
19.       In addition to actual lending operations, the Bank will expand its
program of economic and sector work, develop the planning and provision of
technical assistance, and strengthen and broaden its economic dialogue with
the Government. In relation to short- to medium-term issues, this dialogue
will address the pace, pattern and conditions of oil and gas development;
the size and composition of the investment program; private versus public
sector activities; technical, professional and other skilled manpower con-
straints; training needs; improvements in the governmental administrative
apparatus; development priorities for export and food crops; and general
macro-economic management issues. With regard to longer-term issues, the
dialogue would center on basic agricultural (especially food crop) and
industrial development policies. An agricultural sector policy report is
under preparation and will be discussed with the Government in early 1982. As
regards industry, the Bank has recently completed a comprehensive study of
industrialization and the system of incentives, which has been discussed with
the Government. In the future, the dialogue will be expanded to cover the
objectives, economic performance and accountability of public enterprises.
Donor Activities
20.       Overall disbursements of official development assistance to Cameroon
during the second half of the 1960s amounted to about US$45 million a year,
mostly in the form of grants. France provided most of the assistance, which
was concentrated in infrastructure and some productive sectors. The European
Development Fund (EDF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) directed most of
their assistance to agriculture and infrastructure. Bank and IDA disbursements
were small during this period. In the 1970s, foreign aid increased to about



-6 -
US$90 million a year, with only one-fifth in the form of grants. Bank
and IDA financing amounted to about 23 percent of total disbursements. Bank
Group lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with that of other
donors; in 16 of the 37 Bank projects, joint or parallel financing was
arranged, and expanded cofinancing is being actively sought for several future
projects.
21.       Cameroon is now borrowing increasingly from private sources; such
borrowing rose to over 40 percent of external financing in 1975-79, compared
with only 11 percent in 1967-69. Public debt outstanding and disbursed as of
December 31, 1979, amounted to US$1.6 billion, about 7.9 percent of which was
in the form of Bank loans and about 7.8 percent in IDA credits. Bank loans
accounted for 9.4 percent of public debt service and IDA credits for 0.6
percent. By 1985, public debt is projected to reach US$2.6 billion. By 1985,
Bank loans and IDA credits are projected to account for about 26 percent of
debt outstanding and about 14 percent of debt service.
PART III - THE FORESTRY SECTOR
General
22.       Cameroon has significant forestry reserves, covering about 33 mil-
lion ha of which some 18 million ha are dense tropical forests mostly located
in the southern parts of the country. About 8 million ha of the tropical
forests have been allocated for industrial exploitation but activity remains
relatively modest and the value added in the sector contributed only 4 percent
of GDP in 1978. Little is known about Cameroon's forestry resources, but a
survey of the forests (to be followed by an inventory) has been started with
assistance from Canada, and this will provide the basis for better assessment
of development potential in the sector.
23.       Industrial exploitation of Cameroonian forests is undertaken on
about 200 concessions of which half are relatively small, covering less than
50,000 ha each, and only about 20 are considered large by West African
standards, ranging between 200,000 and 250,000 ha each. Total production on
these concessions was estimated in 1978 to be about 1.6 million m3 round log
equivalent, which implies a modest yield of 0.3 m3 per ha as compared to
1.0 - 2.0 m3 in neighboring countries.
24.       Consumption of forest products for fuelwood is unknown in quantita-
tive terms, but is nevertheless very high and increasing with expansion of
the population. Tentative Bank estimates indicate that some 2 million tons of
firewood are being cut annually. While this does not appear to pose any major
problems in the southern parts of Cameroon, it is becoming a serious threat in
the north in general and around the larger towns in particular, where serious
degradation and depletion of the forest resources have been observed. In
order to assess the pattern and supply of these resources, including fuelwood,
a rural energy survey is being conducted by the Government with financial



support from USAID. The Government is also starting to review possibilities
to produce charcoal and more fuel-efficient stoves with the assistance of
several bilateral and multilateral sources. The proposed project would
therefore deal with these issues but focus on regeneration of fuelwood supply.
25.       A pulp industry commenced operations in 1980 at Edea (southwest of
Douala) on a concession comprising 100,000 ha of harvestable forest. This
industry, operated by a mixed enterprise CELLUCAM (67 percent Government,
33 percent private foreign capital) has capacity to produce 122,000 tons of
pulp annually, and this level is expected to be reached in 1983. At present
CELLUCAM exploits natural hardwoods, but its long-term profitability will
depend on systematic replanting of harvested areas with trees of uniform
size which would both reduce harvesting costs and increase the efficiency of
pulping operations. The proposed project would assist in the establishment
of such plantations.
Institutions
26.       The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the forestry sector.
It exercises its responsibilities through two agencies, the Direction des Eaux
et Forets et des Chasses (DEFC) which operates as a government department, and
the Fonds National Forestier et Piscicole (FNFP) which operates as an autonomous
public entity.
27.       DEFC is responsible for sector planning and policy formulation,
management of state forests and overall supervision of forestry exploitation.
It is also responsible for assessment and collection of taxes and royalties
from the forestry sector. Its function at the provincial level are carried out
by staff supervised by a Forest Conservator. However, neither field staff nor
provincial headquarters have means to travel nor the facilities or funds
necessary to execute these tasks effectively. As a consequence DEFC has not
been able to effectively carry out its responsibilities and taxes have neither
been adequately assessed, nor collected. During 1981 a concerted effort has
been made to improve DEFC's tax-collection performance. The early results of
this effort have been encouraging and the proposed project would actively
support DEFC in this regard.
28.       FNFP is responsible for executing replanting programs on behalf
of the Government. Ninety percent of FNFP's income comes from taxes and
royalties collected by DEFC. Therefore, although FNFP has been given finan-
cial autonomy in theory, in practice it remains dependent upon the performance
of the Government and DEFC in the area of tax recovery. Since collections
have declined since 1978, FNFP has had to rely on supplemental payments from
the Treasury. The technical performance of FNFP in executing plantations has
also been inadequate mainly due to the lack of field experience among FNFP
technical personnel as well as its management. The proposed project would
provide considerable assistance to the strengthening of FNFP.



-8-
29.       Government revenues from forestry come from:  (i) two annual taxes
assessed on concessionaires to support local Government and reforestation;
(ii) a licensing fee for issuance or renewal of concessions; and (iii) royal-
ties charged per m3 of wood either exported or further processed within the
country. The collection of revenues has, however, been difficult, and it
was estimated that by June 30, 1981, about CFAF 1.5 billion (US$5.6 million)
of assessed taxes and royalties were unpaid. This is an amount approximately
equal to the revenue actually collected in 1979/80. The Government has shown
considerable concern over the inefficiency of its tax collection service and
a special commission was appointed early 1981 to propose ways and means of
improving tax collection. In response to this intensified effort, over US$1.7
million were collected between April and November 1981. It is expected that,
with the assistance to be provided under the proposed project all arrears
outstanding as of June 30, 1980 would be recovered by December 31, 1982
(Section 4.03(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). The Government has also under-
taken to carry out tax assessments promptly, and to ensure collections within
one year of the assessment (Section 4.03(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Bank Involvement in the Sector
30.       The proposed project would be the Bank's first direct involvement
in Cameroon in a project devoted exclusively to the forestry sector. However,
forestry components have been included previously in two rural development
projects: the Western Highlands Rural Development Project (Cr 784-CM) and
Northern Province Rural Development Project (Ln 1919-CM; Cr. 1075-CM). These
modest efforts aim to promote small-scale reforestation and erosion control,
as interim steps in the absence of capable forestry institutions in the areas.
The Western Highlands component is being well executed, and provides some
experience which would be valuable in the execution of the pilot village
woodlot components of the proposed project. The Northern Province component
has just begun.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The proposed project was identified by an FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Program (CP) sector mission in February/March 1979. A follow-up mission took
place in November 1979 and project preparation was undertaken by the CP in
May/June 1980. The project was appraised in January/February 1981 by a Bank
mission, with participation of the Commonwealth Development Corporation which
had expressed interest in financing the Edea Plantation component. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington from November 30, 1981 to December 4, 1981, and
the Cameroonian delegation was led by Mr. H. T. Kima, Charge d'Affaires of the
Cameroonian Embassy to the U.S. Details of the proposed project are contained
in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 3448-CM dated December 22, 1981 which is
circulated separately. Key events and special conditions are listed in
Annex III of the present report.

Project Objectives and Description
32.       As its principal objectives, the project would:
(a) expand the contribution of the forestry sector to the national
economy through the establishment of about 11,000 ha of pine and
eucalyptus plantations both in the tropical high forest and on
the savannah;
(b) strengthen Government institutions responsible for forest regenera-
tion and for application of existing regulations for forestry taxes
and royalties.
33.       The proposed project would finance:
(a) establishment of a plantation of about 5,200 ha of pines and
3,600 ha of eucalyptus in the Edea project site;
(b) establishment of plantations of about 1,000 ha of eucalyptus
in blocks and 200 ha in pilot village woodlots near Maga, to
be undertaken by SEMRY and FNFP; and a plantation of 750 ha of
pines and 250 ha of eucalyptus at Ngaoundere, by FNFP;
(c) provision of 16 man-years of specialist services not currently
available in Cameroon in areas of plantation management and finan-
cial control for FNFP and SEMRY, to upgrade technical execution
of reforestation programs;
(d) (i) 12 man-months overseas specialized training of selected
personnel; (ii) studies, including preparation of a possible
follow-up project; (iii) services and material/equipment for the
establishment of an FNFP tree seed unit; and
(e) provision of logistical, material, and operational support for
DEFC to improve its capacity for tax and royalties assessment and
collection.
Project Implementation
34.       Reforestation.  FNFP would be the executing agency for these com-
ponents in the proposed project. Accordingly FNFP would submit annual work-
plans and budgets to the Bank for approval by March 31 of each year (Sections
2.04 of the draft Project Agreement and 3.07 of the draft Loan Agreement). In
order to strengthen FNFP-s capacity to carry out reforestation programs, the
proposed project would finance the services of a Program Officer, a Project
Accountant and a Plantation Manager, each one for four years (para. 37).
These officers would be internationally recruited (Section 2.05 of the draft
Project Agreement).



- 10 -
35.       Since FNFP-s present capacity to undertake extensive field operations
is limited, special arrangements would be made for executing the plantation
programs at Edea and SEMRY (Sections 2.02 and 2.03 of the draft Project Agree-
ment).
(a) Edea. The Edea component would be executed by CELLUCAM on the
basis of a contract to be entered into with FNFP (Sections 3.01(b)
of the draft Loan Agreement and 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
Under this contract, which will have to be revised by the Bank and
signed before the proposed loan can become effective (Section
6.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement), FNFP would initially limit its
involvement to approving workplans and budgets prepared by CELLUCAM,
and monitoring progress through an accountant stationed at Edea.
CELLUCAM would, on the other hand, organize and perform tree plant-
ing in coordination with their own felling operations. CELLUCAM
would also provide support services including accounting, personnel
management and on-the-job training of FNFP seconded staff. The
contract would specify on one hand full reimbursement by FNFP for
costs incurred by CELLUCAM, and on the other hand that CELLUCAM
would purchase and cut trees at maturity, paying a stumpage fee
to FNFP which would ensure full cost recovery, including an accept-
able return on project investments. In view of the key role to be
played by CELLUCAM in executing the project, a special event of loan
suspension would be the failure of CELLUCAM to carry out its respon-
sibilities under the contract (Section 5.01(c) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
(b) SEMRY. The SEMRY reforestation component would be executed in
cooperation between FNFP and the SEMRY Forestry Division on the
basis of an agreement between the two agencies acceptable to
the Bank (Section 2.03 of the draft Project Agreement), and the
signing of which would be a condition for disbursement for the
component (paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Under this agreement, FNFP would provide the services of an inter-
nationally recruited forester to direct the SEMRY Forestry Division.
The following specific arrangements would be made for these
components:
(i) Block Plantation: The SEMRY Forestry Division would select
reforestation sites on the basis of a land-use study to be
financed under the project, and carry out the planting program
following annual workplans agreed upon with FNFP and the
Bank.
(ii) Village Woodlots: Farmers would receive free tree seedings and
plots of prepared land, and would plant and maintain the trees
and pay a stumpage fee when trees are cut at maturity. Village
woodlot pilot schemes are essentially new to Cameroon. This
subcomponent has therefore been modeled on successful schemes
carried out in India and East Africa and provision has been
made for short-term consulting services of a socio-economist
who would analyze the development program to ensure that it can



- 11 -
be successfully reproduced and expanded. No village woodlot
would be implemented before FNFP has submitted an acceptable
action plan (including suggestions on the formula to be applied
to determine the stumpage fee) (Section 2.03(b) of the draft
Project Agreement).
(c) Ngaoundere. This component would be carried out by FNFP alone
using existing staff on the basis of agreed annual workplans.
DEFC
36.       The program to strengthen DEFC's capacity to assess and collect
taxes and royalties from forestry exploitation would be the responsibility
of the DEFC Director. In addition to the equipment and vehicles needed to
improve DEFC's performance, provision has been made for any technical assis-
tance which may be required to improve DEFC's effectiveness (Section 3.04 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
Training
37.       On-the-job training of personnel in the development of the proposed
plantations would be the principal approach for the project's training com-
ponent. The 50 FNFP engineers and senior technicians presently employed
would be given the opportunity of working at either CELLUCAM or SEMRY during
the five-year project period. A program to second FNFP site supervisors and
foremen would be organized and monitored by the Director of FNFP with assis-
tance of the project-financed Program Officer. The Project Accountant would
be responsible for upgrading FNFPs accounting services. Up to about 12
months of specialized short courses held outside Cameroon for selected FNFP
personnel, under training programs satisfactory to the Bank, would also be
financed by the project (Section 2.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
Monitoring and Evaluation
38.       The Program Officer would establish a procedure within FNFP to
monitor plantation operations as a basis for annual work planning, budgeting
and evaluation. Enforcement of forestry legislation and regulations would
continue to be monitored by the DEFC. The Director of DEFC would institute a
pattern of regular visits by staff in the provincial headquarters for control
and verification of forestry exploitation activities. In the third year of
the project, a mid-term evaluation would be conducted by consultants. Recom-
mendations of this review would be discussed by Government, FNFP, DEFC and the
Bank, and would be used inter alia as a basis for preparation of a possible
follow-up project.
Project Costs and Financing
39.       The total cost of the project (based on January 1981 prices) is
estimated at US$35.5 million, including US$2.3 million of identifiable taxes.
However, Government has advised that goods imported and purchased for the
project would be exempted from import taxes. Foreign exchange costs amount to



- 12 -
US$16.2 million or 46 percent of total project cost (49 percent of total
project cost net of taxes). Physical and price contingencies account for
about 44 percent of project base costs and are based on expected domestic
inflation of 12 percent annually and international inflation of 9 percent in
1981, 8.5 percent in 1982 and 1983, 7.5 percent in 1984, 7 percent in 1985
and 6 percent in 1986. The average cost of long-term expert and short-term
consultancies totalling 294 man-months, is estimated at US$10,900 per month
including price contingencies (US$10,360 would cover salaries, agency overheads
and fees, international transportation and living allowances, and US$540 would
cover operating costs in Cameroon), and total US$3.2 million or about 10
percent of total project costs.
40.       The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$17
million (51 percent of total project costs net of taxes), a loan from Common-
wealth Development Corporation of US$7.4 million equivalent for the Edea
Plantation component (22 percent of total project cost net of taxes), and a
Government contribution of US$8.8 million equivalent (27 percent of total
project costs net of taxes). The Bank loan would be made to the Government
for 20 years, including five years of grace. The CDC loan would be made to
FNFP on the same terms as the Bank loan and would be disbursed on a pari passu
basis with the Bank loan in the ratio of 4:3 for the Edea component. The
fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the CDC loan
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Section 6.01(d) of
the draft Loan Agreement). The Bank loan would finance US$11.6 million of
the project's foreign costs (US$16.2 million) and US$5.4 million of the
incremental local cost for the Edea component, for strengthening DEFC and
FNFP, and applied research in the form of improved tree seed production.
Local cost financing is justified to maintain the overall Bank contribution at
a level commensurate with the important institution building objectives of the
proposed project, which would be the first Bank operation in the forestry
sector.
41.       The Government would transfer as a grant to FNFP all funds necessary
to carry out the project components for which FNFP is responsible, including
Government s own contribution. The establishment of separate project accounts
for each of the project components with funds sufficient to finance about six
months of operating costs (estimated at US$1.9 equivalent) to start up the
project would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Section
6.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       Contracts of US$100,000 or more, principally for the purchase of
heavy equipment, would be awarded through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Goods and services so purchased are expected
to total about US$5.2 million, of which US$3.3 million would be financed by
the Bank loan. Purchases would be grouped whenever possible to derive maximum
benefits from bulk procurement. Contracts below US$100,000 but more than
US$50,000 would be awarded through local competitive bidding procedures; those
for less than US$50,000 would be on the basis of quotations from not fewer than
three reputable suppliers. Such contracts would be expected to aggregate about



- 13 -
US$1.1 million, of which Bank financing would total US$0.7 million. Land
preparation and forest track construction which must be closely coordinated
with planting operations do not lend themselves to procurement through com-
petitive bidding and would therefore be carried out on force account by the
respective project plantation entities (US$2.9 million, of which US$0.8
million would be financed by the Bank). Small buildings, valued at US$0.2
million (of which Bank US$0.1 million), at Edea, SEMRY and Ngaoundere would
also be built on force account. However, for the FNFP Seed Production Unit
and DEFC components, building contracts valued at US$0.7 million (of which
Bank US$0.5 million) would be awarded following locally advertised competi-
tive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. All terms of reference,
qualifications and contracts of the experts and consultants to be recruited in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines would have to be satisfactory to the
Bank. Contracts for 294 man-months of technical assistance with a total value
of about US$3.2 million (Bank, US$3.1 million) would be placed in accordance
with normal procedures for international recruitment. About US$18.2 million
of project expenditures, of which the Bank loan would finance US$7 million,
would be for incremental operating costs which do not lend themselves to
bidding procedures and would be committed in accordance with established
practices, which are satisfactory.  Payments to be made to CELLUCAM for
management services would be defined in the proposed execution contract
between CELLUCAM and FNFP, and are estimated at about US$4 million, of which
the Bank would finance US$1.5 million.
43.       The Bank loan would be disbursed over about seven years, and would
be applied as follows to eligible project expenditures: (i) 75 percent of the
cost of vehicles, equipment and buildings (except at Edea where only 60 per-
cent would be covered in view of the contribution from CDC) (US$4.4 million);
(ii) 35 percent of plantation investments and operating costs (50 percent for
the SEMRY plantation) (US$8.6 million); and (iii) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for technical assistance
(US$2.8 million). US$1.2 million would be unallocated. Disbursements for
most civil works, vehicles and equipment, payments to CELLUCAM for support
services, and technical assistance services would be fully documented.
Disbursements against planting costs, including local salaries, and for
buildings included in the plantation components would be against certified
statements of expenditures. Supporting documentation not submitted with
withdrawal applications would be retained for review by Bank supervision
missions.
Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
44.       FNFP would ensure adequate record-keeping for the FNFP components
while the accounting services of CELLUCAM and SEMRY, would handle their
respective components. FNFP's consolidated accounts for the whole project
would be subject to an annual audit by independent auditors with qualifica-
tions and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. FNFP and DEFC would
submit quarterly progress reports to Government and to the Bank adequate for
full supervision of the loan (Section 3.09(c)(iii) of the draft Loan Agreement
and Section 2.09(b)(iii) of the draft Project Agreement).



- 14 -
Markets
45.       CELLUCAM would be the primary market for wood grown at the Edea
Plantation. CELLUCAM would pay a stumpage fee for the plantation-grown trees
as determined in the execution contract with FNFP; the fee would be set at a
level sufficient to assure FNFP of recovery of the full cost of planting and
maintenance, and to yield a positive real rate of return after accounting for
inflation (Section 2.02(a) of the draft Project Agreement). The market for
fuelwood and building materials in the Northern province is expected to grow
at about 5 percent a year, which is likely to create incremental demand for
30,000 m3 of wood in the SEMRY area and upwards of 72,500 m3 of wood in
the Ngaoundere area. Therefore the incremental production of 14,000 m3 at
SEMRY and 57,900 m3 at Ngaoundere should be readily absorbed at prices
sufficient to allow Government to fully recover establishment and maintenance
costs.
Benefits and Risks
46.       The 11,000 ha plantation program would result in:  (i) an average
increase in annual production in the wood-scarce Northern Province of 19,000 m3
of wood after six years, increasing to 26,000 m3 after 15 years; and (ii) an
average annual production of 330,000 m3 of uniform pulpwood 15 years after
project inception at Edea for the use of CELLUCAM. The supply of plantation-
grown pulpwood would reduce CELLUCAM's harvesting and pulping costs by 33 per-
cent and 20 percent respectively. The production of improved seed would
provide about half of the seed required for future FNFP plantation programs.
The two principal forestry sector institutions would be strengthened, estab-
lishing the basis for better long-term management of forestry exploitation,
and sound regeneration of forests. Finally, the pilot program for individual
village woodlots, an approach which holds one of the keys to reversing the
continual degradation of dry-zone forestry resources in Cameroon, would yield
important results for the design of such efforts oni a larger scale.
47.       The project's economic rate of return is estimated at about 14
percent or 88 percent of the project costs. This rate of return is only
moderately sensitive to changing assumptions concerning the future value of
pulp and pulpwood, delays in program implementation and yield variations.
Even with combination of these factors which would increase costs by 20
percent or reduce benefits by 16 percent, the economic rate of return would
still be an acceptable 12 percent.
48.       No major risks have been identified which threaten the success of
the proposed project. Normal risks of fire in the arid zone plantations and
of plant diseases have been adequately dealt with in project design, and
provisions have been made to assure normal protection. The planting tech-
nologies proposed have been used successfully in several West African countries
with similar arid and humid zone conditions.
49.       As indicated above, CELLUCAM would be the primary market for planta-
tion-grown wood financed by the project. In the unlikely event that CELLUCAM
did not buy the project plantation wood, the pine and eucalyptus grown would



- 15 -
find international and domestic markets as wood chips, sawn lumber, and
transmission poles. Although these options would be less advantageous, they
would still allow Government to earn a return sufficient to recover costs, and
a real rate of return on investment of about 2.5 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Cameroon and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and FNFP, and the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
51.       Special conditions of loan effectiveness would be the fulfillment of
all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the CDC loan (para. 40); the
signature of a contract between CELLUCAM and FNFP specifying arrangements for
the execution of the Edea Plantation (para. 35(a)); and establishment by Govern-
ment of separate accounts for each of the project components with funds suffi-
cient to finance about six months of operation costs for these components
(para. 41).
52.       A condition for disbursement of the SEMRY component would be the
signature of an agreement between FNFP and SEMRY specifying the arrangements
for executing this component (para. 35(b)).
53.       A special event of loan suspension would be the failure of CELLUCAM
to carry out its responsibilities under the contract with the Government and
FNFP (Section 5.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement) (para. 35(a)).
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Douala station and the Bassa workshops have been awarded; the contracts for
some civil works in the depots in Yaounde are yet to be awarded.  The equip-
ment and machinery have started arriving and installation has commenced.
The civil works in Douala station are in full progress and the new station
is likely to be brought into use in the first half of 1983. The training
school building works are in progress. Plans for designing courses and
curricula are being drawn up and technical assistants are being recruited.
The current financial situation of the Regie continues to be poor due to:
(i) excessive staffing, (ii) over-ambitious investments, and (iii) reluc-
tance to raise tariffs adequately and frequently. The special Government
Commission appointed to review the railway's financial situation has made
its recommendations, some of which are not in consonance with Bank-suggested
remedial measures. It is proposed to discuss these issues at the highest
levels of Government in January 1982.  However, traffic is maintaining its
steady increase; operating efficiency is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1245-T-CM Third Education Project: US$17 million Loan of
July 2, 1976; Effectiveness Date: December 31, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The project is about three years behind schedule, primarily due to
weak management and problems dealing with a 34 percent cost overrun (US$8.4
million). A secondary technical school, transferred from the previous proj-
ect, is the only one of the twelve project institutions in operation. Con-
struction work is completed or underway at ten institutions, and should start
in early 1982 at the remaining two, for which rebidding was necessary. Most
equipment bids have been invited and most of the technical assistance program
and pre-investment studies have been completed. The Government has agreed to
finance the cost overrun. Project implementation has improved somewhat
recently. Of the three specialists required to strengthen project manage-
ment, one architect was assigned in October 1981, and recruitment of the other
two is underway. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1981, has been
extended by one year initially, according to a detailed implementation sche-
dule discussed with the Government. If this first stage is adequately imple-
mented, the Closing Date should be postponed by another year to allow for
project completion.
Cr. No. 673    Technical Assistance Project:  US$4.5 million Credit
of June 15, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 14,
1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Project's funds have been fully committed and most pre-investment
studies financed by it--largely in agriculture, transport and planning--have
been completed. Long-term advisory consultants are continuing to assist
Cameroonian staff to improve project generation and supervision capacity,
which is being supplemented by on-the-job training and formal training courses.

Cr. No. 723    Rural Development Fund Project:  US$7 million
Credit of August 4, 1977; Effectiveness Date:
January 30, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The Project's delayed development continues to accelerate and to
consolidate; standards of physical construction are generally good and the
organization of most sub-projects is good, as are their planning, budgeting,
accounting and reporting. However, the rate of physical development, par-
ticularly for dams, boreholes, pump installation and bottomlands, where
achievements are approximately 40 percent of appraisal targets and corre-
sponding cost overruns are 100 percent, are significant problems. Develop-
ment of the irrigated market garden credit scheme and the stall cattle
fattening are reasonable but credit program loan recovery efforts need to be
strengthened. Government has requested Bank Group assistance in financing for
an enlarged second phase, terms of reference for a preparation study have been
approved and consultants should commence the preparation stage by January
1982. The Bank has approved a six-month extension to the credit agreement
with aim of covering a fourth construction season (81/82) and coincide with
initiation of a proposed second phase development.
Ln. No. 1392   Second SOCAPALM Project:  US$18 million Loan and
US$7 million Third Window Loan of August 25,
1977; Effectiveness Date: November 23, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
New plantings under the project are satisfactory though implementa-
tion is slightly behind schedule. Production potential from earlier plantings
is not being achieved due to lower than expected yields, labor problems, and
processing difficulties. Cost to completion is expected to be 12 percent
above appraisal estimate. SOCAPALM management has been strengthened by the
appointment of an internal auditor and the financial situation has improved.
,The positive cash balance as of June 30, 1981, amounts to CFAF 230 million,
however insufficient to cover three months of expenditures and an additional
capital increase of CFAF 1,500 million would be required.
Cr. No. 749    Feeder Roads Project:  US$4.6 million Credit and
Ln. No. 1494   US$6.5 million Loan of December 7, 1977; Effective-
ness Date: March 7, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
The project includes establishing a Central Feeder Roads Unit
within the Department of Highways and a four-year program of construction,
improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance of about 2,000 km of feeder roads,
including equipment purchase and operation, office and workshop construction
and staff training in equipment operation and labor-intensive methods. The
project-s implementation is behind schedule because the organization in charge
of the feeder roads is understaffed and because of shortages of local funds.
The Government is to submit for the Bank's approval a modified program for the
execution of the project, reflecting the considerable increase in construction
costs of the feeder roads.

Cr. No. 763    Second SEMRY Rice Project:  US$14.5 million Credit
Ln. No. 1512   of February 1, 1978; Effectiveness Date:  April 14, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984; and US$14.5 million Loan
of February 1, 1978; Effective Date: April 14, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984.
Satisfactory solutions to erosion and piping problems of the
dike have been found and permanent repairs are expected to be completed in
1983. Agricultural yields have reached appraisal levels, but the rate of
resettlement of irrigated land has slowed. Government is now investigating
means of encouraging migration of persons living in land-scarce, neighboring
areas into the project zone. As a result of the slow rate of land use,
Government has stopped the construction of more irrigation works until avail-
able land is more fully used. This will reduce the need for supplemental
financing. On the other hand, fishing in the man-made lake has produced
greater benefits for the local population than expected at appraisal, and
Government and SEMRY are studying ways of improving the management of this new
resource.
Ln. No. 1508   Second CAMDEV Project:  US$15 million Loan of
February 1, 1978; Effectiveness Date: June 30, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The project planting program will only reach 75 percent of the
appraised target and the estate development program has been voluntarily
reduced to 281 hectares (against 600 at appraisal). For estate rubber devel-
opment, the planting of 1,700 hectares in Pendamboko estate will be delayed
until FY82-83 and will be included in a proposed tree crop consolidation
project. The completion of the smallholders program (586 hectares) will
also be postponed for the follow-up project. Financial and managerial pro-
blems previously identified will be solved prior to the effectiveness of the
follow-up action undertaken under the proposed tree crop consolidation project.
In addition, (i) CAMDEV's capital will be increased by CFAF 6,000 million
(US$22.2 million), (ii) CAMDEV's management will be strengthened by five
internationally recruited specialists, and (iii) a reorganization study will
propose solutions to improve CAMDEV's management. The General Management has
already taken measures to control costs by reducing the labor force by 10
percent.
Ln. No. 1515   Third Highway Project:  US$16.5 million Loan of
April 3, 1978; Effectiveness Date: October 17, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Construction of the Garoua-Figuil road, the last section of the
Trans-Cameroon rail and road route, was satisfactorily completed in 1979.
Technical assistance to the Ministry of Transportation helped to carry out
a comprehensive origin-destination survey with the final phase having been
completed in mid 1981. Results of the origin-destination survey are expected
to be available shortly. A transport advisor financed under the Project,
is helping the Ministry of Planning evaluate and coordinate the transport
component of the Fifth Development Plan and will finish his term in mid 1982.
A US$5.6 million cost overrun, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations, has
been covered by the Government.

Cr. No. 784    Western Highlands Project:  US$13 million Credit
of April 17, 1978; Effectiveness Date: December 8, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project is achieving its objectives and technical and financial
management is good. Although physical execution was lagging behind appraisal
schedules, owing to organizational problems encountered during the first
project year, improvements have been made in all components with corresponding
increases in procurement and disbursement rates. Government's contributions
to project financing continue to be regular, and liquidity problems due to
delays in preparation of withdrawal applications have been partly rectified.
In response to Government's request for Bank group assistance to extend the
project into a second phase, the FAO/CP carried out an identification mission
in June 1981, followed by a preparation mission in October 1981. Appraisal is
planned for the second half of FY82.
Ln. No. 776    ZAPI East Integrated Rural Development Project;
US$8.5 million Credit of April 17, 1978; Effectiveness
Date: October 4, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The project continues to make satisfactory progress. Despite
budgetary constraints, physical implementation of most components approached
targeted levels for 1980/81. Crop production, processing, disease control,
research and inland fisheries components are developing well. Reorganization
of extension, credit and distribution services and ZAPI's management structure
is proceeding. ZAPI's financial situation shows marked improvement. As a
result of internal management reforms and a Government-authorized subsidy of
US$2.1 million, ZAPI should be able to liquidate its long-standing deficit and
resume program expansion in 1981/82. At midterm approximately 50 percent of
the IDA credit has been disbursed.
Cr. No. 926    Fourth Highway Project:  US$10 million Credit of August 23,
Ln. No. 1723   1979; Effectiveness Date:  November 15, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1986; and US$38 million Loan of same date; Effec-
tiveness Date: November 15, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
The project includes a training program for staff and workers
for road maintenance, maintenance of about 17,000 km of roads and rehabili-
tation of 1,700 km through force account and domestic contractors, technical
assistance to the domestic construction industry, two permanent weighing
stations, and pre-investment studies for a proposed Fifth Highway Project and
forestry evacuation roads. Implementation of the project has started. The
pre-investment study for the Douala-Yaounde Road is completed. The Bank group
is currently considering, together with other financing agencies, the financ-
ing of the Edea-Yaounde section of this road under the proposed Fifth Highway
Project.

and US$16.5 million Loan of same date; Effectiveness Date:
September 16, 1980; Closing Date: January 30, 1985.
The area planted during PY1, 2,390 ha, exceeded appraisal estimate
by 11 percent. Growth and upkeep are of acceptable standards and root disease
(fomes) is being brought down and kept within manageable proportions. The PY2
planting target of 2,200 ha is expected to be achieved. Expenditures are well
controlled and the overall management is satisfactory. Disbursements are on
schedule and the financial situation is sound.
Ln. No. 1753   Second Water Supply Project; US$21 million Loan of December 11,
1979; Effectiveness Date: May 12, 1981; Closing Date: June 30,
1984.
The aims of the project are to improve and extend water supply
systems in 13 secondary centers and two major cities, Douala and Yaounde; lay
the groundwork for organizing urban development planning for Douala and
Yaounde; initiate a pilot public health educational project; and strengthen
the organization of the water supply sector. Engineering studies and bidding
documents have been prepared, and tenders have been called for the majority of
the project. Cost overruns are substantial due to implementation delays, but
these will be financed by Government. The CDC co-finance loan is not yet
effective.
Cr. No. 1010   Second Livestock Development Project; US$16 million Credit of
June 20, 1980; Effectiveness Date: May 12, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
This credit has recently become effective. The project will support
the second phase of Cameroons "Meat Plan" through three major production
components: a diversified credit program, continued eradication of tsetse
flies from the grazing area of the Adamaoua Plateau, and a strengthening
of veterinary field services. It will also support formal and informal
training, and institutional reforms in aid of the productive components.
Initial progress has been satisfactory.
Ln. No. 1919   Northern Province Rural Development Project:  US$25 million
Cr. No. 1075   Loan of January 27, 1981; Effectiveness Date:  June 1, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981; and US$12.5 million Credit
of same date; Effectiveness Date: June 1, 1981; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984.
The Loan and the Credit became effective last June and the project
is off to a good start. Besides the introduction of improved technical
packages for cotton, the project will also assist the development of foodcrops
with improved seed and techniques and animal traction, as well as the streng-
thening of the rural infrastructures, services and administrative structures
in Cameroon's Northern Province. Notwithstanding the bad rain distribution
40,000 ha of cotton were planted this year. In addition, SODECOTON has
started improvements on sorghum and maize, and will add groundnuts during the
forthcoming season when quality groundnut seed will be available. Measures
have been taken to fill all key staff positions and to reorganize and train
the agricultural extension services as foreseen at appraisal.
