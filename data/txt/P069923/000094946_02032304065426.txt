Management Program (ERDMP). The ERDMP aims, among
other things, to mitigate damages to coastal areas caused by
frequent storms and to reduce the risk to property and life from
flash floods.
Under the UNFCCC, parties are required to present a national
report to the Secretariat of the convention as part of their
obligation.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) as a
signatory to UNFCCC has just completed its national report.
One component of the report dealt with coastal resource
vulnerability. The report indicated that the most likely impacts
of accelerated sea level rise are:
*  Increased coastal erosion
*  Inundation of low-lying coastal areas
*  Increased flooding and storm damage
*  Wetland loss
*  Increased salinity of surface and ground water
*  Higher water table

Flooding in the downstream area of the valley has been
aggravated by agricultural and fuel wood harvesting
practices over the years. Recent housing developments
serve to further increase surface runoff and increase flood
risk.
Not much development has occurred at the riverbanks close
to the project site in recent years. However, land uses
upstream (including housing) have been linked to adverse
downstream effects such as scouring, hence the need to
stabilize eroded riverbanks and bridge infrastructure.
The Buccament Valley Development Project brought a
greater awareness of the harmful landuse practices
affecting the river and other resources in the valley.
Community groups, along with government agencies (such
as Forestry, Agriculture, Public Health, Water Authority,
Community Development and Planning), have worked on
problems associated with chemicals usage, pig farming,
dumping and other practices that pollute the river, which
provides potable water for most of Kingstown.

* Define river cross-section upstream of the bridge in

close to the sea and subject to corrosion.

4.0   ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES                         The likelihood of making such adjustments should not be
ruled out because of development trends and the inherent
4.1   Layou                                            dynamic nature of river ecosystems.
An alternative to the proposed stepped wall would be beach
nourishment. This method is considered to be a soft means
of coastal protection. Its advantages over many other forms
of coastal protection is that it not only provides a wider
area of beach for users but also provides a sediment source
that may participate in the periodic beach profile
adjustment which is nature's natural way of protecting a
coastline.
Additionally it does not cause circumstances to develop
that could create more severe erosion condition like many
other forms of coastal protection such a vertical sea wall
and groynes. The major disadvantage of beach nourishment
is that re- nourishment may be required periodically.
The recurrent period depends on the volume of
nourishment carried out, the exposure and wave climate of
the area and the existing beach profile. Common re-
nourishment periods range from five to 10 years.
4.2   Rivers
No alternatives have been considered for the river sites. In
addition to being suitable for riverbank protection, at these
sites, gabion baskets can be easily removed if future
adjustments are required to further mitigate impacts caused
by upstream developments.

6.3   EIA Data Base
One of the difficulties encountered in undertaking EIA
assessments in the OECS sub-region is the inadequacy of
usable data. Improvement of the database could occur
though monitoring programs designed to support impact
mitigation or otherwise to monitor the effects of land uses
or to measure environmental change.
No agency appears to have research as a major component
of its mandate. However, the Environmental Unit of the
Ministry of Health periodically undertakes to monitor
environmental quality in selected areas of St. Vincent.
Consideration could be given to making research a critical
component of the Unit's mandate. In this case, it would be
provided the budgetary and other resources to develop and
manage a database for environmental management.
This should be done with the understanding that monitoring
is an essential component of mitigation strategies requiring
an appropriate institutional framework and adequate
resources.  The Unit would therefore need to build
administrative and technical capacity to carry out its new
mandate, and would require a laboratory and equipment to
perform basic tests.
