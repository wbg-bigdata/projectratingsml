INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Summary and Conclusions
i.        Since 1960, Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown in
real terms at an average annual rate of about 7%. From the mid-1950's to
1972, Mexico was among the few countries in the developing world to com-
bine a sustained high rate of growth with monetary and balance of payments
stability. Maintenance of this growth rate and stability in exchange rates
is heavily dependent on rapid growth of export earnings and managment of
external debt, which, in turn, hinges on an improved fiscal position. The
recent upsurge in inflation to about 20% p.a. is a consequence in part of
past failures to take the needed fiscal initiatives. Other problems to be
faced are gross maldistribution of income, growing unemployment and under-
employment, and the overall social tensions and pressures inevitable in a
population growth rate of about 3.4% p.a.
ii.       Government policy in relation to the rural sector has the triple
objectives of rapidly increasing food production for both domestic and export
markets, improving income distribution and the availability of public ser-
vices to the poor, and creating the maximum number of new jobs consistent
with sound overall economic management. In 1970, 39% of the country's labor
force was engaged in the agricultural sector. It contributed 11% of GDP,
nearly all domestic food requirements, and 50% of commodity exports. Since
food production is growing at about 4% p.a., while demand is growing at
nearly 5%, elimination of this food deficiency gap by increasing production
is the first serious challenge facing Mexican rural areas. The second serious
problem is that of maldistribution of income. It is estimated that urban per
capita income is about 2.7 times rural per capita income. Of the approxi-
mately 3.9 million rural families, it is estimated that about 65% are poor,
if one defines poor as anyone with an income below the 40 percentile (US$1,500).
Lack of employment opportunities is the third serious problem, as labor absorp-
tion possibilities in urban areas are far short of requirements, and, hence,
job creation in rural areas is urgent.
iii.      The proposed loan to help finance the Integrated Rural Development
Project I - Papaloapan Basin (Project) would help achieve such objectives.
The Project would be executed within the confines of the Papaloapan Basin
(46,517 km2 in size). The Project is conceptually a new departure for the
Bank in Mexico, and for Mexico itself, and would help finance, in addition
to small irrigation works, technical services to rainfed agriculture, market-
ing facilities, experimental farms, feeder roads, potable water, sewerage,
electricity, primary schools and workshops, medical centers and community
centers. Total Project cost would be about US$138.5 million equivalent,
including US$18.0 million for on-farm incremental working capital, which
part, however, would not be financed under the proposed loan, since it is
eligible for financing from Bank Loan 910-ME. The other Project components
would be financed from three sources: (a) the Bank loan of US$50.0 million,



- ii -
or 41%, would finance all the foreign exchange costs (US$21.2 million, or
about 17% of Project cost, excluding on-farm incremental working capital) and
29% of the local currency costs (US$28.8 million, or about 24% of Project
cost, excluding incremental working capital); (b) Government would contribute
US$60.3 million, or 50%; and (c) beneficiaries would provide US$10.2 million,
or 9%.
iv.       In the construction of water systems based on household connections,
the beneficiaries would finance at the outset all investmients within house-
holds and the costs of household connections (about 34% of the total costs of
these systems), and the rest would be financed from public funds. Such systems
would be considered, however, only if, in addition, the households involved
would be prepared to pay an annual charge sufficient to cover the operation
and maintenance costs involved, plus recovery of the public investment funds
over 25 years at zero interest rate. In villages desiring9 only water hydrants,
they would be required to contribute at the outset at least 20% of the invest-
ment cost, and the remainder would be financed from public funds. Such systems
would be built, however, only if, in addition the villages would be prepared to
pay an annual charge sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs (public
investment funds would not be recovered). A sewerage system would be considered
for a village only if the households benefitting would finance at the outset all
investments within their households and costs of household connections (about
22% of the total costs of these systems), and the rest would be financed from
public funds. In addition, however, the households involved would have to agree
to pay an annual charge sufficient to cover operation and maintenance, and re-
covery of public investment funds over 25 years at zero interest rate. In the
construction of electricity facilities, households benefiitting would finance
wiring costs within their households (about 14% of the total cost of these
systems) and agree to pay the annual charges fixed according to the tariffs for
the sale of electricity applied generally in Mexico. Basied on Project cost esti-
mates, these charges are about sufficient .o cover operation and maintenance
costs plus the recovery of public investment funds ovier 215 years at zero inter-
est rate. No contribution from beneficiaries would be required to finance the
investments in experimenta.L farms, feeder roads, marketing facilities, schools
and workshops or medical centers and neither would an annual charge be levied.
Irrigation facilities would be constructed entirely using public funds but an
annual charge, sufficient --o cover operation and maintenance and recovery of
public investment funds over the life of the works, would be collected. Selec-
tion criteria for roads would be such as to yield at Least a 10% return on
incremental investments in roads and the related rainfed agricultural develop-
ment. This would be achieved by requiring th t the expenditures on feeder
roads be linked to development of rainfed agriculture. Anly other justification
for feeder roads would require Bank approval on a case-by--case basis.
v.        Responsibility for Project plann-ing, execut:Lon and operation would
rest with the Papa'Loapan Commission, created in 1947 by Executive Resolution
of the President as an agency within the Secretaria deB Recursos Hidraulicos
(SRH). It has a good technical staff and experience :Ln doing nearly all of
the works envisaged under the Project.  It would get the assistance, if
-necessary, of other agencies involved such as Secretaria de Obras Publicas



- iii -
(SOP) for feeder roads; Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) for village
electrification; Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia (SSA) for health
centers; Comite Administrador del Programa Federal de Construccion de Escuelas
(CAPFCE) for schools; the parent ministrv of the Commission, SRH, for irriga-
tion, water supply, and sewerage; Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agri-
colas (INIA) for research; Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares
(CONASUPO) for marketing facilities; and the Fondo de Garantia in matters
dealing with credit.
vi.       Procurement of all contracts exceeding US$80,000 would be by inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.  For con-
tracts costing less than US$80,000, unit prices approved by SRH would be
acceptable, and the Commission would then select the private contractor best
qualified to do the job, or use force account, subject, however, to the
restriction that the total value of unit-price-based contracts and force
account work would not exceed 30% and, furthermore, that force account work
would not exceed 10% of total procurement costs.
vii.      The productive components would directly benefit about 152,000
people of which 124,000 would benefit from the investments in rainfed agri-
culture.  Beneficiaries of social infrastructure investments include the
following: 307,000 rural villagers would have new potable water systems;
42,000 would have new house-connected sewerage systems; 137,000 would have
new electrical service to their homes; 324,000 would be given access to
medical centers who now lack such access; 59,000 school pupils would have
new primary school classroormis or workshop facilities provided; and 106,000
villagers would have community centers built in their villages.
viii.     Of the investment expenditures, about 36% would be in labor, and
these would generate about 30,000 man-years of employment.  Furthervore,
about 13,000 permanent jobs wouICL be created directly by the Project.
ix.       The rate of return of the Project to the Mexican economy is estimated
at about 26%. Should investment costs be 20% higher, then the rate would
drop to 19%.
x.        During negotiations appropriate assurances were obtained that provide
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of UO$50.3 -zalion for 25 years, irscluding a
five-year grace period. The borrower would be Nacional Financiera, S.A. and
Government would assume tne foreign exchange risk.






MEXICO
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico has requested a Bank loan to help finance
an integrated rural development project in the Papaloapan Basin (Basin). The
proposed loan would be the first loan to Mexico for rural development. To
date, the Bank has made 37 loans to Mexico, for a total of US$1,838 million
net of cancellations. Most of these loans have been made for power, roads
and agriculture. Execution of these projects has generally been satisfactory.
The proposed project was prepared by Government with assistance from Bank and
the FAO/CP.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Mexico's overall economic performance since 1960, as judged by growth
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has been matched by few developing coun-
tries. During that time GDP, in real terms, grew at an average annual rate
of about 7.0%. From the mid-1950's to 1972 Mexico was among the few countries
in the developing world to combine a sustained high rate of growth with monetary
and balance of payments stability. During this period, the annual rate of
inflation was less than 5% and the dollar value of the peso was maintained at
the level fixed in 1954. Prospects for a continued growth rate of 6% to 7%,
however, are heavily dependent on the rapid growth of export earnings and on
external debt management, which in turn hinges on an improved fiscal position.
In recent years for instance, the deficit on current account in the balance
of payments has increased fairly rapidly, and in the past year inflation has
being running at an annual rate of about 20%.
2.02      Income distribution is very skewed in Mexico, where the top 5%
commands about 36% of national income and the lowest 40% only about 24%.
Furthermore, the share of the lowest 40% has decreased during the 1960s.
There are also great income disparities between urban and rural areas. It
is estimated that urban per capita income is about 2.7 times rural per capita
income. It is further estimated that about 40% of the population have per
capita incomes of less than US$259, equivalent to a family income of less
than about US$1,500. These may be defined as the poor.
2.03      The population of Mexico (1973), at about 56 million, is increasing
at approximately 3.4% per year and will reach about 100 million by 1990. Of
this total, 23 million, or 41%, are rural, and about 13% live in the Federal
District (FD). In 1970, the labor force was estimated at 13.1 million workers,
of which 5.1 million (39%) were in agriculture, 3.0 million (23%) in industry,



-2-
and 5.0 million (38%) in services. The net annual additLon to the labor force
is presently estimated at about 400,000. Reliable data on unemployment and
underemployment are lacking, but there is little doubt tlhat these are among
the toughest problems facing Mexico.
B.  Rural Sector
2.04      Agriculture's share of GDP has fallen from about 23% in 1950 to
approximately 11% in 1973. Nevertheless, the sector still supplies almost
all of Mexico's domestic food requirements and about 50% of the country's
merchandise export earnings. The first problem of Mexico's agriculture is its
seeming inability since about 1967 to keep pace with the growth of demand for
agricultural products. Because total domestic demand for food is projected
to increase at almost 5% per annum while agriculture is presently growing at
only about 4%, a problem exists. Because of this, Goverrment recognizes that
efforts to raise the growth rate of agriculture must be given priority in
Mexico's agricultural development strategy. This is essential, not only to
meet growing domestic demand, but also to continue agriculture's substantial
contribution to export earnings and thus help ease thLe balance of payments
constraint to growth of GDP (para 2.01). The irrigated areas now produce
about 60% of the value of crop output, and absorb the major share of the
fertilizer used. Crop output in turn accounts for about 70% of total agri-
cultural production.
2.05      The main constraints to expanding agricultural production are on
the supply side and may be summarized as follows:
(a) the weak technical capability of a very high percentage
of the people involved in agriculture, particularly rainfed,
ranging from farmer to extension and even research workers.
There are, of course, some outstanding individuals but the
generalization is still valid;
(b) the lack of access to credit, especially long-term credit,
by a large segment of producers; and
(c) the weaknesses in the production and distribution system
for fertilizers and improved seeds (para 2.10).
2.06      Maldistribution of income is the second serious problem facing
rural areas of Mexico. Of the approximately 3.9 million rural families, it
is estimated that about 65% are poor (para 2.02). Furthermore, a Mexican
study estimates that the poorest 50% of all workers in agriculture accounted
for only about 20% of the total rural income (including off-farm income),
while the top 10% accoun-L3d for about 40% of total rural income.
2.07      A growing unemployment and underemployment problem is the third
major problem of rural Mexico.  The rural population iis expected to continue
growing at 1.5% p.a. Given the limited opportunities for absorbing new



-3-
workers in the non-rural sectors, increasing attention is being focused on
the employment creation potential within rural areas, especially in agri-
culture, rural infrastructure and social services.
2.08      The agricultural population consists of two principal tenure groups,
ejidatarios and private farmers. Since it is estimated that there are about
1.5 million ejido 1/ parcels and about 1.2 million privately owned farms, about
1.2 million rural families are landless. It is estimated that if all the farm
land of Mexico were divided among the 3.9 million rural families so as to equal-
ize their incomes, then each family would be entitled to about the equivalent
in earning power of 4 ha of irrigated land under cereals.
C. Agriculture Supporting Services
2.09      Minimum support prices, administered by Compania Nacional de Sub-
sistencias Populares (CONASUPO), are offered by the Government for a number
of food products, including maize, wheat, sorghum, beans and vegetable oilseeds,
and prospects are also favorable for most of the crops not covered. In general,
the marketing system in Mexico for agricultural products functions quite effi-
ciently and adequately serves the interests of producers and consumers. How-
ever, some small farmers do not have access to the CONASUPO administered
minimum support prices and, consequently, receive much lower prices from middle-
men.
2.10.     In the marketing of agricultural inputs, Guanos y Fertlizantes, a
state body, has a virtual monopoly in the handling of fertilizers similar to
that of Productora Nacional de Semillas in the handling of improved seed. The
marketing and supply situation, as perceived by farmers, for both these inputs
is unsatisfactory, with timeliness of delivery, shortages and prices the main
problems.
2.11      Most of the crop research has been concentrated in irrigated areas,
with little being done in the more extensive rainfed regions. In spite of
progress to date, much greater efforts should be made to solve a host of very
practical problems in order to remove seriouis constraints to increased pro-
duction. The two major agricultural research institutions in Mexico are the
Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas (INIA) and the Instituto Na-
cional de Investigaciones Pecuarias (INIP). Both are located in the Secretaria
de Agricultura y Ganaderia (SAG), but there is little coordination between
them. Extension services are provided by the federal and state agricultural
extension services, various Government agencies and credit institutions, but,
in general, they have not been effective in introducing new production tech-
niques and management methods. The failure of the research establishment to
provide results suitable for implementation at the farm level is probably the
basic reason.
1/   Farmers on ejido parcels are called ejidatarios and have usufruct rights.



-4-
2.12      Farm credit is provided by official andl private credit institutions.
The Government's Banco Nacional de Credito Ejidal (Banco Ejidal) system lends
to ejidatarios, the Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola (Banco Agricola) system
concentrates on lending to s=mall-scale farmers, aLnd the banks of the Banco
Nacional Agropecuario system (BANAGROs) lend to any type farmer who is credit-
worthy. Commercial banks account for almost all private institutional lending
to the agricultural sector, but about 70% of all lending is by official insti-
tutions. The Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la Agricultura, Ganaderia y
Avicultura (FONDO) was established by Government in 1955 as a trust fund in
Banco de Mexico (BANXICO) to refinance technically evaluated loans of previously
authorized participating credit institutions and supervise implementation. It
is the executing agency for the Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Development
Project, partially financed by the Bank -- Loan 910-ME (US$110.0 million).
D. Government Policy
2.13      Mounting social pressure in the countryside and the disappointing
production performance in recent years were instrumental in causing the
Government to revamp the strategy of agricultural development. The extensive
development approach of the past has largely run its course and a more judi-
cious selection of policies and actions will be required in the future as the
more easily developed water resources in the northern coastal areas have being
exploited, the land distribution program has practicaLly come to a close, addi-
tion of new cultivated land is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive,
intensification of traditional rainfed agriculture has to be geared to farmers
far less sophisticated than those in commercial agriculture, and development
of river deltas in the southern Gulf regions raises many as yet unanswered
questions.
2.14      The present administration is attempting, through legal changes, to
strengthen the service and assistance-type agencies and to considerably expand
the public budget for rural development, including agriculture, to achieve the
objectives of increased agricultural production and imaproved income level and
general standard of living of rural people. The new Agrarian Reform Law (1971),
a new Water Law (1971), and a revision of instructions concerning the alloca-
tion of Bank credit designed to increase the flow of resources to low income
farmers and ejidatarios are measures aimed at ach:Leving the above objectives.
The main goal of the new Agrarian Law is to transform the ejido into an effi-
cient production unit by, inter alia, granting it juridicial status and the
right to contract on the same basis as other enterprises. The Department of
Agrarian Affairs and Colonization (DAAC), entrusted with the implementation of
the Agrarian Reform Law, has been handicapped in the past by staff shortages
and lack of expertise. Recently, however, it is makirtg great efforts to improve
its performance. The Federal Water Law has combined the dispersed legislation
in this field under one heading and also made it more responsive to Mexico's
needs. Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH) c:ontinues to be the central
and dominating public agency in water use. It is a sound institution.

2.15      Rural development, excluding agriculture, has not received much more
than benign neglect in Mexico over the last decades. The present administra-
tion, however, is trying to evolve a strategy for helping rural areas through
a mix of investments in productive elements, production supporting items,
and social infrastructure. During the remainder of this administration
(1970-1976), the rural sector will probably receive more public funds in rela-
tive terms than in any previous administration, except that of Cardenas.
Agricultural investment varied between 7.6% and 13.6% of total public invest-
ment during the last decade, while present plans would raise this figure to
about 18% over the period 1973-76. Irrigation continues to dominate public
investment in agriculture.
III. INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPNENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
A. Brief Project Description
3.01      The Integrated Rural Development Project I - Papalopan Basin (Project)
would develop irrigated and rainfed agriculture, experimental farms, feeder
roads, and marketing facilities to support the production effort, and social
infrastructure (potable water, sewerage, electricity, medical centers, primary
schools and workshops, and community centers), in the Basin. It would also
include technical services and credit for incremental working capital needs
of farmers (and for some on-farm fixed investments) and would be carried out
over five years.
3.02      The main objectives of the Project would be to expand food produc-
tion, improve the distribution of income by raising the income level of poor
families through provision of credit and technical services, and generally
improve the quality of life in poor villages by bringing the level of social
services available there closer to the national average.

3.04     The productive components would directly benefit about 152,000
people of which 124,000 would benefit from the investments in rainfed agri-
culture. Beneficiaries from social infrastructure include the following:
307,000 rural villagers would have new potable water systems; 42,000 would
have new house connected sewerage systems; 137,000 would have new electrical
service to their homes; 324,000 would be given access to medical centers who
now lack such access; 59,000 school pupils would have new primary school
classrooms or workshop facilities provided; and 106,000 villagers would have
community centers built in their villages. The primary executing agency would
be the Papaloapan Commission (Commission) (para 3.25).
B. Detailed Project Features
Project Area
3.05     The Project would be executed within the confines of the Basin
(Maps IBRD 11078 and 11001). The Basin, located southeast of Mexico City,
covers an area of 46,517 km2 and drains into the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower
Papaloapan Basin (Lower Basin), covers approximately 21,000 km2, or 45% of the
Basin, and lies at or below 100 m elevation, on the gently sloping and undulat-
ing lands of the coastal plains. The Upper Papaloapan Basin (Upper Basin)
covers the remaining 25,517 km2, or 55% of the area, and is comprised primarily
of mountains and canyons although it also has some productive valleys.
3.06     The following table gives some statistical comparisons for various
key socio-economic parameters between the Basin and all of Mexico.

The data show that inhabitants of the Basin have less than average access to
education, health services, electricity, sewerage, and piped water. The Basin
itself emerges as a predominantly poor, agriculturally dependent region. It
has been chosen as the Project area for these reasons, but also because it
has potential for agricultural expansion. Most of the poorer farmers are



engaged in crop production and for that reason the Project would concentrate
on crops. Livestock are a very important industry in the Basin and many
ejidatarios make their living from this activity. Since, however, the credit
and technical services provided under the Fourth Livestock Project (Loan
910-ME) are deemed adequate, livestock would receive little attention in this
Project. The long term development of the Basin would be mainly based on
rainfed agriculture with possibly some supplemental irrigation (Annex 1).
Directly Productive Components
3.07      Esperanza-Palmar de Bravo Valleys.  Under the Project, about 40 deep
wells, each serving about 60 ha farmed by a group of 10 families, would be
sunk, lined and equipped with pump and motor. The Cotmnission would own,
operate and maintain the pumps and motors and charge the farmers for the
service. Complementary canals would also be built and lined and land level-
ling would be carried out. On-farm incremental working capital, resulting
from the intensification of production, would also form part of the Project.
Prefabricated concrete canals, pumps, motors, and labor are the main invest-
ment inputs. A new irrigation district would be formed, so that it could
be operated under the provisions of the 1971 Federal Water Law. During nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained that disbursement to this region (other
than for engineering and design) would be conditional on the prior creation
of the irrigation district (Annex 2).
3.08      Rio Salado Irrigation District.  Under the Project, all the main
canals and laterals of the existing 3,600-ha systema in the upper part of the
gorge would be lined with concrete. The water saved by this and other improve-
ments of the rehabilitation program would be diverted farther down the river
and used to irrigate a new area of 2,500 ha. Cement, labor, engineering and
supervision would be the main investment inputs. On-farm incremental working
capital would also form part of the Project. While an Irrigation District
was officially established in the area by Presidential Decree in 1965, it has
never operated as such. During negotiations, however, the Bank was informed
(later confirmed by letter) that Government will operate the area from now
on as an Irrigation District (Annex 3).
3.09      Rio Blanco Irrigation District.  The only Project irrigation work
proposed for the Lower Basin would be the rehabilitation of the Rio Blanco
Irrigation District. The Project would complete all canals, laterals, and
distribution systems to enable 16,000 ha to be irrigated every year, instead
of the present 7,500 ha. Metering gates would be installed to enable District
personnel to control canal flows and farm deliveries. Land levelling and on-
farm incremental working capital would be part of the Project. Labor, cement
and water metering gates would be the main investment inputs. This District
will be very important in generating data on the economics of supplemental
irrigation in the Lower Basin (Annex 4).
3.10      Plan de Mejoramiento Parcelario (PLAMEPA).  PLAMEPA is an intensive
technical service to farmers in irrigated areas.  Technicians would train
farmers in matters related to water use, land preparation, technical inputs,
and proper timing of all operations and would be the link between the farmers
and research workers. The main investment inputs would be salaries, materials



-9_
and equipment for extension work (Annex 5). The cost of this service would
be partially financed from the proposed loan during the Project construction
period of five years (Annex 5).
3.11      Plan Papaloapan for Rainfed Agriculture (APA),  Following the
lessons and experience of Plan Puebla, an intensive technical service tp
farmers cultivating about 100,000 ha of rainfed agriculture would be organi-
zed and partially financed from the proposed loan during the Project construc-
tion period of five years. The technicians working in teams, would combine
advice in technical matters with agricultural credit. PLANPA is already
operating in the Basin on a small scale. Incremental working capital would
form part of Project costs with the main inputs under this category being
labor, improved seed and fertilizer. The main inv'stment inputs to the tech-
nical service would be salaries. Because timely delivery of credit, ferti-
lizer, and improved seed in the required quantities is crucial to the success
of PLANPA, assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government would
take all measures necessary to insure that credit, fertilizer, and improved
seed would be made available in the Project area in the quantities and at
the time required to fully utilize the other resources available. Assurances
were also obtained that the Commission would recruit staff under PLANPA so as
to at least satisfy a schedule agreed upon with the Bank (Annexes 6 and 7),,
Production Support Components
3.12      Experimental Farms.  Applied crop research in the Basin promises
to be very rewarding and beneficial to farmers there. Research data on
varieties of crops, fertilizer response in different ecological zones of
the Basin, and many problems inevitably encountered in a development pro-
gram, would provide a basis for the long-term planning and development of
the Basin. Three experimental farms would be supported under the Project in
zones where none now exist, two in the Upper Basin and one in the Lower Basin.
The main investment inputs would be salaries and research miaterials. Rainfed
agriculture would be the area of concentration (Annex 8).
3.13      Feeder Roads.  The feeder road program would be closely integrated
with the other Project components but especially with PLANPA tpara 3.28).
The main input into feeder road construction would be labor (Annex 9).
3.14        arketing Facilities.  Shortage of storage facilities needed for
the marketing of agricultural inputs and production is an impediment to
expanding production in some parts of the Basin. In the main producing areas
such facilities would be constructed under the Project where they are now
lacking or deficient. CONASUPO would generally operate such facilities.
Social Infrastructure Components
3.15      The general objective under this part of the Project would be to
bring the level of social services available within the Basin closer to
national averages, and to encourage more people to live in villages where
such services may more easily be provided.  Since towns with populations
larger than 5,000 (29% of Basin population) are fully serviced, the Project
would concentrate on those with between 5C0 and 5,000 inhabitants (49% of



- 10 -
Basin population). Selection criteria for the social :infrastructure compo-
nents are further discussed in paragraphs 3.29 to 3.34. For potable water,
the goal would be to provide it to all villages larger than 2,500, to 50% of
those with populations between 1,000 and 2,500, and a third of those with
populations between 500 and 1,000 that presently lack t:his service. In some
of the larger villages and towns, piped water would be provided to those
willing and able to cover the costs involved, while the smaller villages
would generally rely on water hydrants. This would entail constructing water
facilities in about 260 villages. Since the sewerage program is modest, only
about 12 towns with between 1,000 and 5,000 people would be serviced. For
electricity, the goal would be to provide it to 50% of villages larger than
2,500, to 25% of those with populations between 1,000 and 2,500, and to about
12% of those with population between 500 and 1,000 that: presently lack such
service. In total, electricity would be given to about 106 villages or towns.
Medical facilities would be built in about 185 villages, thereby providing them
to all small towns with between 1,500 and 5,000 people and to about 50% of the
villages with populations between 1,000 and 1,500 that presently lack them.
The health centers would have three beds for emergency and maternity care and
would be manned by a student doctor and nurse. The Project would build about
1,185 workshops or prefabricated classrooms, which would be about sufficient
to meet the shortage of classroom space for primary education (first-four
grades) in villages and towns of between 500 and 5,000 inhabitants and provide
workshops where needed.  Most of these classrooms would be additions to existing
schools or replace buildings knocked down by the 1973 earthquake in the Upper
Basin. Many of the pupils and tradesmen graduating from these schools would
have to leave their area in search of work. About 141 community centers would
be constructed in villages of between 500 and 1,000 inhabitants where potable
water supply by means of water hydrants exists. ThLe community centers would
consist of premises for village meetings, washing clothes on slabs, public
showers and toilets; an area for sports; and other such amenities.
3.16      The main inputs to these Project componerLts would be labor, cement,
reinforcing steel, prefabricated superstructures, aLnd engineering and super-
vision (Annexes 10 to 15).
Project Monitoring
3.17      A monitoring system would be established to evaluate Project progress
(para 3.35). The main input would be labor (Annex 16).
C. Cost Estimates
3.18      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$138.5 million of
which US$22.5 million, or 16%, represents foreign exchange requirements,
assuming that contracts would be won by local contractors. Costs have been
estimated at July 1974 prices, and a physical contingency of 15% and a price
contingency of 56% of base-line costs have been added. Inflation from July
to the end of 1974 is projected at about 7%; in 1975 at 15%; and thereafter
at 12%; and are in line with expectations of price increases in Mexico
(Annex 17). Project costs are summarized below:

/1   Incremental working capital would not be financecl from the proposed loan
since it is eligible for financing from existing Bank loan 910-NE.
Incremental working capital would be financed as follows: (a) producers
US$0.9 million (5%); (b) Government US$8.5 million (47%); and (c) the Bank
US$8.6 million (48%) from Loan 910-ME. The other Project components would be
financed from three sources:  (a) the Bank loan of US$50.0 million, or 41%,
would finance all the foreign exchange costs (US$21.2 million, or about 17%
of Project cost, excluding incremental working capital) and 29% of the local
currency costs (US$28.8 million, or about 24% of P'roject cost, excluding
incremental working capital); (b) Government would contribute US$60.3 million,
or 50%; and (c) beneficiaries US$10.2 million, or 9% (see paras 3.30 to 3.34).
While a 20% beneficiary contribution to schools and workshops is expected, it
would not be required. Assurances on this sharing of initial investment
financing were obtained during negotiations.
3.20      The loan would be made to Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFIN), at the
current Bank lending rate at the time of loan approval, for 25 years, including
five years of grace. Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations.



- 13 -
E. Procurement
3.21      The Project would include a diversity of relatively small construc-
tion jobs in many locations over a wide area and would involve numerous Govern-
ment agencies for execution of the works. The primary executing agency, the
Commission, would follow SRH (its parent Ministry) policies and procedures
for contracting, and would require conformance by other agencies.
3.22      In the procurement of goods and services the following procedures
would be followed:
(a)  the Commission would endeavor, where feasible, to group
contracts together in order to obtain more competition in
bidding;
(b)  for all contracts, other than those for consultants,
estimated to cost US$80,000 or more, international competi-
tive bidding following Bank Guidelines for Procurement would
be required; and
(c)  for all contracts, other than those for consultants, esti-
mated to cost less than US$80,000, unit prices approved by
SRH would be acceptable, and the Commission would then select
the private contractor best qualified to do the job, subject
to the restriction that the total value of unit price based
contracts and force account work would not exceed 30% and,
furthermore, that force account work would not exceed 10% of
the total cost of the goods and services to be financed out
of the proceeds of the loan. The cost of engineering, design
and supervision of construction, and the salaries of staff
employed on experimental farms, on technical assistance, and
monitoring would not be included in computing the contracts
awarded at unit prices or under force account.
3.23      The Commission would also submit for Bank approval its final plans
and budgets for each of the three irrigation areas (Esperanza-Palmar de
Bravo, Rio Salado, and Rio Blanco) prior to the award of any construction
contract in that area. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
under the Project procurement procedures would be as outlined in paragraph
3.22, and that construction would not start in any of the three irrigation
areas until the Government and Bank shall have agreed on final plans and
budgets for each such area.
F. Disbursements
3.24      The Bank would disburse against 41% of investment expenditures by
the executing agency for civil works, equipment, technical assistance (includ-
ing salaries of technical personnel on experimental farms) provided for under
any or all parts of the Project except for water systems based on household



- 14 -
connections, sewerage, and electricity where the percenLtages would be 46, 50,
and 48, respectively. The higher percentages for the later three components
are actually equivalent to 41% of the total investment cost in these components,
but since householders themselves would build part of the facilities within
their households, the Bank would finance a correspondingly higher percentage
of the work done by the public agency involved. Any undisbursed loan funds
remaining after Project completion would be cancelled. Since the construction
period is five years (Annex 17), loan disbursements are also expected to occur
over about five years (Annex 18).
G. Organization and Management
Background
3.25      The primary executing agency, the Commission, was established as
a semi-autonomous Government institution by Executive Resolution of the
President of the Republic of Mexico on February 26, 1947, to promote the
integrated development of the Basin. On December 19, 1951, the Resolution
was enacted into law and authorized the Commission to plan, design, and
construct all types of public works. It can also operate in the industrial,
agricultural, and settlement fields when such activities are carried out in
connection with integrated development of the Basin. The President of the
Commission is the Minister of SRH, and is responsible for planning, general
policy formulation, supervision, and coordination of po:Licy with other
Ministries and agencies of the Government. The Vocal Ejecutivo, the official
representative of SRH, is the chief executive officer and is responsible for
execution of the policies approved by the President. Under the new (1974)
organizational structure, management has been streamlined according to func-
tional responsibilities. In August 1973, the Commission had a total staff
of about 620. Of this number, 170 were professiona:L staff (27%), 100 being
civil and 35 agricultural engineers. The Commission obtains its funds through
appropriations in the Federal Expenditure Budget.  The annual appropriations
appear as a single item in the SRH budget.  The Commission was one of the
first to start rural development in Mexico and over the years, it has devoted
itself to doing things closely akin to the type of activities planned under
the Project (Annex 19).
Project Organization
3.26      The Commission would be responsible for carrying out the Project
with the assistance, if necessary, of other appropriate Government agencies.
Other agencies which might be involved include Secretaria de Obras Publicas
(SOP) for roads; Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) for village electri-
fication; Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia (SSA) for health centers;
Comite Administrador del Programa Federal de Construccion de Escuelas (CAPFCE)
for schools; SRH, in aspects of irrigation, water supply, and sewerage;
CONASUPO for marketing facilities; INIA for experimental farms; and the FONDO
in matters pertaining to agricultural credit. The Commission would provide
technical and organizational assistance to villages where social infrastructure
would be developed. This assurance was obtained during negotiations.



- 15 -
3.27      A Project Director has been appointed to manage the day-to-day
operations of the Project under the general direction of the Vocal Ejecutivo.
He would be particularly concerned with coordination within the Commission
and with ensuring that the Project is carried out as agreed between the Bank
and the Commission.
Selection Cr:iteria for Feeder Roads and Social Infrastructure
3.28      Feeder Roads,  It is in the selection of feeder roads for develop-
tnent under the Project that the concept of "integrated rural development" would
best manifest itself because the feeder road program would almost exclusively
be dictated by the reqluirements of PLANPA. It is assumed that the minimum
desired quantified return on investment in feeder roads and complementary rain-
fed agricultural development is in the neighborhood of 10%. Given this assump-
tion, and providing that the road is necessary to development of a block o.f.
land, then, in the lIpper Basin, up to a maximum of US$23,000, and in the Lower
Basin, up to a maximum 9f US$86,000 may be expended on feeder roads for each.
block of 100 ha 'f agriialtural land developed under PLANPA.  Any other justi
fication for feeder roa4 construction in a particular area would require the
prior approval of the "nk.  Assurances on the above were obtained duritig
negotiations. >t 
3.29      Social inf          re. In the development of social infrastructure,
ceteris 2ar:ibus, pridti. y would be given to areas of the Basin where directly
productive Project c    nents are under development.  During negotiationss
assurances were obt       that this principle woul]d be applied in Project imple-
mentation.
3.30      Water Systems,.  A water system based on hydrants would be considered
for a particular vil-la* only if the per capita investment cost of the systemr
was less than US$40., Villagers would also be required at the outset to con-
tribute at least 20%M of the investment cost, and show evidence of an organi-
zational structure capable thereafter of collecting sufficient annual reveriues
to cover operationi and maintenanice (public funds invested in such systems
would not be recovered).  Villages desiring a water system based on household
connections would have to show similar evidence on organizational matters,
contribute at the ouitset the cost of household connections and be preparerd to
finance all investments required within households, and also be prepared
thereafter to pay an annual charge sufficient to cover operatiorn and maiUnE--
nance and recover the public funds invested in the system over 25 years at
zero interest rate. (In w.ater systems based on household connections, about
34% of the initial investment cost financing would be contributed by the
beneficEiaries, and the remaining 66% would come from public funds.) Assur-
ances on the above selection criteria and charges were obtained during nego-
tiations.
3.31      Sewe.rge.  As with water systems based on household connections,
households wanting a house-connected sewerage system would have to finance
all investments within households (22% of total investments in sewerage), and
be prepared thereafter to pay an annual charge sufficient to cover operation
and maintenancei,nd recovery of public ftnds invested in the system over
25 years at zero interest rate. Appropriate assurances were obtained during
negotiations.



- 16 -
3.32      Electricity.  The investment cost per capita including transmission
from the main power grid to any village and distribution within the village
to consumers, would be subject to an upper limit of US$75. Households wanting
electrical service would have to be prepared to pay, the costs of all wiring
and fixtures within their households (about 14% of total investment cost in
electrical systems), and thereafter pay an annual charge that would be fixed
in accordance with the rates for electricity applied generally in Mexico.
(Based on the cost estimates of Annex 12, charges as presently fixed allow
for covering operation and maintenance and recovery of public funds invested
over about 25 years at zero interest rate). Assurances on the above were
obtained during negotiations.
3.33      Schools and Medical Centers.  The basic criterion that would need
to be satisfied in the selection of villages for schools, workshops, and
medical centers is that the required professionals would be available to
operate each facilities after construction. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.
3.34      Community Centers.  The principal selection criteria would be that
the per capita investment cost be less than US$20, the community desire the
facility and express that desire through a capital contribution of at least
20% of the cost, and, in addition, that the village have an organization
capable of maintaining the facilities from revenues collected within the
village. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Monitoring
3.35      Since one of the objectives of the Project is to generate data on
rural development, it was assured during negotiations that the Commission
would, in consultation with the Bank, establish a system to monitor Project
progress and costs, and gather data to evaluate the soundness of the tech-
nical, financial, and economic assumptions used in the appraisal of the
Project.
H. Accounting and Auditing`
3.36      The Commission's Accounts Department has two sections, one responsible
for maintenance of the account and payment systemsgi-and the other for examina-
tion of documents relating to disbursement. All vouchers, supported by neces-
sary documents, are checked and approved by the Vocal Secretario before. payments
are made to ensure that expenditures are properly incurred and sanctioned by
appropriate authority. All contracts and orders gr,eater than US$16,000 must
be signed by Commission Members and approved by the Minister of SRH. They
must also be registered with the Secretaria del Patrimonio National, whose
approval is required before disbursement can be made.
3.37      The Commission's account is audited under the supervision of the
Administrative Director. The Controller's Office of SRIl and 'the General
Accounting Office of the Secretaria de Hacienda also review accounts, and
the Secretaria de la Presidencia and the Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional
can perform field audits as they desire.



X 17 -
3.38      Separate Project accounts, covering disbursements, revenues, cost
recoveries and repayments, and showing all Project transactions made by the
Commission with funds provided by the Government, the Bank, and other finan-
cial contributors would be maintained by the Commission. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that these separate accounts would be maintained
and audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing principles consis-
tently applied, by independent auditors designated in accordance with the laws
of the Government, and that the auditors report would reach the Bank within
six months of the close of the Commission's fiscal year.
IV. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
4.01      A wide range of crops would be produced by farms participating in
the Project. Farmers are expected to shift to the most profitable crops as
farming conditions change. However, the most significant increases (relative
to present national output) are likely to occur in beans, 1%; rice, 6%; soy-
beans, 8%; and peppers, about 5%.
4.02      Most of the maize, wheat, barley, potatoes, and beans produced
by the Project would be consumed locally, either in the local towns and
villages or for subsistence. The alfalfa would readily be absorbed by the
expanding dairy industry in the Basin, while the sweet corn, green peppers,
vegetables, and fruits would find a market in neighboring towns and Mexico
City. In summary, due to the flexibility in production possible in the
Basin, no serious marketing problems are foreseen.
4.03      A summary of producer benefits, derived from representative models
of production, is given in the following table:

- 18 -
4.04      The average family income of farmers expected to participate in the
Project would be much lower than the income level lpreviously used to define
the poor on a national basis (para. 2.02). Average farm size of Project
participants would range from a low of about 1.5 ha in Rio Salado to about
11 4 ha in Rio Blanco Irrigation District. In PLANPA, average farm size of
participants would be about 4 to 5 ha. Tne incremental financial rates of
return shown above should be sufficiently high to make on-farm investments
attractive (Annex 20).
4.05      The question of an appropriate level of water charges in irrigation
districts would be handled under the Project in accordance with the provisions
of the new (1971) Water Law which requires a socio-economic study prior to
fixing the charges. Assurances to this effect were obtained during nego-
tiations. On the basis of cost and other assumptions given in Annexes 2 to
4, it would appear reasonable to fix water charges at a level sufficient to
cover operation and maintenance and to recover all incremental public invest-
ment under the Project at 7.6% p.a. over a period of 15 to 25 years, depending
principally on the income level of the beneficiaries.
V. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The economic rate of return of the Project is estimated at approxi-
mately 26% when all Project components are treated as rLecessary in order to
obtain the quantified Project benefits (Annex 21). Should investment costs
be 20% higher than expected, then the economic rate of return would be 19%.
It is clear that the production (irrigated and rainfed agricultural develop-
ment) and productive support components (experimental farms, feeder roads and
marketing facilities) of the Project are essential inputs to achieve the
agricultural benefits, because investments in these components would be made
only to the extent that they are necessary to achieve such benefits. The
rationale for regarding social infrastructure investments as integral parts
of the Project is not as clear cut. There is evidence, however, based on
experience in some other areas of Mexico, to support the belief that acceptance
and continued use of improved agricultural practices among low income people
is closely linked to concurrent improvement in the "quality of life" as they
themselves perceive it. In the Basin, the people have consistently ranked
potable water, electricity, medical centers, and schools as basic to improving
their standard of living. The increased purchasing power resulting from in-
creases in production might not be viewed as sufficient incentive if the people
involved were not capable of improving the "quality of their life" in a sub-
stantial way. Infant mortality rates in the Basin are very high and dirty
water is a principal cause. The ability to read and write is probably a
prerequisite to meaningful participation in the present-day Mexican economy.
Electricity is highly valued, probably in part because it is a status symbol
among poor rural people. It is expected that the President's program of
"Responsible Parenthood" will find expression in the Basin through Government's
efforts to use the medical centers as focal points for the introduction of
family planning. Since these services are generally provided by the public
sector in Mexico, they would be handled similarly in the Project. The ability
to obtain access to these services is crucial to maintaining incentives on the
production side.



- 19 -
5.02      Excluding the social infrastructure components, tbh  ecornoraic rate
of return would be about 65% if there is no decrease in production as a result.
Service charges may be used as proxies for economic benefits and as such re-
present lower bounds to such benefits. Using the cost estimates of Annexes
10 to 12 and service charges as proxies for economic benefits, water systems
based on household connections, sewerage, and electricity would yield zero
percent return on public capital invested. The quantified net benefits
stream from water hydrants represents a negative return on public capital
invested. The situation is similar for schools and medical and community
centers. It is important to note, however, that in all these cases the
economic and social benefits far exceed those captured in the quantified
benefit stream as measured by service charges.
5.03      Of the investment expenditures, about 36% would be on labor,
generating about 30,000 man-years of employment. Furthermore, about 13,000
permanent jobs would be directly created under the Project.
5.04      After completion, the Project would require Government expendi-
tures to operate and maintain the non-revenue earning components. These
expenditures would approximate US$9 million equivalent annually at full
development, with schools accounting for about 29%, medical facilities for
about 25%, agricultural technical services for about 18%, roads for about
17%, and other components for the balance. The incremental taxes accruing
to Government from the incremental Project agricultural production is esti-
mated at about US$1.0 million.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a)  disbursements to the Esperanza-Palmar de Bravo irrigation area
would be conditional on the prior creation of an irrigation
district there (para. 3.07);
(b)  it would take all measures necessary to insure that credit,
fertilizer, and improved seed would be made available in the
Project area in the quantities and at the time required to fully
utilize the other resources available; and that staff would be
hired for PLANPA on a schedule agreed with the Bank (para. 3.11);
(c)  the cost sharing given in paragraph 3.19 would be followed;
(d)  the procurement procedures outlined in paragraph 3.22 would be
adhered to;
(e)  it would submit for Bank approval the final plan and budgets
for each of the three irrigation areas prior to the award of
any construction constracts in each such area (para 3.23);



- 20 -
(f)  technical and organizational assistance 1would be provided to
towns and villages where social infrastruLcture would be.
developed (para 3.26);
(g) the selection criteria for feeder roads specified in
paragraph 3.28 would be followed;
(h)  for social infrastructure components it would apply the
selection criteria and charges detailed in paragraphs
3.29 to 3.34;
(i)  Project progress would be monitored (para 3.35); and
(j)  separate Project Accounts would be maintained and audited
as detailed in paragraph 3.38.
6.02      With the indicated assurances, the Project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$50.0 million equivalent: for a term of 25 years,
including five years of grace.

MEXICO
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
The Papaloapan River Basin
A. Location and Natural Features
1.        Located southeast of Mexico City, the Papaloapan River Basin (Basin)
covers an area of 46,517 km2 and drains into the Gulf of Mexico in the central
part of the sweeping arc of the Mexican coastline as it extends from Texas to
the top of the Yucatan peninsula. Some 51% of the area is in the State of
Oaxaca, 37% in the State of Veracruz, and 12% in the State of Puebla.
2.        Elevations range from sea level up to the highest point in Mexico,
the crest of Mount Orizaba (Volcano Citlaltepeti), with an elevation of
5,757 m above sea level, on the most northern boundary of the basin. Approxi-
mately 21,000 sq km, or 45%, of the basin, lie at or below elevation 100 m, on
the gently sloping and undulating lands of the coastal plains. The remaining
25,517 km2, or 55%, consist primarily of mountains and canyons, but there are
several productive valley areas in this otherwise generally rugged region.
The lands below 100 m are frequently referred to as "The Lower Papaloapan
Basin" (Lower Basin), with the lands above that elevation being termed "The
Upper Papaloapan Basin" (Upper Basin).
3.        For Project purposes, the Basin can be considered as comprising
five geographic regions, each with differing physical and climatic features.
Table 1 summarizes these features.
4.        The average stream flow runoff from the river network of the Basin
is the second highest in the country, averaging about 47,000 million m3 per
year, all flowing into the Gulf of Mexico through the Laguna de Alvarado.
The Papaloapan river carries most of this water. While it officially begins
only where the Tonto and the Santo Domingo rivers join at the upper edges of
the Lower Basin, the Papaloapan river has its farthest origins in the Sierra
Madre de Oaxaca. This great river is a valuable resource for agricultural
and industrial water supplies, for hydroelectric power, and for navigation in
its lower reaches, but at the same time it frequently is a scourge, flooding
large areas in the Lower Basin. In 1969 some 340,000 ha were flooded, causing
estimated damages of Mex$443 million.
B. Socio-Economic Aspects
5.        The most recent data on population and income come from the General
Census of 1970 and related studies made about the same time. This information
was collected and compiled by the Mexican Government within the boundaries of



ANNEX 1
Page 2
political units such as cities, municipalities, districts, and states, rather
than geographical boundaries. The Papaloapan Commission has modified census
data with supplemental local information where practicable to present it in the
most meaningful form for Project purposes.  Table 2 is a simnary of some of the
key indicators of social and economic development in the Basin, while Table 3
shows the distribution of population by srate.
6.        In Table 2, the total number of named population centers is shown
as 3,319, of which 3,223 (97.1%) contained less than 2,500 persons in 1970.
Many of these had less than 10 to 25 persons. Table 4 gives a further break-
down of communities by population numbers.
7.        The rural population estimate of 1,240,000 persons shown in Tables
2 and 3 is based on the arbitrary limit of 2,499 persons for a rural community.
While this limit was convenient for use in the past by Mexican census analysts,
the Mexican government now is aware that there are many communities which are
truly rural even though they have larger populatiorns than that limit. This
is definitely true in the Basin. It is interesting to note that only 11
communities have more than 15,000 persons: one of these (Tehuacan) is in
Puebla State; two (Tuxtepec and Loma Bonita) are in Oaxaca State; and the
remaining eight are in the State of Veracruz (Acayucan, Alvarado, Ciudad
Mendoza, Cordoba, Cosamaloapan, Orizaba, San Andres Tuxtla, and Teirra Blanca).
8.        The following table gives some statistical comparisons for various
key socio-economic parameters between the Basin and all of Mexico.

The data show that the Basin is an area wnose inhabitants have less than
average access to education, health services, electricity, sewerage and
piped water, and that _t is a predominantlv poor, agriculturally dependent
region.

C. Agriculture
General
9.        Three distinct types of environments dominate the resource base
for agricultural development in the Basin: the Sierras of the Upper Basin,
the valleys of the Upper Basin and the coastal plains of the Lower Basin.
The differences between the Upper and Lower Basins, in term of topography,
can be gleaned from the following table:
Upper Basin
Slopes of   C   25%         = 41%
Slopes of  >    25%         = 59%
Lower Basin
Bodies of water             = 11%
Flat (slopes of<10%)        = 89%
The high Sierras (cold and wet), currently subject to low demographic pressure,
are covered by mountainous pine forests. They are located at elevations
varying from 2,500 to 5,700 m above sea level and have annual rainfall ranging
between 2,000 and 4,000 mm. The low Sierras, Mixtecas (temperate and semi-arid)
have been supporting high demographic pressure, but, currently, due to
accelerated erosion, intensified by resource mismanagement, many of the people
are leaving to move to the cities. At elevations ranging from 800 to 2,500,
the area is characterized by a type of topography and aridity (average annual
rainfall varying between 400 and 800 mm) which permits formation of rangelands
suitable for extensive grazing.
10.       The valleys of the Upper Basin (temperate and semi-arid), with a
subsistence type of agriculture based on monoculture of corn, are also
suffering high demographic pressure. These valleys are located at elevations
varying from 600 to 2,400 m, having annual rainfall between 400 and 800 mm,
the distribution of which, in the most favorable areas, can barely support
annual crops during one growing season each year.
11.       The coastal plains of the Lower Basin (hot and humid) have an
average annual rainfall between 1,300 and 3,000 mm with irregular seasonal
and cylical patterns, which, during most years, is enough to satisfy major
water needs of annual crops during one season per year. The plains, currently
subject to the least demographic pressure in the Basin, represent about 45%
of the total area and contain the largest blocks of the best lands with the
highest potential for agricultural development. However, they are subject to
seasonal and cylical floods due to torrential rains, runoff or overflow of the
tributaries of the Papaloapan river. In this region, agricultural production
could be increased by expanding areas, increasing productivity and shifting
to higher value crops.

Crops
13.       Agriculture in the Basin is predominantly based on single cropping
under rainfed conditions. The bulk of the cropping is currently carried out
on approximately 100,000 farms and ejido units (710,000 iha), giving occupation
to about 600,000 persons, or 12% of the total agriculturally active population.
While subsistence agriculture is the prevailing farming system in the Upper
Basin, traditional agriculture based on the use of antiquated methods is
dominant in the Lower Basin. However, this situation is changing for the
better. Under "Plan Papaloapan," results obtained by applying agricultural
principles based on the right package of inputs and the technical knowledge
of how to use it are exceeding expectations. The proposed Project would
follow similar principles (Annexes 6 and 7). At the top of the farmLng
structure, less than one-tenth of the farmers are applying modern technology
such as the use of improved seed, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and
weed and pest controls as wel' as farming practices :Leading to crop diversi-
fication which would permit profitable marketing of their produce.
14.       About 90% of the cultivated land (or 640,000 ha) is devoted to corn,
sugarcane, coffee, beans, rice, fruits and chillies, primarily on the basis of
only one crop per year. Some 260,000 ha are in perennial crops (sugarcane,
coffee and fruits). Only about 25,000 ha are currently being irrigated where
some double-cropping is being practiced, giving a zropping intensity higher
than 100%. The current (1973) situation related to cropping patterns and
production is summarized below.

D. Livestock
General
15.       Of the total land resources available in the Basin, between 1.5 and
2 million ha may be classified as grazing land (the figure quoted by the
Papaloapan Commission is 1.3 million ha). Census data of 1970 indicate that
livestock numbers were as follows (in thousands):
Cattle          1,725
Sheep             497
Goats             632
Pigs              832
Poultry        19,600
Total value of production of the animal production sector in 1970 amounted to
Mex$ 1,652 million (US$132 million).
Beef Cattle
16.       While from 1960 to 1970, the number of cattle in the Basin increas-
ed 2.5 times (average annual increase of 10%), indicators for productivity
and efficiency illustrate the need for improvement: extraction rates for
cattle in the Puebla and Veracruz State portions of the Basin are only 12.8 and
14.2%, respectively, while calving rates for the total Basin are estimated at



ANNEX 1
Page 6
62% and calf mortality at 6%, resulting in a low 56% reproductive rate.  Only
through better feeding, combined with the introduction of basic techniques such
as selection of bulls, adjustment of number of bulls, closed mating seasons,
early weaning, better care of breeding cows before the mating season, and
culling of unproductive cows, can such efficiency indices be improved. At
the same time, improvements in sanitary conditions (control of external and
internal parasites, which are largely water-borne, and. other specifically
tropical diseases) are required.
Dairy
17.       No reliable data exist on the number of dairy cattle nor on the
distribution of dairy herds in the Basin, but pub]ished estimates indicate
that the major production areas are found in the Veracruz portion of the
Basin, while in the Upper Basin an incipient dairy industry exists in the
North (Tehuacan-Cordoba-Orizaba area). The total number of milking cows,
computed from total recorded milk production, and average productivity per
cow is as follows:
Milk Produced (1970) Averatge Production No. of Milking
('000 liters)        (litters/cow)      Cows (implied)
Oaxaca portion                 39,000                  450              86,666
Puebla portion                   6,000                 720               8,333
Veracruz portion              110,000                  540             203,703
Basin                         155,000                  519             298,702
18.       The total value of production of the dairy sector in 1970 amounted
to Mex$217.6 million and accordingly accounted for 25% of the value of
production of the combined beef and dairy industry and for 13% of the value
of production in the animal sector. Oxaca, Puebla and Veracruz areas
contributed Mex$54.6 million, Mex$90 million and Mex$154.0 million,
respectively.
Small Livestock (Sheep, Goats and Swine)
19.       Approximately 400,000 sheep and 500,000 goats graze the arid and
semi-arid, frequently rocky and eroded, shrublands and Juniperus-Oak forests
in the Central and Southwestern sector of the Upper Basin (Zongolica and
Mixteca areas). Some 70,000 goats and an equal number of sheep reportedly
populate the Veracruz portion of the Basin.
20.       The share of each of these sub-sectors in value of production of the
total animal industry sector is only 2%. Management iis grossly inadequate,
both of the land and of the animals, which graze the mainly communally owned
lands in mixed herds of sheep, goats and cattle, cared for mostly by women or
children. No information is available on actual stocking rates or on grazing
capacity, but serious overgrazing is evident throu,ghoult the area. The major
role of the animals in the local economy is that they represent a walking bank
account to the people.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
21.       Research and technical assistance are urgently needed and should
concentrate on the reduction of numbers and adjustment of stocking rates and
grazing systems to the actual carrying capacity of the degraded lands.
22.       Pigs, although not very conspicuous in the area, represent about
14% (or Mex$223.4 million) of the total value of production of the animal
sector, according to available statistics. The total number in the Basin is
some 830,000 and the greatest density is found in the Veracruz portion, with
27 swine per km2, compared to 22 and 10 in the Puebla and Oaxaca portion. In
number of swine per 1,000 inhabitants, the Oaxaca and Veracruz portions each
have 418, the Puebla portion, 365.
23.       The fact that the diet of the local population is seriously lacking
in animal protein, and that pigs, apart from producing multiple size litters,
are relatively efficient in converting feed into weight gains, warrants
attention in future research programs. Feed grains, certain pulses and tuber-
crops could be produced in the tropical lowlands of the Basin under rainfed
conditions.
Poultry
24.       More than 80% of all poultry is concentrated in the Upper Basin.
The total value of production for the sector is over Mex$500 million, roughly
one-fourth of which is from the sale of broiler chickens, both to Mexico City
and the U.S. The remainder is accounted for by the sale of eggs.
25.       Over the last 10 years, the industry has virtually become a monopoly
in the hands of one family that owns between 15 and 20 million chickens in the
vicinity of Tehuacan. This single-family enterprise buys dried and ground
alfalfa (harina de alfalfa) from local growers and drying facilities at a price
of Mex$1,000 per ton. Limestone quarries provide the calcium required in the
diet of the hens, as well as low-grade marble used for manufacturing ornamental
inlays. The family also has its own slaughterhouse and packing plant.
26.       Apart from chicken meat and eggs, the firm has developed another
interesting sideline: it produces and sells chicken manure ("gallinaza") in
fresh or partly decomposed form, and, lately, also in ground form and bagged.
The measure is widely applied throughout the region as fertilizer for both
annual and perennial crops, such as sugarcane and alfalfa. The price at the
plant is Mex$100 per ton.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAkPALOAPAN BASIN
Esperanza-Palmar de Bravo Irrigation Area
Agriculture
1.        Current agricultural production in the temperate and semi-arid
valleys of La Esperanza and Palmar de Bravo (2,000 to 2,400 m above sea
level with about 600 to 800 mm of annual rainfall) is based on rainfed
agriculture. Out of the 12,000 ha currently cultivated, only 2,000 are
irrigated, using groundwater resources. Rainfed agriculture produces only
one crop per year, while irrigation permits double cropping and permanent
crops. The Project would bring an additional 2,4-00 ha under irrigation
(40 wells), changing the cropping pattern and substantially increasing
cropping intensity; in addition, it would improve productivity on the
2,000 ha already irrigated as well as on the remaining rainfed area.
2.        Under the Project, about 40 rainfed farms of 60 ha each would
be irrigated and developed to benefit about 400 fanilies. The Papaloapan
Commission (Commission) (Annex 19) would own and operate the pumps in the
deep tube wells which would be necessary for the irrigELtion. Main features
of the on-farm works, such as land leveling and cornstrtLction of the water
distribution system, would also be carried out by the Commission, working
in close cooperation with the farmers, Plan de Mejoramiento Parcelario
(PLAMEPA) (Annex 5), and technicians of the participating banks under the
on-going Livestock and Agriculture Development Project (Loan 910-ME).
Additionally, technicians would assist each group of 1Ci families per improved
farm in agricultural and livestock production matters. Farms would be pre-
dominantly devoted to perennial crops such as alfalfa and fruit trees, with
a minor area under beans, corn, and high value vegetables, the latter double
cropped. Perennials treated as single crops would bring the cropping inten-
sity, at full development, to 107%.
3.        Under the Project, the newly irrigated area and the improved
existing irrigated area, totalling about 4,400 ha, would form the basis for
establishment of a new irrigation district in La Esperanza-Palmar de Bravo,
in accordance with the bylaws of the new Federal Waiter and Agrarian Reform
Law.
Water Supply
4.        The two valleys contain no surface streams of any size but are
underlain by groundwater basins which would supply water for the Project.
In 1973 there were 144 wells in the two valleys; 108 in the Palmar de Bravo



ANNEX 2
Page 2
valley, and 36 in la Esperanza valley. Additional wells have been drilled,
especially in the Palmar de Bravo area, since the 1973 survey, primarily
by private landowners, for irrigating formerly rainfed lands.
5.        The groundwater is of good quality for irrigation in most locations.
To prevent the groundwater basins from being depleted too rapidly, both basins
would be included in the new irrigation district to be formed for the Project
(para 3). The district would have full regulatory power to limit extractions
and to improve water charges on groundwater pumped, if necessary.
Irrigation System
6.        Under the Project, each 60-ha farming unit would be served by
one deep well having a capacity of 75 lps. The wells would be about 150 m
deep, and pump from a static level 20 m to 60 m below ground surface. Pumps
and motors of from 100 to 150 hp capacity would be needed. For an overall
crop consumptive use requirements of 1.2 m depth of water per year and an
irrigation efficiency of 70%, each pump would have to operate 3,800 hours per
year. Since electric power is available throughout the area, motors would be
electrical.
7.        Water would be conveyed to the various fields in the unit through
pre-cast rectangular concrete channels. All fields would be leveled so that
surface irrigation could be performed efficiently.
Operations
8.        The entire system of wells and canals would be operated by Commission
personnel for the new irrigation district. Water charges would be established
by Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH) in accordance with the new Federal
Water Law of 1971, to recover all operating costs and the investment as deter-
mined by periodic socio-economic studies. Technical and financial summaries
are in Tables 1 to 4.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOP1MENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Rio Salado Irrigation District
General
1.        The Rio Salada Irrigation District lies south of Tehuacan in the
relatively narrow valley of the Poblano-Oazquena gorge. Irrigated, or poten-
tial irrigable, lands lie on both sides of the river as it flows southward.
The District embraces a complex of small independent irrigation systems, each
with its own diversion dam or intake and canal system for water distribution.
The diversions are located on the Rio Salado and its principal tributaries.
The Rio Salado acts as a collector of the natural drainage of the gorge.
2.        Irrigation has a very long history in the valley, and the present
water users follow old standards and customs, which, combined with 250 km
of badly-located, poorly-maintained, unlined canals and the virtual absence
of distribution devices, result in extremely inefficient water use. Gross
diversions from the river are equivalent to more than 6 m depth of water on
the irrigated land, while a very liberal allocation of water actually needed
would be between 2 and 3 m depth.
3.       WMile an Irrigation District was officially established in the area
by Presidential Decree in 1965, the District has never operated as such and
has not been assigned a number or in any way operated by the Secretaria de
Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH) or the Papaloapan Commission (Commission).  SRH
has provided some technical assistance and built 16 masonry diversion dams to
replace old stone and timber dams used by the farners. The various indepen-
dent systems have continued to operate under locaL customs and rules.
4.        Physiographically, the District can be divided into two sectors.
The northern part, which is the flatter of the two, covers 4,000 ha, and
produces primarily such crops as corn, alfalfa, peppers, garlic, and onions.
This section would be excluded from the Project for technical and land tenure
problem reasons.
5.        The southern part represents the Project area.  The predominate crop
is sugarcane, which comprises 2,800 ha of the 3,600 ha included in the upper
part of the Project area. Other crops are corn, vegetables, and fruit. The
lower part of the Project area is presently unirrLgated, and 2,500 ha of these
lands would receive irrigation water under the Project. Total irrigated land
in the Project then would be 6,100 ha.

Project Concept
6.        Under the Project, all of the main canals and laterals of the
3,600-ha system in the upper part of the gorge (but south of the Tehuacan
valley) would be lined with concrete. The water saved by this and other
improvements would be diverted farther down the river and used to irrigate
the new 2,500 ha.
7.        Sugarcane still would be the principal crop in the 3,600 ha area,
and corn, vegetables, and fruit also would continue to be produced. The total
area cropped per year would increase from 3,600 ha to 4,000 ha.
8.        In the new 2,500 ha area, crops would be oilseeds, sorghum, alfalfa,
sweet corn, vegetables, and fruit trees. Total area cropped per year would
be 2,700 ha.
Project Works and Costs
9.        Principal works included in the Project would be as follows:
(a) 3,600-ha Rehabilitation
(i) Repairing and cleaning out intakes for 14 diversion dams;
(ii) Lining 206 km of existing canals with plain concrete; and
(iii) Rebuilding branch and minor canals, using precast concrete;
and
(b) 2,500-ha New Area
(1) 3 diversion dams;
(ii)  3 direct intakes on Rio Salado;
(iii)  92 km of main canals, concrete-lined;
(iv)  160 km of branch and minor canals;
(v)  Operational gates and measuring devices;
(vi)  70 km of operational service roads; and
(vii)  Drainage system.

Operations and Water Charges
10.       Water charges would be established by periodic socio-economic
studies in accordance with the provisions of the new Federal Water Law of
1971. The Commission would operate the district as provided by Law and
would collect all water charges. Technical and financial summaries are in
Tables 1 to 8.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Rio Blanco Irrigation District
Background
1,        The only Project irrigation work proposed for the Lower Papaloapan
Basin (Lower Basin) is the rehabilitation of the Rio Blanco Irrigation District,
an official Mexican irrigation district, located in the northern part of the
Basin, and operated by the Papaloapan Commission (Commission) for the water
users. While the present system was designed to deliver water to 16,000 ha,
only about 7,500 ha presently are irrigated in any one year.
2.        Through 1973 a total of Mex$108 million had been spent on construc-
tion. There is ample water available in the Rio Blanco and Otapa, which is
diverted into main canals by means of the Camelco and Otapa dams. The main
problems limiting the potential of the District area:
(a) limited budgets for construction, which has made it impossible
to complete some of the main canals and laterals;
(b) lack of credit for farmers, which, as a consequence, resulted
in many farmers growing rice since credit was available for it.
Rice is grown on some very permeable soils, resulting in
excessive water use and causing drainage problems at lower
elevations;
(c) limited funds for extension service and technical assistance to
teach the farmers to grow and irrigate crops properly;
(d) failure to level land so that irrigation can be done efficiently;
and
(e) lack of knowledge by the farmers of proper irrigation practices.
Proposed Works and Costs
3.        The Project would complete all canals, laterals, and distribution
systems to enable 16,000 ha to be irrigated every year. Several structures
would be rehabilitated, bottleneck sections in certain canals would be elimi-
nated, and canal reaches traversing permeable soils would be lined with con-
crete. Metering gates would be installed to enable District personnel to
control canal flows and farm deliveries. Drainage would be improved, addi-
tional roads for irrigation operations and maintenance use would be built,
and 6,000 ha of presently irrigated land would be leveled properly. Some
additional operation and maintenance equipment would be purchased.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        When the rehabilitation work is completed, a total of 19,000 ha of
crops would be harvested annually from the 16,000 physical ha under irrigation.
Principal crops would be pastures, maize, vegetables, rice and sorghum. A
PLAMEPA (Annex 5) unit would be assigned to the District to teach proper
irrigation methods. Technical and financial summaries are in Tables 1 to 4.
Land Ownership
5.        At the present time, there are 198 private farmers and 461 ejidal
farmers receiving irrigation water. The average irrigated area per private
farmer is 11 ha, with 83 of these having farms larger than 20 ha. The average
area per ejidal farmer is 4.3 ha of irrigated land. The average size of
rainfed farms in the District is 16.8 ha for private farmers and 8.3 ha for
ejidal farmers.
Operations and Water Charges
6.        The Commission would operate the District for the water users under
the new 1971 Federal Water Law. New water charges, reflecting the increased
benefits to all land, would be established follow:lng socio-economic surveys
carried out under the Law. These studies are required by the Law to be
up-dated periodically.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Plan Papaloapan for Rainfed Agriculture -- 100,000 ha
1.        Rainfed agriculture in the Papaloapan Basin (Basin) is relatively
poorly developed, and a major Project effort to increase production would be
by means of an intensive technical assistance service, coupled with credit
from the public and private banking systems. Plan Papaloapan (PLANPA) for
rainfed agriculture already is working in the Basin on aL small scale, and
has demonstrated that substantial yield increases are feasible. The Project
would expand and support this effort.  Project technical assistance personnel
would be hired and controlled by the Papaloapan Cotmmission (Commission), and
they would work closely with extension agents from the Secretaria de Agricul-
tura y Ganaderia (SAG) and the technicians of participating banks.
2.        PLANPA has similarities to the better-known "Plan Puebla" and has
followed the basic philosophy of, and benefitted from, the experience gained
from the latter project.  The Director of Agricultural Development of the
Commission, who initiated PLANPA, was directly involved in the formulation
of Plan Puebla prior to joining the Commission. There are, however, a number
of basic differences between Plan Puebla and PLANPA.
(a)  Plan Puebla is located at 2,000 - 3,000 m above sea level in a semi-
arid region with an average annual precipitation of 700 to 800 mm.
It covers a total area of 116,000 ha involving 47,500 farmers.
Maize is the major crop and while the area has good infrast-
ructure, such as roads, markets, and banks, and good access to
agricultural inputs, the low and erratic rainfall is a major
limitation for improving rainfed agricultural production in the
area. Plan Puebla's strategy had been to provide the farmers
with the best research information available. This was done
through a small number (1 agronomist per 1,250 farmers, or
1 agronomist per about 3,000 ha) of highly competent research
and extension workers. The proper timing of delivery of
agricultural inputs, such as seed and fertilizer to partici-
pating farmers, organized in farmer's groups, as well as
intensive publicity campaigns, formed important aspects of
the program.
(b) Plan Papaloapan (PLANPA) would cover a total area of about
100,000 ha, in both the Upper and Lower Basins. In the Upper
Basin conditions are generally semi-arid, as in the Puebla
region, but considerably less infrastructure exists. In the
Lower Basin, which is ecologically very different from Puebla,
conditions are subhumid to humid tropical, with average annual
rainfall ranging from 1,300 - 3,000 mm. The infrastructure in
much of the Lower Basin, though better developed than in the
Upper Basin, is still poor compared to the Puebla region. A

further major difference with Plan Puebla is that PLANPA
covers a wide variety of crops, such as maize, beans, rice,
and chili, as well as pasture crops, whereas Plan Puebla
concentrated almost exclusively on maize.
3.        Under the Project, technical assistance teams would be formed in
line with existing practice. Each team would normally consist of an agronomist,
a technical assistant to the agronomist, four to six sub-professional agri-
culturalists, and a secretary. The agronomist would have a pick-up truck,
and each of the sub-professionals would be given a motorcycle. The following
number of technical assistance teams would be operating in each part of the
Basin.

Upper Basin                      5      5      8       8         8

Total                     13      18     28      33        33
4.        In addition to these technical assistance teams, investigation teams
would be established to support them. Each team would normally consist of
an agronomist with one technical assistant, an economist, about four laborers,
and a secretary. Two such teams would be established in the Upper Basin and
three in the Lower. The task of the investigation teams would be to have
demonstration plots in new areas, and to solve problems arising in the field.
They would also work closely with the local research stations and obtain
their help in solving difficult problems. The job of the economists would be
to support the overall PLANPA by solving problems related to credit, avail-
ability of inputs, and marketing, and to help evaluate the results of the
Proj ect.
5.        The above technical assistance teams represent a ratio of about
one agronomist per 3,000 ha (like Puebla), or per about 650 farmers (much
more intensive than Puebla). In addition, the number of sub-professionals
per agronomist far exceeds that used under Plan Puebla. It is therefore a
much more intensive effort than Plan Puebla. This is justified since rain-
fed agriculture in the Basin is much less developed than in the Puebla area
in terms of farmers' skills and infrastructure (roads, markets, banks, etc.),
and because of the much greater number of crops involved. As in Plan Puebla,
the formation of farmers' groups (grupos solitarios) would be encouraged.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Feeder Roads
Scope of Program
1.        The highly mountainous nature of the Upper Papaloapan Basin (Upper
Basin) has hindered the establishment of adequate communications and has
meant that the villages have remained dispersed and isolated without the
necessary public services.
2.        The basic principle applied by the Papaloapan Commission (Commission)
in planning the road system in the Basin has been to provide road communi-
cation to all villages of more than 1,000 inhabitants that were situated at
a distance not greater than 20 km from trunk roads or main highways, or that
might serve as centers for stimulating the economic growth of areas already
under consideration for agricultural and livestock development. Mlost roads
are built using materials available locally and suitably paid labor, in
accordance with the standards laid down by the Secretaria de Obras Publicas
(SOP). Roads are not planned through or inside forest areas, in order to
avoid excessive exploitation of timber resources.
Types of Roads
3.        As regards the road categories involved, it should be noted that
all roads will be of the D or E category with, generally speaking, the
following characteristics:  those in category D, with a daily traffic rate
of between 100 and 500 vehicles, will have a crown width of 6 m and 5.50 m
of roadway; 620 curvature in mountain country, 320 :in h;illy country and 11°
on the flat; a maximum sustained gradient of 10% in mountain country and
7.5% in hilly country; will be surfaced with 20 cm of gravel; and. in some
cases, the roadway will be sealed. Roads in category E., i.e., those with
a daily traffic rate of less than 100 vehicles, will have a crown width of
4 m; a maximum of 620 curvature in mountain country, 30'' in hilly country
and 110 on the flat; a maximum sustained gradient of 12% in mountain country
and 9% in hilly country: and the roadway will be surfaced with 20 cm of
gravel. The category E roads have turnouts about every 500 m to facilitate
the passing of trucks.
Costs
4.        Representative costs for the two road types are given in Table 1.
Investment costs will vary with terrain and accessibility to materials.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Category D roads can be expected to cost from Mex$90,000 to Mex$200,000
per km, and Category E roads from Mex$70,000 to Mex$160,000 per km.
5.        Responsibility for road maintenance would rest with the Commission
or with SOP, depending upon the terms of the applicable agreement.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Potable Water Supply Systems
Beneficiaries
1.        Only 44% of the Basin population were served by community water
supply systems in 1973. The Project would reduce the deficits in such
service by about 35% in communities with between 500 and 999 inhabitants,
by about 50% in communities with between 1,000 and 2,499 inhabitants, and by
100% in villages with populations from 2,500 to 5,000. The following table
summarizes the relative sizes and numbers of the localities involved.

633     (263)      324           (135)     309            (125)
Approximately 307,000 persons would benefit, bringing the percentage of the
population in the Basin having water service to about 60%, which is about the
same percentage as existed in 1970 for the total population of Mexico.
Type of Systems
2.        The Papaloapan Commission would follow its past practice of construc-
ting two general types of water supply systems, one for small villages, and
one for larger villages.
3.        Small Villages:  Communities withi less than 500 population would not
be included in the Project. For villages with from 500 to 999 persons, normally
only a basic system would be constructed, with the inhabitants getting the water
fror, public hydrants located at several convenient places. The supply per person
would be about 75 liters per day.
4.        Larger Villages.  In general, conplete water distribution networks
with individual home services would be constructed in commlunities with from
1,000 to 5,000 population. Public hydrants also would be provided in areas



ANNEX 10
Page 2
where the people could not afford individual home servicie. Projects would
be designed for a population projection of 10 years after system construction,
with a demand of from 75 to 150 liters per person per day.
Water Sources and Treatment
5.        Water sources would be determined by the climate, hydrology, topography,
and geology of each specific site. Designs based on pumping would be avoided
wherever possible to minimize operating costs and pro3blems. Springs and streams
are common sources in the Upper Basin, and in most cases pumping would not be
required. The Esperanza and parts of the La Canada areas are general excep-
tions to this latter statement, and several areas in la Mixteca would require
pumping. In the Lower Basin, pumping would be required in almost all cases.
6.        All systems would be provided with a chlor:LnatiLon unit for disinfec-
Cion of the water.  Such minimum treatment probably would be sufficient to
satisfy health standards for water coming from wells and springs, and some
surface sources, but would not be adequate for many surface sources. The
legree of treatment required will be established by Serviicio de Salubridad y
Asistencia (SSA) for each site.
7.        The Commission is empowered to expropriate and impound privately-owned
water sources if necessary to provide potable water supplies for the population.
System Costs
S.        Cost estimates for four typical systems, representative of small
ana larger villages in both parts of the Basin, are presented in Tables 1
and 2. Those for the Upper Basin are for a gravity-fed system, while those
for the Lower Basin assume that a well must be drilled to provide a source of
water, since these alternatives will predominate in the respective areas.
The estimates can be used for either part of the Basin, however, the type of
source is the key factor, rather than the location.
9.        Capital investment costs for a small village system are estimated
at fromn Mex$207,000 for a gravity system to Mex$250,000 for a pumped-well
system. For an average village population of 700, this represents an invest-
ment of Mex$296 to Mex$357 per capita.
10.       For the larger villages, the typical capital investment costs, includ-
ing the connections to the house, basic household water supply plumbing, and
meters, range from Mex$987,300 to Mex$1,411,700 the hLigher cost being for
the pumped-well system.
11.       Since all costs from the distribution network to and inside of the
house would be financed by the housenolder, the investment costs which should
be recovered by the water system operating agency would range from Mex$579,200
to Mex$1,003,600. Per capita investment costs can be summarized as follows,
for an average population of 2,800 with 500 service connections.

Total System                            353               504
12.       The service connections, meter, and internal plumbing would be
included as part of the total Project cost, but would be financed by the
householder, or water-user. These costs would be about the same for all
types of systems, namely, about Mex$816 per service connections.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
13.       Annual operation and maintenance costs for all systems are also
shown in Tables 1 and 2. The system would be operated by a local water
entity established with the aid of Secretaria Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH),
with SRH supplying technical engineering support, when needed. SRH and SSA
also would perform periodic technical and management inspections.
Annual Revenues
14.       Water charges would be established for all larger network systems at
a level which would cover all operation and maintenance costs plus public
capital recovery over 25 years at zero interest rate. In the villages served
only by water hydrants, only operation and maintenance would be covered by
water charges but 20% of the initial investment costs would be directly fi-
nanced by the villagers.
Magnitude of Potential Extra Water Treatment Costs
15.       Should SSA require treatment in addition to chlorination for water
supplies which otherwise would not be potable, simply slow sand filters could be
used effectively. They require minimum operator training and have low operating
costs. Where required, such filters would add about Mex$75 per capita to system
investment and would increase operation and maintenance costs by about 5% to 10%.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOA?AN BASIN
Sewerage and Sewage Treatment
'1.       Sewerage and Sewage Treatment Systems are proposed only for larger
villages and towns with populations between 1,000 and 5,000, which already
have water supply systems. Only about 26% of the Basin population now has
sewage disposal systems and a modest program, covering albout 42,300 people
in villages with populations between 1,000 and 5,000, is planned.
Types of Systems
2.        The type of system to be used in each selected community would
depend upon the local topographic, geological, and climatic conditions and
the relative economics of elementary waste disposal systems. In any event,
the waste disposal system would be independent of any storm water disposal
system. The two types of systems most likely to be used are septic tanks, or
a network of underground concrete pipes which would collect the sewage from
each building and carry it to a central treatment plant.
3.        Individual septic tanks, or septic tanks serving a group of users,
could be the most feasible means of disposal in areas underlain with permeable
soils with adequate capacity for rendering the waste hannless before it
reaches surface streams or groundwater basins. Where such conditions do not
exist, the pipeline network would be required. In some instances, the sewage
flow may be such a small portion of total streamflow in the area that it could
be discharged safely into a nearby stream with little or no treatment. These
instances would be expected to be rare, and the basic cost estimate for a
village sewage collection and disposal system assumes the construction of
oxidation ponds into which all the sewage would flow. After the required
detention time in the ponds, the effluent would be chlorinated before dis-
charge into a nearby drainage channel.
4.        The central system is superior to septic tanks from the standpoint
of effective control and management to achieve public health objectives.
However, where a substantial saving in cost over the central systema can be
demonstrated for a septic tank system, with public health standards still
satisfied, the septic tank system could be utilized.
Capital Investment Costs
5.        For the pi--poses of developing a representative cost per capita of
central waste collection and disposal systems for the size of villages included
in the program, a village with 625 service connections, representing a popu-
lation of about 3,500 persons, has been used as the basis for cost estimates.



ANNEX 1t
Page 2
Such costs, including service connections and Mex$750 per service for a sink,
water closet, and necessary internal service plumbing are detailed in Table 1,
and may be summarized as follows:
Investment Category                           Mex$ per capita
Collection network and treatment facilities              616
Service connections and inside plumbing                  196
Total system                                        812
Operation and Maintenance Costs
6.        Operation and maintenance of the system would be performed by the
community water system personnel. The extra costs thereby incurred are also
shown in Table 1.
Annual Revenues
7.        Revenues would be charged to cover operation and maintenance, and
recover public capital invested over 25 years at zero interest rate.

Village Electrification
Beneficiaries
1.        In 1970 only about 41% of the Basin population had electrical service.
The Project would bring electricity to some 106 additional villages with popu-
lations between 500 and 5,000, thus providing the benefits of a reliable elec-
tricity supply to some 136,700 more people, or an additional 7% of the total
population. The Basin percentage at a level of 48% would still be much less
than the 1970 national average of 60%.
2.        The following table indicates the existing deficiencies in the
larger rural communities and the extent of the coverage in terms of the
number of villages proposed to be included.

Type of System
3.        Standard electrical transmission lines and distribution networks
would be constructed, as built in thousands of other villages in Mexico by
CFE, the national electricity authority. The usual transmission is at
13.2 KV or 6.6 KV at 60 cycles in the Project area. In most of the villages,
deliveries would not be metered at each service, but only by a single meter
near the edge of the town, plus special meters for any service with abnormal
demand.  CFE has found that this is practicable during the early years, when
the load per house is very low; every house is then charged a flat rate per
month.  When the average load begins to exceed the flat rate demand consistent-
ly, meters are installed; first on the houses with higher electricity usage.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
4.        The length of the transmission line has a considerable influence on
the overall cost. Longer transmission distances are justified for larger
communities. For the purposes of estimating a representative cost, a trans-
mission distance of 5 km was assumed.
System Costs
5.        A village with 200 service connections, representing a population
of about 1,100 direct beneficiaries, was chosen to illustrate typical costs.
The results are detailed in Table 1. The overall inve!stment cost would be
Mex$533 per capita, including an allowance for house wiring, which would
have to be handled separately by the user. Omitting this item, which amounts
to about Mex$413 per service, gives a total cost of ab,out Mex$2,520 per
service, or Mex$458 per capita.
Annual Revenues
6.        The latest tariffs, established nationwide in October 1973, were
used to estimate income. A base load per domestic service of 60 kWh per
month was used to estimate energy costs and revenuLes. This would be about
sufficient to cover operation and maintenance and recover capital over
about 25 years at zero interest rate.

zero interest rate. These rates are fixed on a national basis for rural areas.
3/ For operation and maintenance of the system from the primary transmission line to the
households, but excluding the operating costs within households and such. The energy
cost of Mex$0.225 per kWh at the primary transmission line is an estimate of the
marginal cost of a kWh to the system. At the present time, the marginal cost of a
kWh to the system probably exceeds the average cost of a kWh.

2.        For towns with between 1,000 and 5,000 inhabitants service would
be provided in the form of a health center with three beds for emergency and
maternity care, manned by a student doctor and one nurse, i.e., of .i similar
type of those built by the Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia (SSA).

1.        In spite of the effort made by the Government to bring primary
education to all parts of the Basin, there are still many areas where it
is lacking or inadequate, owing particularly to the existence of many small,
scattered and outlying villages in the area. In view of this, the Project
places great importance on this sector, particularly in the Upper Basin
where the problem is most acute. Dual objectives are to reduce the shortage
of classrooms as soon as possible in villages of more than 500 inhabitants,
and at the same time indirectly encourage greater concentration of population
by not providing service to villages with fewer than 500 inhabitants.
2.        The basic criterion adopted is to cater for the requirements of
communities with between 500 and 5,000 inhabitants. In 1973, an earthquake
occurred in the Upper Basin and damaged or ruined many schools. These would
be replaced under the Project.
3.        In the primary schools emphasis would be placed on the first four
grades so as to make the children literate.
4.        In many areas, workshops would be constructed to teach suich trades
as carpentry, plumbing, electrical, and dressmaking. Meeting locaL job market
requirements would be emphasized, however, in the Upper Basin many of the
tradesmen would have to leave the area to find work.
5.        In total it is estimated that about 1,185 cLassrooms would be built.
Cost estimates are given in -able 1.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Project Monitoring
1.        This would be the first integrated rural development project in
Mexico and would represent conceptually a new departure for the Bank in
Mexico, and, indeed, for Mexico itself. For this reason, but also because
other such projects are planned in many countries, it is crucial to test the
validity of the technical, financial, and economic assumptions that formed
the basis for appraisal of the Integrated Rural Development Project I -
Papaloapan Basin (Project). In this respect, the thinking of the Government
of Mexico is in accord with that of the Bank.
2.        The Monitoring Unit (Unit) would be established within SRH and would
be staffed, at least part time, witb an economist, a sociologist and technical
personnel, as necessary. It would probably also require the services of
consultants from within the country as well as from outside Mexico. It would
be important that the Unit maintain an impartial attitude toward the Project
and that it be given access to all pertinent data. From the start of the
Project, a close relationship between the Unit and the Bank would need to be
established. This is in accordance with Government's intentions.
3.        The core of any rural development project is probably the components
within it that lead directly to increased production of goods and services.
In this Project, efforts would be concentrated on increased production of
crops in irrigated and rainfed areas. A principal objective of the monitoring
system would be to accurately record the increases in production achieved and
the costs involved compared to those anticipated at time of appraisal. This
would involve some type of sampling technique being applied to Project farmers
in order to select a representative sample, and then establishment of a system
for recording the required data at farm level. In this regard, it is important
that the pre-development position of Project farmers be accurately established
and also that a control group be identified and their progress recorded. Key
coefficients involved in this study would be yield per ha, cropping intensity,
cropping pattern, input mix and use per ha for different crops, factor and
product prices at farm-gate, degree of farmer participation, and degree and
amount of technical assistance required to achieve different responses.
4.        For the social infrastructure components, a major effort would be
made to establish demand for water, sewerage, electricity, medical services,
schools, community centers and the like at different levels of user charges,
income of beneficiaries, and other such probable causal factors.
5.        Organizational problems in Project implementation would be recorded,
especially where a pattern emerges. At the village level, organizational
problems are expected to be frequent, and the monitoring system would record
their incidence and attempt to classify them. Furthermore, an evaluation of
the effectiveness of different solutions would be attempted based on actual
experience under the Project.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
6.        The Project account, which would be maintained by the Commission,
would be thoroughly analyzed by the Unit for data oln unit costs of providing
the many services planned under the Project. In the analysis of this data,
much attention would be concentrated on finding ways of lowering unit costs
in later projects. The extent of cost recovery, ancd the adequacy of operation
and maintenance would receive close scrutiny in the analysis of the social
infrastructure components.
7.        Discussions of the advantages of an itntegrated approach to rural
development have been frequent and often beset with controversy. The Unit
would attempt to quantify the linkages which are presumed to exist, for
instance, between feeder road development and expansion of agricultural
production. It would also attempt to establish and quantify the key causal
relationships in the development process of a rural area. To what extent,
for instance, is the provision of public services, such as primary education,
health centers, and potable water, necessary in order to induce and then
maintain increased levels of agricultural production? These are but examples
of the type of information the Unit would attempt to gather and analyze.
8.        The Bank places considerable importance on monitoring the progress
of this Project and therefore agreed to share in its financing to the extent
of about US$80,000.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Papaloapan Commission
Purposes and Authority
1.        The Papaloapan Commission (Commission), a semi-autonomous Govern-
ment institution, was established by Executive Resolution of the President of
the Republic of Mexico on February 26, 1947 to promote the integrated develop-
ment of the Basin of the Papaloapan River (Annex 1). On December 19, 1951,
the Resolution was enacted into law and authorized the Commission to plan,
design and construct all types of public works, such as:
(a) hydraulic engineering projects for irrigation, power
and river control;
(b) sanitary engineering projects;
(c) communication projects, which can include navigation, ports,
roads, railways, telegraph and telephone facilities; and
(d) efforts related to establishment and development of
population centers.
It can also operate in the industrial, agricultural and settlement fields
when such activities are carried out in connection with integrated develop-
ment of the Papaloapan River Basin (Basin).
Operations
2.        Budgetary expenditures from 1947 to 1970 amounted to Mex$1,236
million, distributed as follows over presidential periods:
1947 - 1952               Mex$270 million
1953 - 1958               Mex$592 million
1959 - 1964               Mex$172 million
1965 - 1970               Mex$202 million
Total expenditures over the 24-year period can be further categorized as to
nature and orientation of the projects executed as follows:

3.        The most important undertakings of the Commission so far have been: 1/
(a)  construction of the President Aleman Dam, with. a capacity of
8,000,000 m3 and controlling the waters of the Rio Tonto;
(b)  construction of the Tamascal Hydroelectric: Plant, with a
capacity of electric power of 750,000,000 kWh annually,
using the water available from the President Aleman Dam
(this project was carried out with resources from the
Comision Federal de Electricidad);
(c)  construction of flood control works on the banks of the
Papaloapan River (8.8 km) and control and defense works
of the lower river (171 km);
(d)  construction of irrigation projects and flood protection
works in the states of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Puebla;
(e)  provision of drinking water services and sewerage systems to
a larger number of communities in the three states (Table 1);
(f)  construction of 2,082 km of roads and bridges and 25 small,
airfields;
(g)  carrying out of several livestock and agriculture development
projects and soil conservation programs; and
(h)  implementation of education, sanitary and urban development
projects.
4.        In the first two presidential periods (1947-1952 and 1953-^1958), the
Commission's projects were broad in scope, but they were limited thereafter by
budgetary restrictions. Nevertheless, during the last three years of the
current period, its activities have been substantially increased because of the

present President's interest in resolving problems in the Papaloapan region.
In 1970, the expenditures were only Mex$38.5 million, but in 1971 they
rose to Mex$61.8, in 1972 to Mex$152.6, and in 1973 (September) to Mex$291.5
(see Table 2).
Administration and Management
5.        Headquarters of the Commission are in Cuidad Aleman in the state of
Veracruz, and there is a small office in Mexico City to maintain liaison with
Government agencies. The Commission is composed of the Minister of Recursos
Hidraculicos as President; one Executive Member (Vocal Ejecutivo), represent-
ing the Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH); and one Secretary Member
(Vocal Secretario), representing both the Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito
Publico and the Secretario del Patrimonio Nacional. Both members are nominated
by the President of the Republic for unlimited terms.
6.        The President of the Commission is responsible for planning, general
policy formulation, and supervision, and coordination of policy with other
Secretaries and agencies of the Government. The Vocal Ejecutivo is the chief
executive of the Commission, responsible for execution of the policies
approved by the President and for managing day-to-day business. The Vocal
Secretario is responsible for personnel administration and budget control and
serves as a deputy of the Commission.
7.        The Commission has undergone a reorganization aimed at strengthening
its planning and implementation capability.  Under the new management struc-
ture, principal officials are as follows: (a) Development Director; (b) Con-
struction Director; (c) Technical Director; and (d) Administrative Director. 1/
8.        The Development Director is responsible for the agriculture, live-
stock, industrial, rural, and fishing development programs, as well as for
the operation of irrigation districts, and the Construction Director is
in charge of all types of construction works, such as roads, bridges, irri-
gation canal systems, sewerage and water supply, buildings, and dams. The
Technical Director carries out studies and projects and is responsible for
planning and programming and the contracting and supervision of all the Com-
mission construction projects, while the Administrative Director is respon-
sible for budget control, purchasing, accounting, auditing, personnel
administration, and other general services. The latter reports directly to
the Vocal Secretaria, who, as representative of the Secretarias de Hacienda
y del Patrimonio Nacional, has the responsibility for carrying out close
supervision and control over budget operations and business of the Cotlmission.
9.        Because of the expansion of its activities in the last three years,
the Commission has increased its technical and administrative staff from a
total of 178 in 1970 2/ to about 620 by August 1973. Of this number, 170 are
1/   See Papaloapan Commission Organization Chart, World Bank 8631.
2/   Twenty-five professional staff (14%), 82 technical personnel (46%) and
71 administrative staff (40%).



ANNEX 19
Page 4
professional staff (27%), 100 being civil engineers and 35, agricultural
engineers; 220 are technical personnel (36%); and 230 (37%) are administrative
staff (37%). The number of administrative personnel appears to be too high
in relation with the professional and technical staff, but it must take into
account, first, that the Commission has to maintain permanent offices and
services in many areas of the Basin, and on the other hand, that in the last
three years its activities have been substantially increased. In effect,
its expenditures for 1970 were Mex$152.6 million (an increase of about 300%),
and in 1973 the authorized budget rose to Mex$291.5 million (657% of increase
in relation with 1970). Nevertheless, it appears advisable that the Commission
be careful in increasing the administrative staff in the future.
Finance
10.       The preparation of the investment program is the responsibility of
the Commission. The Commission obtains its funds through appropriation of
the Federal Expenditures Budget. The annual appropriation appears as a
single item in the SRH budget which can be expanded only in accordance with a
detailed program approved by the President of the Republic. At the beginning
of the year, the Secretaria de la Presidencia informs SREI in writing which
projects the Commission is to carry out and the estimated cost of each. A
copy of the letter is also sent to the Secretaria de Hacienda and the Secretaria
del Patrimonio Nacional for financial and control purposes.
11.       In preparing the investment program, the Commission is usually
assisted by specialized officers of SRH and other agencies of the Government.
The Vocal Ejecutivo submits the proposed program to the Secretario de Recursos
Hidraulicos for approval before requesting the funds needed from the 'ecretaria
de la Presidencia. Any subsequent reallocation of funds among projects in the
program requires approval by the President of the Republic. Funds arz released
monthly in advance by the Secretaria de Hacienda followi;ng a request Erom SRH
and in accordance with the forecast of expenditures for each project ais prepared
by the Commission and approved by SRH.
Accounting and Auditing
12.       The Commission's Accounts Department has two sections, one responsible
for maintenance of the account and payment systems, wand the other for examina-
tion of documents relating to disbursement.  All vouchers, supported by neces-
sary documents, are checked and approved by the Vocal Secretario before payments
are made to ensure that expenditures are propertly incurred and sanctioned by
appropriate authority. All contracts and orders more than Mex$200,000 must be
signed by Commission Members and approved by the Secretar-io of SRH. They must
also be registered with the Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional, whose approval
is required before disbursement can be made.
13.       The Commission's account is audited under ithe supervision of the
Administrative Director. The Controller's Office of SRH and the General
Accounting Office of the Secretaria de Hacienda also review accounts, and
the Secretaria de la Presidencia and the Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional
can perform field auditing as they desire.



ANNEX 19
Page 5
Project Organization
14.       The Commission would have overall responsibility for Project admin-
istration and management and would appoint a Project Director to manage day-
to-day operations. The Project Director's duties would be to:
(a) under the general direction of the Vocal Ejecutivo
insure that the Integrated Rural Development Project I -
Papaloapan Basin (Project) is carried out as agreed
between the Bank and the Commission; and
(b) act as a coordinator with the other Directors within the
Commission in the execution of the Project.
A Special Committee under the leadership of the Vocal Ejecutivo would be
created to serve as an adviser team. This team, consisting of all Commission
Directors and the Project Director, would participate in the most important
aspects of the Project and coordinate activities in their respective fields.
15.       The Commission already has sizeable staff of civil and agricultural
engineers (para 9), but additional professional and technical personnel would
have to be hired for the Project.
16.       Budget appropriations for the Project would be approved by the
Secretaria de la Presidencia on the basis of detailed cost estimates. The
Secretaria de Hacienda would issue instructions for using the appropriations
and special regulations to cover bidding procedures. Disbursements would be
made through the Treasury of the Federal Government when the signatures of
approval of the Vocal Ejecutivo and Vocal Secretario and after approval by
the Secretarias de Recursos Hidraulicos, Hacienda and Patrimonio Nacional
had been obtained.

ANNEX 21
MEXICO
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT I - PAPALOAPAN BASIN
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return was calculated on the basis of data
shown in Table 1. Key assumptions and adjustments made were:
(a) the official rate of exchange is equal to the shadow rate
of exchange;
(b) the prices of investment and operating cost items, and
outputs, in real terms, would remain at July 31, 1974
price levels;
(c) all administrative costs of the Project were estimated
and charged to the Project;
(d) payments that would be transfer payments were not charged
to the Project;
(e) service charges for water, sewerage, and electricity were
used as proxies for the economic benefits since the economic
benefits must be at least equal to the charges people are
prepared to pay;
(f) the shadow wage of skilled labor was assumed to equal the
monetary wage since these are set by relatively free market
forces; and
(g) the shadow wage of agricultural workers was assumed to equal
75% of the monetary wage since most of the labor would be
required at peak labor demand periods such as planting and
harvesting.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return of the
project is estimated at approximately 26%. Should investment cost be 20%
higher then the rate would drop to 19%.
