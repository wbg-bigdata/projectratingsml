MEMORANDUM AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ZIMBABWE
FOR A SECOND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation of a proposed loan to
Zimbabwe for US$25 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be on standard IBID terms with 20 years maturity, including five years of
grace, and would help finance a second family health project. The project
would be co-financed by the Government of Norway for US$14.2 million
equivalent, the Government of Denmark for US$8.3 million equivalent, the
Government of Netherlands for US$5.8 million equivalent, the European
Community for US$3.7 million equivalent, and the United Kingdom Overseas
Development Administration for US$4.7 million equivalent.
2.          Background  Despite sluggish economic growth during much of the
1980s, Zimbabwe registered major gains in human resource development.
Education, health, and family planning services all expanded dramatically,
especially in the rural areas which were badly under-served before
independence. Basic social indicators (e.g., irfant mortality, malnutrition,
literacy) improved significantly. However, much still remains to be done,
especially in making basic services available to the poor, enhancing equity,
improving quality, and increasing efficiency.
3.          In health, Zimbabwe has made important progress under the first
World Bank-assisted Family Health Project (1987-91) and other donor-assisted
projects, by extvr4ing primary and preventive services (immunizations, ante-
natal care, malaria control, etc.) to remote parts of the country. Thousands
of nurses and village health workers have been trained to run programs at
rural health centers (RHC) and community level. However, much more needs to
be done to staff, equip, and supervise health facilities in the rural areas,
especially in the districts where no hospital and few RXCs exist. Maternal
morbidity and mortalit3 ates are still unacceptably high, because most nurses
do not have midwifery training and many peripheral facilities lack maternity
equipment, emergency transport, and communications.  In addition, while the
first Family Health Project has helped to strengthen district health
management and manpower planning, the Ministry of Health (MOH) continues to
suffer from weaknesses in the management of financial resources and
materialslequipment.
4.          In population, Zimbabwe has emerged as a leader in Africa: 362 of
married women were using modern contraceptive methods in 1988, the highest
level in Africa. This success is mainly the result of high-level government
commitment to lowering fertility and the development of efficient institutions
to provide information and services, especially at community level. However,
the family planning program reached a plateau around 1987-88, and new
strategies are now required to increase contraceptive prevalence and complete
the transition to lower fertility. In particular, it will be critical to: (a)
expand access to services both in fixed facilities and through rural outreach;
(b) diversify the mix of methods away from the oral contraceptives to other
semi-permanent and permanent methods; (c) improve services for adolescents;
(d) enhance information, education, and communications (IEC) activities; and
(e) strengthen program management.



5.          In nutrition, the prevalence of second and third-degree
malnutrition in children (less than 752 of median weight for age) has fallen
from 222 in 1980 to about 122 at present. Higher incomes for small farmers
and the prevention and control of many parasitic and infectious diseases
accounts for much of this improvement. At the same time, however, levels of
chronic malnutrition (stunting) remain high at 28-30? for young children,
while deficiencies of iodine, vitamin A and dietary iron continue to have an
adverse impact on physical growth and educability of children and on the
health and productivity of adults, especially women. Some of the chronic
malnutrition can be traced to inappropriate child care and feeding practices,
problems which can be solved through well-designed training and IEC programs.
Similarly, prevailing micronutrient deficiencies can be corrected through
appropriately targeted supplementation. Local capacity to plan and manage
nutrition programs needs to be boosted through training and institutional
development.
6.          While no PCRIPPAR has been carried out on World Bank assistance to
the I/P/N sectors in Zimbabwe, a detailed mid-term review of the ongoing
Family Health Project (Ln.2744-ZIN) revealed a number of lessons for the
future. Some of the most important lessons are thats (a) a broader approach
to support for family planning is required, starting with a national strategy
and program that covers expanded service delivery, more diversified
contraceptive method mix. and manpower development; (b) capacity-building for
the health sector needs to receive even greater emphasis, especially in the
areas of financial management and management of equipment and supplies; (c)
designs for upgrading rural health facilities must be more flexible (taking
into account specific local population numbers, disease patterns, and existing
comunications) and cost-effective; and (d) project coordination and
management systems need to be firmly established at the outset and
strengthened continuously through appropriate staffing, in-service training,
and use of local consultants. These lessons and others have been fully
incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
7.          Proiect Objectives  The proposed project will provide the bulk of
the required financial and human resources for the Government's five-year
investment program (1992-96) for health/populacion/nutrition (H/P/N), and will
promote policy and institutional reforms, in order to: (a) improve maternal
and child health and nutrition status; (b) reduce the rate of population
growth; and (c) ensure that households in the 16 worst-served districts (40?
of the population) have access to basic HI/PIN services. To achieve these
objectives, the project will increase the output and effective utilization of
trained Zimbabwean health, family planning, and nutrition workers; enhance MOH
capacity to plan and manage HIP/N activities; and increase efficiency and
mobilize additional financial resources.
8.          Project Description  The project will support the following six
components: (a) Family Planning -- training, community outreach and static
facility servlces, special youth services, rEC campaigns, and improved
management; (b) Maternal and Child Health -- midwifery training, maternity
equipment, school health program, and operations research; tc) Nutrition --
commuity-based growth monitoring and supplementary food production, improved
breastfeeding practices, micro-nutrient supplementation, IEC, and training and
institutional strengthening; (d) Rural Health Delivery -- upgrading of 16
district hospitals and about 80 RHCs, provision of staff housing, ambulances



- 3 -
and supervisory transport, medical equipment, and radio communication; (e)
Manpower Development -- institutional strengthening, curriculum reform,
improved coordination and management of inservice training, personnel system
development and decentralization, and selective upgrading of district training
facilities; and (f) Management Strengthening -- training and systems
development in financial management, materials/equipment management, district-
level information systems, and sector planning. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Zimbabwe are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9318-ZIM, dated May 1, 1991, is
also attached.
9.          Rationale for Bank Involvement  The proposed project is consistent
with the Bank's country assistance strategy for Zimbabwe, which emphasizes
actions to help reduce the country's population grow-th rate and expand the
provision of quality social services to low-income households. Through the
ongoing first Family Health Project and recent sector work on population
(1989) and health financing (1990), the Bank has demonstrated analytical,
institutional and financial leadership in the H/PJN sectors and helped to
forge closer links and broad policy consensus among donors (including UNFPA,
UNICEF, the Nordics, U.K., and USAID). The Government asked the Bank to
assist in designing the proposed project as the centerpiece of Zimbabwe's
1991-95 investment program for these sectors, and to play a major role in
securing the maximum amount of grant funding for the project.
10.         Atreed Actions  During appraisal, agreement was reached ons (a) a
five-year national family planning strategy and program, to be supported by
the proposed project and by other donors (notably GTZ, USAID, UNFPA); (b) a
plan for increasing midwifery training capacity while minimizing the need for
new training facilities; (c) revised standard designs for district hospitals
and RHCs and criteria to be used in preparing provincial RHC upgrading
programs; (d) a health manpower development strategy and options for
coordinating sectoral manpower needs with training program outputs; (e) an
agreed program for increasing cost recovery to a level equal to 10 of
recurrent expenditures by June 30, 1995, mainly by focusing on higher-income
households covered by medical insurance and improving billing and collection
in major hospitals; and (f) the basic staffing pattern for the project
management unit. At negotiations, a plan for phased deployment of additional
community-based family planning workers and ward-based nutrition coordinators
was finalized, and it was agreed that the Government will forward to the Bank
before March 31, 1992 and implement by July 1, 1992 a plan for improved repair
and maintenance of MOH vehicles. The sole condition of effectiveness will be
that three positions in the project unit (financial officer, procurement
officer, physical planninglarchitectural advisor) be filled with candidates
acceptable to the Bank.
11.         Benefits  The proposed project will directly benefit low income
households in rural and urban areas, especially wom*n and children, by
improving their health and nutrition status. The rougily 800,000 women
expected to utilize modern family planning methods in 1995 will obtain a wider
range of methods, better quality services, and easier access, while a large
proportion of the 250,000 women giving birth in 1995 will experience safer



- 4 -
districts will benefit from expanded hospital and health center-based
services. Large numbers of Zimbabwean doctors, nurses, and other paramedical
cadres will acquire additional skills and increased incomes as a result of
project-funded training. The technical and allocative efficiency of the
national health and family planning system will be significantly enhanced as a
result of management improvements, and extra resources for health will be
generated through increased cost recovery and a widening of medical insurance
coverage. For Zimbabwe as a whole, better health and nutrition and lower
population growth will yield benefits in the form of increased labor
productivity, Improved educability of children, and lower outlays, public and
private, for social services.
12.         Risks  The main risks aret (a) weaknesses in the local
construction industry, as experienced in recent years, could delay the
hospital and RHC upgrading program: and (b) inadequate institutional capacity
in M0O and other Government agencies could prevent timely project
implementation. The first risk will be minimized by staggering the
construction schedule and dividing the main civil works contracts among
several firms Also, the overall trade and investment liberalization process
in Zimbabwe should help revitalize the construction industry. The Government
will aim to mitigate the second risk by effectively applying the new scheme of
public service for Zimbabwean doctors, providing additional incentives to
health workers serving in the rural areas (including project-financed staff
housing), and expanding and reorienting training programs to emphasize
comaunity medicine and public health. The health management strengthening,
family planning, and nutrition components of the project are all designed to
make a major contribution to the development of skills and systems required to
mprove the planning, execution, and evaluation of HIPIN programs.
13.         Recomendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
