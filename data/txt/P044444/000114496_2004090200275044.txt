amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii)
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof

further deposit by the Bank into any Special Account shall be made

refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments or eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.

subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
