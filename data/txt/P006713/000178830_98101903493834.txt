APPRAISAL OF THE
BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
COLOMBIA
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Colombia has reauested a Bank loan to assist
in financing a project to improve and expand the water supply facilities
in the city of Bogota. This report covers the apnraisal of the proposed
project.
ii.       Total cost of the project is estimated to be USt35.3 million
equivalent, including interest during construction. The foreign exchange
component is US$17.3 million equivalent, to be covered by a proposed Bank
loan of US$14.0 million equivalent and joint loans from national lending
institutions of supplier countries of at least US$3.0 million equivalent
and up to a maximum of US$5 to 6 million equivalent.  The Bank loan would
be reduced to the extent additional joint loans would exceed US$3.0 mil-
lion equivalent. Interest during construction on the joint loans amounting
to US$0.3 million equivalent would be covered 'by funds generated from
operations.
iii.      The borrower would be the Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado
de Bogota (EAAB), an autonomous agency operating the water supply and
sewerage systems in the Bogota district.
iv.       The project covers the first stage (1968-71) of a long-range
program and includes construction of the first stage of the Tibito II
scheme, preparation of subsequent works and improvement of operations.
The Tibito II scheme is the most economic alternative to provide addi-
tional water to Bogota, sufficient to meet most requirements until major
future schemes come into operation aroumd 1977. The project is technically
sound, cost estimates are reasonable, and the EAAB, with the assistance
of its consultants, is canable of carrying out the work.
v.        During 1967, the EAAB has undergone a major reorganization and
has improved management and administration. A new accounting system is
being established and, for the first time, the accounts have been audited
for the financial year ending December 31, 1967. The organizational im-
provements achieved so far and required by the Bank prior to appraisal
have been satisfactory.
vi.       New water rates, together with a new and improved rate structure,
have been apDroved by the Government and are being put into effect. It is
expected that they will result in a 80 percent increase in the average rate,
enabling the EAAB to earn a return of 6 percent during construction.
vii.      Under the arrangements listed in paragraph 8.07 of this report
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$14.0 million for a period of
.20 years, including a four and a half year grace period.

APPRAISAI OF THE
BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
COLOMBIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has applied for a loan from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to help finance a
project to improve and exDand the water sunply facilities in Bogota D.E. l/
The Borrower would be the Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota
(EAAB).
1.02      Total cost of the project is US$35.3 million eqiuivalent, including
engineering, contingencies and interest during construction.  Foreign ex-
change requirements are US$17.3 million (49 nercent of total project cost),
out of which the proposed Bank loan would cover US$14.0 million.
1.03      The proposed project is one of the three Colombian projects (the
others being the Bogota Power and the National Power Interconnection projects)
included in the joint financing arrangements between the BanX and major
potential supplier countries. Joint loans would cover 50 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of individual orders above US$200,000 provided that
the accumulated value of such contracts placed in the country of the joint
lender amounts to at least US$1.0 million. Joint loans for this project
are expected to cover at least US$3.0 million. The final amount of joint
loans will be known only after completion of bidding on all contracts,
exDected for early 1969. The Bank loan would be reduced below US$14.0
million to the extent joint loans would exceed US$3.0 million.
1.04      Local currency cost for the project (US$18.0 million equivalent)
and interest during construction on the joint loans (US$0.3 million) would
be financed by funds generated from internal operations, local currency loans,
and some Government contributions.
1.05      The proposed project is included in a long-range master plan for
the Bogota water supply and is based on a first-stage feasibiJity study.
These studies have been prepared by Ingetec Ltda., a Colombian consulting
firm. In addition to Ingetec, EAAB has retained other consulting firms for
final design of individual portions of the project, for construction super-
vision and for certain other activities, such, as data processing, review
of meter reading and of billing procedures.
1!   D.E. = Distrito Especial (the Federal District, comprising the city of
Bogota and some surrounding areas).



1.06      This reDort is based on infor-matiorn obtained from the FAAB and its
consultants during an aDpraisal mission to i3og,ota in July .Au7ust 1967 by
Messrs. J. Krombach and G.B.H. Renqer of the Bank staff, and from the con-
sultants' reports.  Processing of the Droposed loan was postponed nending
the outcome of bidding on the malor contract (niceline), as the cost
estimates were too uncertain to reasonably establish the foreign exchanpe
recuirements and conseqoently the amount of the Bank and joint loans.
Therefore Messrs. Krombach and Renger reampraised the project in January/
February 1X68.  Ne7otiations took place from April 11 through 18, 1968.
2.  TSIR W.ATFR SUPPLY SECTOR IN COLONBTA
2.01     Bank missions reviewed the water suoply (and sewerage) sector in
Colombia in 1966 and the sector is presently under a more detailed review
for the 1968 Economic Report.
2.02      Responsibility for the sector in Colombia is shared by various
national, regional and local authorities whose activities are only very
looselv coordinated. Rural schemes are under the Ministry of Public Health,
and communities from 2,500 to 10),000 in ponulation are under the Instituto
de Fomento Municipal ( IISFOFPAL) , an autonomous national authority, which
operates through rezional branches.  In most of the cities larger than
100,000 in Dopulation, the water works are nart of' autonomous municipal
entities, called EmDresas Municipales or Emoresas P'blicas, which provide
also other services, such as sewerage, Do-er, telephone, and, in some cases,
slaughterhouses, market places., etc.  3ogota is the onlv municioality where
these functions are divided into seDarate author-ities.  The water supply
(and sewerage) works in Bogota are administered by the Empresa de Acueducto
y Alcantarillado de Bogota (!KAAB).
2.03      The 1966 sector review identified several high priority water
supply and sewerage sector projects, of which the Bogota projects were
considered to be the most urgent and important.  Since then US-AID has pro-
vided a Col$65 million (US$4.o million ecuivailent) loan from counterpart
furnds and a foreign exchange loan of USD450,000 for the first stage of the
Bogota Sewerage Masternlan (1967-68).
2.04      Major exransion works for the water supply and sewerage systems
in the other large cities, namely Cali, Medellin and Baranquilla, have been
financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the US-AID and the
US Export-Import Bank,  Arrangements for financing of subsequent stages of
these projects by the same lenders are under way.
2.05      The 1966 sector review also identified several high priority
water supply and sewerage projects in medi=rn-sized cities.  Subseouently,
arrangements for undertaking the necessary feasibility studies have been



- 3 -
negotiated between the local Emnresas, the Colombian Planning Office, and
the US-AID, which provides the financing for the studies. The Bank has
been in contact with these authorities and Bank missions visited most of
the cities for which studies are under way.
3. THE PROPOSED BORROWER
A. Ormzan zation and Man agement
3.01      The first organization providing water to the city of Bogota was
a private company founded in 1886. This company was taken over by the city
of Bogota in 1914, and the sewerage department was created in the same year.
The creation of the EAAL  was based on a presidential decree of 1954, which
authorized the Mayor of the District of Bogota to organize the public ser-
vices of the capital. The Dresent organization, the Empresa de Acueducto
y Alcantarillado de Bogota (FiAAB) was brought into existence in 1955, by
a decree of the Council of the District of Bogota. The EAAB is an autono-
mous rublic entity owned by the District of Bogota, and all pronerties
having to do with water and sewerage services were transferred to it upon
its creation.
3.02      The governing body of the EAAB is a board of seven members, con-
sisting of the Mayor or his representative (at present the Secretalr of
Putblic Works of the District), two members appointed by the Council of the
District, three members amnointed bv the holders of the EAAB's bonds (the
Banco de la Republica and the Banco Central Hipotecario), and, as the
seventh member, the manager or sub-manager of the Banco de la Republica.
After the amortization of the outstanding bonds in 1977, the three members
now representing the bond holders will be replaced by members appointed
by the District Council. The Board members are apnointed for a period of
four years.
3.03      The Board does not become involved. in the day-to-day operations
of the EAAB, and its functions are limited to major decisions including
the apDointment of the general manager and sub-managers. Presidential
approval is required for borrowings of Col$1 million or more. Tariff
increases are subject to the apnroval of the Superintendencia de Regu-
lacion Economica (see paragraph 3.23).
3.04      The general manager is the chief executive of the EAAB.  The
present incumbent has been appointed in October 1966. In managing the EAAB
he is assisted by four sub-managers (for Finance, Planning, Operations and
Administration), to whom a fair amount of resnonsibility is delegated. This
is a considerable change from the situation existing two years ago, when, for
example, 21 persons reported directly to the general manager. With the assis-
tance of a local consulting firm, the EAAB has completely revised and stream-
lined its organizational structure. The present organizational chart of
the EAAB is shown in Annex 1.



- 4 -
3.05      So far, the performance of the general manager and the four sub-
managers, all appointed within the Dast 18 months, has been satisfactory
notwithstanding the fact that they do not have as much experience as could
normally be desired for their tasks.
3.o6      Personnel increased from about 800 in 1961 to about 1,150 (44
percent) at present.  This increase is not excessive in view of the growth
of the system (paragraph 3.33). Certain sections are still understaffed,
such as the water supply master plan section, the meter shop and the sections
for maintenance of the water distribution and sewerage systems. Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that the EAAB will review its staff
requirements annually with the Bank.
3.07      The general manager has complete authority to aproint and dis-
charge all personnel below the rank of sub-manager.  ilowever, vacancies
within the EAAB can only be filled by outside personnel when competitive
examinations fail to nroduce suitable candidates froml within the EAAB.  The
discharge of personniel is subject to nayment of all accumulated social
benefits.
3.08      Central organizations of labor unions do not exist in Colombia.
Usually, the personnel of each Drisvate r'd public enternrise organizes
its own union, which negotiates its labor agreements with the management.
Relations between management and labor union of the EAAB are good and morale
among the employees has considerably improved since the apnointment of the
new general manaaer.
3.09      Lack of continuity in the EAA80 s management because of high turn-
over in the general manager's post was ore of the maJor factors contributing
to the unsatisfactory performance of the FAA_ in the past.  Assurances have
been obtained during negotiations that the Bank will be consulted on new
appointments to the costs of general manager or sub-manager.
3.10      The EAAB lacks an adecuate budget control system. A great number
of statistics are being produced without coordination between the various
departments and without integrating the data into periodic reports that
could serve as management tools. Assurances have been obtained that new
could  sev   smn-mn oos              suacshv     bee  otinedemethat nwiti
budget control and management reporting systems 'ill be implemented within
one year.
3.11      EAAB's management and staff, assisted by its consultants, should
be able to carry out the project satisfactorily.
B. Financial Position
Accounting and Auditing
3.12      Comparative balance sheets and income statements since 1961 are
shown in Annexes 2 and 3. Through 1966, however, accounting deficiencies
cloud the picture emerging from these financial statements.  Although an
official with the title of Auditor Fiscal, appointed by the Council of the



- 5 -
District of Bogota and charged with a pre-audit of all payments, continually
checks the EAAB's figures, the accounts had never been audited by an external
auditing firm until the recently completed audit of the 1967 accounts.  Ac-
counts were mostly kept on a cash basis. Capitalization of costs, such as
engineering by EAAB's staff, was arbitrary. The recently terminated physical
inventory of materials in stock was the first in the EAAB's history.
3.13      Accounting consultants have just terminated a review of the EAAB's
accounting system and a more functional system proposed by them should be
introduced shortly. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the EAAB will implement the new accounting system within one year.
3.14      The accounting consultants, Fermin Paba and Cia Ltda., have re-
cently been appointed with the Bank's agreement as the EAAB's external
auditors. A meaningful external audit could only be made on the basis of
the financial statements as of December 31, 1967. The 1967 auditors' renort
has been received by the Bank and is satisfactory. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that the EAAB's accounts will be audited annually
by an auditing firm acceptable to the Bank. The function of the Auditor
Fiscal has to be maintained because of legal requirements.
3.15      The EAAB does not have a meaningful internal audit.  Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that an internal audit section will
be established within one year.
Revaluation of Fixed Assets
3.16      The EAAB has recently revalued its fixed assets using the
following four methods:
(a)  An estimated average annual depreciation in the value of
the peso of 8 percent starting in 1959 for sewerage
investments since that year;
(b) reproduction costs for a small part of water distribution
assets, and for all sewerage assets built before 1959;
(c)  the increase in the dollar exchange rate starting in
1939 for all other water supply investments; and
(d)  the current value for land owned by the EAAB.
3.17      This revaluation resulted in a rate base that is far more indicative
of the current value of the fixed assets than the old book value. It can be
used pending the time when proper arrangements are made for revaluing the
assets of public utilities in Colombia (see also paragraphs 3.25 and 3.26).
3.18      The EAAB's audited balance sheet as of December 31, 1967, before
and after revaluation, is shown in Annex 2. This balance sheet, after re-
valuation, represents adequately the EAAB's present financial position.

Billing and Collections
3.19      The EAAB's billing and collections deteriorated markedly during
1965, partly due to the difficulties encountered when changing over to
electronic data processing, and the accounts receivable for water and sewer-
age services increased to more than six months billings. Procedures were
imnroved in 1966, and, at the end of 1967, gross accounts receivable from
private consumers had been reduced to two months billings. Other accounts
receivable increased during 1966 due to improved accounting and certain items
formerly not accounted for were taken up in the books for the first time.
The bi-monthly meter reading and billing procedures are being improved with
the assistance of an expert consulting firm.  The latest figures indicate
non-revenue water (difference between total water produced and total billed)
at 28 percent, comnared with 33 percent in 1Q66.
3.20      Partly due to improved cut-off' Brocedures, collections on private
accounts are now considered good with nearly 100 nercent being collected with-
in four to six months. Collections from governnment entities are a different
matter and less than 50 percent of the anounts billed were collected during
1967.  However, a recent budget apnroTriation has settled the overdue debt
and assurances have been obtained that the Government and deTendent entities
will henceforth budget sufficient funds for prompt paymTent of their bills.
Canitalization
3.21      Total canitalization of the hAAE, as of December 31, 1967, after
the revaluation discussed above, is as follows:
Million Colt
Long-Term Debt
Bonds                                                45
Foreign exchange debt                                 3
Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IvI)                48
Other                                                14
Total Long-Term Debt                     110
Contributions in aid of construction                206
Revaluation surnlus                                 349
Other equity and earned surDlus                     322
Total Eauity                              877
Total Canitalization                     987



- 7 -
3.22      The small foreign exchange debt consists of the balance (Col$2
million equivalent) of a Japanese supplier's credit and of a US-AID loan
(Col$l million equivalent) for sewerage engineering and equipment. The
EAAB's peso debt at the end of 1967 amounted to Col$107 mill-'on, less than
half of which consists of bonds, issued in the t'eriod 1955-65, and partly
refinanced in recent years.  These bonds, originallv amounting to Col$76
million, are held by the Stabilization Fune of the Banco de la Republica,
with the Banco Central Hipotecario acting as trustee.  They were guaranteed
by a mortgage on all the fixed assets of the EAAB existing in 1955. How-
ever, in order to avoid the comDlications of subordinating this security
to the Bank or of giving the Bank pari passu treatment, the mortgaged assets
have been released with the exceDtion of a mortgage on an old treatment plant
and reservoir, maintained because of legal requirements.  A Col$65 million
loan of US-AID counterpart funds, channeled through the Instituto de Fomento
Industrial (ITFI), was granted in 1966 for the first stage of the sewerage
masterplan works. Col$45 million of this had been drawn at the end of 1967.
Col$3 million of a short-tern. IFI loan of Col$7 million for the procurement
of meters had also been utilized.
C. Rate Policy
3.23      Rates of public services are subfect to the approval of the Super-
intendencia de Regulacion Economica. Although the Suoerintendencia is inde-
pendent by law, it is in fact an arency of the Ministry of Development. The
Minister of Development is the Chairman of the Council oP the Suuerintendencia.
Increases in rates do not require previous approval of the Council of the
District of Bogota.
3.24      There has been no established public utility tariff policy in
Colombia.  However, a resolution of 1°66 of the SuDerintendencia applicable
to water and sewerage only formulated general criteria for rate increases.
'The resolution established that water and sewerage rates should cover all
costs includingl depreciation and paivment of loans and that. according to
a certain formula, reserves should be formed for future extensions an(d
improvements.
3.25      Tariff regulation in Colombia should be simplified.  A mechanism
should be established for periodic rate review, say once a year, and adjust-
ments based on objective criteria should follow, if required, within a re-
asonable period.  For determrining the adequacy of tariffs, a realistic
rate of return criterion should be used, since it provides a satisfactory
measure of nerrormance and can be easily apolied.  This imnlies, however,
that arrangements would be made for periodic revaluation of assets with an
objective mechanism for doing so, and for uniformity in accounting and the
institution of national standards to that puroose.
3.26      The subject of public utility regulation has been discussed at
len7th between the Bank and officials of the Government. The Government
agreed to study modifications along the above lines with a view to formulating
by mid-1969 a new national public utility tariff policy. Bearing in mind that
it will take at least until that time before a suitable policy is adonted that
includes provisions for the revaluation of assets and other factors indicated



above, the loan documents contain a rate covenant based on a minimum rate of
return on reasonably valued assets, and aT agreed method .or period review
(paragraph 7.13).
D. Income Frorn Rates and Other Sources
Water and _Sewerage Rates
3.27      Total income from sales amounted to Col$64 million in 1967.  Prior
to the most recent rate increase of April 1968, rates had been increased
three times in the past 15 years:  in 105h, 1961 and 1965.  In 1965 a sepa-
rate rate for sewerage services was eliminated and since then the rate covers
both water and sewerage services. The 1965 rate increase resulted in a 50
percent increase of the average rate billed to a level of about Col$0.60/m3
(US$0o.14/1000 gallons) and the ATpril 196b iincrease is expected to yield an
averap:e rate billed of about Co1$l.l/Or,3 (US80.26/lo0o  zallons), representing
an increase of about 80 percent. The new rates are considered within the
capacity and willingness to pay of the di,>f'erent categories of consumers
and are comDarable to rates in other cities ir Colombia. The new average
of US$0.26/100( gallons comoares with 7SC, t7/lOO  gallons in Caracas and
US80.38/1000 gallons in Singanore, where the systems are more costly to
operate.
3.28      A comparison of the old and the new rates (Annex 4) shows also a
considerable improvement and simp11ification of the rate structure.  The pre-
vious rate structure had an inderinite number of customer categories, denend-
ing on the assessed value of the nronerty connected to the system but did not
distincguish between domestic and com_mercial-industrial customers.  The new
rate structure not only introduces such  distinction but limits also the number
of categories depending on proDerty valuati n to five for domestic and three
for commercial-industrial custom.ers,  Furthermore, it reduces the allowance
for consumption under the minlmurm.= charge thus resulting in water bills that
will reflect more accurately the customer's consumntion.  This, coupled with
progressive charges for consumption in excess of the allowance, should make
the customers more cost-conscious and should heln to reduce water wastage
(paragraph 6.05). The EAAB has given assurances that it will further simplify
the system of charges as soon as :mnrovements in metering, part of the pro-
posed project (paragraph 5,04-D), will nermit an even more consu-ption
oriented rate structure.
Other Sources of Income
3.29      The two most important other sources of income are the following
'derechos", which increased at about the same rate as the income from water
sales:



- 9 -
(a)   Derechos de Abastecimiento" or "Derechos de Matricula',
defined as the value collected from the consumer for the
right to obtain a connection to the system. This charge
is equal to 3 percent of the value of the property to be
connected or, in case of a new construction, 3 percent of
the estimated cost: these derechos amounted to Col$23.5
million during 1967, and
(b)  "Derechos de Urbanizacion" or 'Derechos de Suministro"
and 'Derechos de Desague", which are charges levied upon
land develoners and denend on the extent of the area to
be served by the system. They amoumted to Col$5 million
in 1967.
The costumer also has to pay the cost of the connection, the meter, etc.,
which is included under "contributions in aid of construction".
E.  Past Earnings
3.30      It is estimated that the EAAB's real return on revalued assets
during the neriod 1961-67 averaged about 3 percent instead of the 9 percent
shown in the financial statements in Annexes 2 and 3. The return for 1967
was 3 percent. Gross income, including the "derechos" (paragraph 3.2Q)
increased from Col$34 million in 1Q61 to Col$95 million in 1967.  Operating
costs quadrupled in this period, mainly because of higher salaries and
waages due to inflation and increase in needed staff. Rate increases have
always been rut into effect timely enough to cone with increased operating
costs but only a modest return was maintained.
F.  ____lv Area and Existing Facilities
3.31      Bogota is situated at an altitude of 2,600 m on a plain, known
as the Sabana de Bogota, on the western slopes of the Cordillera Oriental
of the Andes. It is by far the largest urban area of the country, with a
nopulation of about 2.0 million.  The citv extends over an area of 16,000
ha, resulting in a low average ponulation density of 125/ha. The average
annual rainfall is 980 mm; average temperature, almost uniform throughout
the year, is 140c (580F).
3.32      The existing water supDly facilities (see Annexes 5 and 10 and
Maps 1, 2 and 3) have a total annual average capacity of 5.5 m3/sec pro-
vided by two major schemes, namely the Tibito I scheme (4.0 m3/sec) and
the Tunjuelo scheme (1.2 m3/sec), and some minor schemes (o.3 m3sec).  The
latter will be nhased out as major future schemes come into service.
3.33      The growth of the Bogota water supply system during the past
30 years is illustrated in the following table:

1055             950          74              1,009                   52
1965           1,600         160              2,260                  122
1967           2,100         181-             2,710                  157
3.34      The EAAB is the only water supply agency within the city limits
and does not at present supply water to areas outside the city.  Only some
small areas, mostly with unauthorized dwellings in the high lyinp southern
sectors of the city, representing less than 3 percent of the total population,
are not connected to the system. Rationing Is in force and the present supply
deficit is estimated to be between 15 and 20 nercent.  To supnlement the EAAB
supply, some customers, nainly industries. hrve individual wells.  However,
because of the unsatisfactory Froiundwater ouality, these wells are likely to
be abandoned as soon as the water shortage has been overcome.
4.  THE LONG--ANGE PROGATi.
4.01      Since 1966, the Bank had been prenared to appraise a water supply
project in Bogota, as soon as an acceptable feasibility study was available.
A first review of the situation by a Bank mission at that time showed that
the then pronosed projects were not suitable (naragraph 6.o6). The Bank
recommended that there first be a lon.-range master plan on which the selection
of a first-stage nroject could be based,
4.0o2     This master plan was submitted in mid-1967.  Covering the period
until the vear 2000 it includes a demana study and identifies potential
water supply sources in the vicinity of Bogota.  The following table shows
the most suitable schemes and the tentative order and timing for their
imnlementation (see also Map 1, Demand Calculations Annex 6 and granh

4.03      The studies comnleted to date show that the first order of priority
is the Tibito II scheme (paragrap)hs 6.07-6.10), but further work has still to
be done to confirm the sequence of work for the remainder of the neriod 1968-
78. The program beyond the first ten years is inevitably tentative.  In any
case, it has been established that there are sufficient water sources within
distances of not more than 50-75 km from Bogota. to, cover any foresseable
water demand, even with the high projected growth rates, and to supply most
of this water by gravity, in spite of the high altitude of Bogota.
4.04      Development of the Chinraza, Sumapaz and Suarez schemes would
result in transfers from outside river basins into the Sabana of Bogota of
up to three times the flow of the Bogota River. This would be of benefit
to other sectors, such as irrigation and, especially, power generation
in the Bogota region. It is expected that these beneficiaries will share
in the cost of implementing these schemes.
1/   More recent data seem to indicate a probable yield of the Chingaza
Teusaca scheme of 15-20 m3/sec, more than double the yield assume in
the 1967 master plan.

5.  THI  PROPOSED PROJ..CT
A.  Descriotion
5.01      TIŽ eroject would consist of (i) construction of the Tibito IIA
scheme, (ii) prenaration of the subsequent project, including Tibito IIB,
and of future projects; and (iii) improvement of the EAAB's oDerations.
5.02      The  'Tibito TIA scheme is basically a dulnlication of the existing
Tibito I scheme bv increasing its numpin,_ treatment and transmission capa-
city from 4.0 m3/sec to 7.0 m3/sec, without recuiring any new catchment works,
such as reservoirs. A detailed description of the scheme is given in Annex
10. Its main elements are:
Stage 1 (emerRency works, to be comDleted in early 1969):
Construction of a booster naimu.nisng station at Tibito,
Stage 2 (main works, to be comsleted in 10971,):
(a)  Additions to the raw wate-r Dumi ng and treatment facilities
at Tibito.
(b)  A 62 km nioeline (78-inch) from Tibito to the city and
through the western suourbs to the southern city limits.
(c)  Distribution works: two storage tanks, about 50 km
distribution trunk lines anld partial. renovation of the
existing secondanr s:ystem.
5.03      The preparations for the suubseauent and other future Drojects
would consist of:
(ah  construction of: an access road into the Chingaza area;
(b) feasibility studies of the Cantarrana and the Chingaza-
Teusaca scheres;
(c)  design and preparation of sT,ecifications for Tibito I-B
and for the selected subsecuent scheme (Cantarrana or
Chingaza-Teusaca).
(d)  -further investigations of- cther future schemes, such as
the Sumapaz and. the Alto Suarez schemes. and.
(e)  land acquisitiop for the selected subseauent scheme.
Construction of the subsequent project is exo)ected to start in 1971, at
which time financing for this uroject would, have to be secured.  Therefore,
the Bank project would cover tlese prep ar-tilons only thro,ugh 1970.



- 13 -
5.04      Imnrovements of the EAAB's operations are urgently needed, especi-
ally in view of the projected further growth of the system, and the following
items would be included in the Droject:
(a)  maintenance and construction enuijment, including snecial
purpose vehicles:
(b)  water meters and meter rerair equirment: and
(c)  various other ecuinment, such as for leak detection,
communications, pressure control, drilling, etc.
B. Cost Estimates
5.05      Total cost of the project is estimated to be about Col$590 million
(equivalent to about US*35.3 million), including interest durinR construc-
tion on all loans. The cost estimates are summarized below. Details are
given in Annex 8, page 1, which also shows the expenditures year by year
during the construction and disbursement period 1968 through 1971.

5.o6      The cost estimates are based on the consultants' feasibility
study, and on additional information provided by the EAAB. They were up-
dated in January 1968, after completion of bidding on the two major contracts,



- lh 
(i) the pipeline manufacture and installation; and (ii) t1he pumning equip-
ment sunDly.  The local cost of engineering includes the work performed by
the EAAB staff related to the project.  The estimated foreipn cost of
engineering is for special engineering services whaich will be provided by for-
eign consultants as local firms did not have the necessary experience. The
contingencies provide a margin of 10 nercent for items with completed bidding
( except for the Dineline installation) and of 20 percent both for the re-
maining items of the Tibita IIA schen.e, and for the Dipeline installation.
The cost estimates and the underlying assumnotions are reasonable.
C.  Engineering and Supervision
Tibito II Scheme
5.07      Ingetec Ltda. (paragraph 1.05) is in charge of coordination and
programming of the project.  Preparation of final design and sDecifications
of the various parts of the project has been, or will be, contracted with
several local and foreign firms, includinm  Inretec. A list of the firms
contracted to date is given in Annex 10.
Subsequent and Other Future Pro;ects
5.08      Feasibility studies for the Cantarrana ard the Chingaza-Teusaca
schemes should be completed by early 1099 and final design of the selected
scheme by the end of 1970.  These studies and further preliminary investi-
gations of other potential future schemes, such as the Sumapaz and the Alto
Suarez schemes will be carried out b' a consortium  of Colombian consulting
firms, including and coordinated by Ingetec.
D. Constructi-on Schedule
5.09      The construction schetlule (see Control Network, Annex 9) shows
four ma,jor target dates for completion of certain portions of the Tibito IIA
scheme:
Februarv 1969  Booster pur,iTinc station Tibito
February 1970  New water numpinn  anrd treatment units
January 1971   P-peline (the critical work)
June 1971       Distribution worsk
E.  Procurement
5.10      All contracts for enuiinment suprly and civil works are being
awarded on the basis of international cornretitive bidding.  With the excent-
ion of bidding for construction of the storage tanks and installation of the
distribution mains, bidding should hb  comoleted bv the end of l)98.  The
proposed Bank and joint loans would finance the actual foreign exchange
cost of imported equipment and consultinF services. and the import comnonent

of civil works contracts.  This latter import component would be agreed
upon between the EAAB, the consultants and the Bank for each contract after
the award.  It would include depreciation of imnorted equioment to the ex-
tent used for the project. Should there be any savings over estimated
foreIgn exchange costs, it is pronosed that the excess portion of the Bank
loan would be cancelled, unless the circumstances prevailing at the time
this decision is taken justify apnlyinz these funds to additional work,;.
5.11      In view of the ur7ency of this project, and the need to have
reasonably accurate figures to establish the foreign exchange requirements
and consequently the amount of the Bank and joint loans, it was agreed that
the EAAB proceed with bidding for, and awards of, the critical contracts as
soon as nossible and prior to a-proval of the loani by the Bank.  The EAAB,
while complying fully with the Bank's bidding procedures, was, of course,
aware that it was proceeding at its own risk and that this agreement did not
constitute arny commitment by the Bank to finance.  Contracts awarded to date
total US$13.9 million equivalent: of this the Bank and joint lenders would
finance US$7.8 million eauivalent (Annex 8, page 2).
5.12      It is Droposed that the Bank reimburse the EAAB for foreign exchange
payments made on engineerinR contracts (Annex 10) uD to one year prior to
approval of the loan by the Bank's Executive Directors.  Foreign exchange
payments by the SAAB that would become eligible for reimbursem.ent under this
provision are about US$50,000 as of this date, but may increase because of
further payments nrior to the date of loan approval.
5.13      Originally, it had also been intended that the Bank reimburse the
FAAD for foreign exchange payments made on equipment supply and civil works
contracts up to four months prior to approval of the loan. However, as of
M;ay 1, 1968 no foreign exchange payments have been made on such contracts
but downDayments on certain contracts already awarded may become due prior
to the date of loan approval. It is proposed to reimburse the foreign
exchaiigfe con.-Donent of any such payments but these are not expected to exceed
US$500,000.
5.14      The EAAB is exempted from the payment of import duties.  Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that the Government will act promptly
upon all applications by the SAAB for import licenses on goods for this project.
6. JUSTIFICATION
A. Imrortance of Project
6.01      Bogota is the largest and fastest-crowing city and the main com-
mercial and administrative center of the country. It has also become the
most important industrial rerion. Adenuate public services are a pre-
condition to cope with this rapid development. A safe water supply is
an important infrastructural factor and will influence the attractiveness
of Bogota for further expansion of the industrial and commercial sectors.



- 16 -
6.02      The city has been suffering an increasin fl water shortage since
1963.  This shortage was only temnporarily reduced earl> in 1967 upon com-
nletion of the Usacjuen booster numning station, the first>  ~'~erency
oroject". The average annual shortagee is estimated to be between 15 and
20 nercent at Dresent, but is much higher during the dry seasons of the year.
Because equal rationing is dif'icult due to the structure and conditions of
the distribution system, the shortare is felt particularly in the highly popu-
latedi and industrial southern sectors of the citv.
6.03      There is a serious backlog in the development of the Bogota water
supply, not only in comparison with the situation in the other larger cities
of Colombia, but also compared with other sectors of local development
(sewerage, financed by US-AID, Power - two Bank loans in 1961 and 1963;
urban transportation - construction of a large program has started).  Hence
-the imnrovement and expansion of water supplv is not only essential for
benefits directly related to an adequate water service, such as health
asnects and fire protection, but also for the general economic development
of the city.
B.  Demanrd and Surr7v Pro,ections
6.o4      A detailed demand study has been- part of the long-range master
Dlan prepared by Ingetec in 1956/67 (see Annexes 6 and 7).  The oronosed
project (Tibito ITA) will increase the installed capacity fromr 5.5 m3/sec
to 8.5 rm3/sec; (55 percent) by 1971,  While this increase is too small to
cover both the already existing deficit and the assumed demand increase,
it will at least keen the water shcrtag2e ,ithin certain limits (between 15
and 20 percent) until l973.  Thereafter, upnon completion of the subsequent
schemes the shortage will be gradually reduced.  Full coverage of the demand
is not expected before 1977, the tentative completion date of Chingaza I.
6.05       While the demand estimates anppear reasonable, the new rates might,
as intended, keep the actual demand below the estimates and thus reduce the
calculated deficit (paragraph 3.28 and Annex  ).  The deficit could be fur-
ther reduced, and perhaps overcome, by utilizing the peak and stand-by capa-
ci-ies of the Tibito I + TI  schbernes whenever more water is available in the
Botzota river at Tibito than 9.0 A3/sec (nominal- water right of the EAAB of
8.0 m3/sec rlus 1.0 m3/sec required for downstreeam' use; see Annex 10).
C.  Selection of the Project
6,o6      Originally, the BAA  Dresented to the Bank (i) a serarate develop-
ment of a 1.0 m3/sec Teusaca scheme and (ii) a Neusa-Tibito nipeline as
emergency projects. Neither of them, however, was considered suitable.
The 'Teusaca scheme would have provided only 1.0  m3/sec at an exorbitant
cost (paragraph 6.08) and the 1N1eusa-Tibito uineline would only have saved
the cost of treating and punm-ing 1X0 m /sec, but would not have resulted
in an actual increase in sunply.



- 17 -
6.07      Once those schemes were discarded, the question was which scheme
should take their place. The choice fell on Tibito II for two reasons.
The first reason was that Tibito II had been adequately prepared and was
ready for execution. It would thus be completed in 3-4 years whereas
alternative schemes would take 5-6 years for preparation and construction.
This was an important consideration given the urgent need for additional
water resources and the fact that Tibito IIb while not eliminating the
water shortage, could keep it within reasona.ble liiits.
6.o8      The second reason was that available information, while not
adequate for a full economic comparison, was sufficient to suggest that
Tibito II was the least cost project capable of keeping the shortage with-
in limits. A comparison of the preliminary total and unit cost figures 1/
shows the following:

Yield   Total Cost      Cost Der m /sec

IIB              1.0        5.4         5.4        7.3
Cantarrana                       2.0        21.8                   10.9

1/   Excluding distribution and other works, required for all schemes.
6.o0      Differences in oneratini costs cannot be determined to date, but
are expected to be small and would not alter results materially. The actual
unit cost of Tibito II is even lower than indicated above because an additional
4.0 m3/sec peak and stand-by canacity can and will be used from time to time
(Annex 10).  Other advantages of this scheme are the simplicity of its design
(duplication, and utilization of spare capacity, of Tibito I), the absence
of land acquisition problems, and the elimination of the need to construct
new reservoirs and intake facilities.
6.10      On the basis of the new rates (paragraphs 3.27 and 3.28), the mini-
mum internal rate of return of the Droposed project. as an increment to the
existinr system, is estimated to be 15 percent. Assuming further rate in-
creases, scheduled for 1971 and 1972 in the financial projections, and the
completion of the Tibito II scheme (by includinR Tibito ITB in 1973: para-
graphs 4.02 and 6.08), the internal rate of return is estimated to ranFe from
18 - 21 percent.

7.02      Net internal cash generation is expected to cover 20 percent cf
the total requirements during the construction period, which anount to
around US$75 million equivalent.  This percentage takes into account the
recent rate increase and a second rate increase by January 1971 (see para-
graphs 3.27, 3.28 and 7.11).
7.03      Besides some contributions from the government and other public
entities (see Annex 12, paragraph 4), equity contributions would consist
of contributions in aid of construction, mostly from developers, and a
property improvement tax, called "Valorizacion"', for the cost of the sewer-
age works now being executed. This tax is based on the philosonhy that
owners of real estate, whose proDerty increases in value because of public
works benefiting them, should participate in the financing of these works.
'Valorizacion' has already been an important source of funds to the District
of Bogota for road construction. In other Colotnbian cities it has also
successfully been anDlied in recovering the cost of other Dublic services
like sewerage.
7.04      The nronosed Bank loan of US$14 million equivalent is expected to
cover about 40 percent (total external financing 49 percent) -,f total project
cost, includina interest during construction, and about 18 percent of total
requirements during the construction period.  Based on the nature of the nro-
ject and the EAAB's future financial position, taking into account substantial
future borrowings, a 20-vear term is proposed for the loan including a four
and a half year grace period.  For purposes of the financial calculations
an interest rate of 6¼4 percent and a commitment charge of 3/4 of one percent
on the unwithdrawn balance has been assured.
7.05      Based on the nresent status of procurement, the following joint
loans may become available for contracts already awarded (paragranh 1.0-3 and
Annex 8, nage 2):
Countrv                   Contracts                 Amount Joint l,oan
(IJS4 million)
U. S. A.       PiDeline and Engineering                    2.40
U. K.          Steel Wire and Valves
(sub-order for pipeline)                 0.65
Japan          Steel Sheets
(sub-order for pipeline)                 0.60
Germany        Pmnps and Pumping Equipment                 0.55
4.20
7.06      The ultimate amount of joint loans for this project will only be
known when all contracts have been awarded and all suborders placed. Although
predictions are difficult at this stage, additional joint loans may increase
the total anount up to US$5-6 million.  On the other hand, not all of the above
mentioned joint loans for contracts already awarded are fully assured. In -
determining the amount of the proposed Bank loan it was therefore considered
prudent to assume joint loans of USSi3.0 million only.  The proposeAd  ank loan
of US$14.0 million would be reduced to the extent joint loans would exceed
USI3.0 million.  For the purposes of making the financial projections, the



- 20 -
joint loans have been assumed to carry 7 percent interest with a 10-year
amortization period starting in 1970. Amortization of the pronosed Bank loan
would be adapted to the repayment requirements of the joint lenders in a way
which would result in a repayment schedule as close as nossible to that which
would have resulted had the Bank financed the entire amount of US$17.0 million.
7.07      The future foreign exchange loans have been assumed to cover the
foreign exchange requirements of the second water supply program starting in
1971.
7.08      Other loans consist of a small US-AID loan of about US$0.5 mil-
lion for engineering and equipment required for the expansion of the sewer-
age system, and withdrawals from a snecial revolving fund for short-term
financing (three years) of extensions to the distribution system.  With-
drawals fror this fund have been assumed to amount to Col$60 million.
7.09      The balance of the requirements, arounting to Col$319 million
(26 nercent of total renuirements), has been assured by the Government to
be provided either by, or through, the Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI)
in the form of 20-year loans or from budgetary sources.
7.10      The financing plan is satisfactory.  The EAAB, because of its
extremely low debt equity ratio at present, is capable of incurring sub-
stantial debt.  The debt equitv ratio at the end o0 the construction period
has been project at 32:68 which is still fairly low.
B.   Future Earnings and Financial Position
7.11      Under the assumptions mentioned in detail in Annex 12, the EAAB
is expected to earn a rate of return which would average 6 percent during
the Deriod 1968-1970. Under the return requirerient of 9 percent (paragraph
7.13) a rate increase of 30 Percent has been projected for 1971, when major
benefits of the project should start to be felt. Another rate increase would
be required in the following year.
7.12      Other highlights of the Projected financial performance are as
follows:
(a.) the ratio of operating costs including depreciation to
gross income would vary between 63 and 71 percent during the
period 1968-1973. The orerating costs have been projected
conservatively and take into account increases in price
levels, as exoerienced in the past;



- 21 -
(b) salaries and sages including social benefits, etc.,
would continue to be about 65 percent of total operatingr
costs. This is normal in view of the fact that the EAAB's
water sunDrly system requires very little pum-ing and is
consequently labor intensive,
(c)  debt service coverage, which would average 3:1 during the
construction period, would decrease to 2:1 thereafter,
which is satisfactorv: and
(d)  the debt enuity ratio would increase from 10:90 in 1967
to 38:62 in 1973.
C.   Financial Covenants Pronosed for the Loan
7.13      Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the EAAB's
income from water sales and "derechos' will yield a return on average net
fixed assets in oneration of 5 nercent during the construction period; there-
after, when water service has improved, which is expected by 1971, the EAAB
should maintain its rates and "derechos" at levels that will yield a rate
of return of at least 9 percent. The adeouacy of rates will be reviewed and,
if necessary, ad.justed quarterlv. Fixed assets will be revalued reriodically
as follows:
All assets in oneration on December 31, 1967 and assets
commissioned since then and financed with local currency:
in accordance with a mutually agreed upon local cost
index;
Assets commissioned since January 1, 1968 and financed with
foreign currency:
in accordance with the US$ exchange rate.
7.14      Because of the heavy indebtedness which the EAAB will have to incur
to finance the proDosed and future projects, a debt limitation covenant is
also reauired. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that, with-
out Bank approval, the EAAB will not incur any indebtedness unless its maxi-
mnum debt service requirements on existing and pronosed new debt are covered
at least 1.5 times.

8.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECON>VENDATIONS
8.01      The pronosed project consists of:
(i)  construction of the Tibito !!A scheme;
(ii)  preparation of future schemes, including engineering
for the subsequent project. and
(iii)  improvement of the borrower's operations.
The Tibito IIA scheme is the first stage of a long-range master plan and is
the only feasible solution to the water supply problem until about 1973. It
will increase the capacity of the Bogota water supnly from 5.5 to 8.5 m3/sec
(55 percent) and provide the basis for future exnansions.
8.02      Total cost of the project is estimated to be US 35,3 million
equivalent with foreign exchange recuirements of UST.17 3 million.  The cost
estimates are reasonable.
8.03      The project is technically sound; the construction program and
the financing plan are acceptable and the arrangements for design, procure-
ment, construction and supervision are satisfactory.
8,o4      The proposed borrower is the Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado
de Bogota (EAAB). The EAAB is considered a suitable borrower, having made
satisfactory progress over the past two years in improving management and
administration.  The E4AB has agreed to, and made arrangements for, an annual
audit of its accounts by an independent auditing firm acceptable to the Bank.
8.05      After the initial increase in the average water and seweraJ2e rate
of about 80 percent, presently being implemented, the financial position of
the EAAB should be satisfactory until a second rate increase in 1971, the
final year of the construction period.
8.o6      It is pronosed that the Bank reimburse the EAAR for foreign ex-
change payments made on (i  engineering contracts ur to one year prior to
apDroval of the loan by the Bank's Executive Directors, and (ii) for the
foreign exchange component of downnayments on equipment supnly and civil
works contracts which may become due after \N.r 1, 1968 but Drior to a-pproval
of the loan.
8.07      During negotiations of the proDosed Bank loan, satisfactory
assurances have been obtained on the following:
(1)  Staff requirements will be re,riewed. annually withl the
Bank (paragrarh 3.06).
(2)  New appointments to the posts of general manager or sub-
manager will not be made without consultation with the
Bank (paragraph 3.09).



- 23 -
(3) New accounting, budaet control and management reporting
systems will be imolemented and an internal audit section
will be established within one year (paragraphs 3.10, 3.13
and 3.15).
(4) T'he accounts of the EAAB will continue to be audited annually
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph
3.114).
(5) The Government and dependent entities will henceforth budget
sufficient funds for prompt payments of their bills (para-
graph 3.20).
(6)  The EAAB will set and maintain rates for the sale of water
adequate to permit, coupled with certain other revenues,
a rate of return of at least 5 percent during construction
of the project and of 9 percent thereafter. A method for
periodic review of the adequacy of rates and assets valuation
has been agreed to (paragraph 7.13).
(7)  The EAAB will not incur indebtedness without apnroval by the
the Bank unless its maximum debt service requirements are
covered at least 1.5 times (paragraph 7.14).
8.08      Under the above arrangements the proposed project provides a suit-
able basis for a Bank loan of US$14.0 million equivalent, including interest
during construction, for a neriod of 20 years, including a four and a half
year grace period. This amount has been calculated under the assumption that
joint lenders will provide at least US$3.0 million equivalent. The Bank loan
would be reduced to the extent joint loans would exceed US$3 million eouivalent
(paragraph 7.06).

COLOMBIA - BOGOTA WATER SIJPPLY PROJECT
Existing Facilities
(Water Sunply end Sewerage)
A.   WATER SUPPLY
Rio San Francisco and Other Secondary_Schemes
1.        The Rio San Francisco scheme, with the San Diego treatment plant,
was the first public water supply for Bogota. It was constructed in 1886
and has a safe yield of 0.2 m3/sec. The Rio San Francisco originates in
the mountain slopes east of the citv and flows through the city to the
Bogota River. The scheme is obsolete and only conserved because of the
severe water shortage in the high pressuire zone. A number of other small
water courses (La Vieja, La Osa, Santa Lsabel, Arzobispo) are being utilized
for the supply of certain high-lying areas. Their total average yield is
not more than 0.1 m3/sec.
Tunjuelo Scheme (Mao 1)
2.        The Tunjuelo scheme is the older of the two principal schemes.
It was constructed in 1924 and later expanded to its present capacity of
1.2 m3/sec.  It is a gravity scheme, drawing water 25 km south of the city
from the Tunjuelo River. The river is partly regulated by three snall reser-
voirs (Regadera, Chisaca, Tunjos), all constructed and operated by the EAAB,
with a total stora7e of 11 million m3.  The water is treated at the city
limits in the Vitelma plant, and supplied to the high pressure zone.
Tibito I Scheme (MaDs 1, 2, 3 and Annex 10)
3.        The Tibito I scheme, construieted in 1956-59, draws water from the
Bogota River at Tibito, 35 km north of the city. upstream of the point where
industrial and domestic wastes start to pollute the river.  Upstream Tibito
are three reservoirs (Sisga, Guatavita, Neusa), total storage 890 milliom mi3,
operated by the Bogota Power Company (EEEB) and the Corporacion Autonoma
Regional de la Sabana (CAR) respectively.  CAR is the regional authority
in charge of allocation and control of water resources. The EAAB has a
water right of 6.0 m3/sec on the Bogota river at Tibito.
4.        After passing through a presedimentation basin, the raw water is
Dumied to the treatment olant, 100 m above the river.  The main elements of
the plant are Dre-aeration, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration.
The plant was designed for an ultimate capacity of 6.0 m3/sec the existing
facilities being the first-staae with a nominal capacity of 3.0 m3/sec.
5.        A  35 km transmission line (60-inch) with a gravity capacity of
2.5 m3/sec conveys the water to the city.  A booster Dumping station,
Usaquen, at the northern city limits was comoleted in 1967 and increased
the pipeline canacity to 4.0 m3/sec. The Tibito I scheme supplies the low
and the major part of the intermediate pressure zones.

ANNEX 5
Page 2
Distribution System
6.        The system is divided into three pressure zones.  By far the
largest is the lower zone, comprising the flat central and western city
sectors; the intermediate and high pressure zones extend in two narrow
stretches along the mountain slones in the eastern part of the city.
7.        Total length of existing mains is about 2,600 km.  Only 10 per-
cent of the mains have diameters equal or larger than 10-inch;  only 2 9er-
cent larger than 20-inch: This deficiency in the carrying capacity of the
mains contributes to the present sunply difficulties.
8.        The total volume of the four major st6rage tanks is 250,000 m3,
more than 50 percent of the average present daily supply. However, pres-
sures in their feeding lines are often too low to fill these tanks and
normal operation to regulate hourly demand variations is difficult.
9.        Rationing is done by dividing the system into isolated sectors
which, following a rotating schedule, receive water during certain hours
every day. To overcome the rationing, most of the buildings Iive individual
storage tanks, as required by the EAAB.
B.   SEWERAGE
10.       The sewerage system serves about 70 percent of the present city
and is inadequate. The older part of' the city has a combined sanitary and
storm sewage; the newer areas have a separated system. The situation is
particularly serious in the western sectors of the city, where the sewage
from the central and eastern sectors is collected in open ditches and
natural water courses discharging, without prior treatment, in the Bogota
river in about 5 km distance from the city. The resulting pollution of the
river affects its downstream use (including power generation).  Because of
tne lack of adenuate sewerage in the western sectors, the city has spread
mainly in a north-south direction.
11.       A master plan for expansion of the sewage system was prepared in
1962 by Camp, Dresser & McKee, a U.S. consulting firm, followed by a first-
stage feasibility study in 1964. Construction of the first stage started
in 1967 and will be completed by the end of 1968. A feasibility study for
the second stage has been prepared. Because of the simultaneous construction
of the water supply project, and unless the overall financial situation of
the EAAB would improve above expectations, construction of the second stage,
although urgentl.y needed, will be soread over a five-year period, 1969
through 1973.
12.       Various sewage treatment alternatives are being investigated in
a small pilot plant, particularly the use of sewage lagoons instead of
standard treatment. Construction of sewage treatment facilities is scheduled
for a later stage, after 1975. Until then, pollution of the Bogota river
will increase substantially because of (i) the increased water supply and

Notes:  1)  Per capita, annual and average demand are expressed in groEs figures, including losses estimated at 15-20%.
2)  The projections are based on thr following growth rates by decades
Period                     Pop-la-ion    Per Capita Demand          Demand
1950 - 1960                        100                21                 131
1960 - 1970                        105                20                 150
1970 - 198C                         86                26                 740
1980 - 199O                         60                18                  86
1990 - 2000                         33                 6                  42
The consultants' detailed demand study includes sensitivity tests with lower and higher rates than above; however, their effect is of
a tangible magnitude only after 1973.
3) Demand variations are estimated as follows:
Peak day                  1.25-1.30 (lower than normally because of cool and unifcrm  olimate in Bogota).
Annual average
Peak hour
Daily average         =   2.0 (comparable witn similar systems).
4)  The old rate structure did not permit and the statistics do not shoa- a breakdown of the consumption by customer categories.
The new rate structure, coupled with improved meter reading and data processing, will facilitate a better control of consumption
( and losses).
5)  For the deficit projections 1967-1973, the "IAvailable Supplv" has been assumed as much as 15 percent below  the "Installed Capacity'
'zecause:
(i) additional capacities cannot be absorbed i.edietely by the distribution syaten, Ls spiLe
of the water shortage;
Vii) continuous booster pumping on the transmission lines is rot possible; and
(iii)  demand variations cannot be fully  conoensoted bv available peak capacities.

B.   Basic Criteria
Booster Pumping
1.   As an emergency measure, and the only means to increase the available
supply to Bogota within one year, a booster pumping station would be con-
structed at Tibito to operate on the existing 60-inch pipeline, increasing
its eapacity from 4.0 m3/sec (with booster pumping at Usaquen, the end of the
pipeline) to about 5.0 m3/sec. However, the station would be designed for
operation under the future two-pipeline system and the following transmission
capacities in m3/sec would result under the different operating conditions:

Utilization of Spare Canac_ tin the Existing Treatment Plant
2.        The existing plant, comnleted in 1959, was designed for high
turbidity raw water. After comnletion of the large Guatavita reservoir
(690 million m3) by the Bogota Power Comnany (EEEB) in 1962, turbidity
decreased markedly from an annual average of 200 to 55 units and further
improvements are expected. It has now been established that (i) the
existing facilities can be unrated without any addition from 3.15 m3/sec
(original design) to at least 6.0 m3/sec, and (ii) expansion of the plant
to an ultimate tapacity of 10.5 m3/sec is likely to require not more than
a 50 percent expansion of the facilities. However, the uncertainty as to
what exactly will be required for this ultimate exnansion was one of the
main reasons for dividing the Tibito II scheme into two stages, ITA and IIB.
H1.>_ C_,_ _M
3.        The UEE's nower generation requires considerable seasonal vari-
ations of the Bogota river flow at Tibito. Full requlation of the annual
average flow of 12.5 m3/sec, while feasible with the available reservoirs,
is thus impossible. Even assuming a Derfect coordination of the reservoir
operation, the minimum flow at Tibito may be as low as 9.0 m3/sec.  Deducting
1.0 m3/sec requirements for downstream use, 8.0 m3/sec would remain as safe
yield for the EAAB's water suDnly operation.  This signifies that a large flow
potential is Dresently unused, and the nominal capacity of the EAAB's Tibito
system (at Dresent 4.0 m3/sec) could be doubled and peak canacity (at uresent
eaually 4.0 m.3/sec) tripled, withou; reouirinr new catchment works, such as
reservoirs. Peak capacities could be utilized during extended periods every
year when the river flow exceeds 9.0 m3/sec. The guaranteed minimum flow,
9.0 m3/sec under the present conditions, could be substantially increased
and regulation of the river improved, as soon as transfers from outside
basins to the Bogota river are completed (as planned under the long-range
water supply nrogram), making the BEEB less denendent on a fixed flow pattern
at Tibito. Therefore, while the EAAR's water right will be increased to
only 8.0 m3/sec, the Tibito II scheme will be designed for an ultimate aver-
age capacity of about 10-11 m3/sec.

Assumntions for the Financial Projections 1/
1.        Average Rate (See Annex )4): The new rates billed would result in
an average collectable rate of Col$l.OO/m3 starting July 1968,Col$1.O5!
m3 during 1969 and Col$1.lo/m3 during 1970. To achieve a 9 percent return
thereafter the collectible rate would average Col$1.35/m3 during 1971 and
Col$1.60/m3 starting 1972.
2.        "Derechos":  (a) Derechos de Abastecimiento would increase by
8 percent per annum starting from Col$23.5 million in 1967. (b) Derechos
de Urbanizacion would increase, as authorized by the Superintendencia de
Regulacion Economica, from Col$5/m2 of the area served in 1968 to Col$,l4.30/
m2 in 1977. For the next six years the area to be develoDed would average
2.3 million m2 per year.
3.        Operating Costs:  (a)  Salaries and wages increased from Col$30
million in 1966 to Col$44 million in 1967 due to increases in salaries and
wages, addition of needed staff and improved accounting (e.g. an adjustment
of Col$3 million in social benefits accrued, which formerly we,e only
accounted for on a cash basis). The increase to Col$54 million in 1968
is based on detailed budget Drovisions for new staff and so is the Col$7C
million for 1969.  This item would increase thereafter with 25 percent Der
annum.  (b) Pumping costs are based on the estimated consumption of power,
at a rate which would increase by 8 percent per annum; (c) Chnemicals, other
materials and supplies are based on the estimated water production. cdi Oter
costs are taken at 15 rercent of the total of the above-mentioned operat'ing
costs.  (e) Depreciation has been calculated on the gross value of the fixed
assets at the beginning of the year as follows:
(i) Water supply assets (after deduction of Col$40 million
for land) at 3 percent per annum;
(ii) Sewerage assets at 2 Dercent Der annum; and
(iii) Other assets at 5 percent per annum.
4.        Eoyity Contributions:  (a) the national budget apnropriation of
Col$20 million for 1968 has been anproved and the amount is at the EAAB's
disposal.  (b) The contributions by the District of Bogota are based on a
decision of the District Council in 196]4  the contribution by the Cor-
racion Autonoma Reaional de la Sabana de Bogota (CAR) is based on an agree-
ment dated October 1964.

5.        Contributions in Aid of Const:'uction include not only payment by
the consumer for the cost of the connec:ion, the meter, etc. but also
extensions to the water supply and sewerage system paid for by the consumers
or constructed by developers and transferred to the EAAB. The counterpart
in fixed assets appears in "Other Works" under Water and Sewerage.
6.        ProertX ImDrovement Tax for Se_erae  Works ("Valorizacion`): 70
percent of the sewerage masterplan investment of one year would be recovered
in the four subsequent years.
7.        Foreign Exchange Loans: (a) IBET) Loan would be repaid in 32 semi-
annual payments starting December 1972; interest has been assumed at 6¼ per-
cent per annum and the commitment charge on the unwithdrawn balance at 3/4
percent. (b) Joint loans would be repaid in 10 years, starting 1970, and
would carry a 7 percent interest.  (c) future foreign exchani-e loans would
carry a 7 percent interest, caDitalized during construction.
8.        Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI) Loans:  (the amount required
each year has been considered a separate loan) would carry a 9 percent in-
terest and a 16-year amortization period after four years grac,e, conditions
ecual to the IFI loan of Col$65 million granted for the first stage of t,e
sewerage master plan, of which the balance of Col$20 million will be utfi:`zJd
in 1968.  The balance of Col$4 million of a Col$7 million loan for the pro-
curement of meters will also be utilized during 1968.  This loan must be
repaid in three years.
9.        U.S. AID Loan:  The first of eleven semiannual repayments on th.is
loan of US$450'OOO, carrying 3o rercent interest, will start in 1972,
10.       Revolving Fund Distribution System: established in 1959 to finance
extensions to the distribution system of the EAAB and the Empresa de EnergF ia
Electrica de Bogota in those areas of the city where construction is not
being executed by a developer.  Withdrawals are authorized only for snecif
works, must be repaid in three years and carry a 3 percent interest.
11.       Increase Current Assets: Gross accounts receivable would amount to
four months income from water sales in 1968 and three months thereafter.  The
net accounts receivable appearing in the pro forma balance sheets represent
the gross amount, after deduction of a provision for bad debts of Col$11 mil-
lion, in existence at the end of 1967. Inventories would increase from
Col$19 million in 1967 to Col$30 million in 1973.
12.       Debt Service (not discussed elsewhere): (a) Bonds:  In recent years
maturing bonds have been refinanced for a two or three year period.  All
amounts due in 1968-70 will be repaid in 1971-75. Interest will be maintained
at 6 percent.  (b) A Japanese supplier's credit of US$0.5 million granted in
1963 financed pumping equipm.ent for the Usaquen booster pumping station at
6 percent per year, last payment due in 1969.
13.       Accounts Receivable for water and sewerage services have been
discussed in Daragranh 12 above. Other accounts receivable consist mainly

of amournts receivable as contributions from customers in aid of construction:
the EAAB allows periods of up to one year to pay in installments. Other
accounts receivable also include loans to employees, deposits made by the
EAAB, etc.
14.       Work in Progress:  The emergency works (Booster Ptmning Stat'.on
Tibito) amounting to Col$22 million would be incorporated into the fixeid
assets in 1969. Investments in the sewerage master plan are shown as work
in progress during one year before being added to gross fixed assets.
Investments in other works would be incorporated into fixed assets immediately.
15.       Accounts Payable:  The increase from Col$6 million in 1966 to
Col$18 million in 1967 is due to inTroved accounting:  under the concept cf
cash accounting, formerly in use, accounts payable were not properly re-
flected in the books.
16.       Fauitv:  (a) Contributions in aid of construction have never been
properly accounted for. The amount of Col$206 million shown in the 1967
balance sheet after revaluation represents those fixed assets, i-hich as
far as could be determined during the ohysical inventory of th - fixed ass--ts
in the revaluation process, have been contributed in kind hay -e-relopers o0
built with advances from consumers. These contributions incre:.-se9 start in;i
in 1968 with the amnounts shown as such in the cash flow forecasts ar  '.;
the property imnDrovement tax for the sewerage works ("'Valorizacion"). e bl'
The revaluation surDlus represents a 70 percent increase in net fixed assets
in operation.  Gross fixed assets before depreciation increased 62 rercent
but because of a recalculation of accumulated depreciation based on more.
realistic lives of the fixed assets, the accumulated depreciation after de-
valuation represents 20 percent of gross fixed assets compared to 13.5 per-
cent as shown in thc 1067 balance sheet before revaluation. (c} Other equi-ty
and earned surDlus include the contributions by the Government and the other
zublic entities (see also paragraph 4 above).
17.       Rate Base and Rate of Return:  Contributions from customers in a-2
of construction have been deducted from net fixed assets in o .eration in the
calculation of the rate base.  The return has been calculated on the averauze
rate base at the beginning and the end of the year except for 1967 when the
return on revalued assets has been related to the rate base at the end of
the year.

MENORANDUI ON JOIJE FINANCING OF PROJECTS
IN COLOMBIA  iND 13XICO
I. Projects to be covered
A.     This memorandum applies to the external financing of the
following projects:
Estimated external

l~ili on)
COLOWMIA
National Power Interconnection                  26
Bogota Power                                    25
Bogota Water Supply                           20-30
NVEICO
Second Power Sector Program                     95
B.     The International Bank for Raccnstrucioi: id De-vel' n:aent
(the Bank) is ready to consider the provision of this financing if
agreement can be reached with potential joint lenders on a mutually
acceptable basis for joint financing.
II.  General Formula for Joint Financing
A.     The formula for provision of external financing of the im-
ported goods required for the projects would be 50 percent by the
hank and 50 percent by the supplying cowntry in the case of the
three Co-lombian projects, and two-thirds by the Bank and orie-third
by the suxpplying country in the case of the Ilexican project. This
financing formula iould only apply to individual orders for im-
ported goods of at least $200,000, aggregating for each individual
project at least $1 million in any one supplying country.
B.     All countries with prospects of obtaining significant con-
tracts under the above formula for a particular project would
indicate their willingness to join in its f.rzancing as a pre-
condition for proceeding with joint financing of that project.
C.     The term to maturity of joint loans would be a minimun of
ten years from delivery of the goods, with an appropriate grace
period, in cases where maturity is calculated from. date of sig-
nature. The interest rate and. other charges -2o'.1d be no higher
than the most favorable rate and charges which rhe country other-
wise provides with respect to long-term1 export credit.  The goods
to be imported for the project with financing provided under the
joint financi.ng arrangements would be procured on the bsis4S of






-2 -
international competitive bidding in accordancc wiith th-e practices
usually followed for Bank projects, without referencc to credit
terms including interest raues and asiortization schedules.
III. The Role of the Bank
A.     The Bank dwill appraise each of the projects arid, provided
they conform to the Bankts standards, will recomn.end to its Board
of Executive Directors loans to cover its share of the financing
of imported goods under the formula outlined in II A. above, as
well as some other items in the project.
B.     In order to facilitate the arrangements to be made by the
joint lenders, the Bank will advise them on the progress of its
own project appraisal, and of the status of procurement and award
of contracts for the projects concerned.
C.     The Bpnk loan for each project wiil. becone e"fective siJmiull
taneously with joint loans.  However  tJhe Bak will consider
making its loan effective in advanice of the effectiveness of joint
loans, should this be justified by the circ;nmstancas of the case.
D.     In order to ensure tha   the  tot:a Linaccici  pL  wlich
emerges is appropriate to the project and the fpna. ci nosition
of the Borrower, the BanLk is prepared, wiithlin limits, to adjust
the amortization schedule of its loan to the schedtuies of joint
loans, so that the total annual amortization paymen?,s required of
the Borrower would be reasonably approAimate to those which the
Borrower would have made if the entire amourn  had bGeer provided 'by
the Bank.
E.     The Bank would also be prepared to include ila iLs Loan Agree-
ment for the project a provision stipulating that prematuring of a
joint loan because of a default by the Borrower would be an event
of default under the Bank loan.
IV.  The Role of other Joint Lendcis
A.     Upon the receipt of notification from the Bank, joint lenders
will promptly enter into loan negotiations with the relevant bor-
rowers in Colombia or Mexico.
B.     Joint loans for irQported goods will be fmade effictive simula
taneously with the Bank's loan, unless the Bank, as indicated in
III C. above, decides to make the loan effective in advance of the
effectiveness of joint loans.
C.     If a joint lender finds it necessary to place a ceiling on
the amount of financing to be made available, it will. be prepared






-3-
seriously to consider increasing this amount in case the flow of
orders calls for additional financing by it under the joint fi-
nancing formula. The Bank will consider the effect of such a
ceiling, and after consultation with interested joint lenders,
cqill advise whether such a ceiling would, in the Bank's judgment,
be adequate in relation to the orders likely to be obtained.
