PREFACE
1.      IDA approved a credit of US$15.0 million equivalent for the Chitta-
gong Urea Fertilizer Project on February 2, 1982, which became effective on
January 19, 1983. Negotiations were held at the Asian Development Bano
(ADB) offices during September 29-October 1, 1981. The project was co-
financed by a number of international financial institutions with ADB taking
the lead role. The Credit was closed, as scheduled, on December 31, 1986,
and was fully disbursed.
2.      Project identification and appraisal were carried out by ADB
starting in 1975, based on an engineering credit that ADB made to Bangladesh
in 1976. The main objective of the project was to increase Bangladesh's
area production capacity, both for domestic and export supply.
3.      This Project Completion Report (PCR) is based on the findings of an
ASTIF mission to Bangladesh in October/November 1988 and the technical PCR
prepared by ADB (Attachment I). Information was obtained from the Borrower,
but a formal PCR was not prepared by them. ADB plans to prepare its final
PCR in late 1989. Comments received from the Government and from ADB on an
earlier draft of this PCR have been incorporated into the final text of the
PCR and are reproduced as Attachments II and III, respectively.
4.      The project has been reviewed by OED but will not be subject to a
full audit at this stage.

CHITTAGONG UREA FERTILIZER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1204-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          The project aimed at increasing the domestic supply of urea
fertilizer, based on the country's comparative advantage of low-cost natural
gas reserves. Project identification, preparation and appraisal were carried
out by ADB during 1976-81. Also, ADB was the lead financial institution for
the project, with IDA one of seven co-f. inciers. The IDA credit, which
contributed 4% of the foreign exchange cost of the project, was administered
by ADB. This arrangement worked well and lessened the complexity of
procurement under multiple sources of financing (paras. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2). The
Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) company, the project sponsor, is a
wholly government-owned company operating under the management of Bangladesh
Chemical Industrial Corporation (BCIC).
Objectives
2.          The project consisted of a green field integrated ammonia-urea
plant with a capacity of 560,000 tons a year of urea, based on indigenous
natural gas as feedstock and fuel. The project would achieve self-sufficiency
in nitrogen fertilizer in the country and export the surplus urea (para. 2.3).
Implementation Experience
3.          Project execution was delayed 26 months due to time required to
sign the initial contracts with the general contractor. The difficulty in
coordinating seven external co-financiers also contributed to the long
implementation period. The project also experienced a net 12.4% cost overrun,
primarily as a result of changes in currency values and over design by the
contractor (paras. 3.6-3.8).
Results
4.          The project, which started commercial operation on July 1, 1988,
is technically a success, and operated at about 70% capacity during July 1988-
May 1989 (including 2 months of no production). Substantially all of this
output was exported (paras. 4.1, 5.2). However, in economic terms the project
did not achieve satisfactory results. The realized economic rate of return is
about 6% compared to the appraisal estimate of 19%. This difference is due to
lower than forecast urea prices and the high capital costs (para. 6.1).



- vi -
Overall AssAssment and Lessons
5.          The project cost of about US$525 million compares with current
quotations of about US$350-375 million for the same capacity. Furthermore,
the company is undercapitalized, has experienced losses, and is in need of
financial restructuring (paras. 6.2, 6.3). At current projected world prices,
the project cannot be viewed as successful, albeit in part for reasons that
could not have been fereseen (para. 8.1).
6.          IDA played an important role in ensuring the supply of gas for the
project under the Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD). Both
projects have been implemented in a coordinated manner, once impediments to
signing the initial contracts were overcome (para. 7.1).
7.          The project experience reveals that  project preparation was
inadequate, capital costs were consistently high, urea price projections were
not realized, greater competition in contractor selection would probably have
resulted in lower capital costs, and multiplicity of co-financiers contributed
to project delay (paras. 8.3-8.5).

CHITTAGONG UREA FEPTILIZER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1204-BD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Agriculture has remained the mainstay of Bangladesh's economy,
accounting for about 50% of the gross domestic product and providing
employment to about 60% of the work force. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB)
gives high priority to increasing agricultural production to achieve food-
grain self-sufficiency. Fertilizer use began to increase significantly in the
middle of the 1970s, and since then total use has increased at an annual
growth rate of over 9%. In 1987/88, total use reached 1.5 million metric tons
(MT), with urea corstituting 68% of total products, triple superphosphate
(TSP) accounting for 26%, and muriate of potash amounting to 6%. With the
successful discovery of natural gas supplies, domestic fertilizer production
was begun in 1961 with the Fenchuganj Urea Factory, followed by Gharasal
(1970), Ashuganj (1984), Pol&sh (1986), and just recently the Chittagong Urea
(1988). In addition, Chittagong TSP came into production in 1974. These
factories, owned by Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), have a
combined production iapacity of about 1.8 million tons. Domestic production
has doubled in the last five years, mainly through additional urea capacities
at Ashunganj and Polash and through improvements in output from existing
factories attributable to the completion of the Rehabilitation Project
financed by IDA (Credit 1023-BD). Total production of fertilizers in 1987/88
was about 1.4 million tons, with 1.3 million tons of urea and 0.1 million tons
of TSP. 3angladesh has historically had a fertilizer supply gap and has had
to rely on imports for a substantial share of total fertilizer consumption.
When the Chittagong urea facility is fully operational, domestic urea
production will be expected to exceed 1.32 million MT. Since this increase
has resulted in urea production in excess of demand, Bangladesh has the
capacity for substantial urea exports. In 1987/88, urea exports were
223,000 NT (17% of production) and earned about US$24 million in foreign
exchange.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Pro1ect Identification. Preparation. Appraisal and Credit Effectiveness
2.1       Project identification, preparation and appraisal were conducted by
ADB. In November 1976, ADB provided Bangladesh with an engineering loan of
US$2.5 million equivalent to carry out the feasibility study and detailed
engineering for (a) the development of the Bakhrabad gas field and
transmission line to supply gas to end-users in Chittagong, and (b) an
ammonia-urea complex that would use part of the gas from the gas field.



Following completion of the feasibility study prepared by UNICO, a Japanese
consulting firm, in late 1979; the Government requested IDA to consider
financing and mobilizing and coordinating other donor assistance for the gas
development and transmission project and also ADB to perform a similar role
for the ammonia-urea complex (the project). IDA approved the Bakhrabad Gas
Development project in December 1980 (Credit 1091-BD) with cofinancing from
OPEC and OECF.
2.2       As the lead financial institution in promoting and supervising the
project, ADB conducted the project appraisal in October 1981. On February 2,
1982, based on ADB's appraisal, IDA approved a credit of SDR 12.8 million
(equivalent to US$15 million) to the People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB).
IDA was one of seven co-financiers that participated in financing the foreign
currency cost of the project of US$290 million equivalent estimated at the
time of appraisal. The proceeds of the IDA credit were to be relent by GOB to
CUFL for 15 years including 5 years of grace at 12% p.a. interest with the
foreign exchange risk to be borne by CUFL. The credit became effective on
January 19, 1983, 11 months after IDA Board approval.
B. Project DescriRtion and Objectives
2.3       The project consisted of an integrated ammonia/urea fertilizer plant
with a design capacity of 1,700 tpd of prilled urea, based on indigenous
natural gas as feedstock and fuel. On the basis of 330 on-stream days per
year, the rated annual production capacity of the plant is 561,000 tons of
urea. The objectives of the project were to produce urea fertilizer using
indigenous natural gas to enable the country to achieve self-sufficiency in
nitroger. fertilizer and to export the surplus urea. The net result would be
foreign exchange savings and earnings through import substitution and export
of surplus urea.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Obiectives
3.1       The project was placed in commercial production on July 1, 1988.
During the first 11 months of commercial operation (July 1988-May 1989), the
plant operated at an average capacity utilization of about 70% (including 2
months of no production) and has demonstrated that it is capable of sustained
production at 90% capacity utilization. Because of low demand of urea in the
local market and increased supply of urea from existing plants, a substantial
quantity of urea output is being exported. About US$20 million of foreign
exchange was earned in the fiscal year 1987/88. The project has, therefore,
attained the physical objective of the country's achieving self-sufficiency in
urea and export of the surplus to earn foreign exchange. The basic objective
of an economically viable project was not achieved due to time and cost
overruns and a lower international urea price than anticipated.

3.2       The CUFL, a fully government-owned company, was established in
November 1980 to implement and subsequently operate the project. CUFL has
been functioning as a separate company since it was established. The Board of
CUFL consists of the chairman of BCIC, as Chairman, and the Engineering and
Commercial Directors of BCIC and representatives of the Ministries of
Industries, Finance, Planning Commission and the Managing Director of CUFL.
TEC of Japan as the General Contractor was responsible for overall project
implementation including engineering, equipment and material procurement,
construction and commissioning mana,4ement and training for CUFL staff. TEC is
also providing services to assist CUFL in the proper management and operation
of the plant for the initial period of at least three years after completion
of plant construction.
C.  Manpower Development and Training
3.3       CUFL employed about 880 persons as of April 1988 and will increase
its total staff by mid-1989 to 1,008, including 48 managerial officers, 223
supervisory officer, 351 supporting staff and 386 operators and skilled
workers. The total staffing compares well with the project appraisal estimate
of 1,300. The key personnel were drawn mainly from BCIC enterprises,
particularly from the existing fertilizer plants, and other goverment
organizations. Recognizing the limited technical base in Bangladesh, the
project preparation had placed considerable emphasis on training. A
comprehensive training program was prepared by CUFL in close cooperation with
TEC. A total of 74 personnel, administrative officers, engineers and
technical staff, were given training in the office of TEC in Japan and the
similar operating plant in Indonesia for 75 man-months and 150 man-months,
respectively. A total of 583 CUFL personnel were given on-the-job, in-plant
training in the operating fertilizer plants in Bangladesh of comparable size.
D. Performance of Consultants and Engineering Firms
3.4       The initial project preparation work was carried out by UNICO, a
Japanese consulting firm, under ADB's engineering loan. UNICO also provided
technical advisory services as Technical Advisor to assist CUFL/BCIC for the
implementation of the project. The consultants carried out their task
effectively and worked closely with the CUFL/BCIC technical manager. TEC was
responsible for overall engineering services, except for some detailed
engineering which was provided by package contractors under the supervision of
TEC. The ammonia/urea process and the offsite facilities were designed and
engineered by TEC based on the M.W. Kellogg ammonia process technology and the
Mitsui-Toatsu urea process. Both processes are efficient, well-proven
designs.
E.  Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.5       The overall responsibility for project procurement rested with TEC.
The technical bid documents prepared by TEC were reviewId and accepted by
CUFL's Technical Advisor before dispatch to the respective cofinanciers for
final approval. All the IDA-financed supplies and services were procured

under management of the ADB following contracting and procurement procedures
acceptable IDA. The performance of all suppliers was satisfactory.
F. Project Implementation
3.6       The plant was mechanically completed in October 1987 and following
successful commissioning the plant was accepted by CUFL in February 1988. The
project implementation during the preparation stage was 26 months behind the
original schedule envisaged at the time of the appraisal. But the general
contract was not signed between CUFL and TEC until November 1984. The project
was completed in 37 months, a month ahead of the contractual schedule, but
with a net delay of 27 months due primarily to the unexpected time required to
complete contractual arrangements. The multiplicitv of co-financiers also
contributed to the lengthy implementation period. The original schedule was
far too optimistic, but these delays could not have been foreseen at the time
of appraisal.

G. Project Costs. Financing and Disbursements
3.7       Proiect Costs.  According to ADB, the actual cost of the project as
of September 1989 was US$525.3 million equivalent comprising a foreign
exchange cost of US$343.7 million equivalent and a local currency cost of
US$181.6 million equivalent. The comparison of the project cost estimates at
the time of appraisal and reappraisal and the actual project cost are
summarized below. Due to a wide fluctuation of exchange rates, particularly
appreciation of the Japanese yen, during the two-year delay in the start of
the project and subsequent years of project implementation, ADB reappraised
the project cost in October 1986. At the time of reappraisal, the cost
overrun and the decline in international urea prices were already known.
However, virtually all contracts had been committed. The main purpose of
reappraisal was to confirm that the project should proceed and to provide the
basis for additional financing required. During this time, IDA declined to
provide additional financing.

jb Exchange rate of US$1 - Tk 30.36 as of May 1986 is used to convert
project cost estimate at reappraisal into taka equivalent.
NOTE: Discrepancy of the total project cost, US$29 million, between ADB's
estimate and the official figure of the Government is due to difference in the
way exchange rate calculations were made and different time of estimates.
There was a foreign exchange cost overrun of USF53.7 million (18.5%) as
compared with the cost estimate at the time of appraisal. Most dominant
factor to the cost overrun is the appreciation of currencies, particularly the
Japanese yen, in which about 71% of contracts awarded were denominated.l/
According to ADB's analysis, with foreign exchange rates prevailing during the
./  Average exchange rate of Japanese yen for the US dollar was V 239 (1983),
V 237 (1984), Y 240 (1985), V 169 (1986), V 145 (1987), and V 126 (up to
June 1988).

time of bid opening (1985) of most of the contracts for equipment, materials
and services, the foreign exchange cost would have been approximately
$259 million which is within the original cost estimates. Despite a
considerable local cost overrun in terms of local currency reaching
Tk 1.4 billion (49%), local currency devaluation throughout the implementation
period of the project resulted only in a local cost overrun in terms of US
dollars equivalent of US$4.1 million (2.2%). Consequently, overall cost
overrun of the project was about US$57.8 million (12.4%) as compared with the
cost estimate at the time of appraisal. In July 1988, the Government finally
approved the revised project cost of Tk 15,585 million (US$496 million
equivalent) including foreign exchange cost of Tk 11,363 million (US$362 mil-
lion equivalent) and local cost of Tk 4,222 million (US$134 million
equivalent).

The cost overrun of US$53.7 million equivalent was primarily provided by
supplementary financing from ADB (US$26 million) and OECF (US$23 million) and
that OECF financing was denominated in yen. The financing was satisfactory
and provided in a timely manner, and it did not have a significant impact on
the implementation schedule.
3.9       Disbursement.  The disbursement for the IDA credit as estimated at
the time of appraisal and the actual pattern are summarized below (see also
Annex 1).

The credit of SDR 12.8 million (US$15.0 million equivalent) was fully
disbursed by June 1987. The slow rate of disbursement was due to the 24-month
delay in the start of project implementation (para. 3.6). For the IDA
portion, Japan won the largest share (90%); the rest (10%) of the contracts
were won by Singapore. For the overall project, about 71% of the contracts
were won by Japan.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production
4.1       Production started on October 29, 1987, when the project was
mechanically cc ?leted and until the end of June 1988, the plant produced
about 281,000 tons of urea of "trial operation." Commercial operation of CUFL
started at the beginning of fiscal year 1988/89 on July 1, 1988, and through
the end of May 1989 the plant produced about 361,000 tons of urea. The plant
is now operating commercially without major problems. TEC continues to
provide technical assistance, and management at CUFL is reasonably good. The
plant should have no difficulty achieving 90+% sustained capacity utilization.
The monthly operation of CUFL since start-up is summarized in the table on the
following page.

B. Marketing
4.2       In the fiscal year 1987/88 CUFL shipped about 184,000 tons of urea.
Because of low demand of urea in local market and increased supply of urea
from existing plants, almost all urea, about 183,000 tons, was exported to
neighboring countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and China and earned about
US$20 million of foreign exchange. CUFL estimated that in 1988/89, the
majority of urea production, 0.3 million tons out of 0.4 million tons would be
exported, earning about US$50 million of foreign exchange. (Actual urea
prices in mid-1989 were lower than forecast so foreign exchange earnings may
have been less.) GOB has recently authorized CUFL to sell urea to private
dealers at prices administered by GOB.

5.2       During the first three months of commercial operation, July-
September 1988, the project produced about 114,000 tons of urea and sold about
107,000 tons of urea. After allowing for the interest charge of 12% p.a.,
CUFL incurred a financial loss of about Tk 323 million during this period.
Financial data for the whole of 1988/89 are not available, but could be
somewhat worse than the performance for the first three months due to no
production in November and December 1988 and lower urea export prices in mid-
1989. The company will not be able to fulfill its financial obligations under
the subsidiary loan agreement. Thus a major financial restructuring will be
required as discussed in para. 6.2.

VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.1       The assumptions used in the calculation of the economic rate of
return (ERR) and capital restructuring and also project costs and benefit
streams for ERR are shown in Annex 3-1 and Annex 3-2, respectively. The ERR
is now calculated at 6% 2./ which is considerably lower than the appraisal
/   Since the actual expenditure schedule of the project is not available, it
is assumed that the expenditure schedule takes the same pattern as
envisaged at the appraisal, but with a 26-month delay.

estimate of 19%. The most dominant factors explaining the lower ERR are
(a) lower world urea prices, currently US$166 per ton, than projected at
appraisal which was US$330 per ton for export and US$360 per ton for domestic
sale in 1985 constant value, and (b) capital overrun as discussed in
para. 3.7. The correct urea price is difficult to establish. The base case
ERR is partially based on t'he IBRD commodity forecast of December 1988. THe
actual international price in mid-1989 is well under that level but our
judgement is that urea price will recover during 1990 and the "base case" of
$166/ton urea, f.o.b. in 1989 and US$213/ton thereafter to Asian markets is a
good approximation for purposes of measuring long-term project viability. ADB
is using a 15-year project life (vs. 12 years by IDA) and assumes opportunity
value of gas at Tk 30/MSCF. For purposes of this report, the ADB estimate of
opportunity value of gas is used in the base case. The 12-year life is
maintained in the base case to make it comparable with the appraisal estimate.
The table below shows the results of sensitivity tests.

As is shown later, estimated cash production cost of urea is well under the
present international price of urea, thus the production of urea at the
project can be justified on sunk capital basis. However, with an ERR at 6%,
the economic objective of the project will not be obtainad. As discussed
above, due to overestimate on demand of urea both in international and
domestic market, the projected price of urea in the appraisal report was too
high and the estimated and realized capital costs are substantially higher
than current contractor quotations. Both of these factors account for the
decrease in the ERR, compared to appraisal estimates.
B. Capital Restructuring
6.2       CUFL has a debt/equity ratio of 80:20.  Under the assumptions of
(a) total project costs at TK 15,585 million, (b) annual production of 505,000
tons (90% of rated capacity), and (c) depreciation provisions at 5% p.a. for
plant and machinery, and 2.5% p.a. for building, the 1988/89 estimated cost of
production of urea before interest and return on equity is Tk 3,570 per ton
with gas at its present price of Tk 28.5/Mscf. However, the cost of
production of urea will increase to Tk 3,615 per ton with the proposed
increase of the natural gas price to its economic cost of Tk 30 per Mscf. As
shown below, at the Bank's projected international price of urea in 1989,
US$166 (Tk 5,345) per ton in constant 1988 US dollars, the plant will meet
only 64% of its interest charge in case of the natural gas price of Tk 30/Msf.
Therefore, there is a need for a major capital restructuring of the company.

6.3       CUFL/BCIC has proposed to GOB that CUFL should be restructured by
(a) revising debt/equity ratio to 50:50, (b) reducing the interest rate from
12% to 10%, and (c) reducing return on equity capital to 7.5%.%/ With this
restructuring, CUFL would be able to reduce unit interest cost per ton by 47%
to Tk 1,609, which will be covered at the projected international price of
urea. but it will not be sufficient to meet the entire amount of interest
charge and return on equity capital. The estimated cost of production of urea
summarized below shows that in addition to the capital restructuring proposed
by CUFL, a Tk 3.9 billion write-off from the present investment cost of
Tk 15.6 billion may be necessary. If the face value of the present investment
cost is reduced by Tk 3.9 billion (25%) and the debt/equity ratio is improved
to 50:50, the company would be able to reduce (i) depreciation cost to
Tk 1,016 per ton of urea, (ii) interest charge to Tk 1,233 per ton, and (iii)
required return on equity to Tk 867 per ton. Full cost of production of urea
will be thus reduced to Tk 5,375 per ton which will be about equal to the
projected international price of urea. However, the actual international urea
price in 1989 is well below the assumed level of US$166/ton, so the actual
financial restructuring required will likely be different.

6.4     The Government has recently undertaken some of the required financial
restructuring. The Government has approved a debt/eauity ratio of 50:50 and
an interest rate of 10% p.a. Consideration is being given to raising ex-
factory prices and to convert loans of Tk 3.9 billion into equity. These
steps would improve the financial pcsition of CUFL considerably. Because
international urea prices are fluctuating well outside the Bank forecast,
there will be a need to continue assessing the financial position of the
company.
VII. IDA ROLE
7.1       During the various stages of the project, the ADB, as the lead
financial '-.stitution, worked closely with GOB, CUFL and their consultants in
identifying problems as they arose and in evolving practical solutions. Under
a Memorandum of Agreement signed by the seven co-financiers and the ADB in
1983, IDA worked closely with the ADB. In addition, the IDA credit has been
administered by the ADB. This arrangement worked well and lessened the
complexity of procurement under multiple sources of financing. IDA played an



- 14 -
important role to ensure the supply of natural gas for the project under the
IDA-financed Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD). Both
projects have been implemented in a well-coordinated manner once initial
contracting delays were overcome.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.1       The overall assessment of project viability is mixed.  With an ERR
of --% the project is not an economic success. However, on a sunk-cost basis,
the project covers more than economic cash costs. Thus, it should continue to
run. Virtually all of the problems at CUFL can be traced to high capital
costs and lower than expected urea prices. Project cost of about US$525 mil-
lion compares to current estimates of about US$350-375 million for the sane
capacity.
8.2       The financial restructuring proposed by CUFL (para. 6.3) is not
ideal. To the degree that these figures are below the opportunity costs of
capital, there is still a hidden subsidy that should not be forgotten.
However, the alternatives would be to set higher interest charges and increase
the capital write-off, or to forego the return on equity.
Lessons Learned
8.3       The project reconfirmed several lessons that we have learned over
the past few years, i.e., (a) the elapsed time of about two years between the
Board date and start of implementation signifies that project preparation was
not as thorough and complete as desirable, (b) capital costs estimates
prepared in the early 1980s were consistently high, and (c) the high
international urea price forecasts made in the early 1980s were not realized.
8.4       The project was implemented by a general contractor under a cost-
plus fee arrangement. It is ADB's assessment that this implementation system
contributed to overdesign and higher costs. We concur. There could have been
more competition in the contractor selection that may have yielded a lower
capital cost. However, this point would be impossible to prove after the
fact.
8.5       In the earlier Ashuganj project, it was thought that the
multiplicity of cofinanciers contributed to project delay due to varying
credit approval and procurement systems. This was also the case in CUFL, even
though ADB did a good job in coordinating the seven financing sources.

1.        h  2aCittagin  Ure Fertilizer Project as appraied by the Bank
Wm to  tablimb    inteated  _aurea fertilizer plant at Ransadia,
Chittagan  situated two kileters (km) south-west of the Mtrine Academy on
the left bank of the Karnaqwli River (se   Mqp, pae J and ti).  The
capaity of the Plant was designed  to produce about 1,000 metric tons per
day (mt/day) of lnteediate amnia and to convert the aonia into  about
1,700 mt/day of prilled urea using natural ga frm  Bakbrabad gas field
throug  the 170 km Bkkhrbed-dittagoW ga  tranmiusion system. On the
basis of 330 om-strem das per year, the Plant will hae a rated amual
output capacity of about 561,000 metric tons of ures.  The Project
consisted of the following major Components:
(i) acquisition and preperation of the site for the Plat
comprising 211 hectare (ha) for the     aia/-ea  Vuex aud
4 ha for the water intake facilities downstrea of alMurghat
bridge;
(ii) design,  engineering,   prAcurel"mt,  construction   and
comissionins of:
(a) a 1,000 mt/day ammenia unit,
(b) a 1,700 ut/day prifled urea unit, and
(c) utilities, offaites and ancillary facilities for the
aminmia and urea units including 16 MW captive pwer
generation, 110 tons per hour steam generation, 220
tons per hour jetty and product handling network;
(iii) construction of office and plant buildings and a housing
colony including community facilities for the mmuigemat and
operation staff of the Plant;
(iv) provision for the contirnusation of the engageimnt of UNIOD
International Corporation (UNICO), as Technical Advisor
(TA), to asist and advise the Exccuting Agency on the
design, construction and start-up of the Plant;
(v)  provision for the engagement of operational advisors tc
asmist the Executing Agency to mwnage, operate and maintain
the Plant during the initial three years after coumissioning
of the Plant; a-id
(vi)  provision for the training of selected Executing  Agency
personnel in fertilizer plants similar to the Project, in
langlaesh and abrad, to _mage and operate the Plant.
2.       During appraisal of the  Project in 1980, the inrsm  and Mare
stable supply of fertilizer was considered to be aim of the critical
fst.ors for PAngladenth to ar.hievR self-sufficiency in foodgmin producrtin.

the Govemnut of Bangladesh in November 1980 solely for the uwrpose of
implemnting the Projeot wd operating a  in     t      the Plant facilities
after cauissicming. During the early phase of the Project, UNICO, the TA
engaged under the technical service  loan  j/, assisted  CUFL in the
evaluation of prequlification response, preparation of tfia  docuts
aid review of bids for the selection of the site-filling acotractor, and
prepuration of prequalification documents, evaluation of prequalificetion
respouses and preparation of tender documents for the syenral oontract.
with the approval of the Bank, CUFL retained UNICO as TA  for the
emplentation of the Project under an * amended ontract. UNIOD assisted
WUFL  in  the  following  services:   (i)  ismmuma   of bids,  review and
evaliation of bids for the selection of General Contractor (OC), (ii)
review  of tender speoifications and  docunts  prepared by  C  for
procuinmt of equipment mid materials required for the Project, and  (iii)
supervision of the work carried out by OC.
4.       aWL enaged a OC, the Toy  aigiemern  Corporation  (TBC) of
Japen, for servioce  responaible for the overall impl_  tation  of the
Project, including guarantee of the performan  of the Plant. Ihe services
consisted of:
(i) provision of process lioenses, and basic mid detailed
designs of the amonia/urea units, off-sites and ancillary
facilities;
(ii) managegmt of p kocurMA t for all materl md  equipont
for the  ammonia/urea units,  off-sites and  ancillary

Equipnent and materials pro ored by OC on behalf of CUFL were in accordauoe
with the prscurent procedures of the respective co-financiers with CUPL
directly  arranging  payment  to  the  relevant suppliers.  Civil works,
construction and erection works contracts for the Project were awarded by
CUFL under separate contracts.  With  prior approval of the Bank, CUFL
retained OC to provide management and operational advisory services during
the first thirty months of operation of the Plant.
5.       In March 1980, the Government established a National Coordinating
Comuittee (NCC) for the purpose  of coordinating the implemPntation of the
(UFL Project and  the  Bakhrabad-Chittagong  Gas Pipeline Project.  The
IDA-assisted project for the construction of gas pipeline from Bakhrab d
gas field to the Plant was completed in 1984.
6f.      As agreed upon between the Government and the co-financiers,  the
Rank undertook the role of coordinator among the co-financiers. Ihe Bank
participated in the co-financiers' meetings held in Dhaka for monitoring
the progress of implementation of the Project, and reviewing other mstters
such as  procurement procedures,  definition  of critical items,  the
contracting arrangement between CUFL and oC and allocation and reallocation
of Project comporents among co-financiers.   At  the  request of   the,
Government, the  Bank also  condueted a reappraisal of the Project in
June-July 1986, and organized a co-financiers' meeting in MIbnila in August
1986  to  discuss  the  findins   of the  reappraisal and  to  finalize
arrangements for financing the cost overrun on the Project.
7.       The Project as originally  appraised was to be completed  in
November 1985. However, the Plant was physically completed on 28 OCtober
1987, two  years behind  schedule, mainly  due to  the long  time taken  in
finalizing arrangents for the  implementation of the Project and due  to
the delayed selection of GC.

8.       'he main  objective of the  Goverumt's Second  Five-Year Plan
(FY1980/81- FY1984/85), the goals and strategies of which wre largely
paralleled  awl extene   by  the  Third  Five-Year Plan  (FY1985/86  to
FY1989/90), me to achieve self- sufficiency in foodgrain produotion
througb improved farming practices and use of modern inputs. Efforts in
this direction resulted in an  increase in foodomin produotion frm  13.45
million tons in P11980/81 to 16.50 million tons in FY1986/87. In this
regard, the Governmet placed empais on ensuring adequate supply of
fertilizer  to  support  the agriculture setor.  Te  eceo n      ie mm  of
indigenous natural gan for domestic produotion of chemical fertilizer to
achieve self-sufficiency was given high priority by the Oovernaent.
9.       At  the  time of  appraisal  of  the   Project  in  1980, the
fertilizer 1/ requirements of Bangladesh exceeded domestic produotion and
the shortfall had to be met by  imports which acoowited  for aboat 68 per
cent of  the total amomut of  fertilizer consud.   Demand for urea was
expected to grow  steadily. The supply of locally produied  urea in  the
early 1980b depended on the  perforizance of  the existing  ura plant   at
Fenchuganj and ChorasaL,  and the timing of coism ioning of the tWo now
urea  fertilizer plants at  Ashugapn   and Pblash at (see Appndix 1).  It
was estimated that, after commissioning of the Project, the country would
be self-sufficient in urea fertilizer and would even have a temporary
surplus production from FY1987/88 to FY1992/93 (see ..ppeniix 2).  However,
by F11993/94, the country would have to rely partly on uroa fertilizer
import again to  meet domestic dmwd, unless new produotlon plants were
established.
10.      The Project was originally conceived by the Bangladesh Fertilizer
rhemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation  - predeoessor of  Bangladesh
Chfaical tndustries Corporation (BCIC) t/ - which, wtth  the  Fertilizer
Corporation of Indis, prepared in June 1974 a "Techno-Roonomic Feasibility
Stuudy" prnposing a Plant in wangiadesh for manufacturing urea fertilizer
from indigenous  natural gas  for  export of  the  product to  India.   The
prnposal, was first brmuWht to the attention of the Bank during the visit of
a Project  Identification Mission  in Mbrch  1975.  A  Bank  Fact-Finding
Mission then visited Bangladesh in Cctober/November 1975 to examine the
proposal. After detailed investigations in the field and discussions with
I/  The major chemical fertilizers used in Bangladesh and their respective
percentage of the total usage are urea (64 per cent) , triple
superphosphate and di-ammonium phosphate (30 per cent), and mriste of
potash (6 per cent).
?J  Ashuganj and Polash plants started production in 1981 and 1985,
respectively.
t/ ABrIC was constituted in June 1976 in accordance with Presidential
Order No. 27 of 1972.

govezwit authorities and BCXC, the Mission determined the brmd soap. of
the propoma and comidered that the most appropriate  site for the Plant
should be at Chittagong rather than at any of various altenative sites
becaue of accessibility  to  both  local and export markets.  In  this
connection, the Government requested the Bank for a loan to finance the
services of a TA to carry out the nrcessary field investigation and to
prepare a detailed proposal for the Plant and the related natural gas
supply system. A Bank Appraisal Mission visited Bmngladeah from 8 to 15
June 1976 and held discussions on various aspects of the proposed technical
services with relevant government agencies ard BCIC. At the request of the
Goverimnt and prior to the approval of the proposed loan, the Dank, an 8
October 1976, convened a meeting of interested aid  enie and gfovrnts
at the Bank's Headquarters. The meeting was held to: (i) invite ommnts
on the soope and tenrm of refererne of the TA to be engaged muder the
proposed loan from the Bank; and (ii) solicit preliminary interest in the
Project of potential aid agencies.
II.      on 23 November  1976 the Bank approved Loan No. 282-BAN(SP) of
$2.5 million from its Special Furids Resources for the Chittagng Urea
Fertilizer Technical Services Project  in  Bangladesh.  This Technical.
Services Project was to provide technical advisory and consulting services,
for the  preparation  and  subsequent  implementation of an  integrmted
ammonia/urea fertilizer plant at Chittagong and a related Gas Supply System
oomprising the development of gas walls at the bakhraibd Sas field and a
gas transmission pipeline for the supply of gas to the Plant and other gas
end-users in the Chittagong area.
12.      On 4 January 1978 DCIC, the Executing  Agency for the Technical
Services Project, appointed   UNIOD, a Japanese   c lting  firm   in
association with JGC Corporation of Japan, DeGolyer and MncNauehton of USA,
Williams Brothers Engineering Company of USA, Technical Consultants and
Associates  Ltd. of Bangladesh  and Hydrocarbon Consultant  Ltd.  of
Bangladesh, to undertake the required technical services. The services
were to be carried out in tihree phases. Phase I involved the preparation
of a  comprehensive project  report  covering  the   feasibility  and
implementation aspects of the ammonia/urea plant and the as supply aystem.
Phase II involved the development of design criteria and bid specifications
for soliciting propoals from engineering firms for the construction of the
ammonia/urea plant and the  gas supply system.  Phase III  involved  the
evaluation of proposals for the general ensineering contract and  provision
of technical and management assistance for the implementation of the
ammonia/urea Plant. In late 1978, the Governmet requested the Dank tn
assist in the mobilization and coordination of financing for the Plant and
the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to
provide similar assistance for the gas supply system. In this regard, the
as supply system project was appraised by IDA in February 1980, and the
financial arrangements were finalized by the Government with IDA, Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan and OPEC Fund. Cocwurrently, a
pre-appraisal of the Project (the ammonia/urea plant) was conducted by a
Bank Mission which visited Bangladesh from IS February to 7 March 1980.
Based on the findings of the pre-appraisal, a Project Report prepared hy

the Bank was circulated to interested co-financiers and a meting was held
in the Banks Headquarters from 24 to 25 July 1980 for the purpose of
mobilizing contributions and coordinating financiers' positions on the
Project.
13.      Subsequently, a  Bank Appraisal Mission,  aLso joined  by other
co-financiers, visited Bangladesh from 24 October to 15 November 1980. The
scope and cost of the Project were finalized and agreed upon between the
Mission and the Government during the Mission's stay in the field. It was
also agreed that the Government would establish a new company, CUFL unidr
the supervision of ECIC, to implement and operate the Project. Based on
the results of the apprmisal, the Bank on 17 Novemr 1981 approved a  lam
amounting to $72.0 million from its Special Funds Pesources to finroe part
of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The Loan Agreint (Loan No.
541-BAN(SF)) was signed on 23 November 1981 and became effective an 19
January 1983. The rest of the foreign exchange cost was provided by six
other co-financiers, namely, Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Ebonomic  Developnt
(ADFAED), Canadian International Developent Agency (CID), IDA, Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), OBCF and Sawi Fund  for Development (SPD).  The
entire local currency cost was provided by the Government as equity to
aeL.
14.      At the time of appraisal, the ProJect was estisated to oost about
$467 million of which $290 million was in foreign exchane cost.  However,
the Project incurred a substantial cost overrun mainly due to realigeunts
of exchange rates of foreign currencies, change in  arrangement for site
preparation and change in location for fresh water intake. The cost of the
Project was re-estimated at about $577.8 million of which $354.1 million
was in foreign exchange cost. On 12 January 1986 the Goveriment  requested
the Bank to provide supplementary financing to ment part of the increased
foreign exchange requirements for completing the Project. Similar requests
were also made by the Government to the other co-financiers of the Project.
A Bank RWview cum Reappraisal Mission visited Bangladesh in July 1986 toi
gather cmxprehensive economic, financial, market and other pertinent data
for the assessment of the Project's viability. Base on the findings of
the Mission, the Bank approved on 13 November 1986 a supplementary loan
(Loan No. 796-BAN(SF)) in the aumunt of SDR 21.427 million equivalent from
its Special Funds Resources.  The Supplementary Loan Agreent was  signed
on 9 January 1987 and became effective on 16 June 1987.

16.      CUWL has  been functioning  as a  separate company since it wa
established. Initially, it functioned as an enterprise of BCIC, with the
Chairman of BCIC acting as the Chairman of the CUFL Board of Directors. In
mid-1981, the Governrmt constituted a Board of Directors coqWising  the
Secretaries to the Ministries of Industries and Finance (both Finance and
External Resources Divisions), and Member-in-Charge of the Industries
Division of the Planning Commission, besides the Chairman of BCIC and the
Managing Director of CUFL. The Board was further reconstituted in February
1985, when it was  aain made an enterprise  of BCIC, although  maintaining
its seFprate corporate structure. The Board at present oonsiats of the
Chairman of ECiC, as Chairman, and the &igineering and Comeroial Directors
of BCIC and representatives of the Ministries of Industries, Finance
(Finance and External resources Divisions), Planning Commission and the
Maiaging Director of CUFL.. The changes in the compositioa of the Board of
Directors  reflected  thi' concern  of the   Goverrmunt for  suiocessful
implemntation of the Project, particularly in the critical initial phase.
ahe reorgenization of CUFL as an enterprise of BCIC was designed for better
coordination and assistance from BCIC.

2.  Ian Effectiveness
18.      The original Loan Agreement  for the Project was signed on  23
November 1981  and beam  effective  on  19 Januury 1983.  The date of
effectiveness of the Bank loan had to be extended sevui times because the
Government took longer than expected  to fulfill pre-onditionm for loan
effectiveness, such as:  (i) a  legal opinion covering the Loan Agreemnt,
Financial Agreement, Gas Supply Agreement and acquisition of title of land;
(ii) an order concerning the appointment of the Menaging Director of CUlL;
and  (iii) docimentation   in  relation  to  the effectivity of  other
co-financiers' Agreements. Due to ttia different precondition set forth by
the co-financiers for effectivenese to their Loan Agreents, CIDA declared
its loan effective on 28 November 1981, followed by ADFAUD on 9 Mwrch 1982,
OECF on 27 April 1982, SFD on 21 November 1982, IDA on 19 January 1983 and
IsDB on 2 February 1983.

Thmere      a delay of about two months after two eteions in declaring the
effectivenes  of the  Loan due to  the  following  reass:  (i) late
submission of the legl opinion covering the Lan ad Project Agremts;
(ii) late approval by the Governmet'n   Project Evaluation Camittes of the
Project Proform; and (iii)  late comitment by the Govenent of its own
resources to met a portion of the foreign exchange financing gap estimated
at $11.3 million at the time of reappraisal.
3. *  Recitment of Technical Advisor Service
20.      With tho approval of the  ank and following the Bntk's Ouidelines
on the Use of Consultants, BCIC engaed WICO in 1978 as  Its TA for the
Projeot urAer Loan No. 282-BAN(SF). lhe work an the fesibility study of
the Project (see para.  11) undertaken by UNICO vas satisfactory, and  the
Oovernmt/BCIC requested Bank approval for retaining UNICO as TA for the
l:emp tation of the Project uner a revised  contract with CUFL.  In
acw       with  the provisions set forth  in Clause  5.06 "Continuity of
onsulting Services" of the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants
the Bank approved the Govern_mnt/BCIC's request to continue the technical
services of UNICO. In term of the revised agremit executed betwee
UNICO and  CUFL on  14 May 1983, the team  of TA, particularly  the key
personnel including  the  Pioject MIiger,  wastethened with  the
concurrence of the Bank after a review of the service provided du&ring the
initial stages of Phase III  (se  par. 12).  Gut of the total 291
man-mnths provided by TA for assisting ClJFL in implmenting the Project,
258 man-months were used at a total cost of $2.968 millim and the
assignent of UNICO was comleted on 22 Februsry 1988.
4.  Earth Filling ard Site Prem  tion Contractor
21.      In order to expedite   iwplintation  of the Project,  the
Government throush SCIC, advertised in June 1980 (in Bangadesh nswspapers)
for prequalification of contractors for carrying out dredging work related
to earth  filling and site preparation  for the Plant.  Copies of the
advertisement were sent by BCIC to twenty-three embassies of the Bankta
member countries in Bangladesh for transmittal of the informtion to the
agencies conoerned in their respective countries.
22.      twenty firms responded to the advertisement and indicated their
interest to be prequalified. The firms were from the following countries:
Netherlands (9), Japan (5), Belgium (2), UA (1), Korea (1), Sineapore  (1)
and Bangladesh (1).
23.      The proposas were evaluated by CUFL with assistance from  UNI0O.
Of the  20 firms,  17 were  found to be qualified to do the work.  The
prequalification procedure and evaluation criteria were reviewed by the
Bank and found them to be in accordance with the Bank's Guideline. for
Procurement.  Since earth  filling work cannot be carried out during  the
monsoon season from May to September, the site filling work was considered

Guidelines for Prount.  Moreovert the GovernIt, thruo* WaFL, agreed
to bridge finance the down payrent to the  su8eful contrwtor fro, its
awn resources and to request re u      t  for such pyrnmt from the  Bank
after the loan for the Project had been approved maul declared effective by
the Bank.
24.      on 16 July 1981, the tender doouwents were issd by aCL.P to  the
17 prequalified firms. However, only one bidder, Van oCrd Utrecht (VW) of
Netherlands, submitted its bid before the original bids' olosing date
of 30 September 1981.  After consultation with the  Bank, CUFL decided to
extend the closing date of the bids up to 22 October 1981. Four bidders,
all from Netherlands, submitted their bids during the extension and were
found to be substantially responsive to the tedhnical mad finacial
requirements of the  tender documents.  On   22 April 1982, the Bank
approved CUFL's reo lndation to awsrd the drWedging contrat to the lowest
priced/evaluated bidder, V02, at a fixed cost of DPL 13.99 million ($5.67
million equivalent) in foreign exchange coet plus Taka 17.07 million in
local currency cost with provision for price adjumtient up to DFL 426,150
for an estimated 5 per cent representing additional fill volum.
25.      A dredging contract was  signed on 13 Mby  1982 betweem CUFL and
vo2 which agreed to start work in early September 1982; however, V02
actually started work on 18 November 1982 after 1.5 months of delay
awaiting customs clearance for its dredging equipment at the Chittagoag
port. Since most equipment of V02 required re-export out of Bngladesh
after completion of the dredging work, the delay was mainly due to the long
processing time in obtaining an inventory of the equipmit prior to firal
clearance from the custoim authorities. The dredging work wse completed in
August 1983. A total of 80 hectare (ha) out of 215 ha acquired by CUFL
was filled of which 47 ha are for the Plant, 22 ha for the housing colony,
9 ha for the jetty and 1.6 ha for water intake stations.
5.  Recruitment of General Contractor
26.      CUFL we. to engage a GC on a lump-sum fixed price basis for the
services required of it  to complete  the Plant.  In order to m_ett OCF
requirements for its funds to be utilized for financing the urea unit on a
lumpsuma basis, CUFL was to engage a contractor to be responsible for
providing the process licenses and basic and detailed engineering desiguw,

for the supply of equipzeut anl for providing techical supervision for the
erection of the ures unit under the overall coordintion awd supervision of
OC. As GC required to guerantee  the overall perf      e of the Plant, OC
wa  given an opportunity to associate with a urea contrtor (UCI if (C so
desired. Therefore, prequalification for the general coxtractor anxd urea
contractor was to be conducted simultaneously on a ccmtrutinig arrnSement
to include: (i) all services relating to prooess licenses, basic and
detailed  engineering,  prc        t, supervision   of comstruction  and
erection, commissioning and start-up in respect of the entire complex on a
lump-sum fixed price basis; and Wii) all servicea relating to procees
licenses, basic and detailed engineering and supply of equipment for the
urea plant also on lump-sum fixed price basis.
27.      The notice for prequalification of oC/tc was published by CUFL in
June 1981 1/, and response were received from 13 applicants from  Austrta,
Belgium, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, FPderal Rbpublic of
Genmany, UK and U9A. Nine firms/consortia from Birope, Japan awd UBA were
prequalified on 2 November 1981 for bidding for (otIC  for the Projoct. The
tender documents to be used for inviting bids for actuc wars prepared by
CUPL with assistance from UNIOO, and submitted to the co-financiers for
their review. It was intended to  finalize the tender doouints for OC/Jc
in the co-financiers meting held at Dhai from 5 to 7 JuIr 1982, which wa:
attended by r pre entatives of the Bank, the Government, WD and aWIF.  In
the meeting, however, SFD insisted that sequential bidding should be used
for selection of CIC first and then seleoction of Ur, later, bmasd on
documents to be prepared by the selected OC, so as to enmble Wc to aseu
full responsibility for suaranteeing performenoe of the entire complex.
However, OBCF insisted on simultaneous bidding for CC nd UC. Consdereble
efforts were spent by the Dank wnd the Goveriet to resolve the iss0U   of
contracting arrangements required by S9D and OBCF. The Government
mpted to  seek common  agreement between  the two co-financiers  which
would be acceptable to the Bank.
28.      On 9 Norember  1982 the Bank was informed by CUFL that 9FD arA
OCSF had agreed to the condition that C, his associates/affiliates, would
act as independent contractors and would not be permitted to bid for any
other component of the Project. In this connection, the cost of the OC's
services (other than in relation to services for the urea unit) we to be
clIintiffed and paid on lump-sum basis by the Bank. Similarly, the cost of
the (IC's services in relation to the urea unit (i.e., for the provision of
design, basic  and detailed  engineering, mnagemsnt of procurm nt cf
equipment and materials, supeivision of erection and construction and
supervision of commissioning of the urea unit) was to be identified and

CUJFL issued an invitation to bid (ITS) an 22 Dem~r 1982 by following the
Bank's guidelires for the "two envelopes" produre to the eight reuinirg
prequalified firms/consortia.  TNo prequmlified  firm advised after the
pre-bid conference hold at Dhak in  Febrnary 1983 that they would not
participate in the bidding.
30.      The technical proposals were publicly opened an 31 Mu-oh  1983
and technical evaluation was conducted in accordance with the criteria and
procedures an approved by the Bank in November 1982. As a reult, two more

16 My 1983 for clarification of their bids. The financial bids, together
with the price adjustmunt proposals, were publicly opuad on 9 Jua  1983.
Ihe final price evaluation of the bids ws then carried out by CUlR awd a
tem of TA. CUFL's Board of Directors r o_mm IAtion      sent to the Dank
on 4 Augst 1983 for review alonm  with the evaluation rept of CAlL.
31.      In view  of the representation md  by sveral firm  either
through their respective Thecutive Directors or directly to the Bank in
writing, the Procur..t Comittee decided  that it would be neoua   for
CUFL to  send a delegation to  the Dank for detailed dimsiA of all
camplaints recived and all matter related to the teenics and fiinial
evaluation.  Metings  were also  held co!mmw ut    with  bider's
reprentatives  in order to  obtain  a better urstaiding of  the
representations edo by them. On 26 Septembr 1983, the Bonk accepted the
recomindtion of CUFLs Board of Directors that the lowet evaluated
bidder was T0 of Japan in  the total aiwt of $22.78 sillon equiv&lent.
But (UFL was unable to  ca_noe contract negotiation unless clearae had
been given to thus by the Goverrmant.
32.      On 21 Murch 1984 CUFL  as finally authorized bv the Goverment to
issue a Letter of Intent to 1Tm and to invite thm for contract
negotiation. The draft contract negotiated betwon CUR. ai ndC w   sent

packages as agreed by the co-financiers during appraisal of the Project.
Most of the preliminary engineering works were initiated arl co pleted by
OC in the second half of 1984 before the official start of the gemeral
contract (see para. 32).

designed and engineered by the oC offices in Japan with 90 per cent of the
engineering works completed by the end of April 1985. All of the technical
dccuments were reviewed and approved in Japan by the TA temm on behalf of
CUFL. Ihe docuwnnts in respect of equipment bid evaluations prepared by
GC were sent to Dhaks for review and acceptance by CUaLJTA before dispatch
to  the  respective co-finaniers  for final  approval.  The  auxiliary
facilities such as buildings, offices an* shops were designed in Dhaka bv
the Bangladesh firms working as suboontractors to oc.
(b) Procurement
38.      For the procurement of equipmnt, materials and service  fcr the
Project, OC established two             groups - one in the h   off i:*  at
Tokyo and  the  other  in  the Dhaka office.  An sdditimal of f Vp -ut

47.      The jetty package (PU-1)  is a civil  works contrast.  The  jetty
consisting of loading platform (175 meters long x 25 meters vid_a nDvoring
dolphin, bridge-type  trestle and  catwalk was  to ba  aonstrucvld CrOr the
purpose of loading bulk and baggage product urea at 220 toiuf per Ii; tuj and
2,200 bags per hour, respectively, to ocean-going vesselo and coactal
barges.  It was  also to be  used for loading  and unloading of equiplment,
materials, supplies and conaumbles. The scopa of work a? the jetty
package comprised  the design and  engineering, prefabrication  of piles,
pile-driving and extensive concrete works. These activities tware estimated
to take at least 13.5 months for the completion of the jetty and another
eight months for the erection of the materials conveying/hanilinU system on.
the loading platform of the jetty by other contractors.
48.       Notice for prequalification of bidders' for all mzjor coatpnents
of the Project  was consolidated  in one  advertisem2nt and  i-susd ill the
t,ocil and foreign newspapers in September and October 1984, rsepsctively.
Tn response to this advertisemant, CUFL received 18 applications f   seven
countries, namely: Japan, Korea, Singspore, Thailand, China, 'ur,tey and
India  for  the   jetty  construotion  under   Package  PU-1.   Sinr   the
prequalification notice did not indicate the source of financing under
PU-I, the bidder's eligibility clause from each respactive financiers was
riot imposed during  the  prequalification  stage.  In  the  co-finnnciers
meeting held in Februny 1985, ADFAED agreed to finarce the jetty  package.
The prequalification documents were subsequently forwarded to ADFAED for
approval of the eight prequalified bidders from four countries: Japan (5),
Korea (1), Netherlands (1) and Turkey (1), as proposed by iJFJ and 'TEC.
49.       On 28  June  1985 the  tenider documents usirg  the  tca-nvelope
bidding procedure  were issusd  to the  eight prequalified  biddesr*w   As  a
result of the evaluation of the seven bidders who submitted their bids (the
Turkish firu declined to submit its bid), recommondation by CUFL to  award
the  jetty contract   to  the  lowest   priced/evaluated  bid,er,  Taisei
Corporation of Japan, at a total coat of Yen 912 million plus Takm 28.5
million ($4.77 million equivalent 1/) was initially approved by ADiAED; but
ADFAED later  expressed inability  to finance  the jetty  contract bsacuie
funds available from ADFAED had been decreased considerably due to currency

period that wm  longer than that envisaged at the tim of appraisal.  The
cost overrtm in foreign exchange was mainly coaued by the realign ent of
foreign curmicy rates after award of contracts apart from delays in the
early implementstion phase of the Project (see pars. 54). Other factors
that contributed to  the foreign exchane cost overrun are su.irized as
follows (see also Appendix 15):
j/  The imposition of development surcharge aid import fee in addition  to
custom duties mad sales taxes has increased the rate from an estimated
2.5 per cent to 7. 5 per cent.

(ii)  The location of the fresh-water intake station ws  changed,
due to saline water intrunion, from the forser location at

the increase  in pumpira  capacity as  al as  inarease  in
length of the water pipeline (about *4 Million).
(iii)  The price of equipmet, mterials and service escalated as
a result of delays relating to finalization of the Project

construction of the Plant (about $2 olliom).
(iv) The construction and erection of process facilities
originally contemplated to be carried out by direct local'
labor were, however, awarded to foreign ccntractors due to
shortage of skilled local labor. These costs related to
foreign subcontraotors for process vesel fabrication,
equipment erection, insulation, refrectory lining, piping

12. Disbucrsmnt of Bank Lans
60.      The original Loan Agreement for the Project        signed on  17
November 1981, but tk date of effectivenes of the lon bed to be extended
seven time as reqysted by the Goveront before all pre-conditions for
loan effeotivmmsa could be  fulfilled (see para.  18).  The original  loan
me    r finall declared effeotive on  19 Janury 1983. Dt   of loan
proceeds at a cumulative  amount of $6.351 million  for th yers 1983  and
1984 pri,mrily covered  the expenditures  of two  sezvim  contracts,  i.e.
earth filling/site  preparation  and  the TA  service.  Soon after CUFL
appointed  oc  in  late  1984, the  pwce of  iementation as  well as
distxwsaent activities of the Project improved at the start of first
quarter of 1985. The disbursements of the loan proceed1 w'r at peak
during the critical construction period from  the first quarte of 1986  to
the third quarter of 1987 (aee Appendix 16 for actual disbu_nts of loan
proceeds). The approval of the Supplementary Loan by the Blak in late 1986
was timely,  enabling both GCr  and the  subontractors to  mintain  their
respective contractual obligations on a continuom   bsis.

61.      In the original Loan ASreement,  the utilization of the  logn
proceeds  expetoted to  be completed by 31 Dw1br 1986. Horvr, the
loan closing date w' extended to 31 December 1990 in order to coincide
with the closing date of the supplementary Lan. Out of the total loan of
$100.961 million 1/, the contract awards aid disbusmnts as of 31 May
1988 amowated to  $88.326 million  and $80.609 miion, repectively.   In
view of the completion of the Project, it was estimted that about $2.85
million will be cancelled from  the original lon ainmt. The  renmining
disburse_ts to be  e    xier  the origial  loan are expected  to  be
completed in Jum 1989 upon issuance of the final acceptano by CJFL of the
two major contracts (Jetty and civil works for proces/utility) arm
subsequntly, the Governmnt/CUFL will request the Bak to effect closing
of the original loan (see Appendix  17 for final allation of proceeds of
the original lown). For  the Supplentary Lan,  the contract aids awx
disbursements ammted to $19.81 million and $12.01 million,  respectively.
The remaining proceeds of the loan will be utilized for the Operational and
enamnt Advisory Services and  the praourmnt of oonsumble catalysts/
chemicals and critical materials  and apares a  needed in the  inten
and operation of the Plant till late 1990 (see Appendix 18 for rvised
allocation of prooeeds of the Supplentary Lan).
13. Bank's Role as Coordinator
62.      Te Bak was requested by the Goveziat in 1979 to undertake the
role of coo    tr  as    the co-fianiers. A           r.nim of agremnt
setting forth, in gairal term, such aspects as the Project            ion
arr-ng- ta, allocation of coqmp    ts to be fi'ard by eob co-finanier,
aid coordination amnn  them was siged aang the oo-finoiers and the Bank
in 1983. The lank also performed a similar role during the early stage of
the engineering loan for technical services for the uw fertilisr plant
and the gas systm. Because of the nagituie of the total forein exchOnge
requirements which made it difficult for the Bank to finane the Project
cost alone, the Goverunent requested Sank assistance in mobilizing the
total foreign exchange  requirements of the Project.  In respns  to  the
request of the Bank and the Government, the other co-finaniers agreed tc
join the Bank in the financing of the Project. The firet pro-appraisal of
the Project in February/Mrch 1980 was initiated  d                 bory the
Bank, with  representatives   of ADFA1D,  CIDA,  IaDB,  OUF and  SPD
participating. All these co-financiers also participated in the appisal
of the Project in October/Novenber 1980. The Bank also paticipated in the
subsequn  _meetings of the co-finenciers  held in Dhaka for  nnitoring  the
progress of  iplantation of the Project, and reviewing  other natters
related  to Project implementation.   The matte  disc_used  included
procurement procedure,    definition   of critical  item,  contrating
arrangmnt bete       F CUIL and GC and allocation and reallocation of Project
components among co-finaniers.  Following a request of the Goverrimnt, the
Bank also  conducted a  reappraisal of the Project in Juma-July 1986, anr

66.      The soaps and coparAnts of the Project an foruAlated  during
appraisl in 1980 we  based on infomtion  and data obtained from  the
technical advisory services which we  finmnod  by the Ban* uner Loan No.
282-BAN(SF) in late 1976 (see pars. 11 & 12). The Plant was constructed
in oonforuity with the scope of the Project an originaily envisaged.
During the iuplintation of the ProJect, however, there ws only one major
chawe in the oontractor a scope of work related to the onstruction of the
fresh-water intake station  and  its  pipeline network.  The  revision
recmmniurded by TA was mainly due to saline water intruion at the Sikalbahs
Canal for the propoed water pumping station.  A new location at the
KVAryphuli River was later decided upon for the tter paping station which
involved increase  in puiug   a ity  and increase  in length of water
pipeline, from 8 1m to 28 km from the Plant site (see pas. 59).  This
increase was reflected in the updated cost of the Projet at the tim  of
reappraisal of the Project in 1986. There we, therefore, no chanp in the
scope of the Project as envisaged during the time of reappaisal. Both the
original scope and the increased copmptos  under the  up;plry  loan
wer wel* conceived. The provisions in the Bank  loon for pr      mnt of
equipmant, materials and services were adeqtLte.
67.      The use of the Kellogg aonia process and the Mitsui-Toatsu urea
process as provided by GC wa made with the conr m  of the Dank and
other co-finaniers while selecting OC through interntional oampetitive
bidding mong prequalified  contraotor (para. 27 to 32). Both processes
are well-proven, and have been in suooessful comercial operation in a
number of plants for several yewas in miny countries. The urea process  is
also in operation in the Ghorasal fertilizer plant in Bangladesh which was
also engineered and constructed by the sam oC in 1970. For the abeorption
and regeneration of carbon dioxide in the aimnia plant, the well-proven
activated Benfield process has been applied.  The mmin ammonia  synthesis
gso comprssor and  recycle gas compresor and their stem turbines were
fabricated by well-known umnufacturers and suMpliers. These units are also
commercially proven. Other major process equipment such as the ammonia
synthesis converter, high-pressre steam boilers anl critical papa were
also supplied by repAted manufac rs. lhe Plant is  furnished with  a
water treatment facility with a satisfactory design and ample capacity  to
ensure adequate supply of boiler feed-water systm and other process
related cooling systema.
68.      The design  of the Plant adopted  sma proven  features of  low-
energy process involving more eoonomical utilization of process heat than
the conventional process such as combustion air preheating in the amonia
plant and condensate recovery hydrolyzer in the urea plant. As a result,
the capital cost was increased by about $6 million ($4 million in the

cost estiute  (ee Appendix 19). Howw r, due to the  appreciation of
curren-ies, particularly the Japanese Yen j,  in which the contracts were
awszded vis-a-vis  the currencies  in  which the  loans and credit were
de_minBted, this amount increased by about $100.77 million after taking
into aoccmut the contract variations listed in Appendix 15 and the
prevailing rate at the time of the disburseemnt (Appendix 16). There os a
foreign-exchange cost overrun of $87.85 million (30.3 per cent) and $23.7
million (6.7 per cent) as compared with the cost  estimte at the timr  of
appraisal and reappraisal, respe¢tively.
70.      The tote.l actual Project cost is summarized in Table 12 compared
with the Ashusani fertilizer project completed in June 1983. The Aabuganj
Fertilizer Plant / in Bangladesh which was also co-financed by the Bank
(Loan Nos. 217/396-BAN(SF)) may be used as a couparison beoause of its very
considerable similarity to the Projeot; both projects were designed to
establish a new amnenia/urea  fertilizer plant using natural g   as
feedstock and fuel. The rate capacity of the Ashugani plant is 1600 mt/day
of ures and is slightly smaller than that of the CUFL plant which has a
capacity of 1700 mt/day.  However, there  are more components added to the
CUFL plant such as raw-water  intake station and pipeline, Jetty  facility,
bulk urea storage and handling facilities and site dredging. In comparing,
the total cost of the two projects taking into acoount the above'
differenoes and adjustment on completion period on the s basis, the CUFL
plant is about $96 million (20 per cent) lower than the AahuganJ plant (see
note "d" in Table 12).
J  Averoge exchange rate in the past 6 years for USL.00 is equivalent to
Yen 238.78 (1983), Yen 236.8 (1984), Yen 239.65 (1985), Yen 169.45
(1986), Yen 145.12 (1987) and Yen 126.13 (up to June 1986).
;/ The plant was built using the Friedrich Uhda prooess for the
production of ammonia and the Stamicarbon prooses for the production
of urea.

C.  IuDlemntation Pla  and Project Schedule
71.      The  iplementation  plan  for the  Project was  satisfactorily
followed using: (i) a TA team to assist CUFL in the prepartion of tender
docouents for the recruitment of the site-filling contractor awd QC, and
supervision of QC works; (ii) a QC for services responsible for the overall
implementation  of  the  Project  including  engineering,  procurement,
supervision of erection and construction of services contractors, guarantee
the performance of the Plant and training of CUFL personnel; (iii) CUFL as
Executing Agency, with key personnel drawn mainly from WCIC, responaible
for overseeing the implementation of the Project and for liaison with the
Bank and (iv) the Bank as coordinator among the co-financiers. To ensure
satisfactory and timely implementation of the CUFL project and the IDA
assisted Bakhrabid-Chittagons gas pipeline projcwt (see pars. 5), the
Government established NOC for coordinating the activities of the two
projects.  These arrangements contributed  significantly  to  efficient
implementation of the gas pipeline project that was completed in 1984;
however, NOC was urable to expedite the Government's confiraation for award
of oC contract (see pam. 55). In retrospect, the TA and CC arrangement
for executing a project as complex and as large as the Chittagong Ures
Fertilizer Plant has proved to be successful.
72.      The Project implementation schedule as presented in the Appraisal
Report of 1981 Was reasonable. It allotted 13 months for prequalification
of aWplicants and subsequent bidding for the general contract, two mx*ths
for mobilization of GC and 38 months for completion of the Project by (c.
However, during the early phase of  the Project, the implemnttion was 27
months behind the original schedule envisaged at the-tim  of the- appraisal.
The main cpases of the delay were:
(i) The prequalification of nine contractors for the general
contract, out of 13 considered, took four months more than
expected due to the need for properly assessing the
engineering and financing capability of some firmB;
(ii)  The  ITB  for  the general contract was  issued to  the
prequalified contractors   some   12 months  later  than
originally scheduled because bid doowuents could not be
finalized until the arrangements  for the implmentation of
the Project were agwxL  =oc6_ cs=£inanisn>   Due to  the
different procedures, guidelines and prefereos held by the
co-financiers, a series of protracted ocnsultations amWng
the co-financiers, as well as between the Goverzuent and the
co-financiers, were held during 1980-1982 before a final
coqpromise formula  for contracting  arrangemuat  for  the
implementation of the Project could be evolved n  bember
1982 (see paras. 27 and 28); ad
(iii) The appointment of oC took about 11 months longer than
expected mainly due to procedural delays in the Gove2wurt's
decision after the Bank and other co-finamiers had given



- 64 -                        ATTACHMENT I
concurrence to the CUIFL rewi ca,dtion of the selected oc
and the need to confirm the availability of ammonia prooess
license from licensor through the seleoted oC (see pyras. 31
and 32).
The general contract agreement between CUFL and TBC wis signed on  25
November 1984 and be¢ame effective on 24 December 1984 with the aim of
completing the Project within  38 months.  The Plant was mechanically
completed and subsequently accepted by CUFL on 1 February 1988, a month
ahead of the contractual schedule.
D.  Contractina for Goods and Services
73.      The procurement of equipjmnt, materials and various services was
undertaken by oC on behalf of CUWL in accordance with the respective
guidelines, procedures and eligibility requirimts of the seven
co-financiers in respect of the components allcoated for their financing.
The procuireent activities (see pars.  38 to 41) were generally carried out
efficiently and according  to the principles of quality and economy.  No
serious problem was encountered in the contracting and procurm ent of "o3or
machinery and equipment, particularly the process-and time-critical  it _ ,
as most of the these vendors/manufacturers (about 70 per oent, see Table 3
and 4) were from Japan where TBC gave them utmost asswrance for its
commitment. As a result, deliveries of the process-and time-critical item
were kept on schedule.
E.  Environmental Aspects
74.      The Plant was constructed with appropriate treatments to control
spills and dust emissions and to minimize the discharge of liquids, gases
and urea dust particles into the environment in all areas of the complex.
The environmental protection measures adopted for the Project were in
accordance with the Western/Japanese standards as they are more stringent
than the local environmental authority, the Deprtmmhnt of Envir&omental
Pollution Control. Provision was made in the design of the facilities to
safeguard accidental process spills including pump leeks and chesical
vessel ruptures such that they could be adequately contained, collected,
treated as required, and recycled back to the prooces. Also, discharge of
toxic or hazardous materials from the Plant is strictly prohibited.
Enforcement of the environmental rules and regulation and routine
monitoring of the effluent from the discharge point of the sources is
carried out by an in-house environmental unit function under the utility
department. With respect to the oocupational safety aid health of the
pereonnel in the Plant, the facilities were constructed in acoordance with
standards acceptable to the chemical industry which provided the following:
(i) adequate exhaust/ventilation system for buildins; (ii) adequate mster
supply and sanitary disposal within the oomplex; (iii) maximun atmosphric
exposure for high pressure and hazardous prooess; (iv) adequate catwalks
and railings for routine maintenance  (v) good insulation with protective
aluminum jacket for high temperature piping; (vi) vent stacks for process
related equipment and machineries; (vii) fire fighting, rescue and first



- 65 -                     ATTACHMENT I
aid facilities including fully equipped ambulanoe, fire trucks, portable
fire extinguishers, dry/wet fire sprinklers, fire alarm and fire detection
system; MAn (viii) essential safety tools including hard hats, goggies/
safety glassm, boots, respiratory masks; safety showers and eyewash
stations.
75.      Natural gas with the absence of sulphur is used as fuel for the
generation of steam and power. Stack height of at least 30 meters above
ground level provided for the  fuel gas exhaust systma  is acceptable on
standard engineering practice.  A build-in  scrubber/exhaust fan system
integrated on top of the prill tower was installed to capture fine urea
dust carried-over during the prilling process. No sample has been taken so
far at the discharge of the exhaust; however, based on site observations,
the scrubber seems to be operating well within the design para eters.  A
number of beg-house type collectors were also installed at the sizing  and
transferring points of the urea handling system. As the Plant is the only
chemical plant located in the rural area far from large urban areas, no
particular probleums with effluent air have so far been experienced at the
site surroundings.
76.      The concept of treatment of  liquid  effluent at source of
generation wms adopted and the treatment system Wms specifically designed'
to meet its requirement as follows:
Area of Source        TI t   System                 Puroo
ammonia unit         neutralizing pit         boiler blow-down

neutralizing tank       polisher regeneration wastes
oil separator/skimmer   oil wastes
auxilliary areas     oil separator/skimer   oil wastes
All the treated liquid effluents from the souroes are piped undergroui
with grmvity flow to an effluent pond (16 x 15 x 3 cubic i-ters) designed
for a four-hours retention time for final pH control and dilution/aeration
by the use of a blower.   he effluent frao  the pond is  then  _mped for
disposal (at a design flow  of about 790 gallon   per miute) into the  mea
taking into acout the beeficial ues and  the asimilative capcity  of
the receiving water and carried to a point where rapid mixing is asured at
all times during the year.  Effluent sample  from the Plant outflow  was
taken by the in-house environmental unit analyzing  for pH, amonia  (NH )
and supended solid (sa) once a day; oil, copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and ziL
(zn) once evEry week;  and bio-oxygen demRnd (BOD)  once every ncnth.   The
analysis of the effluent outflow for the months of Mbrch and April 1988 is
averaging as below (all unit in milligram per liter except pH):

F.  Initial Onerations
77.      The Project has attained its  min objective to  establish  an
integmted ammonia/urea fertilizer coWlplex with a production capacity  of
1,700 mt/day prilled urea, based on indigenous natural ga as feedstock and
fuel (see Table 9, para. 64).  The Project facilities are well maintained
by a number of well trained  engineers and technical staff, so=a of whom
have had overseas trmining and are familiar with nmdern fertilizer plants.
With prior approval given by the Bank, CUFL has retained GC to provide
operational and management advisory services covering the period from
February 1988 to Augut 1990 (see paras. 51 to 53).
78.      Since March 1988, CllFL has been facing  a critical imbalance  in
its finished product's in-and-out flow at the storage facilities (see Table
10, psra. 65). The overloading stockpile of urea has ethd te 95,000
tons (85,000 tons bulk and 10,000 tons bagged) in-plant storage capacity.
Consequently, it has frequently caued CUFL to reduoe its production  rate
in order to sustain continuous operation and to avoid untimaly and costly
shut-down of the Plant. Most importantly, the stockpile of urea valuad at
about $12.0 million would adversely affect CUFL's finanial position.   The
main cause for the overloaded stockpile of urea are:
(i) full-scale commitment for export by BCIC was not anticipated
until such time as urea achieved export quality in late
December 1987 and the Plant attained continuou steady
opertion in March 1988;
(ii) low demand of urea in local market because sugpply of ures
from existing plant was sufficient to meet local demsnd for
FY1987/88 due to a large carry-over of 0.2 million torna from



ATTACHMENT I
- 67 -
last fiscal year (production of 0.968 million tons versn
projected local demd of 1.06 million ton);
(iii) material handling conveyor system and shiploaders were faced
with various mechanical problems (the original mtanfacturer
of the conveyors went bankrupt in Deoember 1987 and a new
firm  (original manufacturer under new  u gnt)   has
recently taken over to rectify these problems);
(iv)  the majority of the shipments made so far was in bagged ures
(see Appendix 20) (bag loading is much slower than bulk
loading); and
(v) mostly "general cargo" vessels were used by the buyera of
urea instead of "bulk" type carriers (loading efficiency is
much less for "general cargo" vessels).
G.  Perfonrmnce of Technical Advisor and General Contractor
79.       CUFL engaged a TA, a GC and an Operational and MEaIeenmat Advisor
to assist in the implementation and initial operation of the Project.
1.  Technical Advisor (TAL
80.       The TA  team,   UNICO of  Japan   in- association with   three
international well-known engineering consulting firms from Japan and USA,
and two local firms, (see paras. 11 and 12), completed the feasibility
study of the Project uider Bank  Loan No. 282-BAN(SP).  The performmoe  of
the TA team was satisfactory in carrying out the initial phase of the
Project work which included the development of design oriteria and bid
specifications for  soliciting proposals  from  engineering firms  for  the
construction of the amnonia/urea complex.  As a result, the Bank approved
the request of the Government/CUFL to retain the services of UNIOD for the
implementation of the Project under Loan No. 541-BAN(SF).   In the  early
phase of the Project, UNIOW was able to maintain the eiploy,mt of experts
with high technical stanrard in the fertilizer industries to assist CUFL in
the evaluation of bids for the general contract. However, due to the delay
of 11 months before CFL was  able to obtain the Goverment'as approval for
contract award (see para. 72), most of these  experts beosce omitted  to
employment elsewhere and, in consequenoe, the new TA assigned to carry-out
the construction, commissioning and testing Lt the ammonia/urea complex did
not perform satisfactorily. The TA services were then taken over by the GC
who considered it necessary, in the construction of a plant as oomplex and as
large as the CUFL plant, to employ technical staff more -cupetGnt and
experienced than the staff of UNICD.
2.  General Contractor (CC)
81.       The overall perfornm3ce  of  oC  was  highly  satisfactory.   In
comparison with the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project ompleted in June 1983 (see
Table 11, para. 70), the achievement of OC in completing the Chittagong

Urea Fertilizer ProJect, inclusive of a comissioning ad testing period of
37 xmmths, a month ahead of the contractual sd3dule, is outgtanding
compared to the AahuSrnj Project which took more  than 90 mths.  aIC m
able to achieve all the important milestones set forth at the begirning of
the implementation:

82.      During the Project  implementation period,  seversi events snd
difficulties  interfered with,  or samtim s  briefly disrupted,  the
construction works of the Plant but these did not adversely affect the
implementation schedule because of countermeasur actions  taken by oc to
cope with each problem. These events and difficultie were: (i) shortage
of qualified welders; (ii) delayed shipmnt of materials by vendors sod
manufacturers in the early phase; (iii) shortage ofm enpower in the civil
construction and installation of equipmant; (iv) defective quality control
of civil works;  (v) slow pace  in custom cleranoo;  (vi) labor problems;
(vii) stoppage of work due to general strike; (viii) 1wm sad order
situation; (ix) temporary scarcity of building   aterials aaoh as cemont,
steel bar, asbestos sheets snd etc.; (x) delay in contract wards for WW-2,
WW-3(1) and (II), and PU-1 (see par. 43 for description of works);  (xi)
laying of water pipeline along busy public roed and (xii) hostile weather
conditions. In addition, the most difficult one wms the shortfall of
foreign currency cost of the Project due to realigmmnt of foreign
currencies starting in 1986 (see pares. 56 to 59).
83.      In spite of the foregoing, aC encoountered no serioua problem  in
carrying out its duties and responsibilities diligently bt taking action
which  included:   Mi)  the  initiation and completion of  preliminary
engineering works before the official start of the general contract (seo
pars. 36); (ii) the establishment of an effective intexuational network to
expedite foreign procurements including quality control inspections and
timely delivery of equipment and muaterials; (iii) the firm asurasnce of
purchases to vendors and manufacturers of process-sod tier-critical items

mobilizing effective and efficient manpower to meet Project requiranats.
Most importantly, the principal other factor contributing to the suoe ful



- 69 -                         ATTACHMENT I
implementation of the Project carried out by GC was the satisfactory
performance  undertaken  by  the  fourteen major  service  (or  package)
contractors (see Table 5 in para 43).
H. Performance of Executing Agency
84.      Despite their unfamiliarity with the co-financiers' procedures in
the early stage, CUFL with the assistance of TA and GC was able to
successfully implement  the Project.  The Plant was completed  26 months
behind the original schedule envisaged at  the time of the appraisal.  The
delay was mainly due to late appointment of WC in the early implemntation
phase. Although the causes of delay (see pam. 72) were beyond the control
of CUFL, the efforts made by CUFL to  expedite early  resolution of the
problems encountered in the selection of GC dCtrated aUFL'a ability  to
carry out the duties and responsibilities of an Executing Agency. lhe same
efforts were demonstrated later by CUFL  when the Project went into a  cost
overrun crisis  in 1986.  The  Project was  reappraised by the Bank and
subsequent financing arrangements were made from twc, of the original seven
co-financiers to finance a major portion of the foreign exdhange Cost
overrun on the Project.
85.       Since its  establishment  in  1980, CUFL has  functioned  as an
enterprise of BCIC mnd has ensured the effective management and efficient
operation of the Plant after the campletion of the physical erection work
of the Plant. Overall, its tie-up with BCIC has been a positive element in
the institutional strengthening of CJFL (see Table 2  in parm. 17).  CUFL
has faced no significant problem in assigning technical staff and officials
because of the availability of adequate experienced personnel within ECIC.
Srince BCIC is in charge of all ongoing and planned chemical fertilizer
plants in the country and because of its significant technical and manpower
resources, BCIC is able to provide support to CUFL in: (i) tackling
technical/operational   problems,    (ii)    assisting/effecting    annual
turnarounds, (iii) filling senior staff vacancies quickly, (iv) pooling and
procuring spare parts, and (v) contending with the bureaucrsay. As same of
the problems it enoounters are comon to the fertilizer industry, ECIC has
periodically organized consultations with concerned staff and officials
from other fertilizer plants in the country with the objective of
exchanging information on problem and their suocessful solutions likely to
be of assistance in dealing with its own current and possible future
problems.
86.      In addition to the overseas  training of CUPL personnel provided
under the Bank's original loan (see para. 46), the supplementary loan also
contained a provision for a team of expatriate advisors to assist CUFL in
the proper amnagement and operation  of the Plant in  the initial period
starting from February  1988 to August 1990 (see  paras. 51  to 53).  The
expatriate team is expected to assist CUFL in the management and operation
of the Plant, in particular in the scheduled initial overhaul of the Plant
during September/October 1988. At present, all activities must be reported
directly to the Managing Director, who is concurrently acting as Executive/
Technical Director. This involves the Managing Director in decisions which



-70 -                         A
should be made at a lower level, and limits the time he can give to
importt policy  matters, corporate  planuing  or m,nitorin  of  the
perfoimance of the various deprtments.  In  short, deoision-mking  is
overcentralised ari the Muging Director  is oveiwrked.  Also, in  my
operational,            adnta  d-technical matters, CUWL is still substantially
depedent on  CIC. As (nJFl ontiues to grow, it will require a  strategic
plan for identifying various operational and directioal option  so that it
can  operate  independently  in  aordance with accepted  intentional
chemical fertilizer industry principles.  In this respect, the expatriate
team will provide a strategic plan to strengthen CEWL's imnagement and
operational activities.
I.  The Bank's Performance
87.      The completion of the Project took about 13 years starting  from
the Project Identification Mission in Mbroh 1975 to the completion of the
Plant for production in February 1988. The initial six years mad three
months were spent on Project formulation and preparation, and the following
six years and nine months on Project implementation. From 1975, the Sank
was involved in the feasibility study, the selection of the plant site, the
preparation  of  a suitable  fza.m.ork  for  Project formulation  and
implementation and in the financing plan arrangements for the Project. The
Bank undertook the role of coordinator among the co-finaniers of the
Project and, mot importantly, played an important role in retaining the TA
services, selecting the UC and reappraising of the Project for
supplementary finacing.  At a  tim  when  the Govwrn t withbeld  the
clearance for CUFL  to o     ae   contract negotiation with  TE (se   par.
72), the ECnk played an important role in piruing the Gover(mnt to cw
with both the Bank and CUPL's decision for ontract award to the lowest
evaluated bidder for the general contract. The Governet finally  issued
the authorization to CUFL for contract negotiation with T9 after 11 nmths
delay.
88.      A good working  relationship  between CUFL  and  the Bank  mm
maintained throughout and no significant difficulties with CUFL were
encountered during Project imFiei.ntation. The Bank has closely mmitored
the implementation of the Project and responded expeditiously to special
requests made by CUIL, more specifically in: (i) financing additional
components such as nom-4estructive testing, water pipeline, oto mmication,
vehicles, oonetruotion equipment and unloading/inland trnsportation  using
the unallocated prooeeds from the original loan; (ii) financing the jetty
and maintenance equipment from the Supplementary Loan awd (iii) using the
proceeds of the original loan for disbarsements of additional contraots
prior to the effeotiveness of the Supplementary Lfan. The Bonks tin ly
approval of these requests enhanoed Project implementation in ter of
efficiency awd economy.

N.  OONCULlSION AND RUaCtfIDATICON
89.      'he completion of the Project  fell twenty-six months behind the
schedule envisaged at the time of its apprisal mAnly due to the lan time
taken in finalizing ang ts for the implmntation of the Project and
to the delayed  selection of OC  (see pars. 72).   The implemtntation plan
using the services of TA and CC to assist CUFL for Project implementation
(see paras. 3 to 7) has proved successful in executing the large industrial
complex constituted by the Chittagong Ures Fertilizer Plant, particularly
in regard to the involvement of several co-finanoiers.
90.       The Plant was physically completed  on 28 October 1987.  Testing
and commissioning of the urea  fertilizer complex  were undertaken during
August 1987 to December 1987. Ammonia was first produoed on 25 October
1987 and  urea  on  29 October  1987; this  was followed  by a  guamatee
performance test  from 1 to 11  January 1988.  The Plant was officially
accepted by CUFL on 1 February 1988, one month ahead of the GC's agreed
contractual schedule (GC's work started effectively on 24 December 1984).
The overall performance of GC was highly satisfactory. With prior approval
given by the Bank, CUFL has retained GC to provide the operational and
management advisory services covering the period February 1988 to August,
1990 (see pera. 51 to 53). The facilities are at present being properly
operated  and maintauned by CUFL.  Comoercial operation  of CUFL was
scheduled to start at the beginning of FY1988/89 on 1 July 1988.
91.       During the implementation period  of the Project,  OC and the  14
major foreign services (or package) contractors had done their utmost to
cooperate with the Government and CUFL in the use of national resources . A
number of local firms had been engaged as sub-ontractors for construction,
erection, installation and  other related services.  A workforoe of about
5360 Bangladeshi was directly employed by the foreign contractors (see
Table 6 in pam. 44), and also, local manufactured goods as well as local
available equipment and raw materials were used by the civil construction
contractors for  the Project.   By enabling  the country  to achieve  self-
sufficiency in foodgrsin production by ensuring availability of the
required fertilizer, the Project has attained its main objective to
establish an integrated asfonia/ures  fertilizer complex with a  production
capacity of 1,700 mt/day of prilled urea, based on indigenous natural gas
as feedstock and fuel (see Table 9 in para. 64). Since trial production
started in October 1987, CUFL has produed 207,111 tons of urea and
recorded a total sale of 107,763 tons as of 25 April 1988 (see Table 10 in
para. 65).
92.       CUFL has been facing a critical imbelance since Mrch 1988 in its
finished  products  in-and-out  flow   at  the  storage  facilities.    The
overloading of the urea stockpile has exceeded the 95,000 tons in-plant
capacity. As a result, it has frequently caused CUFL to reduce its
production rate in order to sustain continuous operation and to avoid
untimely  and costly  shut-down  of  the  Plant.  Most  importantlY,  the
stockpile of  urea valued  at about   $12.0 million  will adversely affect
CUFL's financial position. The main causes for the overlcaded stockpile of



ATTACHMENT I
- 72 -
urea are described in para. 78. It is anticipated th&t a normal level of
ures at the storage facilities should be mnintained by October 1988 after
overhauling of the Plant scheduled for September 1988. It is reomrenided
that the Bank closely monitor the progress of the first scheduled overhaul
of the Plant and the  inventory of ures at the storage facilities.  The
monitoring of the scheduled plant overhauling and urea stockpiling problem
may be made through the monthly progress reports submitted by CUFL to the
Bank.
93.      The actuil total cost of the Project as of April 1988 amnuted to
$512.95 million comprising a foreign exchange cost of $377.83 million and a
local currency cost of $135.12 million equivalent. The comparison of the
Project cost estimates at appraisal in November 1980 and reappraisal in
October 1986 and  the actual Project cost is  sumrized in Table 7  (see
para. 57). The cost overrun in locl currenoy of about Tk 1,309 million
was mainly due to higher rates of duties and taxes, and increased in
interest during construction (see para. 59). The cost overrun in foreign
exchange of about $87.85 million was mainly caused by the realigiuent of
foreign currency rates after award of contracts apart from delay in the
early implementation phase of the Project (see puesa. 56 and 59).
Had no delay of 27 months been  incurred during the early stage of the
Project, the urea fertilizer facility would have been completed on schedule
as envisaged at the time of the appraisal and at coat well within the
original cost estimate of the Project  (see pam. 69).  Sinoe the actual
total cost of the Project is substantially higher than the original
estimate, it is expected that effective from  the date of co.merial
operation, CUFL may have difficulty in complyint4 with the financial
covenants in Section 2.16 of the Project Agreement, particularly: (I) a
debt equity ratio of not higher than 60:40; (ii) a current ratio of not
less than 1.5; and (iii) a debt service ratio of not less than 1.5. It is
recommended that the Bank closely monitor the financial status of CUPL in
the forthcoming years, and suggestion to the Governat and BCIC/CUFL ways
of improving the financial profitability of CUFL after reviewing the first
year performance of comercial operation of the Plant.
94.      The proceeds of the Supplementary  Loan are  to be used  for
financing the cost of the operational and usnagmnt advisory services
until August 1990, catalyst and chinicals, and some ancillary equipmt and
materials. It is reco ended that the Bank send a Review Mission for the
Project during the fourth quarter of 1989 to examine the status of: (i) the
production of the Plant; (ii) the proceeds of the Loan, and (iii) the
financial data particularly on production cost and compliance with the
financial covenants.
95.      The supply of urea from  existing plants  in the oountry is at
present sufficient to meet demand for FY1987/88 due to the large volut of
0.2 million tons carried over from last year (see pra. 9). As a result,
about 99 per cent of CUIFL'a urea production was set aside by BCIC for the
export market. With regard to lornal urea market demad for 1Y1988/89, BADC
has projected a demand of 1.176 million tons which inoludes a supply of
0,191 million tons from CUFL (see para. 9 and 65). Pursunmt to Section

16, 17 and  19, Schedule 6 of the Lan Agre'mnt concerning traport of
urea for loal urket, the Governmet wil take nVoessary stepe to  ensue
that: (i) rnGdaYs are in good condition; and (ii) a river- crosing  ferry
for truck  hauling urea is provided duing the pek dmmd season of urea
from September to March in the  folowing year. Also,   L shuld  closely
coordiate with BADC so that loading of urea to local haulers is done in a
systemtic  and efficient way.  The relevant provisions in  the Loan
Agreement are as follows:
"Facilities for       ortation of Ure fa  the Plant
(a) To enable urea to be t     te   bV roao fro, the Plant to
the consuin  areas in  the Chittagong district, the Borrower
shall ensure that the Potiya-Anwra main road and the 5 kIm road
linking the ProJect site with such main road are  onstruted and
completed by June 1985.
(b) The Borrower shall provide and aSke available on a timely
basis adequate transportation faoilities including coasters,
bargee, rail transportation  and  trucks, for collecting  and
transporting ures from the Plant to the urea conmuAing areas."
"Facilities for Storase and Distribution of Fertilizer
Prior to the completion of the Project, the Borrower shall
prepare and  implement an overall prvgrm  for impoving awA
expanding the existing interal network of facilities for storage
and distribution  of fertilizer within  the country.  The Bank
shall be kept informed of steps taken in tis coeotion."
":Exort of Urea
The Borrower shall take steps to ensr that the urea fertilizer
prod: ed uner the Project is utilized primarily  for meting
dmstic demods and needs. No export of suck production shall
be permitted exaept to the extent of any surplus that ay remain
after meting such domestic dmwxs."
In view  of the  foregoing, it  is  recamamded that the Special Laan
Administration Mission should also closely exmine the continuing
conforzmane by the Goverent and CUFl in aooordace with the provisions in
the Loan Agreement conerning export and locl umzkets of ures as well as
traportation, storage and distribution networks for the lal market.

Because of the poor lifting of urea by the domestic buyers a
substantial quantity of this output was exported. The foreign
exchange earning during tho fiscal yoar was about US$ 20 million.
The pro3ect was completed ahead of schedule after the agree-
ment was signed. The delay in the project excution prior to the
signing of tho contract with the General Contractor was due to
delay in finalizing contracting arrangements & delay in signing
of the contract with the General Contractor.

P.    Proieot Imolementation,
The plant was mechanically completed on 29th October, 1987 1
and was formally acceptod by CUPL management on 2nd Pebruary,
1988. The Project execution was dolayed by 26 months due to
delay in finalising the contractlag arrangoemnt and delay in
the selection of the General Contractor. The Project has ex-
perionood a not 10.5% cost over run, attributing to exchane
rate fluctuation, changes in project scope, and inadequate
cost estimate of certain items. InVostment oosts in foreign
mechange have increased by 26% in terms of US dollar at the
exchange rate prevailing on 30.06.88. but if the exchange
rate provalling at the date of disburssemnt is considered
this increase would be 16%

Conments on Draft Project Completion Report on Fertiitser
Industry lUeliabilitntloct Project ( Credit 1023 - BD ).
The draft Project Completion Report on FIRP (Credlt No. 1023-BD)
prepared by World Bank has beon revieuved and our commeuts nre given helow s
1.   Financial and Economic Rate of Return i
In calculating the FIRJ  & EIBR in the draft PCD of tho  oh-Id Dauk
the assumptions made were realistic, The cumulative iiacrementail productlon
was, however considered from 1988 to 1995, which resulted io poor finan-
clal and economic rate of returns. It should be from 1983 to 1995 since
DCIC started acruing the benefits of F1RP from 1983.
2.   Sustainabillty of Rehobilitated Project s
Sustainability predicted in thae draft PCR of World Daik may not
r4fleet the actual situation, as the preluction was made on the basis of
low YIRR & LIRR calculated for 1988-1995 productive years instead of
1983 to 1995 production-years as mentioned earlier.
further, taking into account the present trend of development
towards more economic and efficient management of various enterprises
under BCIC and based on cumulative experievces of operating spphisticated
fertilizer industries in this part of the world, there are definite
reasons to be optimistic In sustaining economic operation of the plant
under discussion.
3.   GENISAL COUUENTS t
a) Fenchuganj Fertilizer Factory experienced difficulty in proruring
equipment which are at present more or less obsolete in natube.
This had appreciable impact on project completion time.
b) The objectives!.of all the three improvement projects were
fulfilled after implementatton and the benefits derived have been
discussed in details in the P1W of respective project.
a) It is worth mentioning here that the problems or plant defficieon-
cles, identified by the in-plant personuel zere realistic and as
a result, the achievement after implementation was up to the
desired level.
4.   CONCLUSION t
We have no other comments to make in the draft PCR.

Coinents Received from the Asian Development Bank
Mr. Alexander Nowicki
Division Chief
Policy-Based Lending, Industry,
Public Utilities and Urban Sectors
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Nowicki:
Re: Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Project
- Project Completion Renort -
We refer to your letter dated 2 August 1989 seeking our views
on the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer
Project prepared by your Department. Our Post Evaluation Office is also
currently evaluating the above Project based on the work of a Post
Evaluation mission which visited Bangladesh earlier this year.   Their
draft report may be expected around late September 1989.
In response to your request, we wish to offer the following
comments on your draft PCR:
1.   Paras. 3.1 and 4.1
The statement about capacity utilization of 81 per cent and the
assessment that the fertilizer plant is operating without major
problems on the basis of only three months operations during
July-September 1988 in FY1989 do not appear to provide a
realistic picture of the operational capability of the plant.
In fact, during the subsequent three month period in October-
December 1988, there was virtually no production of fertilizer
at the plart. We provide in Attachment 1 the production details
until May 1989. Based on this, paras. 3.1 and 4.1 shou)d either
be  amended  to  include  information  for  the  full  year or
appropriately qualified.
2.   Para. 3.7
The actual cost of the Project is computed at $525 million.
Details on the latest estimates of actual Project costs,
including breakdown between foreign and local costs, as well as
yearwise disbursements, are provided in Attachment 2.

ATTACHMENT III
3.   Para. 3.8
We provide as Attachment 3 the latest financing plan on the
Project.
4.   Para. 6.1
The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as calculated,
appears low and differs from our re-evaluation of EIRR of 9%.
The reason for the variation in the EIRR is evidently due to the
different assumptions made in its calculation, as indicated in
Attachment 4.
5.   Para. 8.4
The summation that the Project was implemented on a turn-key
basis does not appear to be correct. The Project in fact was
implemented through a cost plus fee arrangement through a
General Contractor and it is our assessment that this has
contributed to overdesign and higher costs.
6.   Para. 8.5
It is true that the Bank made a major effort in coordinating
seven financing sources.   However, the multiplicity of co-
financiers contributed to delay in Project implementation.
We hope you will find the above comments useful in finalizing
your document on the Project. We look forward to receiving your final
version of the Report when it is ready.
Very truly yours,
E. A. NONIS
