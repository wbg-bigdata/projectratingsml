PROJECT FOCUS, DESIGN AND RATIONALE
Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy of
Bangladesh. In 1979/80 the agricultural sector accounted
for about 55 per cent of gross domestic product, 75 per
cent of employment and 90 per cent of merchandise exports.
At present 59 per cent of the country's land area com-
prising 8.5 million hectares is under cultivation. About
80 per cent of the cultivated area is devoted to rice
production -- the staple foodcrop in Bangladesh. Never-
theless, Bangladesh is still not self-sufficient in food
production, and in 1979/80 about 2.9 million tons of
foodgrain had to be imported. Foodgrain imports during
the past five years had averaged 1.6 million tons per year.
A major objective of the country's Second
Five- Year Plan (1980/81-1984/85) is to achieve self-
sufficiency in foodgrain production. Since there is little
scope to increase the area of farmland in the country, the
Government intends to attain self-sufficiency in foodgrain
production by increasing the use of fertilizer, expanding
irrigation facilities and propagating high yielding variety
seeds. The level of nitrogenous fertilizer application
per hectare in Bangladesh is low at about half the world
average and far below the optimum dosage recomnended by
the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council. There is
much scope for greater use of fertilizer in Bangladesh.
Chemical fertilizer was first introduced into
Bangladesh in 1951/52. During the past ten years, use of
chemical fertilizer in that country had increased at an
average annual rate of 11.7 per cent from 281,500 tons to
reach 855,300 tons in 1979/80 including 544,500 tons of
urea fertilizer. The average annual rate of increase in
fertilizer consumption between 1975/76 and 1979/80 was
14.5 per cent. Demand for urea fertilizer is expected to
increase at an average annual rate of 13 per cent between
1980/81 and 1982/83 and at 10 per cent from 1983/84 onwards
to reach about 1,500,000 tons by 1989/90.



At present two urea fertilizer plants operate
in Bangladesh, and a Bank-financed urea fertilizer plant
which is under construction at Ashuganj is expected to
be on stream by November 1981. These three plants have
a combined installed capacity for production of 974,000
tons of urea fertilizer per year, and even at full capa-
city operation will not be able to meet the country's
projected demand for urea fertilizer. A considerable
amount of urea fertilizer will have to be imported by
the country, unless additional urea fertilizer production
capacity is installed in the country.
The proposed Project, which aims at establisning
a urea fertilizer plant with a rated capacity for production
of about 561,000 tons of urea per year, is designed to help
the country become self-sufficient in urea fertilizer when
it comes into operation in 1985. A small amount of surp4.us
urea fertilizer is expected to be available from the proposed
Project for export during the first three years of its
operation. The Plant will be located close to the city of
Chittagong which has easy access to domestic markets and
has adequate port facilities for handling exports of
surplus urea.
Bangladesh has abundant reserves of natural gas.
Proven gas reserves are estimated at 9-10 trillion cubic
feet. T;-ere are good prospects for proving of additional
gas reserves.  The natural gas deposits in Bangladesh are
of high quality and are suitable for the production of
nitrogenous fertilizer. At present a relatively small
amount of the proven gas reserves (about 120 millon cubic
feet per day) is being used mainly for power generation
and for the production of fertilizer. This leaves large
quantities of natural gas available for further development
of the country's chemical and fertilizer industries.
Natural gas from the Bakhrabad gas field will
be used as the basic feedstock and fuel for the proposed
Project. The Government has already secured financing from
the International Development Association (IDA) and other
cofinanciers to develop the Bakhrabad gas field and construct
a gas transmission system from Bakhrabad to the Chittagong
area to supply gas to the proposed Project and other potential
gas users.



The Executing Agency for the proposed Project
is the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL), which is
a newly established company fully owned by the Bangladesh
Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) on behalf of the
Government. Provision is included in the proposed Project
to train technical staff of CUFL and to recruit foreign
experts to assist CUFL in the management and operation of
the Plant for the first three years so as to ensure optimum
use of the installed plant capacity.
The total cost of the Project is estimated at
$467.5 million, of which $290 million is foreign exchange
cost. It is proposed that a Bank loan of $72 million
(including $2 million to be consolidated from Loan No. 282-
BAN(SF) approved on 23 November 1976) be provided from the
Bank's Special Funds resources to finance part of the foreign
exchange cost of the Project. The balance of the foreign
exchange cost of the Project has been secured by the
Government of Bangladesh from the following sources: Abu
Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development ($25 million equi-
valent); Canadian International Development Agency ($20
million equivalent); International Development Association
($15 million); Islamic Development Bank ($16 million equi-
valent); Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan ($60
million equivalent); and Saudi Fund for Development ($85
million equivalent). The Project would be implemented over
a period of 53 months.
The Project has an economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) of 19.0 per cent and a financial internal
rate of return (FIRR) of 11.7 per cent.  Sensitivity
analysis of EIRR and FIRR indicate that the Project is
economically and financially viable even under adverse
conditions. The Plant would help Bangladesh achieve net
foreign exchange savings and earnings estimated at $114
million a year.
The Project would involve operational risks
that are inherent to the chemical industry. These risks
would be minimized by adopting well-proven technology
which could be supplied by internationally experienced
firms. Due to its capital-intensive nature, the Project



would incur financial risk if the Plant could not achieve
full utilization of installed capacity. In order to
avoid such risks, a training program for CUFL personnel,
and the provision of management and operational advisors
during the first three years of plant operations is
included in the Project. The Government has also assured
the Bank that key positions within CUFL will be filled
only by senior and experienced executives.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.        In November 1976 the Bank approved a loan of
$2.5 million from its Special Funds resources for the
Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Technical Services Project
in Bangladesh../ This Technical Services Project provided
technical advisory and consulting services for the pre-
paration and subsequent implementation of: (i) an integ-
rated ammonia/ureaJ fertilizer plant (the Plant) with a
capacity to produce 1,700 metric tons of urea per day at
Chittagong; and (ii) a related Gas System comprising the
development of gas wells at the Bakhrabad gas field and
a gas transmission pipeline for the supply of gas to the
Plant and other gas end-users in the Chittagong area.
2.        The Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
(BCIC), is the Executing Agency for the Technical Services
Project. In January 3978 BCIC appointed UNICO International
Corporation (UNICO), / a Japanese consulting firm, to under-
take the required technical services. The services were
carried out in three phases. Phase I would involve the
preparation of a comprehensive project report, in two
distinct parts -- one for the Plant and the other for the
Gas System -- covering the feasibility and implementation
aspects of the Plant and the Gas System. Phase II would
involve the development of design criteria and bid speci-
fications for soliciting proposals from engineering firms
for the construction of the Plant and the Gas System.
Phase III would involve the evaluation of proposals for the
general engineering contract and provision of technical and
management assistance for the implementation of the Plant
only.
1/ Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) approved on 23 November 1976.
2/ A Glossary of Technical Terms is contained in Appendix 1.
3/ Under its contract with BCIC, UNICO had been performing
the technical services in association with JGC Corporation
of Japan, DeGolyer and MacNaughton of USA, WilliamsBrothers
Engineering Company of USA, Technical Consultants & Asso-
ciates Ltd. of Bangladesh and Hydrocarbon Consultants
Ltd. of Bangladesh.



3.        UNICO started work on Phase I in January 1978.
Towards the end of 1978 the Government of Bangladesh asked
the Bank to assist in the mobilization and coordination
of financing for the Plant and the International Develop-
ment Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to provide
similar assistance for the Gas System. The Government,
the Bank and IDA closely monitored and reviewed the work
of UNICO. Reports under Phase I were submitted for the
Gas System in October 1979 and for the Plant in February
1980.1/
4.        A pre-appraisal of the Project (i.e. the Plant)
was conducted by a Bank Mission which visited Bangladesh
from 18 February to 7 March 1980. Based on the results
of the pre-appraisal, a Project Report was prepared by the
Bank in cooperation with the Government. At the request
of the Government the Project Report was circulated by
the Bank to interested cofinanciers and a meeting was
held in Manila from 24 to 25 July 1980i for the purpose
of mobilizing contributions and coordinating cofinanciers'
positions on the Project.
S.        Subsequently, an Appraisal Mission visited
Bangladesh from 24 October to 15 November 1980. The Mission
was composed of V.A. Groope (Senior Project Engineer) as
Mission CHief; M. Yoshitomi (Project Economist); R. Kiji
(Financia} Analyst); S. Hashimoto (Country Officer);
D.C. Amerasinghe (Counsel) and W. Diggelmann (Consultant,
Equipment Specialist). Mr. Z. Noorzoy, Deputy Director of
Country Department also visited Bangladesh from 4 to 7 November
to assist the Mission in discussions with the Government
and other cofinanciers. The Mission was also joined
by separate missions from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab
Economic Development (ADFAED), Canadian International
1/ The Gas System project was appraised by IDA in February
1980. Financing arrangements for the Gas System project
have been finalized by GOBwith IDA, OECF and OPEC Fund.
2/ The meeting was convened by the Government of Bangladesh
with the assistance of the Bank. Representatives of
ADFAED, IsDB, OECF, SFD, Canada and Italy attended the
meeting.



- 3 -
Development Agency (CIDA), Islamic Development Bank
(IsDB) and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of
Japan. During the appraisal it was confirmed that the
Project was economically viable and suitable for financing
by the Bank and other cofinanciers. The financing plan
and implementation arrangements for the Project were
finalized during several discussions between the Govern-
ment, the Bank and cofinanciers concerned.1! This report
is based on the findings of the Mission in the field;
discussions with relevant Government authorities, BCIC
and international and bilateral aid agencies concerned;
and the feasibility study prepared by UNICO.
1/ The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) and International
Development Association also endorsed the results of
the appraisal and joined in the financing of the Project.

II. BACKGROUND
A. Agriculture Sector
6.        Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy of
Bangladesh. It accounted for about 55 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP), 75 per cent of employment and
90 per cent of merchandise exports in 1979/80. Rice,
the most important foodcrop, accounts for about 80 per
cent of cropped area, while jute (the major export crop)
accounts for six per cent. Other crops such as wheat,
sugarcane, tea, cotton, pulses and vegetables account for
the remaining 14 per cent.
7.        During the past decade foodgrain production
in Bangladesh increased at an annual rate of about 1.5
per cent, lagging behind the population growth rate of
about 2.4 per cent a year. As a consequence, the country
depends on imported foodgrain. In 1979/80 about 2.9
million tons of foodgrain had to be imported.
8.        The Government plans to increase production of
foodgrain from about 13 million tons in 1979/80 to 20
million tons by 1984/85, mainly by increasing the use of
fertilizer and expanding irrigation and the use of HYVs.
There is Ilttle scope to increase the area of new farm-
land, but there is much scope for increase of fertilizer
use, considering that the present applications of ferti-
lizer are far below the optimum dosage recommended by
the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council.
9.        Irrigation is a vital prerequisite for increasing
the propagation of HYVs. Irrigated areas increased at an
annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent from about 1,3 million
acres in 1960/61 to about 3.2 million acres in 1977/78,
and are expected to expand at an annual rate of 10.8 per
cent to about 6.7 million acres by 1984/85. About 60 per
cent of all fertilizer consumed in Bangladesh is supplied
to HYVs of rice and wheat and an increase in areas under
these HYVs is considered to be one of the key factors for
increasing fertilizer use. The propagation rate of HYVs
of rice is expected to increase from 13 per cent in 1976/77
to around 30 per cent by 1990/91.



10.       The Agriculture Division of the Ministry of
Planning has projected fertilizer demand in Bangladesh
up to the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1984/85).
Total fertilizer demand is projected to grow at an annual
average rate of about 17 per cent etween 1978/79 and
1984/85 and is expected to reach about 1.9 million tons
in 1984/85, with demand for urea growing at an annual
rate of about 10 per cent, TSP at about 26 per cent and
MP at about 40 per cent.
11.       A major objective of the Second Five-Year Plan
(1980/81-1984/85) is to achieve self-sufficiency in food-
grain production. In order to reach this goal, the
Govemnment has launched a number of programs, including:
(i) increased adoption of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds;
(ii) extensive promotion of increased fertilizer applica-
tion; (iii) expansion and improvement of small scale and
pump irrigation systems; (iv) more aggressive agricultural
extension services; and (v) an expansion in institutional
agricultural credit. Within the framework of the Second
Five-Year Plan, the Government with the help of IBRD has
prepared a Medium-Term Foodgrain Production Plan, which
places special emphasis on irrigation.
B. Fertilizer Industry
12.       At present there are four chemical fertilizer
plants operating in Bangladesh. These comprise two urea
plants at Fenchuganj and Ghorasal, and two triple super-
phosphate (TSP) plants at Chittagong. The Fenchuganj plant
also has production facilities for ammonium sulphate (AS).
The plants at Fenchuganj, Ghorasal and Chittagong are
directly controlled by Bangladesh Chemical Industries
Corporation (BCIC), a Government corporation under the
Ministry of Industries. A urea plant at Ashuganj is under
construction and is expected to come on stream in November
1981. This plant is owned by the Ashuganj Fertilizer and
Chemical Company Limited (AFCC) whose capital stock is
fully subscribed by the Government, Trends in fertilizer
production in Bangladesh during the period 1967/68-1980/81
are shown in Appendix 2. A summary of fertilizer production
in Bangladesh from 1976/77-1980/81 is given in Table 1.

13.       The Fenchuganj plant, which was commissioned
in 1961, was the first fertilizer manufacturing plant to
be established in the country. It consists of a urea
unit of 106,000 metric tons per year (TPY) and an ammonium
sulphate unit of 12,000 TPY. The Ghorasal plant was
commissioned in 1970 with a designed production capacity
of 340,000 TPY ox urea. The two TSP plants, with designed
productio3n capacities of 32,000 and 120,000 TPY of TSP,
were estabLished at Chittagong in 1968 and 1970. These
TSP plants are based on imported phosphate rock and sulphur.
The Ashuganj plant, with a designed capacity of 528,000
TPY of urea, is expected to start commercial production in
November 1981.  The Ashuganj Fertilizer Project was financed
by ten cofinanciers including the Bank.-J The Fenchuganj,
Ghorasal and Ashuganj plants use local natural gas as
feedstock.
1/  The Bank approved a loan of $30.0 million on 20 February
1975 (Loan No. 217-BAN(SF)) anda Supplementary Loan of
$25.0 million on 26 April 1979 (Loan No. 396-BAN(SF)),
for the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project.



14.       Largely due to inadequate maintenance, the
capacity utilization of the existing urea fertilizer
plants in Bangladesh had averaged about 60 per cent
during 1976/77 - 1978/79. To improve production the
Government has taken steps to rehabilitate the existing
plants with assistance from Japan, the United Kingdom
and IDA. The capacity utilization of the existing TSP
plants had also been adversely affected by lack of suffi-
cient foreign exchange to import phosphate rock; conse-
quently, their average capacity utilization during the
same period was 32 per cent.
15.       As a result of the Government's efforts to
improve operation of the existing plants, the average capaci-
ty utilization during the last two years (1979/80 - 1980/81)
has improved to 79 per cent for urea and 47 per cent for
TSP. The rehabilitation measures and the current opera-
tional status of the existing plants are described in
detail in Appendix 3.
C. Fertilizer Consumption
16.       The use of chemical fertilizer in Bangladesh
has increased steadily since its introduction in 1951/52.
The establishment of the East Pakistan Agricultural Develop-
ment Corporation in 1962, which later became the Bangladesh
Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), contributed to
the increase in consumption of fertilizer ln the country.
During the past ten years, fertilizer consumption in
Bangladesh increased at an average annual rate of around
11.7 per cent from 281,500 mt in 1969/70 to 855,300 mt in
1979/80. The average annual rate of increase in urea
fertilizer consumption between 1975/76 and 1979/80 was
14.5 per cent.
17.       Trends in fertilizer consumption in Bangladesh
between 1968/69 and 1979/80 are shown in Appendix 4. A
summary of fertilizer consumption in Bangladesh during
1973/74 - 1979/80 is given in Table 2.

18.        Fertilizer consumption was sharply reduced in
1974/75 due to supply shortages caused by the shut-down
of the Ghorasal plant following an explosion which damaged
its control room. Unprecedented high prices for chemical
fertilizers in the world market following the steep price
hike of crude oil in 1973 and 1974 also resulted in a
temporary reduction in the consumption of chemical ferti-
lizers. Since 1975/76 fertilizer consumption had grown
steadily in Bangladesh. In 1977/78 an increase in ferti-
lizer consumption of about 40 per cent over 1976/77 was
registered. This increase in consumption was a result of:
(i) a higher procurement price for paddy; (ii) improvements
in the distribution system for fertilizer; (iii) expansion
of agricultural credit including liberalized credit pro-



cedures; (iv) maintenance of relatively low retail prices
for fertilizer; (v) development of irrigation facilities;
(vi) propagation of HYVs; and (vii) improvements in
agricultural extension services.
19.       A breakdown of fertilizer consumption by,
districtis given in Appendix 5. Of the country's 20
districts, the main consumption districts are Comilla,
Dacca and Chittagong which in 1979/80 accounted for
15.2 per cent, 8.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent of total
fertilizer consumption, respectively. These three
districts account for about 32 per cent of total fertili-
zer consumption in Bangladesh but only 16 per cent of the
total area planted to rice in the country. This points to
significant disparities of fertilizer consumption intensity
among districts. The largest application of fertilizer is
for rice (85 per cent) followed by jute (4 per cent) with
the remaining 11 per cent applied to other crops such as
sugarcane, wheat and vegetables.
20.       The major chemical fertilkers used in Bangladesh
are urea, triple superphosphate (TSP), muriate of potash
(MP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP) which was introduced
into the country in 1978/79. Urea accounted for 64 per
cent of the total chemical fertilizer used in 1979/80,
followed by TSP.4nd DAP (30 per cent) and MP (6 per cent).
The average NPKLJ nutrient ratio in Bangladesh is about
9:4:1. Heavy use of nitrogenous fertilizer is due to supply
constraints of phosphatic and potassic fertilizer because of
low domestic output of phosphatic fertilizer and lack of
foreign exchange to import phosphate rocks and potassic
fertilizer. It is difficult to optimize crop yields with
the present imbalanced NPK ratio, but the Government has
attempted gradually to improve this ratio. The NPK ratio
improved from 24:2;1 to 9:4:1 between 1962/63 and 1979/80,
and is expected to improve further. The Government has
agreed to prepare a program of action to achieve a more
balanced nutrient ratio in fertilizer application in
Bangladesh by the end of 1982. The Bank will be afforded
an apportunit D to comment on such program before its im-
plementation.

21.       The fertilizer requirements of Bangladesh
exceeded domestic production and the shortfall had to be
met by imports. During the period 1977/78-1979/80, imports
accounted for about 68 per cent of the total amunt of
fertilizer consumed in the country. All HP requirements
were imported, while TSP and urea imports met about 66
per cent and 50 per cent of total requirement, respectively.
About 90 per cent of all fertilizer imports were obtained
under various foreign aid and credit schemes. Appendix 6
shows the sources of supply for various types of fertilzer.
D. Projection of Demand and Supply of Urea
22.       Demand for urea in Bangladesh is expected to
grow steadily in the future. The growth rate will depend
on a wide range of interdependent factors including: (i)
agronomic requirements to increase crop production; (ii)
the development of irrigation facilities and propagation
of HYVs of rice and wheat; (iii) economic and organizational
factors, such as relative prices of fertilizers and crops,
agricultural extension services and agricultural credit
facilities; and (iv) the availability of facilities for
storage, transport and distribution of fertilizers.
23.       Based on the projection of the Ministry of
Planning afnd taking into account historical trends of
urea consumption, factors such as the development of
irrigation, propagation of HYVs, together with better
facilities for storage and transportation of fertilizer,
and a prospective gradual decrease in the subsidy for
fertilizer, the Mission projected that the demand for
urea in Bangladesh would increase from 615,000 mt in
1980/81 to 1,531,000 mt by 1989/90 at an annual rate of
13 per cent between 1980/81 and 1982/83 and at 10 per
cent between 1983/84 and 1989/90 (see Table 4 page 13).
The Mission's projection is close to the "aggressive"
demand projection presented by UNICO in 1978.
24.       Future supply of locally produced urea will
depend on the performance of the existing urea plants at
Fenchuganj and Ghorasal and the timing of comxnissioning
of the new urea fertilizer plants at Ashuganj, Chittagong
and Polash (near to Ghorasal) (see Appendix 3 for details).



- 11 -
The Government and a group of foreign investors, together
with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the
World Bank Group, have been examining a proposed project
to establish an entirely export-oriented urea plant at
Chittagong under the ownership of a new joint venture
company, the Karnaphuli Fertilizer Company Limited (KAFCO).
The Government intention for establishing the export-oriented
t'rea plant is to earn foreign exchange and improve the
country's balance of payments. Since technical studies
regarding scope, cost estimates and financing arrangements
are still being negotiated by the Government and the foreign
sponsors, the urea supply from such proposed plant has not
been taken into account in projecting urea production in
the country. The Government has given an assurance that
the Bank will be kept informed of any proposal for the
construction of additional fertilizer plants and will ensure
in the event of the Government deciding to proceed with any
such proposal the viabil1ty and implementation of the Project
will not be prejudiced.A! For the purpose of the supply
projection it is assumed that: (i) production of the
Fenchuganj plant will gradually decrease from a peak of
99,200 tons of urea in 1980/81 to 45,000 tons of urea by
1989/90; (ii) production of the Ghorasal plant will reach
a peak of 250,000 tons of urea in 1982/83 after the comple-
tion of rehabilitation works; (iii) the Ashuganj plant will
begin production in 1981/82 and will achieve 90 per cent
capacity utilization to produce about 475,000 tons of urea
per year by 1984/85; (iv) the proposed Chittagong plant
will begin production in 1985/86 and will achieve 90 per
cent capacity utilization to produce about 505,000 tons of
urea per year by 1988/89; and (v) the proposed Polash plant,
which will be constructed with assistance from the People's
Republic of China, will begin production in 1984/85 with
70,000 tons of urea and will increase production to 95,000 tons
of urea per year by 1986/87. Projected production of urea
by the various plants for the period 1981/82 to 1989/90 is
given in Table 3.

25.       The projected urea demnd-supply balance in
Bangladesh is given in Table 4.1J Based on the projections
for domestic demand and supply of urea fertilizer, it is
forecast that Bangladesh will have surplus urea for export
between 1985/86 and 1987/88. Future imports of DAP and
other forms of compound fertilizer may increase the avail-
ability of surplus urea from the proposed Chittagong plant
for export.  Taking into account the world urea fertilizer
i/ In October 1980, BCIC concluded contracts to export
20,000 mt of urea each to Pakistan and Sri Lanka during
November 1980 and January 1981. Although Bangladesh
still needed to import urea in 1980/81, fertilizer storage
facilities in the country were almost full in July 1980,
because fertilizer was not consumed as much as expected in
1979/80 due to drought. As a result, the Government
approved the proposed export of urea.

situationl/ and the geographical position of Bangladesh,
there are good prospects for Bangladesh to export its
surplus urea production to nitrogen fertilizer deficit
countries in Asia.
26.       Future exports of urea fertilizer will likely
be conducted under the supervision of BCIC, the holding
company of the Executing Agency of the proposed Project.
BCIC has acquired considerable experience in conducting
export business through handling the export of products
of its subsidiary enterprises (such as newsprint, paper
and cellophane to India, Pakistan and Nepal) and would
be capable of handling the export of surplus urea from the
country.

E. Marketing and Distribution
27.       BADC is sole'L  respornsible for the procurement,
distribution and marketi ng of locally producoe and imported
fertilizer in Bangladesh, At presernt, 3ADC rceives fer-
ti'lizer from. the local plants and from, imports through the
ports of Chittagong and Chalna. and distributes it to
intermediate godowns and thanal! level godo~ m,  Final
distribution of fertilizer to falers i:s mainl'y carried
out by about 32,000 private dealers appointe6 by BADCM
A small amount of fertilizer is channeled thr%-ough the
Thana Central Cocperatives Associations (TCCA" and Krishi
Samabaya Samities (KSS) which are cooperative societies
at the thana and village levels  respectively,
28.       To improve the availability of fertilizer to
farmers on a timely basis and to reduce marketing and
distribution costs, BADC introdueed the 'New Marketing
System" (NMS) in 1978 to the Cahittagong Division in order
to involve greater participation by the pritVate sector.
Under NIS,, BADC sells fertilizer to wholesale dealers at
primary distribution points which are generally located
in major towns. The wholesale dealers in turn distribute
the fertilizer to retail dealers and farmers, Compared
with the earlier system, NMS provides for inc--reased dealer
margins and permILs farmers to buy fertilizer from any
dealer.  is a resul t of the successful starr of NNS in the
Chittagoty Dvs i-on, NMS has since been intrduced through-
out the country by July 19800
29.       Of the total amovement of fertilizer in Bangladesh
in 1977/78, railroad transport accounted for 35 per cent,
inland water transport 33 per cent and road transport 32
per cent. Transport of fertilizer is mainly onducted by
private contractors for BADCO  Although fer:lizer accounts
for a small part of the country's total freiLgnt mcve-
ment (about 3 per cent at ports, 8 per cent of rail
freigh,t and 8 per cent of £ inland water cargo', there had
been severe constra:ints on fertilizer transport because of
the overall inadequate transport system and the higher
prior i ty assigned by the Governmente to the -ement of food.
I/  For administrative purposes, Bangladesh Ls divided into
4 divI sions, 20 di stricts, 64 subdivisrn-s D about 460

3G.        Transportation facilities required for the
delivery of urea from the Chittagong Plant to consuming
areas are estimated in AppedLx. 8. It is assumed that:
(i) urea required by Chittagong Divisicr, Chittagong
Hill Tracts and Noakhali Districts (areas adjacent to the
Plant) will be distributed from the proposd Chittagong
Plant by 5-ton trucks; and (ii) ure. required by the Khulna
Division (in the Southwest)  and the Rlashahi Division
'in the Northwest) will be transported from Chittagong to

and barges required between 1985/86 and 1989/90 for deli-
very of urea from the Chittagong Piant for dcmestic con-
sumption are estimated as shown in Table 5 below:

areas._
31.       Adequate storage facilities are essential for
the efficient distribution of fertilizer. In 1979/80
fertilizer storage facilities in Bangladesh totalled
505,000 tons; of this amount,BADC's storage was 404,000
tons and factory storage was 101,000 tons. BADC operates
9 transit, 62 intermediate and 1,064 thana godowns; about
50 per cent of the godown capacity is rented by BADC and
the rest is owned by it. To ensure that fertilizer is
available to farmers on a timely basis, storage for about
five months requirements is necessary under the current
internal transportation and local production system.
Taking into account the actual storage capacity of exist-
ing facilities and the poor condition of rented ones,
current fertilizer storage facilities are considered to
be inadequate. Prior to the completion of the Project, the
Government wlll prepare and implement a program satisfactory
to the Bank for expanding and improving the existing net-
work of storage facilities.i/
32.       Present construction programs for increasing
fertilizer storage capacities include: (i) storage
facilities of 150,000 tons to be constructed by BADC with
the assistaace of USAIDI/ and the Bank;4! and (ii) planned
factory st.c--ages at Ashuganj (48,000 tons), Chittagong
(102,000  '.ons) and Polash (32',000 tons).  By 1985/86 total
fertilizer storage capacity in Bangladesh will increase to
about 837,000 tons, after the completion of these additional
storage facilities. This is equivalent to about 4.8 months
of annual consumption and should be adequate to meet re-
quirements at that time.

1. Pricing
33.        The retail and ex-factory prices of fertilizer
in Bangladesh are set by the Government. The objectives
of the Government's pricing policy for fertilizer are to
set retail prices at levels which will encourage its wide
use by farmers, and ex-factoryprices at levels which will
allow fertilizer plants to earn reasonable profits.
Table 6 shows current retail, ex-factory and cif import
prices of fertilizer in Bangladesh. The retail prices
(urea $184/ton, TSP $151/ton and MP $117/ton) are con-
siderably lower than the cif import prices (urea $250/ton,
TSP $300/ton and MP $190/ton). Since May 1981 the ex-
factory price of urea has been fixed at Tk 2,400 per ton
($150 equivalent). The ex-factory price of TSP has remained at
Tk 4,350 ($272 equivalent) since July 1980. The current
domestic ex-factory price of $150/ton for urea is only 60
per centof the cif import price of about $250/ton.

34.       BADC, which procures and distributes fertilizer
to farmers, receives a subsidy from the Government to cover
the difference between its procurement and distribution costs
and its sales revenue. Budgetary allocation for fertilizer
subsidy increased from Tk 150 million in 1974/75 to
Tk 1.25 billion  in 1979/80.  It is the Gornment's policy
gradually to reduce the fertilizer subsidy_/ by increasing
j  Net fertilizer subsidy during FY78-FY81 were as follows:
FY78 F    FY80 FY81 (pro,ected)

the retail price of fertilizer and maintaining procurement
prices for crops at levels which would encourage fertilizer
use. The draft Second Five-Year Plan proposes to reduce
the average fertilizer subsidy from 40 per cent in 1979/80
to 25 per cent by 1984/85. It is the stated policy of the
Government that the subsidies on fertilizers will be kept
under constant review with a view to reducing the level
of subsidy and ultimately phasing them out as early as
possible. The Government will keep the Bank informed of
such reviews and will be given an opportunity to comment
on any changes in the Government's pricing and subsidy
policies ./
2. Credit and Extension Services
35.       An effective system of agricultural credit is
essential to promote increased fertilizer consumption by
farmers.  Although institutional agricultural credit
provides only about 20 to 25 per cent of the total agri-
cultural credit needs of farmers in Bangladesh, this
source of credit increased at an average annual growth
rate of 37 per cent from Tk 324 million in 1973/74 to
Tk 1,672 million in 1978/79. It is expected that the
figure is likely to exceed Tk 2,000 million in 1980/81
under the ipecial Agricultural Credit Program which has
been starzsed by the Government in 1977/78.  This Program,
with libei:al and simplified procedures, has enabled small
scale farmers to benefit from it. Also, institutional
agricultural credit has increased significantly as a
result of che Program.
36.       Agricultural extension services are conducted
by the Bangladesh Directorate of Agricultural Extension
and Management under the Ministry of Agriculture. In
addition to the Directorate's staff, BADC's thana inspectors
are also involved in the promotion of fertilizer consumption.
Due to a shortage of extension workers, guidance to farmers
has noc been provided effectively. Therefore, the Government
plans to increase substantially the number of extension
workers by developing training facilities for extension
workers with the assistance of IDA.-'

III. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect DescriDtion
37.       The proposed Project is to establish an integrated
ammonia/urea fertilizer plant (the Plant) with a design
capacity of about 1,000 mt per day (TPD) of ammonia to be
converted into about 1,700 TPD of prilled urea based on
indigenous natural gas as feedstock and fuel. On the basis
of 330 on-stream days per year, the Plant will have a rated
annual output of about 561,000 mt of urea. The objectives
of the proposed Project are to increase the country's urea
fertilizer production capacity principally to meet local
demand.   The Executing Agency will be the Chittagong Urea
Fertilizer Limited (CUFL), which is a newly created company
owned by the Government.
38.       The proposed Project will include the following
major components:
(i) acquisition and preparation of the site
for the Plant;
(ii) design, engineering and construction of:
(a) a 1,000 TPD ammonia unit;
(b) a 1,700 TPD urea unit; and
(c) utilities, off-sites and ancillary
facilities for the ammonia and urea
units;
(iii) construction of office and plant buildings
and a staff housing colony, including
community facilities for persons to be
employed in the management and operation
of the Plant;
(iv) supply of equipment for the construction
of the Plant;



- 20 -
(v) continuation of the employment of UNICO
as Technical Advisor to assist and
advise CUFL on the design, construction
and start-up of the Plant;
(vi)  employment of a Management Advisory and
Operational Services Team to assist CUFL
to manage, operate and maintain the Plant
during the initial three years after
commissioning of the Plant; and
(vii) training for selected CUFL personnel
in fertilizer plants similar to the
Project in Bangladesh and abroad.
B. Plant Size and Manufacturing Process
39.       The proposed plant sizes of an intermediate ammonia
unit of about 1,000 TPD and a urea unit of about 1,700 TPD
are considered to be the maximum sizes for which appreciable
benefits of scale can be achieved from single train units.
Ammonia and urea units of such standard maximum size capa-
cities have been well proven in the region and are known to
be highly reliable and efficient in continuous operation.
To go beyond such capacity limits would involve the adoption
of double train urea units, which would offset most of the
advantages of scale.
40.       The proposed Plant would adopt modern technology
for manufacturing ammonia, and would use centrifugal
compressors with an improved waste heat recovery system.
The production of urea would be based on a total recycling
process, and a single train reactor incorporating the latest
technology would be used to convert all ammonia to urea.
The plant s ize and technology proposed for the Plant are
considered to be in accordance with latest proven commercial
developments. A description of the plant size and production
processes is given in Appendix 9. More than half of the
estimated daily gas requirement of the Plant would be con-
sumed for generation of electricity and steam for the Plant.
The proposed Plant will incorporate the latest proven tech-
nology improvements for minimizing energy consumption
consistent with overall requirements for ensuring reliabi-
lity and economy of operations of the Plant.

C. Selection of Plant Site
41.       A site at Chittagong situated south of the Marine
Academy, on the east bank of the Karnaphuli river (see maps,
pagesiii & i') has been selected by the Government and
UNICO as the most suitable location for the Plant. Earlier,
a number of possible alternative locations at Chandpur,
Ishurdi, Ghorasal, Daudkandi, Shatnol, Ashuganj and
Chittagong were considered by the Government for the Plant
site. Following preliminary investigations by the Bank
and IBRD, the first four locations were ruled out. The site
at Chandpur was considered risky because of possible heavy
erosion by the lower Meghna river. Ishurdi on the bank of
the Padma river in the northwest region of Bangladesh was
eliminated because investment in a pipeline to bring gas
to Ishurdi would be prohibitive. Ghorasal on the Sitalakhaya
river and Daudkandi on the Gumti river were considered
unsuitable locations for the establishment of any large
fertilizer plant because of the shallow drafts of the rivers.
42.       Of the remaining three potential sites selected for
further detailed analysis, Shatnol was ruled out because of
a relatively lower economic rate of return. This left
Ashuganj and Chittagong as the only two alternative locations
for setting up the proposed Plant.   A urea plant is now under
construction at Ashuganj. If some of the facilities of that
plant could be shared with a second plant at Ashuganj then the
total cost of the latter would be marginally lower than that
of a similar size plant at Chittagong. In practice, sharing
of the facilities would be difficult especially when none of
the facilities of the plant under construction are designed
with sufficient excess capacity to support the operation of
a second large fertilizer plant at Ashuganj. The Mission also
considered that siting a second large urea plant at Ashuganj
could interfere with the operation of the plant now under
construction. Siting of the proposed plant at Chittagong,
on the other hand, would enable the Government conveniently
to export any surplus urea through the port of Chittagong,
and would support the Government's policy to disperse future
gas-based industries away from the northeastern region of
Bangladesh where all the country's existing gas-based
fertilizer plants are concentrated. In view of the above, the
Mission considers the Chittagong area to be an appropriate



- 22 -
location for the establishment of the proposed urea Plant.
The selected site is located in a relatively undeveloped
region in the Chittagong district and is consistent with
the Government's policy to give priority to the development
of the less developed areas and regions in the country.
43.       The proposed site at Chittagong south of the
Marine Academy on the opposite side of the Chittagong port
was selected after an extensive evaluation of three other
alternative sites in and around the Chittagong area. The
site was selected for the following reasons (see map on
page iv):
(i) establishment of the Plant on the site
will not interfere with, or prejudice
any plans to expand Chittagong airport
and the port, nor will it increase the
hazards to their use;
(ii) the site has sufficient suitable land
for the constrution of the proposed
Plant and for future expansion, if
required;
(iii) the site is convenient for handling the
anticipated volume of urea output of the
proposed Plant from the point of view of
both domestic and export shipping; and
(iv) the site will promote the increased use
of urea in the important district of
Chittagong and the surrounding areas.
44.       The site is easily accessible with regard to the
domestic fertilizer markets. By waterways, the urea output
of the proposed Plant can be transported to the western
district such as Noakhali, Barisal and Patuakhali and to
the ports of Khulna and Chalna for distribution to the south-
west and northwest regions of Bangladedi. The construction
of a 5-km road to link the Project site with the Patiya-
Anwaro road (now under construction) will enable urea to be
transported by road to the consuming areas in the Chittagong
district. The Government will construct both roads out of



- 2 23 
its own resources and the Governrant has assured Fhe Bank
that these roads wil' be coaipet   by June 1985. U
Provision has been made in tae cost e9timtes for the
construction of a jetty for Loading the urea produced by
the Plant to either one ocean-going ship of 8,500 dwt
capacity or to two coasters of 1,000 dwt capacity each at
one time.  Construction of the jetty and the completion
of the roads would be adequate for transporting the urea
from the Plant to its markets.
45.        The proposed site is situated in a minor earth-
quake zone, but the effects of possible earthquakes would
not be serious.  The foundations for the Plant would include
piled support for heavy strusctxZes and spread footing
support for light structures.  To protect the site against
floods and high tides, the Size would have to be elevated
20 feet above mean sea level. Stuitable filling material
in sufficient quantity is available from a river bed
deposit located about 1,500 maters southwest of the proposed
site.
46.        The Government has already surveyed and demarcated
the areas for the Plant, the housi-ng colony and the jetty.
Acquisition of all the necessary land is under processing by
the Government for transfer to CUFL. Of the 294 acres of
land, 100 acres will be occupied by the Plant, 65 acres will
be used for housing and the rest will be for roads, right-
of-ways for water pipeline for the Project and the jetty.
It will be a condition of loan effectiveness that CUFL should
have acquired all land, as may be required to enable CUFL t
undertake the construction of tne Plant.yl/
D.  Raw Material and  I          ilfiFA 'e
47.        The main raw mazerial reciuirement of the Plant
will be natural gas from the Bakhrabad gas field. The gas
is to be used both as feedstock and as fuel for the Plant.
The maximum dq ily gas requirement for the Plant is estimated
at 55 MMSCF.3 & The gas -from the Bakhrabad gas field contains

- 24-
about 94 per cent methane with very negligible amount of
sulphur and is suitable for urea production. A gas analysis
of the Bakhrabad gas field is given on page 8 of Appendix 10.
48.       The Bakhrabad gas field comprises four culminations
designated as A-1, A-2, B-1 and B-2. The total gas reserves
(proven and possible) of the B-1 and B-2 culminations were
estimated by M/S DeGolyer and MacNaughton of USA, the gas
consultant for the related Gas System Project, at 3.1 trillion
cubic feet, of which the proven reserves have been assessed at
1.1 trillion cubic feet. Other gas reserves can only be deter-
mined by drilling additional wells. The current estimated
reserves indicate that the Bakhrabad gas field is the largest
of its kind in Bangladesh. Based on gas demand projections
prepared by Petrobangla and agreed to by a joint IDA/Bank
Mission in May 1979, the total estimated off-take from the
Bakhrabad gas field by the Plant and other potential gas
consumers in and around the Chittagong area up to the year
2000 is 1.0 trillion SCF. Thus, the total proven gas reserves
at Bakhrabad would be sufficient to support the projected
total gas requirements of the Plant and other gas end-users
at least until the year 2000. Gas demard projections for the
Bakhrabad gas field are given in Appendix 11.
49.       From Bakhrabad, the gas will be delivered via a
161-km long, 23-inch diameter transmission pipeline to the
Chittagong City Gate Terminal, from where gas will be distri-
buted to the Plant and other gas end-users in the Chittagong
area. From the terminal point, the gas will be piped to the
Plant by a 20-inch cum 16-inch diameter distribution system,
which would also supply gas to other major gas consumers.
These pipeline systems and the development of the Bakhrabad
gas field comprise the Gas Systems Project which Petrobangla
will develop as a separate project to bring gas from the
Bakhrabad gas field to the Chittagong area (see Appendix 10
for further details). The funding of the Gas System Project
will be provided by other cofinanciers coordinated by IDA.
The Gas System Project was approved by IDA in December 1980
and is expected to be completed by 30 June 1984.
50.       The Government has already dedicated 360 billion SCF
of gas from the Bakhrabad gas field to be made available to
the Plant over a period of 20 years. This quantity of gas



- 25 -
will be sufficient to meet the projected gas requirements of
the Plant. CUFL will enter into a long-term gas supply
contract with Bakhrabad Gas System, Ltd. (BGSL) on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The contract will
obligate BGSL to complete the related Gas System Project
well before the completion of the Plant.L/ The finalization
of this contract will be a condition of loan effectiveness.ZI
51.       Other major plant facilities required for the Plant
are steam, power and water. Production of ammnnia by a steam
reforming process will generate sufficient steam internally
from the recovery of waste heat. Steam requirements for the
urea unit and for other purposes such as plant start-up will
be supplied by gas-fired packaged boilers.
52.       The Plant will require about 14.7 megawatts (MW)
of electric power. Provision has been made in the proposed
Project for equipping the Plant with two 12 MW generators
to provide it with its own captive power. Additionally,
the Plant will also be connected to the national grid for
standby use. D
53.       The Plant and the housing colony will require about
1,050 cubic meters of water per hour. Extensive investiga-
tions carried out by the Technical Advisor in the vicinity
of the selected plant site indicate that the nearest reliable
source of water of acceptable quality would be at the con-
fluence of the Karnaphuli and the Helda rivers located near
the Kalurghat bridge about 25 km north of the selected site.
The results of an analysis of the water at the proposed intake
point are given in Appendix 12. A tentative pipeline route
has been selected, and the Government is in the process of
finalizing the acquisition of the right-of-way for laying the
pipeline.
54.       With the development of the plant facilities and
the related Gas System, the supply of raw materials and
utilities for the Plant will be assured. A full description
of these facilities is given in Appendix 10.

E. Work Force, Training and Technical MAnagement
55.       The Project will require the services of about
1,300 persons. About 240 persons would be managerial and
administrative staff, and the rest would be plant personnel
and other supporting staff. Plant personnel would comprise
technical, maintenance and operational personnel for ammonia
production, urea production, urea handling and dispatch,
plant maintenance and laboratory work. The tentative orga-
nizational chart of CUFL for the operational phase of the
Project is shown in Appendix 13. More than half of the plant
personnel would be technologists, technicians and skilled
workers such as engineers, chemists, fitters, mechanics,
welders and electricians. The rest would be semi-skilled and
unskilled laborers needed for tasks such as materials handling
and bagging. Some of the key personnel will be drawn from
within the BCIC enterprises, particularly the existing ferti-
lizer plants and the new urea plant now under construction at
Ashuganj. Others will have to be recruited from other sources
within Bangladesh. As such other staff would have little or
no prior industrial experience, they would have to be trained
for meeting the specific requirements of the Project.
56.       CUFL wouid recruit all the key technical staff
during the construction phase of the Project, and would pro-
vide such sz;aff with the necessary training prior to the
start-up o. the Plant. Training programs would be drawn up
by CUFL's General Contractor in close cooperation with the
Technical Advisor for the Project. The programs will mainly
be carried out in tne Ashuganj fertilizer training center but
will also include intensive training abroad for selected staff
in fertilizer plants similar to the proposed Plant. Arrange-
ments for this training would be made by the General Contractor
as part of his contractual responsibility. In addition, the
General Contractor, in consultation with the Technical Advisor,
would be required to organize on-the-job training for CUFL
staff during construction and initial operation of the Plant.
The training program would be submitted to the Bank for
approval before it is implemented.l/
I/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 7.



- 27 -
57.       It would also be necessary for CUFL to engage a
Management Advisory and Operational Services Team with
experience in the technical management of urea fertilizer
plants to assist CUFL in managing and operating tie Plant
for at least the first three years of operation.1J In the
evaluation of the requirements of the Management Advisory
and Operational Services Team, consideration has been
given to the expected improvement of skilled manpower in
Bangladesh by the time the Project organization has to be
staffed. It is envisaged that a small but strong group of
expatriate management and operational advisors would be
required to assist CUFL to achieve, as quickly as possible,
and maintain the production rate of the Plant at about 90
per cent of rated capacity.   An input of up to 288 man-
months by the team of expatriate experts would be required
for assisting CUFL in the efficient operation and maintenance
of the Plant and for providing on-the-job training for CUFL's
managerial and technical staff. Details of the tentative
expatriate team are given in Appendix 14. The peak require-
ment of expatriate management and operational advisors is
assessed to be a minimum of 12 persons for the first year.
The requirements of expatriate experts for the second and
third years are foreseen to be 8 and 4 persons, respectively.
The key experts would cover the start-up, the first major
overhaul and subsequent stable operation of the Plant.
58.       Before any scheduled reductions of the expatriate
management personnel take place, an evaluation of the Plant's
performance and the operating and maintenance skill of CUFL
personnel would have to be carried out by the Government.
Actual reductions in expatriate managemeqt personnel will be
subject to the concurrence of the Bank.>d An amount of $3.0
million in foreign exchange to cover the costs of the Manage-
ment Advisory and Operational Services Team has been included
in the Project cost estimates. In the event that additional
management and operational services are required by CUFL, the
additional cost will be financed by CUFL out of its own
resources.

F. Prolect Implementation
1. Technical Advisor
59.       In November 1976 th /Bank approved a technical
services loan of $2.5 million   to the Government of Bang-
ladesh for the purpose of financing the services of a
Technical Advisor to help establish the proposed Plant.
With the approval of the Bank and following the Bank's
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, BCIC appointed UNICO
as its Technical Advisor for the Project. The Technical
Advisor has since completed the feasibility report for
the Plant, and the Government intends to retain UNICO as
the Technical Advisor for the implementation of the Project
under a contract with CUFL. The subsequent work of UNICO
will be to assist CUFL in the preparation of process
specifications and bidding documents for the general con-
tract, prequalification of contractors and selection of the
General Contractor. Following this, UNICO will provide
management witii technical advisory services to CUFL during
the implementation phase of the Project.
60.       UNICO's work to-date has been satisfactory. Owing
to a scarcity of experienced and qualified personnel in
BangLadesh, strong participation from UNICO will be necessary
durivig the -ngineering and construction phases of the Project.
For successiul Project implementation, the team of technical
advisors, a;< proposed in IJNICO's existing contract with BCIC,
would neeQ to be strengthened, particularly those key tech-
nical personnel of the team including the Project Manager.
The expatriate man-months needed would have to be increased
from 238 to 274. The details of arrangements for improving
the Technical Advisory services as agreed to with the Govern-
ment are described in Appendix 15.
2. General Contractor and Urea Contractor
61.       CUFL will engage a General Contractor (GC)2J for
the services required to complete the Plant. Such services
will include:
1/ Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) approved on 23 November 1976.
2! Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 4.



- 29 -
(i) provision of process licenses, and basic
and detailed designs of the ammonia unit
and of all off-sites and ancillary
facilities;
(ii) management of procurement for all materials
and equipment for the ammonia unit and for
all off-sites and ancillary facilities;
(iii)  supervision of erection and construction
of the entire integrated Plant, including
the urea unit, and civil works;
(iv) testing, start-up and the commissioning
of the entire integrated Plant, including
the urea unit; and
(v) training of CUFL personnel.
62.       The GC will be paid on a fixed fee plus reim-
bursable cost basis for its services. Equipment and materials
will be procured by the GC on behalf of CUFL in accordance
with the procurement procedures of the respective financiers,
with CUFL directly arranging payment to the relevant suppliers.
Civil works, construction and erection works contracts for the
Project will be awarded by CUFL under separate contracts. The
OC will supervise such works and will have overall responsi-
bility for the construction and commissioning of the Project.
63.       To meet OECF requirements for its funds to be
utilized for financing the urea unit on a lump sum basis,
CUFL will engage a contractor who will be responsible for
providing the process licenses and basic and detailed engineer-
ing designs, for the supply of equipment and for providing
technical supervision for the erection of the urea unit under
the overall coordination and supervision of the GC.
64.       As the GC will be required to guarantee the overall
performance of the Plant, it is essential that he be given
an opportunity to associate with a urea contractor whom he
has confidence in. Therefore, CUFL will invite bids for the
general contract and the urea contract simultaneously. The
prospective GC will be required to submit a bid for the general
contract on a fixed fee plus reimbursable cost basis, and to



- 30 -
submit a bid for the urea unit on a lump sum basis at the
same time. The prospective GC may bid for the urea unit
himself or in association with another contractor. If the
prospective GC should bid in association with another
contractor it will be required that working arrangements,
sharing of responsibilities, adequate guarantees of per-
formance of the urea unit, and of standards of materials
and construction to be used in the urea unit are clearly
defined and agreed upon between the prospective GC and the
associated contractor. The general contract and the urea
contract will be awarded to the bidder who has been
evaluated to have submitted the lowest combined bid for
both items.
65.       This arrangement has been worked out after
thorough discussions with the Government, with all co-
financiers -- and OECF in particular -- and is acceptable
to all parties concerned. The notice for prequ lification
of GC was published by CUFL in June this year,i1 and res-
ponses were received from 13 applicants from Austria,
Belgium, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Federal Republic of Germany, UK and USA. Bid documents
for the GC are being prepared and are expected to be
completed by end of November 1981.
66.       Careful and close monitoring of the GC by the
Executing Agency would be required, particularly during the
design and procurement phase of the Project. To ensure that
the Executing Agency is not handicapped in the performance
of this task, a competent technical advisory team (organized
along the lines described in paragraph 60) would be needed
to assist CUFL in monitoring GC's work. The proposed
organizational set-up for the implementation phase of the
Project is shown in Appendix 16. To ensure that there would
be a strong and competent team to implement the Project, the
Government would fill all the key positions, particularly
those of the Managing Director, the Project Director and
Finance Director with suitably qualified and experienced
candidates satisfactory to the Bank,/  Provided that:  (i) the
above recommended type of contract is adopted to implement the
Project; (ii) the technical advisory team is strengthened
along the lines discussed in paragraph 60; and (iii) key
positions of CUFL's proposed construction organization are
1/ See Board Paper R62-81
2/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. l(c) and (d).



- 31 -
staffed with suitably qualified and experienced personnel,
then the arrangements for Project management during the
implementation phase of the Project can be considered to
be satisfactory.
3. Coordination Among Cofinanciers
67.       In accordance with the request of the Government,
during the appraisal of the Project it was agreed upon between
the Government and the cofinanciers that the Bank, without
liability to the other cofinanciers, would undertake the role
of coordinator among the cofinanciers. In particular, the
Bank will monitor and channel information regarding the
Project and its progress, as well as organize and arrange
review missions of cofinanciers on a regular basis. In the
course of these review missions, the status of compliance
wiLh the loan covenants, latest budgetary cost estimates,
status of implementation schedule, performance activities,
and projected disbursements of the Project will be reviewed.
The Bank will also arrange joint meetings among cofinanciers
as and when necessary for taking steps jointly to resolve
Pny problems which may arise during Project implementation
and for coordinating procurement activities.
68.       It was agreed that the cofinanciers would keep each
other informed of: (i) the status of the fulfillment of the
conditions of their respective agreements with the Government
of Bangladesh; (ii) amounts committed and disbursed; and
(iii) any event which may prevent making disbursements. Co-
financiers will consult with each other to the extent possible
before taking action to suspend, terminate or amend their
respective agreements with the Government.
69.       Prior to agreeing to any changes in the specifi-
cations, cost and nature of construction works, and work
schedules as compared with those originally envisaged and
agreed upon, cofinanciers will consult with each other with
a view to finding jointly acceptable course of action. These
matters have been incorporated in a Memorandum of Agreementi'
among cofinanciers regarding coordination in Project execution,
AJ The draft Memorandum of Agreement among cofinanciers has
been reviewed and found to be generally acceptable by all
cofinanciers. It will be concluded after approval of
this loan.

procurement and use of funds which has been drawn up for the
approval of the respective approving authorities. The Govern-
ment will cause the Project to be carried out in accordance
with these arrangements for coordination among cofinanciers.j/
4. Procurement
70.       The procurement of goods and services to be
financed under the Loan will be in,iccordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement,.6J Contracts for the
procurement of goods and services estimated to cost the
equivalent of $200,000 or more will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. Bidders for civil
works contracts, construction and erection contracts and for
the contract for the services of the General Contractor will
be prequalified before bidling in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.zU Contracts for the procurement of
goods and services estimated to cost less than the equivalent
of $200,000 will be awarded on the basis of international
shopping. The mode of procurement of goods and services to
be financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan from the
Bank is given in Appendix 17.
5. Consultants
71.       Consultant services required under the Project
are those c; the Technical Advisor and the Management Advisory
and Operaticnal Services Team. The services of the Technical
Advisor, who has already been engaged in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants under the techni-
cal services loan,4/ will be continued under a contract with
CUFL. The Management Advisory and Operational Services Team
will be engaged by CUFL in accordance with the Bank's Guide-
lines on the Use of Consultants.,!

6. Government Obligations
a.  National Coordinating Committee
72.       In March 1980 the Government established a National
Coordinating Committee composed of a Member of the Planning
Commission as Chairman and three Secretaries, those of the
Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources and Ministry of Finance (External Resources
Division), for the purpose of coordinating the implementation
of the Urea Plant Project and the Gas System Project. The
Plant is dependent upon the Gas System for the supply of
gas as feedstock and as fuel. The Gas System, in turn,
would depend upon the Plant as a major consumer of gas.
The establishment of the Plant would ensure the economic
viability of the Gas System especially during the initial
years of its economic life. This National Coordinating
Committee would continue to functiqn until both projects
have been successfully completed.T
b. Customs Duties and Clearances
73.       For prompt implementation of the Project, it is
essential that all goods and equipment arriving at the port
of Chittagong be cleared through customs as quickly as
possible. The Government would have to provide import
licenses without delay and make arrangements to enable all
imported equipment and materials to be delivered directly to
the site and all customs duties to be assessed an made
payable upon presentation of shipping documents.J2  Customs
duties on project goods and equipment (inc uding spare parts)
would be levied at the preferential rate-,j in compliance
with the Government's policy to promote new industry located
in relatively undeveloped areas and the use of local raw
materials as a major production input.
c. Local Materials
74.       The Government has agreed to give all necessary
assistance to the Executing Agency to arrange the timely
1/  Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 2.
1/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 12.
ZJ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 13(a).



- 34 -
transport of such local materials as may be required for the
construction of the Plant. In the event that the supply of
local materials is limited, the Government would give pre-
ference to the Plant for scarce materials and would give
every assistance to the Executing Agency to import nuk
materials, if necessary to make up for any shortages. ,
d. Review and ARproval of Contlact Awrd
75.       To ensure prompt implementation of the Project,
the Government would establish a time-saving review procedure
for contract approvals. The Executing Agency would be per-
mitted to approve contracts valued at up to Tk 40 million
equivalent, without reference to any other authority of the
Borrower. Under existing Government procedures, contracts
valued at Tk 40 million or more would have to be approved
by the relevant authority of the Government and the Govern-
ment has agreed to make appropriate arrangements to ensure
expeditious approvals of uch contracts as may be awarded
by CUFL for the Project.f_iu
e. Reports
76.       The Executing Agency, with the assistance of the
Technical Advisor, will prepare monthly progress reports on
the execution,operation and management of the Project and
submit these reports for review by the parties concerned
within 14 days of the end of the month to which such
reports relate. These reports will indicate, among other
things: (i) funds committed and the outstanding balance
of funds; (ii) progress made and problems encountered
during the month under review; (iii) steps taken or pro-
posed to be taken to remedy such problems; and (iv) a pro-
posed program of activities to complete the Project. In
addidon to these monthly reports, CUFL shall furnish to
the Bank within 45 days of the end of each year an Annual
Progress Report prepared by CUFL and certified by its
Managing Director. This annual report will review CUFL's
operations and activities during the year under review.
Particular emphasis will be placed in this annual report
on financial status and developments with respect to the
1/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 10.

Project, including construction of physical facilities,
estimated date of completion, a,nd the proposed program of
activities for the next year.1/
G. Capital Costs
77.       The total Project cost is estimated at $467,54
million, of which the foreign exchange cost is $289.98
million and the local currency cost is $177.56 million
equivalent. Details of the capital cost estimates are
shown in Appendix 18. A summary is shown in Table 7.
A balance of $2.0 million is available under the technical
services Bank loan (Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) of $2.5 million)
for financing the services of the Technical Advisor for the
implementation phase of the Project. After deduction of
this balance, the total foreign exchange financing required
for the Project would be $287.98 million.
78.       The cost estimates were prepared by the Technical
Advisor. Account has been taken of recent prices of
equipment and machinery from major supplying countries and
worldwide rates of inflation in the preparation of such
estimates. Physical contingencies provided are 7.7 per cent
and 12.1 per cent of the foreign exchange and local currency
base cost estimates respectively, and are based on the
detailed contingency schedule shown on page 5 of Appendix 18.
The base cost estimates of the Project shown in Appendix 18
and summarized in Table 7 are expressed in April 1981 values.
Price escalation provided is 20.9 per cent and 28.0 per cent
of the foreign exchange and local currency base cost esti-
mates and physical contingencies. Escalation rates for the
foreign exchange costs have been taken at 9.0 per cent for
1981, 8.5 per cent for 1982, and 7.5 per cent for 1983/85.
Escalation rates for the local currency costs have been
taken at 12 per cent for 1981 and 10 per cent for 1982
onwards. The above provision for price escalation is con-
sidered realistic as the base cost estimates already include
price escalation components due to scarcity factors. T4ese
estimates are based on a Project implementation period J
1/ Project Agreement, Section 2.08(b) and Section 2.08(c).
2/ See Appendix 19 for detailed project implementation
schedule.

of 53 months starting from the time of issuing of pre-
qualification documentation for the general contract to
the time of commercial operation of the plant.
79,       The initial working capital requirements to
provide adequate levels of inventories, receivables and cash
is estimated at $35.08 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of $5.28 million. The foreign exchange
component of the working capital requirements is included as
part of the total foreign exchange cost of the Project for
financing by the cofinanciers while the local currency com-
ponent will be financed by the Government from its own
.esources as part of its equity contribution to CUFL.
80.       The interest payment during construction of the
Project is estimated at $75.29 million equivalent. This
is based on the disbursement schedule shown in Appendix
20 and a 12 per cent interest rate to CUFL on all foreign
loans, which the Government will relend to CUFL for the
Project.
H.  Financing Plan
81.       The Government plans to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the Project from foreign sources. Against
the total foreign exchange financing requirements of $290
million, firm commitments for $293 million have been
received, as given in Table 8.

82.       The Government will make equity contributions
from its Annual Development Plan Budget to CUFL for
financing all local currency expenditures of the Project
including working capital and interest during construction.
The Government has assured the Bank that it would provide
equity fun4s to CUFL for financing the Project in time as
required.V Equity financing of the Project will be about
38 per cent of total Project cost, and debt financing will
b)e about 62 per cent of total Project cost. This capita-
lization ratio can be considered to be reasonable.
83.       The proposed loan from the Bank will be made to
the Government from the Bank's Special Funds resources.
The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan together with other
funds made available to the Government for the Project by
other cofinanciers,2/ will be relent by the Government to
CUFL under a Financing Agrqement upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank.I The proposed relending to CUFL
will be for a term of 15 years including a grace period of
five years at an interest rate of 12 per cent taking into consi-
deration the current Government regulation regarding relending
terms of foreign loans/grants to autonomous or semi-autonomous
organizations. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by
CUFL. The total loan amount for the Chittagong Urea Ferti-
lizer Technical Services Project Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) is
$2.5 million, but only $0.5 million of this is expected to
be utilized until the proposed Bank loan for the Project
becomes effective. Consistent with Section 2.09 of the Loan
Agreement for Loan No. 282-BAN(SF), it is proposed to incor-
porate and consolidate $2.0 million from Loan No. 282-BAN(SF)
into the proposed Project loan. The unwithdrawn portion of
the Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) will be cancelled when the proposed
loan becomes effective,4J and any outstanding payment still
to be made under Loan No. 282-BAN(SF) after loan effectiveness
will be made from the proposed loan.

I. Allocation of Foreign Funds
84.       During the joint appraisal of the ProJeect followed
by consultation among the Government and the various co-
financiers it became evident that the cofinanciers preferred
preallocation of Project components to be financed out of
their respective funds instead of consolidating the funds
into a pool and have them available for joint financing of
all the components of the Project. Therefore, preallocation
of Project components to the respective funds available for
the Project were worked out and agreed upon a=ong the co-
financiers and the Government, as summarized in Table 9
below. (See Appendix 21 for details).

85.       The only tied funds made available to the
Project are those from CIDA.'s grant contribution. It
should be noted that the Appraisal Mission, in full agree-
ment with CIDA, paid due consideration to Canada's general
competitiveness in the selection of Project components to
be financed out of CIDA's funds.
86.       The Bank loan is mainly proposed to be used
to finance expert services needed for the Project. The
Bank's preference for financing these services stems from
the request of the Government and the other cofinanciers
that the Bank act as Project coordinator for the Project.
In this connection, it is important that the Bank finance
the expert services portion of the Project which is of
critical importance to Project implementation. By
financing the expert services, the Bank would be in a
better position to closely monitor the progress of the
Project.
J. Environmental Protection
87.       Statutory regulations for industrial pollution
control in Bangladesh are in the process of being enacted.
Their standards are expected closely to follow those adopted
in developed countries. The Project would be designed in
accordance with the standards set by the local anti-pollution
authority, where applicable. Otherwise, the Plant will be
designed in accordance with standards in developed countries
with respect to solid, liquid and gaseous emissions.Y)
In any case, since natural gas from the Bakhrabad gas field
is virtually sulphur free, atmospheric pollution is expected
to be minimal. Solid emissions from the prilling of urea
will be minimized through the installation of cyclones.
Liquid effluent from the Plant will be treated in waste
water treatment units before being discharged into the
Karnaphuli river. Under these circumstances, the adverse
effect of the Project on the environment can be expected
to be negligible.

K. Project Risks
88.       Chemical fertilizer projects face operational
risks which are inherent in the chemical industry. The
Project also faces risks which may arise from delay in
project implementation and possible cost overrun. Such
risks are discussed below.
89.       Technical risks to the Project will be minimal
through the adoption of technology which has been developed
and commercially proven by internationally experienced
firms. However, sustained performance with regard to
capacity utilization at the projected level will depend
to a large degree on the availability of an adequate and
competent management and trained work force. The Project
will be protected from this risk by inclusion of provisions
for: (i) a training program for CUFL staff;./ and (ii)
employment of expatriate management and ope ational advisors
during the first three years of operation._/ Assurance
has been given by the Government that adequately qualified
and experienced executives will be appointed to the key
positions within CUFL.3/
90.       The Project is further subject to risks comn
to projects of such size and complexity, namely, delays
in project implementation and cost overrun. Measures to
minimize these risks have been taken, particularly in the
proposed contractual arrangement with the General Contractor.-
L. Energy Impact
91.       Natural gas will be consumed as raw material
for the production of ammonia/urea and also as fuel for
the generation of steam and power. Fertilizer plants
similar to the proposed Chittagong Urea Plant in developing
countries are normally provided with captive power plants.
This is done to ensure reliable power supply because a

3/  Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 1.
i/  Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 4.



- 43 -
brief interruption of power supply or brief voltage
fluctuation can cause total shutdown of the ammnonia
and urea plants. The recovery to full production of a
ammonia/urea plant after shutdown takes more than one
full day. Plant shutdown caused by an unexpected power
failure can also cause serious damage to the catalyst
and refractory lining in the high temperature section
of the plant.
92.       Based on the calorific value of about 1,022 BTU
per SCF for the natural gas from the Bakhrabad gas field,
the energy requirement for the production of urea is
estimated at about 31 million BTU per ton of urea. More
than half of this gas requirement will be consumed to
generate steam and power for the plant. Therefore, the
proposed Plant will incorporate the latest proven tech-
nology improvements for minimizing energy consumption
consistent with overall requirements for ensuring relia-
bility and economy of operations of the Plant.
93.       All the required electricity for the fertilizer
plant, water intake station and housing colony will be
generated in and distributed from the plant. Only small
amounts of fuel and diesel oil to be used for an emergency
standby generator and the feed water pump drive will be
procured from external supplier. As to the diesel engine
for the start-up generator, dual fuel system (oil for
start-up and gas for normal running) is envisaged. In
view that the feedstock as well as fuel requirement for
the plant is based on indigenous natural gas, no problem
is envisaged in meeting the energy requirement of the
Project.

IV. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Introduction
94.       BCIC has been acting as the Executing Agency
for the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Technical Services
Project for which the Bank approved a loan of $2.5 million
from Special Funds resources in November 1976. BCIC em-
ployed UNICO of Japan in January 1978 to undertake the
Technical Services Project. UNICO completed the prepara-
tion of a comprehensive project report for the proposed
Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Plant in February 1980. After
acceptance of that report by the Government and the Bank,
the Government decided to establish a new company under the
supervision of BCIC to implement and operate the proposed
Project. The new company, the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer
Limited (CUFL) was established in November 1980 in accord-
ance with the Government's decision.
B. Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
95.       BCIC is a statutory autonomous corporation
established in July 1976 under the Bangladesh Industrial
Enterprises (nationalization) Order of 1972. BCIC was
formed by the merger of Bangladesh Fertilizer, Chemical
and Pharmaceutical Corporation, Bangladesh Paper and Board
Corporation, and Bangladesh Tanneries Corporation. The
main functions of BCIC are to control, supervise and coor-
dinate the activities, busines es and affairs of 30 nation-
alized industrial enterprises-1including the existing
fertilizer plants at Fenchuganj, Ghorasal and Chittagong.
BCIC acts as a holding corporation and its income is
derived from management fees that it charges to its sub-
sidiary enterprises for the provision of supervisory
services.
96.       The general authority to direct and administer
the affairs and business of BCIC is vested in a Board of
Directors appointed by the Government which has overall
1/ See Appendix 22.



- 45 -
superintendence and control of the Board. The Board
consists of a Chairman, who is the Chief Executive of
BCIC, and five Directors. Each Board member, including
the Chairman, is an operating director for a group of
enterprises as well as a staff director for major corpo-
rate functions such as finance, planning, commerce,
engineering and production.
97.       As a Government supervising organ of the ferti-
lizer industry in Bangladesh, BCIC has been playing an
important role in the establishment of CUFL and, using
its experienced technical and managerial staff, BCIC will
continue to assist CUFL in the implementation as well as
the operation stage of the Project. Judging from the role
and experience of BCIC in respect of fertilizer and other
chemical related industries in Bangladesh, the Mission
considers that BCIC can support the newly incorporated
CUFL effectively.
C. Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL)
1.  Institutional Set-Up
98.       The Government has established a new company
called the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL),
which will act as the Executing Agency solely for implement-
ing and operating the Project. The Memorandum and Articles
of Association of CUFL were approved by the Government in
October 1980, and CUFL was incorporated in November 1980
as a limited liability company under the Companies Act of
1913. The authorized capital of CUFL is Tk 3,000 million
($187.5 million). The shares of CUFL will be subscribed
by the Government or by BCIC on behalf of the Government.
Payment will be made, when capital is required to pay local
currency expenditures on the Project. It was agreed that
there would be no change in the shareholding or in thq capital
structure of CUFL except in agreement with the Bank.17
2. Management and Staff
99.       The Board of Directors of CUFL shall be the
policy making body and shall be responsible for achieving
VJ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. l(b).



- 46 -
the objective for which CUFL was established. CUFL will
have at least five but not more than eight directors in-
cluding the Chairman of the Board of Directors. All the
Directors will be appointed by the Government. The Govern-
ment has informed the Bank that it has decided to make the
Board of Directors of CUFL a high powered one in order
to expedite decision making by CUFL as well as by the
Government in the course of Project implementation. The
Board will consist of the following members: (1) Secretary,
Ministry of Industries - Chairman, (2) Member (Industries) -
Planning Commission, (3) Secretary, ERD of Ministry of
Finance, (4) Secretary, Finance Division of Ministry of
Finance, (5) Chairman, BCIC, (6) Managing Director, CUFL,
(7) Project Director, CUFL, and (8) Finance Director, CUFL.
This arrangement is the same as those for AFCC with the
only difference that in case of CUFL, the Chairman of BCIC
will also be included in the Board. The Mission considers
the composition of the Board of Directors of CUFL to be
satisfactory as it provides necessary coordination and
assistance from BCIC and also it assures expeditious
decision making as proven in the case of AFCC.
100.      The proposed organization chart of CUFL is given
in Appendix 13. The Managing Director shall be the Chief
Executive of the company and shall be responsible for
conducting the day-to-day business of the company. The
appointments of the Managing Director, Project Director
and Finance Director of CUFL and any changes in these
positions will be made in consultation with the Bank.'
CUFL will have about 1,300 employees by the time it reaches
the stage of commercial operation.
101.      In order to strengthen the management and staff
of CUFL, particularly in the technical field:
(i)  CUFL will retain tie services of the
Technical Advisor2 to assist it;
(ii) Management Advisors will be appointed
to assist CUFL in the initial manage-
ment and organization of operations of
the Project; and
1/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. l(d).
2/ BCIC has already a Technical Advisor contract with
UNICO (see para. 59).



- 47 -
(iii)  CUFL's technical staff will undergo
a comprehensive technical training
program to be arranged and supervised
by the General Contractor.
102.      CUFL plans to draw technical and managerial
support from BCIC and other fertilizer companies in Bangla-
desh. In this regard, the Government assured the Bank
that CUFL would be adequately sta fed for the management
and organization of the Project.1y
3. Accounting and Audit
103.      The Memorandum and Articles of Association of
CUFL require its Directors each year to prepare an annual
budget together with financial projections for the follow-
ing year. Accounts of CUFL will be audited by independent
auditors to be appointed at the Annual General Meeting.
The general meeting of CUFL will decide on matters relating
to appropriation of profits. Dividends will be paid to
the shareholders only out of the net profits of the year
or any other undistributed profits upon the recommendation
by the Directors. The Mission has reviewed the Memorandum
and Articles of Association of CUFL and is satisfied that
CUFL will be able to perform its duties within the current
institutional framework in Bangladesh.
104.      It was agreed that CUFL would furnish to the
Bank within 45 days after the close of each qf the first
three quarters of each fiscal year of CUFL:2
(i) an unaudited quarterly financial
statement; and
(ii) a written statement by an authorized
financial officer of CUFL setting
out the status of compliance with the
financial covenants agreed upon bet-
ween CUFL and the Bank.
1/ Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. l(c).
2/ Project Agreement, Section 2.09(b).



- 48 -
It was also agreed that CUFL will furnish to the Bank
within s d months after the close of each fiscal year
of CUFL:_
(i)  audited financial statements; and
(ii)  a certificate by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank
setting out the status of com-
pliance with the financial
covenants agreed upon between
CUFL and the Bank.

Major assumptions for the financia projections are:
(i) an econowic life of the P'oject of 12 years;
(ii) a capacity -utiliat;iam rate of 30 peor cent
for the first twve rnth  (N          er 1985-
October 1 986), 75 paz cet for the )m.t
twelve months (ftviu*r 1986-0ctober 1987)
and 90 per cent from Nov er 1987 moards;
(iii)  a urea enport piofile of 39,700 at in 1986,
99,900 mt in 1987 ad 36,900 mt i& 1988;
(iv) an ex-factory ptic@ of urea of $280 per mt
fo'r the domestic zk-&t and $330 per at for
the export market, Tespectivelye
(v)  a price of natural gas at T  16.900 ($1.00)
per MSCF, taking inite consideration the
comnitments made by the Govenment to IBRD
regarding gas pricing in connection with
the negotiations for a loan for BGSL, and
also discussions with the Planning Commission
and other Goverrnent agencies cncerned; and
(vi) 1income taw exemption for the first five years.-
All prices and costs are expressed iUn mid1985 constant
values. Detailed assumptions are given iri Appendix 26.
106.     The following fiianncial ccvenauts weze agreed to
by CUFL in order to ensure sousynd financial operations of
the Project, namely; (i) a current ratio of not less than
1.5, (ii) a debt/equity ratio not 4higher than 60:40 and  2/
(iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not I1eas than 1.5.-
It would not be possible for tLhe Proiect - which has to
bear high depreciation and debF ase_ice bcrde  - to be
financially viable based on the present ezfactory price
of urea of $150 per mt fixed by tihe Go,vsrrzLn  wthich is

- 51 -
below the projected production cost of $169 per mt). 
It is estimated that an ex-factory price of $280 per ton
would be required to satisfy these financial covenants.
107.    Based on an ex-factory price of $280 per mt the
financial evaluation of the Project indicates that the
financial position of CUFL will be satisfactory and will
allow the Project to bear an interest rate on long-term
debt of 12 per cent and also to pay a 10 per cent dividend
on share capital from the fourth year of operation of the
Project. The Project may incur a net loss during its
initial stage of operation because of the assumed capacity
utilization of 50 per cent. This loss will not occur if
capacity utilization reaches 71 per cent. During the rest
of the life of the Project, CUFL will be able to maintain
a ratio of 15 per cent for average net profit (after tax)
to sales.
108.     In order to further ensure sound financial opera-
tions of the Project, the following financial covenants
were agreed upon in a dition to the financial covenants
stated in para. 106.2-
(i) CUFL will not, after the commercial opera-
tion date, incur or have any outstanding
long-term debt, if after such incurrence:
(a) the debt equity ratio exceeds 60:40;
(b) the debt service ratio becomes less
than 1.5 times;
(ii)  CUFL will not, prior to the commercial
operation date, make expenditures or
commitments for expenditures for capital
additions except expenditures required for
the Project;
(iii)  CUFL will not, for the three-year period
following the commercial operation date,
1/  Inclusive of depreciation charges ($66 per mt) but
exclusive of interest expenses.
2/ Project Agreement, Section 2.16(a), (b), (c), (e) and (f).



5- 5 -
make any expenditures or c  iitments except:
(a), expenditures required for operation
of the Plant;
(b)  investment in shortter  mamtetable
securities solely for the purpose of
temporarily employing funds at the
time not required to be held as cash;
and
(c)  other expenditures or commitments for
the expenditures, not exceeding (in the
aggregate) the equivalent of $3 million
in any fiscal year.
(iv)  CUFL will not pay any dividend or make any
other distribution with respect to its share
capital if, after giving effect to such
action, the current ratio would be less than 1.5.
(v)  CUFL will take necessary action from the
commercial operation date, in order to meet
out of its sales revenue in each fiscal year
its full operating, administrative and distri-
bution expenses including adequate provision
for maintenance, depreciation, taxes, surcharge
and other levies and interest on debt and to
earn a reasonable rate of return, after taxes,
on its equity.
2.  Production Costs and Break-Even Analysis
109.     The production cost structure of urea is capital
intensive; capital-related costs (i.e. depreciation and
interest expenses) will account for 55 per cent of the
total production cost of $232 per mt in 1988. The cost
of feedstock, i.e. natural gas, is estimated at $31 per mt
of urea or about 13 per cent of the total production cost.
110.     Based on an ex-factory price for urea of $280 per
mt for the domestic market and $330 per mt for the export
market, the profit break-even point of the Project is



- 53 -
estimated at 71 per cent of rated capacity for the first
year of operation, but will gradually decrease to 46 per
cent of rated capacity by 1996, as interest payment
decreases. The cash break-even point, which excludes
depreciation from fixed costs but includes principal
repayment cost, is estimated at 57 per cent of rated
capacity. A break-even analysis for the Project is
presented in Appendix 27.
3. Financial Internal Rate of Return and
Sensitivity AnalySis
111.     Based on an ex-factory price for urea of $280 per
mt for the domestic market and $330 per mt fqr the export
market, the financial rate of return (FIRR)l/of the
Project is estimated at 9.9 per cent (after tax) and 11.7
per cent (before tax), which is considered satisfactory.
112.     Table 11 shows the results of sensitivity tests
carried out under various assumptions and an examination
of key factors is given in Appendix 29.
113.     The FIRR was found to be most sensitive to the
change in the domestic market price of urea; a 10 per cent
decrease would bring down the FIRR before tax from 11.7
per cent to 9.2 per cent. However, the adverse effect of
the decrease is safeguarded in the sense that the Government
and CUFL will ensure that the price of urea will be reviewed
from time to time in qrder for the Project to comply with
financial covenants.2 /
114.     The FIRR was also found to be very sensitive to a
reduction in capacity utilization and, when it occurs in
combination with delay in construction and cost overrun, the
combined effect on FIRR is very significant. In such even-
tuality, FIRR before tax would be as low as 6.2 per cent
and the ex-factory urea price would have to be increased
from $280 per mt to $330 per mt to ensure compliance with
the financial covenants.

115.      The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate
that sound management of the Project during both the imple-
mentation ana operation period is vital for ensuring the
financial viability of the Project. In this regard, CUFL
will be strengthened and assisted by advisers and receive
management assistance for the implementation, initial manage-
ment and operation of the Project.l/

To determine the economic price of urea, international
market prices were analyzed. In projecting the inter-
national market price of urea, it is assumed that a
slight excess of supply over demand would continue in
the international market through the early 1980s, and
therefore that the international market price of urea
would be mainly determined by the selling price of natural
gas-based urea fertilizer plants which account for about
?5 ner cent of total production capacity of urea in the
world. According to an IBRD forecast,1/the price of urea
will be around $367 per mt (fob) in 1985, which is estimated
on the basis that the average long-term price of urea
would be at a level which would ensure a reasonable return
on a new investment. In order to be conservative, an fob
price of urea of $330 per mt in 1985 has been assumed.
Allowing a freight cost of $25 per mt and local handling
charges of $5 per mt, an economic price of urea at $360
per mt (cif price) for domestically consumed urea and $330
per mt (fob price) for exported urea has been assumed.
117.     For the valuation of the economic cost of natural
gas, the shadow price of natural gas was estimated; this
comprises the economic value of natural gas under the
ground, development cost of the Bakhrabad gas field and
transmission cost to consumption areas. The economic value
of natural gas under the ground is defined as the cost of
replacing the natural gas by the next best alternative
source (crude oil is assumed) when the natural gas is
exhausted. Based on these assumptions, the economic price
of natural gas in Bangladesh is valued at $1.44 per MSCF in
1985 (see Appendix 30 for details).
2. Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity
Analysis
118.     Financial costs excluding transfer expenses such
as taxes and duties are used for economic evaluation. The
exchange rate of Tk 16.00 per US dollar is used for currency
conversion and no shadow wage rate is adopted. Details of
the assumptions used in the economic analysis of the Project
are given in Appendix 30. Assuming the economic price of
I/  'Trice Prospects for Major Primary Commodities" by
IBRD, January 1980.



- 56 -
urea for the domestic market and the export market to be
$360 per mt and $330 per mt, rT,pectively, the economic
internal rate of return (EIRR)- on the Project is estimated
at 19.0 per cent.
119.     Table 12 shows the results of sensitivity tests
carried out under the same assumptions which are used for
the financial analysis.

120.     The EIRR was found to be most sensitive to
delay in construction, and also very sensitive to
decrease in urea price. However, EIRRs of these cases
are 16.4 per cent and 17.1 per cent, respectively which
indicate the viability of the Project. The sensitivity
tests indicate a marginal EIRR of 11.4 per cent in the
case of a reduction in capacity utilization; when this
occurs in combination with delay in construction and cost
overrun, the combined adverse effect on EIRR is as signi-
ficant as in the financial analysis (see para. 113).
3. Other Benefits
121.     The proposed Project would help bangladesh
achieve self-sufficiency in urea supply and earn foreign
exchange through the export of surplus urea. Average
annual gross foreign exchange savings and earnings which
would be generated by the Project are estimated at $170.8
million, assuming cif and fob prices of urea at $360 and
$330 per mt. After deducting foreign exchange components
of capital charges and operating costs, the net foreign
exchange savings which will be gener7ted by the Project is
estimated at $113.6 million a year.1
122.     The Project will directly employ about 1,300
persons, more than half of whom would be skilled workers
who will receive extensive technical training. In addition,
the Project is also expected to create substantial indirect
employment opportunities for rural workers in such areas
as fertilizer transportation, storage and distribution.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
123.      Bangladesh has sizeable reserves of natural
gas suitable for the economic production of nitrogenous
fertilizer. The Project will not only help Bangladesh
achieve self-sufficiency in urea fertilizer, and support
the Government's policy to become self-sufficient in
food and increase agricultural output and exports, but
will also help the country earn foreign exchange through
the export of surplus urea fertilizer. The Plant would
help Bangladesh achieve net foreign exchange savings
and earnings estimated at about $114 million per year.
124.      The total cost of the Project is estimated
at $467.5 million equivalent, of which about $290 million
would be in foreign exchange. The Government intends to
finance the foreign exchange cost of the Project from
loans, leases and grants from external aid agencies.
The local currency cost of the Project would be financed
by the Government from its own resources.
125.      The Project is considered to be suitable for
a loan of $72 million!.! from the Special Funds resources
of the Bank. The Government will be the Borrower of the
Bank loan and will relend the proceeds of the Bank loan
to CUFL, the Project Executing Agency, for a term of 15
years including a grace period of 5 years at an annual
interest rate of 12 per cent. Satisfactory arrangements
have been made with the Government and CUFL for ensuring
efficient implementation of the Project.
126.      In addition to the standard provisions and
requirements embodied in the Bank's loan documents
specific assurances have been received from the Govern-
ment and CUFL in respect of the following:
(i) All local currency costs for the
Project will be provided by the
Government to CUFL by way of equity

tractor and the terms and conditions
of contract will be in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement and will be subject to
the prior approval of the Bank.
(See Loan Agreement, Schedule 4,
para. 4 and Schedule 6, para. 4).
(vii)  For ensuring expeditious implementation
of the Project, the Government will
establish a time-saving review pro-
cedure for approving contracts that
may be awarded by CUFL for the Project.
(See Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para.
11).
(viii)  The Government will introduce
adequate measures to ensure that
import licenses and customs clearances
for Project goods are provided without
delay. A preferential rate of customs
duty will also be levied on equipment
and goods (including spare parts)
imported for the Project. (See Loan
Agreement, Schedule 6, paras. 12 and
13).
(ix)  The Government will ensure that the
gas pipeline system from the Bakhrabad
gas field to the Project site is con-
structed on a timely basis, and that
sufficient gas is made available to the
Project on time. CUFL will negotiate
and conclude a contract with BGSL for
this purpose on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. (See Loan
Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 8 and
Section 6.01(c).
(x) In addition to the captive power to be
provided under the Project, the Plant
will also be connected to the Government's



- 61 -
national grid for appropriate
standby use. Such connection will
be provided on a timely basis.
(See Loan Agreement, Schedule 6,
para. 9).
(xi) The Government will ensure the
provision of adequate transportation
facilities for the movement of
Project materials including the
urea output of the Plant. (See
Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, paras. 10
and 16).
(xii) The Government will, prior to comple-
tion of the Project, prepare and
implement a program for improving
and expanding the existing internal
network of facilities for storage
of fertilizer and distribution to
farmers. The Bank shall be kept
informed of steps taken in this
connection (Loan Agreement, Schedule
6, para. 17).
(xiii) The Government will construct a 5 km
road to link the project site with
the main Patiya-Anwaro road (now under
construction) out of its own resources
and will ensure that these roads will
be completed by June 1985.
(xiv) The Government will before the end of
1982 prepare a program of action towards
achieving a more balanced nutrient ratio
in fertilizer application. The Govern-
ment will afford the Bank an opportunity
to comment on such program prior to its
implementation. (Loan Agreement, Schedule
6, para. 21).
(xv) The Government will, in consultation with
CUFL, from time to time review the ex-



- 62 -
factory price of urea for CUFL
and make adjustments thereto as
may be necessary to enable CUFL
to comply with the financial cove-
nants as stated under (xvii) below.
(See Loan Agreement, Schedule 6,
para. 18(a).
(xvi)  The Government will keep under
constant review its pricing policy
in regard to fertilizer as well as
in regard to farm produce, with a
view towards gradually reducing
levels of subsidy and phasing out
subsidization while at the same time
providing incentives to farmers to
maintain adequate production. The
Bank will be kept informed of steps
taken in this connection, and will
be afforded an opportunity to comment
on any changes in the Governments'
pricing and subsidy policies in
respect of fertilizer. (See Loan
Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 18(b).
(xvii)  CUFL will comply with the following
financial covenants; a debt/equity
ratio of 60:40, a debt service ratio

Glossary of Technical Terms
1         Ammonia (Anhydrous (NH3)).  A gas containing
approximately 82 per cent nitrogen. Under pressure,
ammonia gas is changed to a liquid and is usually stored
and transported in this form. Anhydrous ammonia is used
to make most of the solid forms of nitrogenous fertilizers
and also used for direct application to soil either as a
gas or in the form of aqua ammonia.
2.        Ammonium Carbamate (NH C02NH ).  An intermediate
chemical formed from carbon dioxide an3 amnonia in solution
during the synthesis of urea. On reduction in pressure it
decomposes into urea with the formation of by-product water.
Ammonnium carbamate is a highly corrosive material and
requires the use of special materials and equipment to
handle it.
3.        Ammonium Sulfate (NH4)2 SO4.  Ammonium sulfate
is chiefly the ammonium salt of sulfuric acid. It contains
not less than 20.5 per cent of nitrogen.
4.        Biuret.  An impurity, NH(CONH )2, found in commer-
cial urea brought about by the partial 3ecomposition of urea
to biuret ard ammonia. For certain applications, particu-
larly when the urea is ultimately sprayed on citrus trees,
the biuret content should be kept as low as possible, in
the range 0.1 to 0.3 wt. per cent.
5.        Bulk Fertilizer.  Commercial fertilizer delivered
to the purchaser, either in the solid or liquid state, in
a non-packaged form.
6.        Calorific Value.  A measure of the quantity of
heat given out in the combustion of a fuel. Usually expressed
as BTIJ/standard cubic foot in the case of a pipeline gas,
where -he standard cubic foot of gas is measured at 14.7 lb./
sq. in. absolute pressure and 60°F temperature and in the dry
state.  A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 lb. of water through 1 fahrenheit degree at 600F.
Reference in text: para. 1 (footnote 2), page 1.

7.        Fertilizer.  Any natural or manufactured material
added to the soil in order to supply one or more plant
nutrients.
8.        Granular Urea.  Several granulation processes
have been developed for the production of granular urea,
which is produced in the form of spherical particles. In
one of the processes, granular urea is prepared by spraying
a hot concentrated solution of urea into a cascading bed of
recycled fines in a pan granulator.
9.        Nitrogen (N2).  A colorless, inert gas that makes
up about four-fifths of the atmosphere. Nitrogen for commer-
cial purposes can be "fixed" synthetically from the air by
several processes.
10.       Nutrient (Plant).  Any element taken in by a
plant to facilitate its growth.
11.       Ordinary Superphosphate.  A product that contains
16 to 20 per cent available phosphoric acid and is produced
by treating phosphate with sulfuric acid.
12.       Phosphate Rock.  Phosphate-bearing ore composed
largely of tricalcium phosphate. Phosphate rock can be
treated with strong acids or heat to make water soluble
forms of phosphate. Finely ground rock phosphate is some-
times used in long-term fertility programs.
13.       Phosphoric Acid (H P04).  An inorganic acid used
in the manufacture of concen&rated calcium phosphates,
ammonium phosphates and sometimes for direct application
as fertilizer through irrigation water. Although in fer-
tilizer terminology the term has been used practically
from the inception of the fertilizer industry to denote the
water soluble phosphate (P205) equivalent of a fertilizer,
this usage is not strictly correct and has become particularly



- 68 _
Appendix I
Page 3
confusing in recent years since phosphoric acid (H3P04) is
being used as such in the manufacture of fertilizer.
14.       Potash.  A term used to denote the potassium
oxide (K20) equivalent of materials containing potassium.
Actually, K20 as such is never found in fertilizer, but
historically the potassium in fertilizer has been thus
expressed.
15.       PPM (parts per million).  The concentration of
a substance expressed as the number of units of that
substance per total million units.
16.       Prills.  Spherical particles prepared by spraying
molten material downward through a countercurrent steam of
cooling air; this operation is performed in a prilling
tower. The particles obtained have excellent storage and
handling properties in that they are hard and have less
surface area than crystals.
17.       Primary Elements or Fertilizer Nutrients.  The
primary plant food elements are nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium. They are called primary, or major elements
because of the relatively large quantities needed for healthy
plant growt&;, and are the most common constituents of commer-
cial fertilizer. While the plant food elements as such are
phosphorus and potassium, in fertilizer terminology quantities
are expressed in terms of their oxide equivalents -- water
soluble phosphate, P205 and potash, K20.  Ratio    the nume-
rical ratio among the concentrations of the primary plant
foods in a fertilizer. For example, a 5-10-15 grade would
have a 1:2:3 ratio.
18.       Superphosphate.  Made by reacting sulfuric acid
and phosphate rock. The principal source of available phos-
phate (P205) in fertilizer. There are two principal kinds --
normal superphosphate and concentrated superphosphate (also
called triple or treble).
19.       Sulphuric Acid.  (H2S04; Oil of Vitriol).  This
strong acid is made from various sulphur materials.



- 69 -
Appendix 1
Page 4
Sulphuric acid is a common acid, and is used in the manu-
facture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate and super-
phosphate.
20.       Triple Superphosphate.  Made by reacting phosphoric
acid and phosphate rock. A product that contains 40 to 50
per cent available phosphoric acid. Triple superphosphate
differs from ordinary superphosphate in that it contains very
little calcium sulfate. In the fertilizer trade, the product
is also called the treble superphosphate, double superphosphate,
and multiple superphosphate.
21.       Urea (CO(NH2)2).  A white crystalline material
produced synthetically from ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide
(C02) under high pressure. Comercial urea contains 45 to
46 per cent nitrogen. Urea is completely water-soluble but
chemically classed as a synthetic organic nitrogen.

Existing and Future Fertilizer Plants
in Bangladesh
A. Existing and Future Fertilizer Plants
1.        At present there are four chemical fertilizer
plants in operation in Bangladesh. These are a urea and
ammonium sulphate plant at Fenchuganj, a urea plant at
Ghorasal and two triple superphosphate (TSP) plants at
Chittagong. A urea plant is now under construction at
Ashuganj and another is planned to be constructed at
Ghorasal in addition to the proposed Plant at Chittagong.
B.  The Fenchugani Ammonium Sulphate/Urea Plant
20        The urea plant at Fenchuganj was established in
1961 and commercial production began in 1962. The basic
process design was prepared by Chemical Construction Corpo-
ration of USA and the plant was constructed on a turn-key
basis by Kobe-Steel of Japan. The plant has a rated output
of 106,000 TPY of urea based on natural gas from the Haripur
gas field in Sylhet for feedstock and fuel.  The ammonia
plant is based on conventional reciprocating compressor
technology. Its rated capacity is 66,000 TPY and the
ammonia is produced in two trains. The urea plant employs
a partial recycling process and the urea is produced in
three trains.
3.        The plant operated satisfactorily from 1962 to
1970 with an annual output averaging 87 per cent of the
rated capacity. It was shutdown during the civil war in
1971 and although it was reported to have suffered no
damage during that period, the plant upon restarting in
1972 failed to achieve its previous production levels.
Its production level in 1972/73 was only 37 per cent of
the rated capacity. The first overhaul of the plant was
carried out only in 1974 thirteen years after commissioning.
After the overhaul, production in 1974/75 improved to about
55 per cent of rated capacity. From 1975/76 to 1978/79,
production averaged about 58 per cent of rated capacity.
4.        A major rehabilitation of the plant covering
repairs and replacement of major items of equipment in both
Reference in text: para. 15, page 7 .

A2pendix 3
Page 2
the urea and ammonia units at a total cost of Tk 251 million
($16.7 million equivalent) was undertaken in 1978/79 with
Japanese commodity aid. After the rehabilitation and up to
July 1981, the plant operated at about 90 per cent of
rated capacity.
5.        The plant is now 19 years old.  Despite the
considerable repairs and replacement of equipment carried
out during the major rehabilitation in 1978/79, it can
be expected that increasingly costly maintenance would be
required to maintain production of the plant at high
throughputs. Some major works for the future could include
replacement of the original primary reformer tubes, catalysts
and water and process piping. Most of the old machines are
fast approaching the end of their economic life and their
deterioration has reached the stage where they could soon
seriously limit production efficiencies and throughputs.
Some of the potential production bottlenecks which have been
identified would be alleviated by another rehabilitation
program planned for 1980/81 at a foreign exchange cost of
$3.04 million to be financed by a $29 million loan from
the International Development Association to Bangladesh
for the rehiabilitation of existing fertilizer plants.1/
Considering these factors and known deterioration rates
of similar plants elsewhere, production from the Fenchuganj
plant cou. decline to uneconomic production levels towards
the end oC- the decade. (See projected production for the
Fenchuganj plant in Table 3, at page 12).
6.        The ammonium sulphate plant was erected in
1969, and commercial production began in 1970. The plant
equipment was supplied by Lurgi-Mitsubishi and includes a
sulphuric acid plant. Ammonia is supplied by the ammonia/
urea complex at Fenchuganj. The plant has an annual rated
capacity of 12,000 TPY of aumxnium sulphate.  The ammonium
sulphate is produced mainly for consumption in the tea
estates in the districts of Sylhet and Chittagong.
7.        Production averaged about 55 per cent of rated
capacity for the period 1970/71 to 1978/79, with the highest
production of 84 per cent rated capacity recorded in 1973/74.
1/ The IDA loan also include provisions for training of staff
and for purchase of essentialspares, catalysts and chemicals
for the existing operating plants.

Production in 1980/81 reached 9,900 mt or 83 per cent
of rated capacity. The basic plant design is satisfactory.
Given normal maintenance on the plant, it should be capable
of maintaining production at about 75 per cent of rated
capacity for the rest of the decade.
8.        The plant is operated as part of the Fenchuganj
integrated fertilizer complex which employs a total of
1,490 people and is under the control of a General Manager
who directly supervises the entire works organization which
consists of seven departments, namely; Production, Main-
tenance, Civil Engineering; Electrical/Instruments/Power,
Accounts,  Administration and Commercial.
C. The Ghorasal Urea Plant
9.        The urea fertilizer plant at Ghorasal was
constructed in 1969/70 by Toyo Engineering Corporation of
Japan under a turn-key contract. The plant has a rated
capacity of 200,000 TPY of ammonia and 340,000 TPY of urea
based on natural gas from the Titas field as feedstock
and fuel. Commercial operations started in September 1970.
The plant is based on total energy recovery centrifugal
compressor type ammonia technology and is made up of a
single train ammonia unit based on Power Gas'es Methane/
Steam reforming process and Toyo's own ammonia synthesis
loop design. Carbon dioxide removal from the reformed
gas stream is by the Giammarco Vetrocoke system but addi-
tional carbon dioxide (as needed for urea synthesis) is
recovered from flue gases using monoethanolamine solution.
The urea unit is based on Toyo's own total recycle process
and is basically a single train unit although two urea
reactors, two carbamate pumping streams and two crystallizer
units are installed.
10.       The plant employs about 1,290 people.  Another
50 contract workers are employed for materials handling.
The plant is under the control of a General Manager who
directly supervises the entire works organization which
consists of five departments, namely: Operations, Engi-
neering, Accounts, Administration and Comuercial.

11.       The plant has a chequered history of operation.
Shortly after it began commercial operation in September
1970, civil war broke out and the plant was shutdown for
the duration of the war. After the war, the plant was
reconditioned and started production again in 1972 but was
again shutdown in 1974/75 for one year because of an
explosion which damaged the control room. The control
room was rebuilt with funds provided by the United Nations
under its Relief and Emergency Operation Program in
Bangladesh.
12.       Production from 1970/71 to 1973/74 averaged
less than 50 per cent of rated capacity, although in the
period immediately before the latest shutdown the plant
was producing urea at about 78 per cent of rated capacity.
Production from 1975/76 to 1978/79 averaged just over 60
per cent of rated capacity.   Production for
190/8Olws 245,500 mt or 74 per cent of rated capacity.
The plant should be able to run at this higher throughput
as it just had an overhaul in the early part of FY 1979/80.
13.       As part of a wider rehabilitation plan to increase
fertilizer production from its existing plants, BCIC in
1977/79, commissioned a study of all the fertilizer plants
in Bangladesh including the Ghorasal plant under the Ferti-
lizer Works Operation Improvement Program. The study was
financed by a technical assistance credit from IDA; Bresler
and Associates was appointed as the consultant for the study.
According to the findings of the consultant, the reasons for
low rate of capacity utilization for the Ghorasal plant are
as follows:
(i) Equipment Bottlenecks - The main areas
of bottlenecks are the water cooling
system, the steam system in the ammonia
plant, the air compression system and
lack of spare parts;
(ii)  Maintenance Shortcomings - Poor mainte-
nance of machinery, equipment and instru-
ments led to unplanned shutdowns which
resulted in substantial loss of production;



- 75 -
Appendix 3
Page 5
(iii) High Turnover of Experienced Staff -
High turnover of experienced staff
led to operational problems. The
staff loss is normally in the most
skillful and experienced category.
14.       The equipment bottlenecks of the Ghorasal Plant
were further examined by Toyo Engineering Corporation of
Japan, the original turn-key contractor for the plant.
Resulting directly from this and the Bresler and Associates
study, a major rehabilitation of the plant covering major
repairs and replacement of equipment is scheduled for 1982.
The cost ($11.65 million) will be financed by IDA out of
its $29 million credit allocated for rehabilitation of the
existing fertilizer plants in Bangladesh.
15.       With regard to overcoming problems of maintenance
and shortage of skilled manpower, BCIC has engaged a team of
experts from UNICO International Corporation of Japan to
examine these problems. UNICO's team of experts are to give
advice and guidance in the operation and maintenance of the
Ghorasal plant and to establish a managerial and technical
training program for the personnel of Ghorasal.  The cost
of UNICO's consulting services would be financed by UNDP as
part of its technical assistance of $1.7 million to Bangladesh
for improvements in the operation and management of the
existing fertilizer plants in the country.
16.       Following the rehabilitation planned for 1982
and the expected improvements in the operation and main-
tenance of the plant resulting from UNICO's input, it is
anticipated that the Ghorasal plant should be capable of
running at 74 per cent of the rated capacity at least
during the first five years after the rehabilitation given
further normal maintenance input. Moderate production
decline beyond the fifth year could be expected given the
age of the plant by that time.
C. The Chittagong Triple Superphosphate Units
17.       The triple superphosphate (TSP) complex at
Chittagong is located about 2 miles south of Chittagong
City on the same side as Chittagong Port. The complex



- 76 -
App§ndix 3
Page 6
consists of two TSP units known as TSP-I and TSP-II.
18.       TSP-I comprises a 100 TPD 98 per cent sulphuric
acid unit, a 32 TPD P205 phosphoric acid unit and a 106
TPD TSP unit. The plant was designed based on either
Moroccan or Florida rock material of low chloride, flouride
and silicate content. The process design was prepared by
a company known as Pan American and the plant was constructed
in 1968 by a joint-venture French-US company known as
Technique Chemie with Technical Enterprises supplying all
of the equipment.
19.       TSP-II consists of a 400 TPD 98 per cent sulphuric
acid unit, a 133 TPD P205 phosphoric acid unit and a 430
TPD TSP unit. The phosphoric acid plant design was also
based on a phosphate rock raw material of low chloride,
flouride and silicate content. This plant was completed in
November 1970 by Hitachi of Japan on a turn-key basis financed
by Japanese supplier's credit.
20.       TSP-I suffered severe corrosion when the plant was
started in 1969 using Jordanian phosphate rock which has a
high chloride content. The corroded equipment was replaced
oy the end of- 1973 but the plant remained shutdown until
April 1977 b_cause of a subsequent legal dispute between
the equipmer-: supplier and BCIC on contractual liability.
TSP-I was slightly damaged during the civil war in 1971 but
was repaired and reconditioned by 1973 and started up shortly
after the receipt of a consignment or Moroccan rock. Pro-
duction from 1974/75 to 1980/81 from both plants averaged
only 36 per cent of rated capacity, with the highest pro-
duction of 47 per cent recorded for 1980/81.
2L.       The problem of low utilization of plant capacities
was studied by Bresler and Associates in 1977/78 as part of
an overall study financed by IDA out of its technical
assistance credit to Bangladesh under BCIC's Fertilizer
wiorks Operation Improvement Program. The study identified
n.e reasons for low production as poor maintenance of the
plants, lack of spare parts, unreliable sources of power
and water supply, dust pollution problems, shortage of raw
materials and lack of training of personnel. As a result



- 77 -
A22sndig 3
Page 7
of the study, BCIC fielded a team of experts from UNICO
financed by UNDP as part of its technical assistance of
$1.7 million to Bangladesh for improvement in the operation
and management of all fertilizer plants in the country.
Another study was prepared by Cremer and Warner Ltd. of UK
for the Ministry of Overseas Development of UK in early
1978 on the feasibility of granular TSP production at the
Chittagong complex. Arising out of these studies, a major
rehabilitation of the TSP complex covering the replacement
and repair of equipment and machinery and the installation
of granular production facilities is now scheduled for
1980/81. The cost of equipment replacement and repairs
($5.08 million) will be financed by IDA out of its $29
million credit allocated to Bangladesh for rehabilitation
of the existing fertilizer plants in Bangladesh. The
granulation production facilities will be financed out of
$5.15 million contributed by the Government of the Nether-
lands for the improvement of the TSP-complex. The rehabi-
litation, together with the implementation of a training
program to be prepared by UNIDO, would enable the plant to
operate at least at 60 per cent of rated capacity. Higher
throughputs may be possible if the problems of power and
water supplies are overcome. On raw materials, it was re-
ported that arrangements have been made for rock supplies
to be shipped from Morocco and Jordan on a regular basis.
D. The Urea Plant at Ashuaani
22.       The construction of the urea plant at Ashuganj
is already considerably behind schedule. The plant design
includes an ammonia unit of 925 TPD and a urea unit of
1,600 TPD. Based on 330 operating days per year, the rated
capacity of the plant is 528,000 TPY. The raw material for
the plant is natural gas from the Titas field. Shortly
after the start of the project implementation in early
1974, the need for compaction of the site became a major
issue which took about 12 months to resolve. In addition
to the site problem, the Executing Agency has been con-
fronted by other technical problems as well as poor commu-
nications facilities at the site, lack of a suitable
arrangement by the General Contractor in expediting
delivery of equipment and low productivity of expatriate
and local staff.

23.       The project is, as of October 1981, about virtually
completed; mechanical completion was finalized in July 1981.
Commissioning and start-up preparations started immediately
thereafter. CommeErcial operation of the plant is set for
November 1981.
E. The Polash Urea Plant at Ghorasal
24.       The Government is planning to establish another
urea plant at Ghorasal with aid from the People's Republic
of China (PRC). The plant will be designed and constructed
by the PRC with all process equipment coming from that
country. The plant, which will have a designed capacity
of 100,000 TPY of urea,lJ will be established on the site
next to the existing urea plant at Ghorasal. A construction
company will be set up for implementation of the project,
and after its completion the plant will come under the direct
control of the organization which manages the existing
Ghorasal urea plant.   Given that the plant would be designed
with excess capacity and considering that the reliability of
the external source of power supply for the plant has yet
to be proven, a 95 per cent utilization rate at stable
operation has been assumed for projection of urea production
from this p.ant, which is tentatively scheduled to come on
stream in 1984/85.
F.  Propgseu Frivately Financed Urea Plant at ChIJ&ago
25.       The Government of Bangladesh has examined and
accepted in principle the proposal offered by private European
investors and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of
the World Bank group, to set up a platform-based ready-to-
operate ammonia/urea plant at Chittagong or Ashuganj. The
size of the plant would be similar to the proposed Bank-
financed Project. The total cost is estimated at $450 million.
26.       The Government also stated that the capital structure
of the new company to be set up would be 70:30 debt/equity
ratio. Accordingly the equity of the new company should be
1/ It appears that the design philcsophy of the Chinese is
different from that of the West in the respect that the
plant will be over-designed in capacity so that it can be
operated continuously at the level of the designed capacity.



- 79 -
Appnrix2 3
Page 9
in the order of $130 million out of which the Government,
through BCIC, would take up 30 per cent. A similar equity
participation in the new company is expected to be
subscribed by the private investment group. The remaining
equity may come from OPEC countries and IFC. The foreign
loans required is expected to be met partly by supplier's
credit and the remainder would be arranged by IFC through
an IFC loan syndicate.
27.       It was stressed by the Government that the proposed
private financed plant is 100 per cent for export. The
Government firmly assured that the new plant would not be in
conflict with the objectives, scope, viability and implemen-
tation of the Bank-supported project.
28.       The Mission was informed by the Government that a
detailed feasibility study will be undertaken by the foreign
sponsors. It may well take until the latter half of 1981
before a final decision is taken on whether or not to proceed
with the project.

World Nitrogen Fertilizer Situation and I/
Export Possibility of Urea from Bangladesh-
i.        Total consumption of world nitrogen fertilizer
nutrient which comprises mainly urea, a mmnium nitrate
and ammonium sulphate, increased from 16.4 million to
47.7 million tons at an average annual rate of 8.6 per
cent during the period 1964/65 - 1977/78. It is expected
to increase at around 6 per cent a year during the period
1979/80 - 1989/90. Table 1 shows the projected supply,
demand and balances of world nitrogen fertilizer during
1977/78 - 1984/85, which forecasts that worldwide surplus
of nitrogen fertilizer nutrient will increase from
0.1 million tons in 1977/78 to 4.3 million tons in 1981/82;
afterwards, the surplus will decrease and a balanced situa-
tion is expected to be reached in the mid-1980s.

2.         About 8.8 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer
were traded in the world market in 1976/77. Table 2 shows
the contribution by regions to the world trade of nitrogen
during the period from 1973/74 to 1976/77. According to
Table 2, Asia (Far East, Nea; East and Asian centrally
planned economic countries)UJ is one of the biggest importing
regions. Therefore, taking into account the geographical
position of Bangladesh, it would be advantageous for Bangla-
desh to give first priority in terms of probable markets
for its surplus urea production to deficit countries in
Asia, such as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal,
which are forecast to be importers of nitrogen fertilizers
in the 1980s.

from Chittagon& Urea Plant for the Domestic Market
ASSUMPTIONS
1.        Urea required in the Chittagong, Chittagong
Hill Tract and Noakhali districts -- which are assumed to
account for 12 per cent of total urea consumption in
Bangladesh -- will be provided only by the Chittagong
plant by trucks.
2.        Urea required in the Khulna Division (in the
Southwest) and the Rajshahi Division (in the Northwest)
will be transported by barges. The movement of urea
fertilizer from Khulna to the Northwest will be by rail-
road and water transport.
3.        Monthly movements during the peak consumption
month is estimated to be 15 per cent of the annual con-
sumption in the districts served by trucks and to be 12
per cent for the districts served by water transport.
4.        All urea exports from Bangladesh would be by
ocean-going ships.
5.        The capacity of a truck is assumed to be 5 tons,
and average turn-around time is one day. A truck works
24 days per month.
6.        The capacity of a barge from Chittagong to
Khulna port is assumed to be 700 tons. An average turn-
around time is assumed to be 14 days and a monthly turn-
around is two times. Table 1 of this Appendix lists the
number of trucks and barges required for delivery of urea
from the Plant for the domestic market.

Plant Size and Production Processes
A. Plant Sixe
1.        A plant size of 1,700 TPD of urea has been
selected with intermdiate a_wnia facilities being sized
for total conversion of amnaia to urea. This is the
maxiim  size limit to which appreciable benefits of scale
can be achieved from single train units. To go beyond this
size would almost certainly involve adoption of double
train urea units which will offset most of the advantages
of scale. The capacity of the ammonia unit sized for total
conversion of aonia to urea is 1,000 TPD of ania.  Such
amnia and urea units are standard size capacities which
have been well proven to be capable of achieving high relia-
bility and efficiency in continuous operation.
2.        There would not be any real benefit in going
beyond the proposed size limit in order to satisfy future
market requirments.  If Bangladesh is to becom  self-
sufficient in food production and achieve maximu product-
ion of cash crops, it will require at least one
more such plant within the next ten years. The aim, there-
fore, at this stage is to select a standard size plant which
can conveniently and economically be duplicated in the fu-
ture. It is therefore considered that a 1,700 TPD urea
plant size, based on total conversion of amonia, represents
the optimim choice for Bangladesh from the aspects of economy,
reliability and future planning.
B. Production Processes
3.        The production of urea from natural gas using the
latest urea and amonia technology consists essentially of
three major steps: steam reforming of natural gas, aoonia
synthesis and urea synthesis. Typical amonia and urea
production processes are shown on pages 5 and 6 of this
Reference in text: para. 40, page 20.



Appendix 9
Page 2
Appendix.. A brief description of these processes is
given as follows:
(a) Steam Reforming of Natural Gas
4.        Natural gas from the Bakihabad gas field is
first desulphurized to ensure that the sulphur in the gas
is below a level that would not adversely affect the cata-
l.ysts used In subsequent processes. Next, the desulphu-
rized gas is combined with superheated steam in an amount
approximately equal to a 3 to 1 steam/carbon ratio and
subjected to a pressure of 30 to 35 kg/cmB  and a tempe-
rature of 810-8500C in the presence of a nickel catalyst
in the primary reformer. Here the gas, mostly methane,
is partly converted to carbon oxides and hydrogen.  Some
hydrocarbons remained unconverted. The partially reformed
gas from the primary reformer is then mixed with a con-
trolled amount of air in such a way that the oxidation
of the unconverted hydrocarbons will produce the required
amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen for mmnia synthesis.
This partial oxidation is carried out in the presence of
a nickel-based catalyst in a secondary reformer.  The me-
thane cont-ent of the gas, after the secondary reforming
stage, will be reduced to about 0.2 per cent.  The next
stage of the reforming process is the conversion of the
carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide by means of a high tem-
perature and a low temperature shift conversion process
which involves reaction of carbon monoxide with steam. The
carbon monoxide content of the gas after the completion of
the shift reaction will be reduced to about 0.3 per cent.
5.        The gas now contains essentially hydrogen, nit-
rogen, trace amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and
carbon monoxide.  Since carbon dioxide is harmful to the
aonia synthesis, it has to be removed.  This is done by
absorption by a number of liquid processes. Subsequent
regeneration of the rich liquid absorbent releases the
carbon dioxide for use in the production of urea in the
urea plant. Any remaining carbon dioxide have to be removed
down to a 10 ppa level by reaction with hydrogen over a ca-
talyst to form methane.. The purified gas,



- 90 -
Appendix 9
Page 3
called synthesis gas, now contains hydrogen and nitrogen
in the desired volumetric ratio of 3:1 for the product-
ion of amonia.
(b) A onia Synthesis
6.        In the azmonia synthesis process, the nitrogen
hydrogen mixture is compressed by a centrlfugal com-
pressor to a pressure of 150 to 300 kg/cm and passed
over an iron-based catalyst for conversion into a mmonia.
Unconverted synthesis gas is separated from the converted
ammonia by cooling the exit gas to 0°C by a cryogenic
separation system. Unconverted synthesis gas is recycled
to the ammonia converter. Other gases, such as
methane and argon, which are also brought into the system
have to be removed to prevent any build up of such gases
in the synthesis loop. Any accumulated methane and argon
are removed by purging. The purged gases are then ref-
rigerated at minus 10 C, sent through a knock out drum to
remove any condensed aonia and then routed to the re-
forming or boiler area for use as a fuel. Liquid ammonia
from the cryogenic system is collected and flashed to
remove any impurity.  The purified liquid aonia produced
in the process is stored in a low temperature tank or fed
directly to the urea unit.
(c) Urea Synthesis
7.        In the production of urea, amonia and carbon
dioxide in appropriate quantities ire fed into a reactor
and at a pressure of 150-250 kg/cm and a temperature of
180-2200C, they are converted to amonium carbamate.  This
intermediate product is subsequently dehydrated to form
urea. The reaction of carbon dioxide and aumnia to annium
carbamate and the dehydration of aonium carbamate to urea
will not proceed to full completion in single steps. As a
result, the product, urea, contains non-converted carbamate
and the original reaction gases, both of which have to be
separated from urea for recycling back to the reactor.
Various processes are comercially available for doing this.
Depending on the degree of the recycling of the unconverted



- 91 -
Appendix 9
Page 4
ammonia and carbon dioxide, the processes offered can be
broadly classified into three types:  (a) once through;
(b) partial recycle; and (c) total recycle. in the first
two processes, unconverted ammonia is used for the pro-
duction of other fertilizers, such as amonium sulphate
and nitrate. In the total recycle process, all uncon-
verted ammonia and carbon dioxide are recycled back to
the reactor and thus a more efficient conversion of
ammonia and carbon dioxide to urea can take place.  The
Project will employ a total recycle process, but the
selection of a specific process will be made based on
the merits of the bid proposals to be submitted by the
General Contractor.
8.        To ensure that any surplus product can be sold
in the world market, the Project will produce urea with
a maximum moisture content of 0.4 per cent and a maximu
biuret content of 0.8 per cent.
9.        With regard to the type of finished urea pro-
duct for the Plant, an evaluation carried out by the
Technical Advisor and the Government indicated that
prilled urea rather than granular urea would be the pre-
ferred product as this would minimize investment and
operating costs. The production of granular urea at a
production rate of 1,700 TPD would require the setting up
of several granular units at an additional capital cost
of about $14 million. Also the production costs will be
higher by about $2.5 per mt   of urea.  However, there
will be some possible savings in handling and shipping
costs through a 6 pet cent reduction in bulk in the case
of granular urea but these would not be significant enough
to justify the higher investment and production costs of
producing granular urea in Bangladesh. Also, it has yet
to be proven that granular urea is agronomically more
effective than prilled urea. In view of these considera-
tions, the production of prilled urea for the Plant is
favoured.

Raw Material and Plant Facilities
A. Raw Material
1.        Raw material for the Plant will be gas from the
Bakhrabad gas field. The gas will be used both as a
feedstock and as fuel for the Plant.  The gas will be   1/
delivered to the plant at a pressure of around 220 psig.-
Further boosting of the gas pressure to the required level
for direct steam forming will be carried out at the Plant.
The gas contains approximately 94 per cent methane with
very negligible aunts of sulphur.  It is, therefore,
very suitable for urea production. A gas analysis of
the Bakhrabad field is given on page 8 of this Appendix.
2.        The Bakhrabad gas field consists of four culmi-
nations named A-1, A-2, B-1 and B-2. In 1968/69, the
then Bangladesh Shell Oil Company Limited drilled and
tested one well, named BK-l, in the B-1 culmination. This
well tested the gas in two zones; several additional zones,
although not tested, apparently also contained gas,
according to electrical log interpretation. Based on data
collected at the B3-1 well and other geological and seismic
information on the BAkbrabad field, DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(DAM) of USA, the gas consultant for the Gas System Project
(see para. 3), estimated the prqven gas reserves in the B-1
culmination at 1.1 trillion (1012) SCP. Total additional
gas reserves in the B-1 and B-2 culminations classified as
possible reserves by DAM are estimated at 2.0 trillion SCF.
Other gas volumes can be determined only by drilling add-
itiRnal wells. The Plant would require about 360 billion
(10 ) SCF of gas from the Bakhrabad field over a period of
20 years. Based on the gas demand schedule (prepared by
Petrobangla and agreed to by both IDA and ADB in May 1979)
1/ Pounds per square inch gauge.
Reference in text: para. 47, page 24.
para. 54,. page 25.



95-
Appendix 10
Page 2
for all potential gas consumers (including the Plant) in
and around the Chittagong area, the total estimated gas
offtakes from the Bakhrabad field up to the year AD 2000
is 1.0 trillion SCF. Thus, the current total proven and
possible gas reserves at the Bakhrabad field are suffi-
cient to support the estimated gas offtakes. The gas
demand projections for the Bakhrabad gas field are shown
in Appendix 11.
3.        The feasibility of development of the gas fields
at Bakhrabad, the transmission of gas to Chittagong and
the distribution of gas to the urea Plant and other major
gas consumers of the Bakhrabad gas field was studied under the
ADB   Technical Services Loan (Loan No. 282: BAN(SF) of
$2.5 million) to Bangladesh as a related Gas System Project.
The feasibility study recommended (i) the development of a
cluster of 5 wells at the B-1 culmination and subsequently
another 3 wells at the B-2 culmination to support the gas
demand projections up to the year AD 2000; (ii) the cons-
truction of a 161 km. long, 24 in. diameter transmission
line to deliver gas from Bakhrabad to a terminal point at
Chittagong (the Chittagong City Gate Terminal) for subse-
quent distribution to gas consumers; and (iii) a pipeline
distribution system consisting of a 20 in. cum. 16 in.
diameter line for supply of gas to the Eastern Refinery,
the Steel Mill, the Urea Plant and the WAPDA Power Station
together with a 10 in. diameter spur line from this main
distribution line for supply of gas to the Karnaphuli
Paper Mill.
4.        These recommendations for the Gas System have
been accepted by Petrobangla for development as a separate
Project. The funding of this Gas System Project would be
provided by other lenders co-ordinated by IDA of the World
Bank group. The appraisal of th;,s Project was completed
by IDA in January/February 1980 ;2this Project is scheduled
for completion by 1983.
I/ The Bakhrabad Gas Development Project was approved on
24 December 1980 by IDA.

B. Plant Facilities
1. Land
5/.       The estimated area of land required for the
construction of the Plant and all its ancillary facilities,
including that of the housing colony, is 294 acres. The
Government is in the process of acquiring all of the re-
quired land area at the selected site at Chittagpng. It is
estimated that 100 acres will be occupied by the Plant and
81 acres by the jetty, bagging facilities and the access
road from the jetty to the plant site. Another 65 acres
will be allocated for the construction of the housing
colony and the rest for the right-of-way of the water pipe-
line.
2. Site Preparation
6.        To protect the site against floods and high
tides, the areas to be occupied by the Plant, the access
road, bagging facilities and the jetty would have to be
filled to a final elevation of 20 feet above mean sea
level. The height of fill would include an allowance for
soil settlement over a period of time. The site would be
further protected by an embankment to be raised to a height
of 24 feet above mean sea level. Sufficient suitable
material for filling the site is available either from an
adjacent tertiary hill or from a river bed deposit located
at a distance of 1,500 meters southwest of the site. In
order to start the dredging work in the dry 1981/82 season
certain ster, have been taken to recruit a suitable dredging
contractor. The Government is considering adoption of
dredged filling of the site, as its own studies have indi-
cated this method to be a more suitable method for site
preparation.
7.        The site is situated in a minor earthquake zone
in Bangladesh and liquefaction potential of the soil can
1/ See Board Paper R62-81.



97 -
Appendix 10
Page 4
be considered minimal. To avoid any liquefaction problems,
the foundations of the Plant will be designed to safeguard
against the maximum level of earthquake intensity likely
to be experienced at the site. The heavy structures of the
Plant would have to be supported on piled foundations
whereas the light structures would have to be supported by
spread footing foundations. Preparation of these found-
ations would begin after the completion of the site fill
and after the elapse of a reasonable period of time for
settlement of the site fill.
3. Facilities for Urea Distribution
8.        A jetty designed for loading the output of the
Plant on to coasters and barges for domestic distribution
and to ocean tankers for export will be constructed at
the plant site upstream of the Chittagong port lash
moorings.  The jetty will be designed to accommodate two
coasters simultaneously or one ocean-going ship. The
capacity of the coasters is about 1,000 dwt drawing a
draft of 12 feet when fully loaded. The maximum size of
the ocean-going ship for which the jetty will be designed
would be 8,500 dwt. It will have a draft of 25 feet when
fully loaded. The minimum water depth at the jetty is 26
feet and the average height of tide in the Chittagong area
is 14) feet. The restriction for movement of shipping
between the anchorage area near the mouth of the Karnaphuli
river and the plant jetty is a shallow area with a minimum
water depth of 15 feet just outside the mouth of the
Karnaphuli river. The coasters can have access to the jetty
at all times. The ocean going ship when fully loaded can only
leave the jetty at high tide. During cyclonic weather, no
jetty operations will be allowed. Based on past data of
cyclonic weather prevailing at Chittagong, it is assessed
that the annual disruption of jetty operations due to
cyclonic weather will reduce jetty availability time by
about 12 per cent. The plant is designed with sufficient
urea storage and adequate loading facilities at the Jetty
to overcome such disruption of shipment of urea from the
Plant during periods of prolonged adverse weather.



- 98 -
Appendix 10
Page 5
9.        It is anticipated that up to 19 per cent of the
output of the Plant will be exported during the first 3
years of operation. The remaining
output will be for domestic consumption. Sowe 58 per cent
of this will be delivered by coasters and barges to the
western districts such as Noakhali, Barisal and Patuakhali
for consumption in the main agricultural areas there and
to the ports of Khulna and Chaln for distribution else-
where. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation will
acquire the required number of coasters and barges for this
purpose. The remaining 42 per cent will be consumed in the
agricultural areas in and around the Chittagong district.
Urea will have to be distributed by road to these areas.
For the distribution of urea to these areas, a 5-km. road
will be constructed by the Government with its own resources
to link the plant site to the Patiya-Anwaro road, now under
construction. With the completion of the linkroad and jetty
facilities, there will be two available modes of transport-
ation for the distribution of urea output from the proposed
plant and this is considered adequate.
4. Water SupPly
10.       The estimated total water requirement for the
Plant and the housing colony is 1,050 cubic meters per
hour. The water will be taken at the confluence of the
Karnaphuli and the Helda rivers near the Kalurghat bridge
located about 25 km. north of the plant site. Extensive
investigations carried out by the Technical Advisor in
the vicinity of the site and elsewhere indicated this as
the nearest reliable source of raw water supply of low
salinity for the Plant. Analysis of water quality at
this point is shown in Appendix 12. The Government is in
the process of acquiring the right-of-way for laying a
pipeline to deliver water to the site, where the raw water
will be treated to potable quality standards for drinking
and for other uses. The water treatment facilities will
consist of clarifiers, sand filters, chlorinators, desine-
ralizers, etc. These are standard water treatment facilities.
A suitable equipment package will be selected after bid pro-
posals have been evaluated.



- 99 -
Appendix 10
Page 6
5. Captive Power
11.       The entire works will require about 14.7 mega-
watts (MW) of electric power. The nearest source of
power supply from the Power Development Board is about
10 km. away. The Government is considering the power
supply to the Plant fromthis source. In case no suitable
arrangements can be made to secure reliable power supply
from this source, the Plant must then be installed with
its own captive power plant. Provision has been made
tentatively for equipping the Plant with two 12 MW gene-
rators to provide its own captive power.
6. Steam
12.       Steam requirements for the entire Plant include
high pressure, medium pressure and low pressure steam.
Sufficient high and low pressure steam for the ammonia
unit will be generated internally from the production of
ammonia by the steam reforming process from the recovery
of waste heat. Steam requirements for the urea unit and
for other purposes such as plant start-up will be supplied
by gas-fired packaged boilers.
7. Other Facilities
13.       Other supporting facilities for the Plant will
include a fully equipped maintenance workshop, fire
station, laboratory, first aid station and adequate ware-
houses for the storage of spare parts and other equipment.
14.       Urea from the plant will be conveyed via a 2 km.
long conveyor belt system having a capacity of 200 tons/hr.
from the urea bulk store at the plant site to the urea
bagging facilities at the jetty. The urea bulk store is
designed to have a total capacity of 85,000 tons, equivalent
to 50 days production. This storage capacity is sufficient
to service the Plant at full production during the monsoon



- 100 -
Appendix 10
Page 7
seasons when shipping could be affected by adverse
weather. The urea bagged store will be designed to have
a capacity of 17,000 tons, equivalent to 10 days pro-
duction.
15.       In addition to all of these facilities, the
Plant will have a polyethylene bag manufacturing plant
for the production of polyethylene liners for the jute
bags to be used for bagging the urea output.

Services of the Technical Advisor
1.        In November 1976 ADB approved a  Technical
Services Loan (Loan No. 282-BAN(SF)) of $2.5 million to
Bangladesh to finance the cost of advisory and consultant
services for the establishment of the urea Plant and the
development of the related Gas System Project. Following
ADB's Guidelines on the Uses of Consultants and with
the approval of ADB, Bangladesh Chemical Industries
Corporation (BCIC), the Executing Agency, appointed UNICO
International Corporation of Japan as its consultant for
performing the technical services. Under the terms of the
contract agreement between UNICO and BCIC, the technical
services are to be carried out in the following three
phases:
Phase I:  Preparation of a comprehensive report,
in two distinct parts, one for the
urea Plant and the other for the Gas
System covering the feasibility and
implementation aspects of the
establishment of the Plant and the
development of the Gas System.
Phase II: Preparation of documents covering
design criteria and equipment
specifications in sufficient detail
for soliciting proposals from
engineering firm for the construction
of the Plant and the Gas System.
Phase III: Evaluation of proposals for the
general engineering contract, selection
of the general contractor and provision
of management and technical assistance
for the implementation of the Plant
only.
Reference in text: para. 60, page 28.

Appendix 15
Page 2
UNIhO's Phase I work had since been completed. ADD
had preappraised the Plant in February 1980 and was requested
by the Government to coordinate the financing of tis Plant.
IDA, which appraised the Gas System Project in January/
February 1980, would coordinate the financing of the Gas
Svstem Project. IDA would also provide funds from its
teclnical assistance credit to Bangladesh for financing
the technical services work of the Gas System from Phase II
onwards. With this arrangement, UNICO's subsequent work will
only be confined to Phass II and III for the Plant only.
A balance of $2 sillion from the technical services loan
is available for financing the work of tho Technical
Advisor on Phases II and III of the Plant.
2.        UNICO's work to-date has been satisfactory.  To
ensure success in the implementation phase of the Project,
strong participation from UNICO as the Technical Advisor
to CUFL would be needed especially when there is a shortage
of experienced and qualified local personnel to staff the
construction organizatiom of CUFL. An evaluation of the
proposed Technical Advisor's team for Phase III work
indicated that it would be necessary for the team to be
strengthened by:
(i) increasing its expatriate man-months
input for Phase III from 238 to 274; and
(ii)  making some changes to UNICO's proposed
manning schedule in relation to (i) above.
3.        UNICO's proposed expatriate advisory team for
Phase III work is shown on page 5 of this Appendix. The
proposed team's set-up shows only very limited involvement
of the Project Manager (PM) during the design and procure-
ment phase of the Project. Whilst it may be argued that
some of the duties of the PM would have already been
covered by other key personnel as proposed in the Technical
Advisor team such as the Senior Advisor, the Assistant
Project Manager and the Project Engineer in the GC's office,



- 108 _
Appendix 15
Page 3
it is considered that for proper implementation of the
Project, the PM should be in the GC's office from the time
of the award of the GC's contract to the completion of
procurement of the majority of equipment and materials in
order that the work of the Technical Advisor's tam and
that of CUFL can be coordinated and that of the GC can be
realistically monitored. The design and procurement
period will last about 18 months and the services of the PM
in the GC's office during this period is most crucial in
order to ensure that there are no design deficiencies and
that only equipment and machinery which fully meet the
design specifications are procured for the Project. It
would be necessary, therefore, for the an-months of the
PM outside Bangladesh to be increased by 171. The PM should
have the services of the Assistant Project Manager (APM),
and the Project Engineer for the entire duration of the
PM's tim in the GC's office. This would require APM's
and PE's inputs to be increased by 6 and 5 mn-manths,
respectively. Also a cost control engineer (none proposed
in the Technical Advisor team) should be included in the
advisory team in the GC's office for the entire 18 months
duration to enable proper monitoring of the cost control
of the Project. Other supplementary specialist services
from the Technical Advisor as proposed by UNICO for
shorter periods as and when required appear satisfactory.
Thus, an additional input of 46h man-months by the Technical
Advisor appears necessary in order to realistically monitor
the work of the GC during the design and procurement phase
of the Project.
4.        During the construction phase of the Project,
the Technical Advisor proposes to have a site Manager for
28 months,starting with his arrival on site four months
before the site is ready for construction. This is
satisfactory except that if the construction schedule were
to follow that envisaged for the Project and as shown in
Appendix 18, the Site Manager would be leaving the site
2 months before the completion of plant erection. In
all probability, the Site Manager's services would be
needed until after the completion of all plant testing.



- 109 -
Appendix 15
Page 4
To ensure that the Site Manager is available until that
time, an additional input of 4 man-months by the Site
Manager would be necessary. Other specialist inputs as
proposed by the Technical Advisor as, and when, required
during the construction and erection phase of the Project
appear to be satisfactory.
5.        During the pre-commissioning and start-up phase
of the Project, it is envisaged that the PM would again
have to be closely involved in the Project. This period
would last about 9 months from the start of the pre-
commissioning period to the beginning of commercial
operation of the plant.   About 9 man-months out of the
11.5 man-months of the PM's time in Bangladesh should be
allocated for this work. No other changes are considered
necessary.
6.        UNICO's home office input of 108 man-months
appears excessive after the proposed increase of the
Technical Advisor's input in the GC's office and at the
site. The home office input by UNICO, especially the
input of the specialist engineers, could be reduced by
about 15 man-months without affecting the overall
performance of the Technical Advisor.
7.        The proposed total increase of the Technical
Advisor's manpower input as envisaged above is 50½ man-
months. If this is followed by a reduction of 15 man-
months in UNICO's home office input, the net increase is
an additional 354 (say 36) man-months of the Technical
Advisor's input. There is provision in the project cost
estimates to absorb this cost of additional input. The
need for an increase in the Technical Advisor's input

1. Natural Gas
9.  The present selling price of natural gas for the ferti-
lizer industry is Tk 7.75 ($0.48)/MSCF. However, in
connection with the negotiations for loan for BGSL with
IBRD, the Government made the following commitments
regarding gas pricing:
(i)  the national average gas price to consumers shall
be increased by at least 20 per cent over the
existing price by June 1981 and it shall continue
to be increased in order to keep up with inflation
and other factors.
(ii) the gas prices, net of excise duty, are to be set
at such levels as would provide a rate of return
on the revalued assets of BGSL prior to depreciation
of at least 5 per cent in 1985 and 10 per cent in
each year thereafter.

-t 10 per cent of escalation factor has been asumed.
Taking into consideration the above projected gas prices and
also discussions with the Planning Commission and other con-
cerned government agencies, the Mission has estimated the
price of natural gas for the Plant to be Tk 16.00 ($1.00)/MSCF
in mid-1985 constant values. Natural gas consumption of
30,590 standard cubic feet, which includes gas consumption
for the in-house power station, will be required for the
production of one ton of urea.
2. Catalyst and Chemicals
10.  The annual consumption of catalyst and chemicals is
estimated to cost $1.63 million (cif). Local handling
and internal freight cost (3 per cent on cif value)
and import duty (50 per cent on cif value) were taken
into account in the calculation of overall annual cost.
3. Bags
11.  Polyethylene pellets cost about $4,160 per ton (cif);
eight bags (50 kg bag) can be made from one kg of
polyethylene pellets. Import duty (100 per cent of



- 129 -
Appendix 26
Page 5
cif value) and internal freight and local handling
costs (3 per cent of cif value) are taken into account
in arriving at the estimate of polyethylene lining
cost of Tk 16.88 per bag. Jute bag with a capacity
of 50 kg costs Tk 15.15 per bag.
4. Labor Cost
12.  a.  officers and Staff:  511 workers with Tk 1,850
monthly salary;
b. Technicians and skilled workers: 490 workers
with Tk 970 monthly salary;
c. Contract workers: 310 workers with Tk 775 monthly
salary;
d. Fringe Benefits: 72 per cent of (a) and 59 per
cent of (b).
13.  Production bonus is assumed at one month's salary
equivalent at 80 per cent capacity utilization rate
and two months salary equivalent at 90 per cent.
5. Maintenance Materials
14.  Process, auxiliary materials handling and
miscellaneous equipment (fob)               $   140.78 million
a. Maintenance materials: 5 per cent
of equipment cost                      $ 7,039,000
b. Shipping and marine insurance:
10 per cent of (a)                     $   703,900
c.  Import duty:  25 per cent of (a+b)   $ 1,935,725
d. Internal freight and local hand-
ling cost: 3 per cent of (a+b)         $   232,287

19. Lease has been treated as loan in the financial analysis,
taking into consideration the present accounting
practise regarding lease transaction with IsDB in
Bangladesh.
F.   Income Tax
20. Provision for income tax has been assumed to be 55 per
cent of taxable income, according to the Finance Act,
1980.
21. Notifications dated 26 and 30 September 1975 in pur-
suance of Section 14A of the Income Tax Act stipulates
that a new industrial undertaking will be exempted
from income tax and for a period of 5/7/9 years accord-
ing to its location beginning with the month in which
commercial production of the undertaking started.
Since the Project is located in an area which the above
exemption can be applied for, tax exemption for the
first five years is assumed.

a/  The ratio of the ammonia unit capital costs to the
capital costs of both the aimonia and the urea units
is 68 per cent.  Hence 68 per cent of the annual
fixed production cost is allocated to the a monia
production.  The variable cost per ton of ammonia
is calculated as follows:
The viable cost per ton of ammonia - (variable cost
per ton of urea - bagging cost) x 1,700 - 1,000

2.        The urea price for the domestic market used
in the base case is not a projected market price but is
the minimum price which has to be maintained to ensure
that stipulated financial covenants (see para. 105) can
be complied with by CUFL. As change of selling price of
urea is a major factor in the sensitivity analysis, the
effect of a 10 per cent decrease in selling price has been
tested in order to indicate the sensitivity of this factor.
For the urea price for the export market, the effect of a
10 per cent decrease has been tested, taking into consi-
deration the future demand-supply condition of the inter-
national market.
3.        Although the demand for urea in Bangladesh is
projected to keep growing, the Project would have to
export surplus urea during the early part of the Project
Life (see para. 25). The effect of a 10 per cent decrease
in the export price of urea has been tested.
4.        The pricing of natural gas is the controversial
issue in Bangladesh and there is always the tendency to
increase the gas price. Therefore, the effect of a 50
per cent increase in the gas price has been tested.
5.        Other production costs are expected to increase
but not at a greater rate than the general rate of in-
flation in the country.
6.        Capacity utilization depends heavily upon the
availability of experienced skilled manpower and adequate
infrastructure. Although the Project can be expected to
recruit capable personnel from the existing fertilizer
industry, a low level of initial capacity utilization rate
was assumed in the base case, taking into oDnsideration
the present manpower situation in Bangladesh. However,
it should not be ruled out that the Project might suffer
from a slow capacity build-up and low level of capacity
utilization rate. In this regard, the effect of 40, 50,
65 and 80 per cent of capacity utilization has been
tested.

7.        There are always possibilities of cost
overrun and delay in construction caused byunforeseeable
incidents. Effects of (i) a 10 per cent increase in
capital costs and (ii) a one year delay in construction,
with a reduction in capacity utilization have been
tested.

Basis for Economic Analysis
A. General Approach
1.        The economic evaluation is based on mid-1985
constant US dollar values. Price escalation on the
assumption of future inflation has been excluded.
Present and future changes in relative prices have been
taken into account. Transfer payments and time costs
such as import duties, taxes and interests during con-
struction have been excluded from financial capital
and operation costs. A 12-year economic life of the
Project is assumed, as was done in the financial analy-
sis. The market wage rates are taken as the economic
wage rates, since the costs of labor constitute only a
very small proportion of total production costs. The
economic benefits of the Project are derived from import
substitution and the export of urea fertilizer using the
economic price of urea (bagged) at $360 per ton for
import substitution and $330 per ton for export,
respectively. In converting taka values into US dollar
values, an exchange rate of Tk 16.00 per US$1.00 is used.
B. Cost of Natural Gas
2.        The economic cost of natural gas in Bangladesh
is valued at $1.44 per MSCF in 1985, comprising the oppor-
tunity cost of natural gas under the ground of $1.18 per
MSCF and the development and transmission costs of natural
gas of $0.26 per MSCF.
1. The Opportunity Cost of Natural Gas
Under the Ground
3.        The opportunity cost of natural gas under the
ground is defined as the cost of replacing the natural gas
by the best alternative source (crude oil is assumed),
when the natural gas is exhausted. Assumptions used for the
calculation of the replacement cost of natural gas are as
follows:
Reference in text:  para. 117   page 55.
para. 118, page 55.

Appendix 30
Page 2
(i)  reserve adequacy of 30 years; and
(ii)  the price of crude oil is $30 per
barrel (Arabian Light) at present,
and will increase at three per cent
per annum in real terms; and
(iii) discount rate of 10 per cent per
annum in Bangladesh.
2. The Development and Transmission
Costs of Natural Gas
4.        The estimated development and transmission cost
of natural gas is $0.26 per MSCF (unit investment cost;
$0.232 per MSCF, unit operating cost; $0.026 per MSCF,
based on the estimated investment and operating costs
for the Gas System).
