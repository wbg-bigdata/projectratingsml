INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPNENIT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$4.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an education project. Other
external finance for the oroject will be provided on a grant basis by the
Federal Renublic of Germany (US$1.37 million), United Kingdom (US$0.90 mil-
lion), Canadian International Development Agency (US$0.56 million), and two
private organizations (US$0.28 million).
PART I - THE ECONONY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Lesotho in June/July 1973.  Their
report entitled "The Economy of Lesotho" (Report No. 331a-LSO), will be dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors shortly. The substance of the mission's
findings is summarized below. The most recent economic data is given in
Annex 1.
3.        Lesotho, designated by the United Nations as one of the 25 Least
Developed Countries, is small, very poor and desperately short of natural
resources. Traditional agriculture is the largest productive sector- farm-
ing is the principal occupation for about 35 percent of the resident popula-
tion and contributes about 45 percent of CDDP. However, not more than 13 per-
cent of the land area is suited to crop cultivation. The rest is mountainous
and suitable only for grazing. Rapid population growth (2.2 percent a year),
resulting in extreme pressure on the land, deteriorating soil conditions and
declining agricultural yields has over the years led to a situation in which
the country is no longer able to produce enough food for its people. Erosion
is progressing so fast, that, unless there is a major change in agricultural
practices within two or three generations there may be no land remainina suit-
able for cultivation. The Government has long tried to stem erosion by con-
structing conservation works, but these attemnts were generally not tied in
with any agricultural production project. Bad farming practices continued,
which caused serious further erosion. Only recently have rural development
projects been formulated which hold out hope that what remains of Lesotho's
soil can be saved.
4.        Manufacturing, mining, construction and public utilities contri-
bute not more than 5 percent of GDP. Total wage employment in Lesotho is
estimated at just over 20,000. Thus, with few employment opportunities in
Lesotho, many have been forced to seek work abroad. At present, an estimated
60 percent of the male labor force are away as migrant workers in South Africa.
The total earnings of the 175,000 men and 25,000 women emnloyed in South
Africa may have amounted to US$90 million in 1973 (more than Lesotho's own
CDP), of which possibly US$20 million is remitted to Lesotho. The number



-2-
working in Soutlh Africa has increased by more than 6 percent per annum over
the past decade, but it is not certain how long this trend may continue. The
vast majority of migrant workers are unskilled. Their earnings could be greatly
enhanced through vocational training.
5.        One abundant natural asset, not being tapped yet, is water.  The
potential for irrigation has not been investigated systematically, but what
studies there are suggest that it is limited. The possibility of exporting
water to South Africa has been studied in detail, but so far Lesotho has not
been able to negotiate a long term sales agreement. There are no known eco-
nomically workable mineral deposits of any great significance, Prospecting
for oil is being undertaken, but so far the results have been discouraging.
Mining is confined at present to some small-scale diamond digging but there
are good prospects that a medium size diamond mine employing 400 workers will
be established soon.  The only other natural asset which is still largely un-
exploited is Lesotho's beautiful mountain scenery. Consultants are presently
investigating the country's tourism potential.
6.        Together with Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland. Lesotho belongs
to the Rand Monetary Area and the Southern African Customs Union.  Movement of
goods and funds within the Area is virtually free. Lesotho has no central bank
of its own7, and the South African rand circulates as legal tender.  This situa-
tion has both advantages and disadvantages for Lesotho. Among the advantages
are the free access that Lesotho's industries have to a large market, benefits
for Basotho farmers from the support prices paid by the South African market-
ing boards to agricultural producers, and the fact that Lesotho is able to
draw on the foreign exchange reserves of South Africa. The disadvantages of
the arrangements are mainly that they limit the set of economic policy instru-
ments available to the Government.  In practice it is South Africa who has
determined the policies related to foreign exchange rates, monetary matters,
and the level of customs, excise and sales taxes. Lesotho receives a propor-
tion of the total customs and excise revenue of the whole customs area, re-
lated to her total imports, which, since the re-negotiation of the customs
agreement in 1969, has accounted for a substantial part of the country's
annual revenue.
7.        Lesotho obtains the bulk of the manufactures she consumes from abroad,
importing goods valued at US$65 million in 1972. The increase in prices for
petco'1rum products may add US$2-2.5 million to the import bill in 1974 and raise
internal transport costs, further depressing the low standard of living in the
more remote areas which are the poorest.
8.        The scant available economic data indicate that there has been pover-
ty and stagnation over a long period of time. It appears that in real terms
total GDP per capita has fallen slightly over the last decade or so. But as
remittances from migrant workers have increased, GNP per capita may have re-
mained more or less stable at US$100. The level of gross fixed investment
is estimated to have stagnated at some US$7 million a year (about 10 percent
of GDP) since Independence (1966).



-3-
8.        At Independence, the Government inherited a situation in which
British grants-in-aid were required to finance about half of Lesotho's
current budget. By renegotiating the revenue sharing arrangements contained
in the Customs Union Agreement and by various austerity measures, Lesotho
progressively reduced its budget deficit and is now generating surpluses.
In 1973/74 a surplus of R 6 million is expected. Government recurrent rev-
enue is likely to increase from US$31 million in 1973/74 to more than US$60
million by 1979/80. Since 1967/68 recurrent expenditures, which provide in
most cases for only a minimal level of services, have not been allowed to in-
crease in real terms. This has severely hampered the planning and implemen-
tation of Lesotho's development program, and is a major reason for government
capital expenditure remaining at a low level of about US$4.5 million a year.
9.        In 1971, the Government published its First Five-Year Development
Plan 1970-75. The Plan envisaged an average annual rate of growth of GDP
of not less than 5 percent and the creation of 10,000-15,000 new jobs.
This was to be achieved, in particular, by increasing agricultural produc-
tivity, promoting small-scale industries and exploiting the country's water
resources. The Plan proposed a US$42 million government capital expenditure
program for the five-year period, excluding about US$38 million to be spent
on the construction of the Malibamatso Water Export Project.  However, in the
first three years of the Plan, total government capital expenditures amounted
to only 56 percent of the planned target, and remained at about the same level
as before the inception of the plan. Only a few hundred new jobs have been
created each year. The Government is intending to prepare a new plan covering
the period 1975-1979. In the future, the substantially imnroved budgetary
position should give the Government much more leeway in planning.
10.       In the past, the most serious constraint to development has been
the country's low absorptive capacity. The Government will be able to use
part of the anticipated increase in revenue, mainly derived from customs,
excise and sales duties, to build up its administrative framework for plan-
ning and plan implementation. In addition it is likely that some US$20 million
of locally generated finance may be contributed to the financing of the next
five year public sector development program. Since a large part of this must
be allocated for essential capital expenditures which are unattractive to ex-
ternal agencies (e.g. administrative buildings, staff housing etc.) the Govern-
ment necessarily depends on external finance to meet not only the foreigni ex-
change costs of development projects but also a large part of local costs.
11.       Although in the past Lesotho has depended heavilv on external aid,
capital assistance to Lesotho has been in the form of grants or IDA credits.
Thus the Public debt is verv low. Since Independence, on average, Lesotho
has received US$3 million per annum from the U.K. and US$0.4 million from
other sources. In addition approximately US$2.7 million of IDA funds were
disbursed in the period 1966-73. Since the Government is able to draw on
the foreign exchange earnings of the whole Southern African Customs Union,
its debt servicing capacity depends on its budgetary position. Servicing
of existing public debt amounted to US$570,000 in 1973/74, which represents
1.5 percent of current revenue. In future, Lesotho expects to continue to



-4-
receive most capital assistance in the form of grants or concessionary credits,
in which case the servicing of public debt is likely to increase to about US$1.2
million by 1979/80, eouivalent to 2.0 percent of projected domestic government
revenue.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LESOTHO
12.       To date Lesotho has received Bank Group assistance for only two
projects. The first was a US$4.1 million credit (82-BL) approved in FY1966
for the paving of the main north-south road between Leribe and the Matsieng
turnoff and the construction of 17 miles of feeder roads; the project was
completed in 1969. The second was a US$5.6 million credit for the Thaba
Bosiu rural development scheme (361-LSO) approved in FY1973 OnI which a prompt
and promising start has been made. Annex II contains a summary statement of
IDA credits and notes on the execution of the ongoing project.  As of mid-
1973 IDA's share in total external public debt service in 1973 was under 10
percent, but may be expected to rise gradually over the next five years.
13.       In view of its extreme poverty and difficult geographical position
Lesotho deserves special attention by IDA. As a result of the increase in
domestic revenue, the gradual strengthening of the Government's administra-
tive capability and the steps taken by the Lesotho Government towards achiev-
ing internal stability, an expanded IDA lending program is now feasible. A
variety of sectoral studies (water resources, transportation, telecommunica-
tions, tourism, etc.) have been recently carried out or are nearing comple-
tion. These will facilitate the identification of fundable projects. Eow-
ever, given. the administrative and planning constraints, the Government will
reguire considerable assistance from the Association in the preparation of
Irojects.
14.       In order to protect and imorove agricultural incomes there is an
urgent need to introduce better grazing control combined with related con-
servation measures. This may be achieved by means of a rural development
project, focussing on livestock improvement, which the Association is assist-
ing the Government to prepare. However, since the Thaba Bosiu project is
imposing a considerable administrative burden on the Government, absorbing
aL-- ,--- part of the available technical staff, it is considered advisable
to delay mounting a second major rural development project for two years.
15.       The Association is currently assisting in the preparation of a
road project which is planned for implementation in FY1976.  Consultants,
financed by the UK Overseas Development Administration, have prepared a
national road development plan.  It is anticipated that design work on
the upgrading of high priority sections of the road network will be com-
nleted by earlv 1975.  Since new mountain roads are a prerequisite for tour-
ism development5 for any livestock scheme and for mining, the Government is
considering preparing a comprehensive scheme for the mountain areas.  The
Association will assist the Government to plan on this basis.



16.       The Bank has been discussing with the Lesotho Government for over
tnree years a major scheme for the export of water - the Malibamatso river
diversion project. The Bank has indicated a readiness to consider partici-
pating in the financing of the project provided South Africa agrees to enter
into a sales contract guaranteeing Lesotho a price for the w¢ater which would
cover all oDerating and maintenance costs and debt service, and also provide
Lesotho with a significant annual royalty which could be used to finance de-
velopment. However, there is no indication if or when the outstanding issues
may be resolved.
PART III - EDUCATION IN LESOTHOI
17.       Lesotho's education and training sector features: (a) compara-
tively high enrollment ratios at both the primary and secondary level; (b)
numerous, but disconnected, programs of rural education: (c) provision for
education and training of high level manpower through the trinational Univer-
sity of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (UBTS). The education system suffers
from outmoded curricula, inadequate training of the teachers and insufficient
coordination among agencies and programs involved in non-formal education for
rural development. The comparatively high level of enrollment in formal edu-
cation over many years has resulted in a relatively high literacy rate (es-
timated at 40 percent).
18.       Lesotho's schools have poor facilities and inadequate equipment.
A high oronortion of the children are overage, and there is an excessively
high drop-out rate. Primary school enrollment is equivalent to 65 percent
of those aged between 6 and 12, while secondarv school enrollment amounts to
8 percent of the 13 to 18 age group.  The average student teacher ratio in
the primary schools is 45:1, with one-third of the teachers being untrained.
The educational system is particularly weak in the fields of vocational and
conmercial trainine. The Lerotholi Technical Institute (LTI) in Maseru offers
three year artisan training courses in carpentry and the mechanical trades,
but the annual output is only 30. There is practically no commercial train-
ing and few secondary schools teach practical subjects. Technician training
is beinQ started in temporary facilities.
19.       In brief, Lesotho lacks a cohesive and efficient education system
capable of meeting the demand for skilled manpower. As a result, Lesotho
has experienced a shortage of administrative and technical personnel, es-
pecially at the middle level, which has been and is a major constraint in the
prenaration and execution of the Government's investment programs and has
limited Lesotho's capacity to absorb foreign aid. Furthermore, the wages
earned by migrant laborers are closely related to the level of training,
with a considerable premium being paid to skilled workers.
20.       Since Independence in 1966, the Government has taken several meas-
ures to acouire greater academic and administrative control of the many mis-
sion schools as a prerequisite to the development of long-term educational
policies and strategies consistent with the country?s needs. In particular,



-6-
the Government has accepted an increasing share of the financial burden for
education by paying grants-in-aid to mission schools and the salaries of all
qualified teachers. To reduce costs, it has decided to shorten the primary
education cycle. To assist policy formu:lation and planning, it has conducted
several studies of various levels and types of education and carried out sur-
veys of manpower requirements. The Government education Dlan and the proposed
project stem from these studies and surveys. The Plan gives priority to: (a)
the improvement and expansion of technical, vocational, commercial, agricul-
tural, and teacher education; (b) the control of growth in enrollments and
the reorientation of secondary education towards a more practical content;
and (c) the phased development of a rural and adult education program in
line with staff availability and improved inter-ministerial coordination.
A new National Teacher College is being established and the expansion and
improvement of the Lesotho Agricultural College is underway.  Education and
training already absorb some 6 percent of GNP and 22 percent of the Govern-
ment budget, and the future expansion of the Education system will be severe-
ly constrained by the availability of recurrent finance. However, with rela-
tively buoyant revenues carefully planned expansion will be possible.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       The proposed project would assist: (a) the expansion and improve-
ment of vocational, technical and commercial education; (b) the establish-
ment of an extension college for continuing education of adults, (c) the
introduction of practical subjects and of non-formal programs for youths
and adults in secondary schools; and (d) staff development and preparation
of future programs and projects. The project has been prepared by the
Ministry of Education with assistance from UNESCO, ILO and the Association.
Field appraisal took place in October, 1973. A credit and project summary
is given in Annex III. The appraisal report (Appraisal of an Education
Project in Lesotho, Report No. 363a-LSO) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held
May 15 to 17, 1974 with a delegation led by Mr. 0. M. Seheri, Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Education.
22,       The project would consist of:
(i) The Provision of Educational Facilities: buildings,
furniture and equipment for:
-    the existing Lerotholi Technical Institute (LTI) for
vocational and technical training to permit exDansion
from the present enrollment of 120 to 360:
-    the new Lesotho Institute of Business and Administration
(LIBA) for commercial, administrative and financial train-
ing to provide places for 200 students;



- 7 -
the new Lesotho National Extension College (LNEC) for
the non-formal education of 4,000 to 5,000 adults an-
nually;
six existing secondary schools for the introduction of
a new and broader curriculum and to provide satellite
regional centers for the LNEC and 1 ,000 additional
student places.
(ii) The Provision of Technical Assistance:
-    The cost of 25 specialists and 48 fellowships for staff
development, introduction of new programs, preparation
of a rural education scheme and project implementation.
The canacity of the existing project schools would increase from about 1,900
students to about 3,300 students; emphasis would be on the improvement of the
quality of the output, expansion would be geared to well-identified manpower
needs and the entire program would take account of present and projected con-
straints in terms of instructors' availability and recurrent finance. These
figures do not include part-time and short course programs, it is estimated
that the non-formal programs promoted by the project would have an attendance
of some 5, ,00 p.a., doubling the present number of adults attending non-formal
education courses in Lesotho.
`.5 the education strategy and the proposed project ireclude major
reforms, the Government has agreed to establish an Education Evaluation
Committee within one year of signing of the Credit Agreement to evaluate
the effectiveness of the reforms on a continuing basis and reconmend changes
and improvements in the programs as required.  The Committee will include
staff from the Ministry of Education and the Central Planning and Development
Office, an(. other relevant agencies and a draft statement of its operational
orocedures is to be forwarded to the Association for comments within 18
-onths of t!e signn-I of the Credit Agreement.
Formal Vocational Training
24.       The Lerotholi Technical Institute (LTI) is the only industrial
vocational training institution in Lesotho and its present output (about
30 p.a.) meets merely one-tenth of the estimated annual needs for indus-
trial skilled workers and technicians.  Expansion and improvement assisted
by the project would increase full-time enrollment from 120 to 360 and pro-
vide each year for in-service training of some 200 workers already in employ-
ment. The program would comprise: (a) a pre-craft training course; (b) craft
courses in carpentry, construction, electrical installation, plumbing and
sheet-metal work, motor vehicle and maintenance mechanics work: (c) post-
secondary technician courses in civil, mechanical and electrical engineer-
ing; and (d) the training of pre-vocational teachers for secondary schools.
An important new feature would be the provision of in-service training for
persons already in employment. Programs and facilities would be organized



- 8 -
on a flexible basis to permit the addition, or elimination, of specialized
courses in response to changing demand. Boarding (176 places) and staff
lhousing (21 units) are necessary due to the national character of the LT!
and the housing shortage in Maseru.  To derive maximuml benefit from, th-Ae
oroDosed improvements, the Government has agreed to appoint a Consultative
,'.ommittee for the LTI with private sector employers' participation and es-
c-ablish a technical/vocational education division in the Ministry of Educa-
t-on.
25.       The proposed nexw Lesotho Institutite of Business and Administratio,n
(LIBA) would be the only institution for preDating employees in clerical,
commercial and administrative occupations,  there are 8,000 persons employed
in these fields and approximately 200 institutionally trained middle level
employees will be required each year. LIBA would provide facilities for
200 full-time students and approximately 100 in evening and Saturday courses.
Emphasis would be placed on courses on management, bookeening and accounting
practices.  LIBA would include two secticns, catering respectively for the
private sector and for the civil service.
26.       The project would provide the buildings and equipment: requlired to
introduce practical subjects into six selected secondary schools. rr.te qual-
ity of secondary education needs to be improved and the curriculum is to be
made more relevant to Lesotho's environment.  Emphasis on science and mathe-
miatics teaching is now being increased and agriculture, handicrafts and in-
dustrial arts would be introduced as regular subjects in the secondary school
program. Domestic science courses would be available to girls.
27.       Because of the lack of practical subject teachers, the new progran
will be limited init4ally to 6 of the 56 secondary schools. The six schools
have been carefully selected to insure widespread geographical distributiorn
and each would adopt the subjects most relevant to the needs in the surround-
ing region.  Five of them would be located in rural areas and would provide
additional thrust to the rural development program.  All are located in cor.
paratively well-populated regions to reduce the need for boarding facilities:
three are in the north, one is central and two are in the south. In accordanCe
with the Government's plan to control growthi in secondary school enrollment by
expanding existing schools rather than building additional schools, each
sc'ool has been designated for further expansion and the project would pro-
vide for the present total enrollment of 1,700 to be increased to 2,750.
Non-Formal Education
At presenEt, because of administrative constraints only limited
assistance in thae area of adult and rural education can be contemplated.
There is, nevertheless, a need to develop programs for improving the skills
and attitude of the agricultural population and to meet the special require-
ments of women and youngsters who perform most of the farming and herding
functions as over half of the men are nonnally abroad working as migrant
laborers. In particular, the project wou:Ld provide technical assistance
for the evaluation of existing programs and the preparation of a nationwide
rural education scheme.



- 9 -
29.       The project will assist the establishment of the Lesotho National
Extension College (LNEC) patterned on the successful projects initiated by
the International Extension College (ILEC) of Cambridge, UK in other develop-
ing countries.  Through the LNEC, and with assistance from IEC, it was plan-
ned to reach 4,000 to 5,000 adults each year after a three year development
period. The LNEC would make use of radio, correspondence, booklets, tape-
recordings and regular teachers in off-hours. tThere applicable, group meet-
ings and secondary school facilities would be used to supplement radio and
correspondence instruction. The six secondary schools included in the proj-
ect are expected to serve as regional satellite centers for the LNEC. The
program would include supplemental academic courses for preparation for sec-
ondary school level examinations, in-service teacher training, and basic
rural training in agriculture, animal husbandry, health, handicrafts, mar-
keting, and cooperatives in the satellite centers. Special courses would
be provided at the six satellite centers on a regular basis, evenings and
Saturdays for adults and school leavers from the surrounding areas. It is
anticipated that at least half of these courses would be directed to women
and focus on nutrition and basic rural skills. The project would provide
the headquarters of the LNEC, including duplicating, collating and storage
facilities, equipment for the production of radio and tape recorded educa-
tional programs, and housing for six staff.
Technical Assistance
30.       The successful implementation of Lesotho's education strategy and
of the proposed project require a major program of staff development and
technical assistance to: (i) strengthen and upgrade the staff of the Min-
istry of Education (ii) supply administrators and specialist teachers for
the project institutions and the training of their local counterparts; and
(iii) provide key-personnel to the project implementation unit who, in ad-
dition to overseeing implementation of the project, would help establish an
effective school building unit and assist in standardizing and making more
economical educational facilities.
31.       In particular, the following positions would be established in the
Ministry and staffed initially by expatriate specialists who would train their
counterparts with a view to being replaced by Basotho aftcr three years from
the start of the technical assistance program: (a) a rural education specialist
would plan, organize, and develop the proposed new program oE rural education
and devise the administrative means of coordinating the efforts of the various
ministries which are active in rural develonment efforts; (b) a director of
practical studies would develop the proposed new secondary school program and
make necessary adjustments as the program develops; and (c) the director of
the teaching service would organize a new system of teacher recruitment, rec-
ords, and Payment, made necessary by the recent decision of the Government
to take over responsibility for the payment of salaries of all qualified
teachers.



- 10 *-
Execution of the Project
32.       The project would be implemented over a period of four years after
the date of Credit effectiveness. A Project Unit with appropriate facilities
and staff is being established within the Ministry of Education for: (a) super-
vision of project implementation; (b) coordination with the Ministries and other
entities involved in the project; and (c) liaison with the Association. The
Unit would include, inter alia, on a full--time basis, a project director, an
accountant and a procurement specialist, selected in consultation with the
Association and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. The
Project Unit would be assisted by architects/engineers seconded from the Min-
istry of 1Works in supervising the architectural/engineering consultants.  The
establishment of the Project Unit would be a condition of effectiveness of
the Credit. Supplemental operational expenses, including salaries of the
staff, furniture, equipment and general expenses of the Unit would be fi-
nanced under the Credit. For the design and supervision of the construction
of project institutions, consultants will be employed. They would be required
to make maximum use of local construction skills and materials in the design
of project institutions, since cost estimates have been made on that basis.
Consultant(s) have been selected. A condition of credit effectiveness would
be the appointment of the consultants, employed on terms and conditions ac-
ceptable to the Association. Sites have been acquired for the project in-
stitutions and are in all cases adequate for the proposed facilities.
Costs and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$8.14 million equiv-
alent and the foreign exchange component at US$5.00 million or 61 percent of
the total project cost (Annex II).  This high percentage is the result of the
large technical assistance element of the project (25 percent of the total
project cost). External financing for the project will be provided by IDA
and bilateral donors on a parallel basis, with each agency financing differ-
ent discrete elements within the major project components. The financing
plan is as follows:

The provision for contingencies is based on an assessment of likely infla-
tionary trends in Southern Africa and amount to approximately 23 percent of
the total project costs. The proposed credit would finance the foreign ex-
change component (US$2.64 million) and part of the local expenditures of
those elements of the project assisted by the Association. Grants from bila-
teral donors - the Federal Republic of Germany (US$1.37 million), the UK,
(US$0.90 million) Canada (US$0.56 million), the International Extension
College (US$0.14 million) and the Goldfield Mining Corporation (US$0.14
million) - would finance the remaining elements of the projects and most
of the technical assistance requirements. The additional recurrent cost
is estimated at US$300,000 p.a., equivalent to about 5 percent of the annual
budget of the Ministry of Education in 1979/80, when the project schools would
be first in full operation.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       With regard to those elements for which the Association is provid-
ing financial assistance, contracts for civil works, furniture and instruc-
tional equipment will be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding, except that contracts for the procurement of instructional equip-
ment, books and furniture costing less than US$20,000, up to an aggregate
of US$100,000, would be on the basis of local competitive bidding, using
the Government's standard procurement procedures. Domestic civil works
contractors will be allowed a preferential margin of 7.5 percent, and do-
mestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a prefer-
ential margin of 15 percent, or the existing rates of import duty, whichever
is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports. Procurement of the
goods and ervices financed by UK, the Federal Republic of Germany, the IEC,
the Goldfield Mining Corporation and Canada would follow the practices and
Dolicies of the respective Governments or organizations; these practices
and policies provide for competitive bidding and can be expected to lead
to reasonable costs.
36.       Disbursement would be on the basis of:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported
instructional equipment and furniture or 100 percent of
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured furniture;
(b) 80 percent of total expenditures for civil works, professional
architectural/engineering services, project administration and
local expenditures for transportation services for furniture
and equipment.
Retroactive financing is proposed for up to US$275,000 of expenditure incurred
since April 1, 1974 on consultant architects, project unit expenditures and a
small amount of civil works. Procurement is expected to be completed by March
31, 1977 and the project by October 1, 1978 with a proposed Credit Closing
Date of March 31, 1979.

Benefits and Justification
37.       The comprehensive program for the improvement of the LTI and the
LIBA and for the establishment of the LNEC would enable Lesotho to meet
well-identified trained manpower gaps that have frustrated the implementa-
tion of development plans. As the institutional supply of technicians,
skilled workers and commercial/administrative personnel is expected to be
less than the demand, LTI and LIBA would develop the evening and non-formal
programs required to strengthen "on-the-job" training and thereby reduce
the skilled manpower shortage. By providing retraining and upgrading
courses at both LTI and LIBA for persons already employed and by helping
develop the LNEC, the project would extend the capability of the existing
labor force to contribute to economic growth through increased productivity.
38.       The project would help produce a general education system more re-
sponsive to the country's needs by assisting the Government to give secondary
education a more practical content. Because of staff and financial limitations,
only six experimental schools would be included in the initial scheme. The
selected schools would provide a testing ground for the evaluation and pro-
motion of new curricula embodying practical subjects.
39.       The project would provide a starting point for a well-conceived
program of non-formal rural-skill education for adults and school leavers
through educational broadcasting for farmers and their wives and, by making
use of the comparatively high literacy rate, through appropriate part-time
and correspondence courses. The evaluation mechanism and the specialists'
services Provided under the project would enable a broader rural education
program to be planned on a sound basis.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Kindgom of Lesotho and the
Association, the Recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to Executive Directors
separately. The credit documents conform to the normal pattern for educa-
tional projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

PART VI - RECONMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed devel-
opment credit.
