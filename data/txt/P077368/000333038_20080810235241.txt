1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal


Sectoral background: After the collapse of Soviet Union, Georgia was faced with macroeconomic crisis,
economic depression, and drastically increased poverty levels. Decline in the quality of life of the
population was due in part to the near total breakdown of basic local services such as water supply and
sewerage, urban road, solid waste collection and disposal, and building maintenance. Only in the mid-1990s
with the return of some political stability, the Government of Georgia (GOG) was able to begin a series of
reforms that aimed at restoring macro-economic stability and creating conditions for private sector
development. To address the weaknesses in the institutional and policy environment, the GOG developed,
and largely implemented, a program to support decentralization beginning in the late 1990s (State Program
for Municipal Development). Meantime, the GOG requested and World Bank approved the first Municipal
Development and Decentralization Project (MDDP I, 1997-2002), which aimed at (a) assisting the
decentralization process; (b) promoting improvements in financial and administrative management as well
as municipal investment programs; (c) supporting urgent local investments; and (d) generating employment
opportunities.

Although this first phase of decentralization was an important step forward, much work remained to be done
to strengthen the municipal sector and improve local infrastructure and municipal service provision. In
recognition of the need to further proceed with municipal reforms in 2000, the GOG requested from the
World Bank the second Municipal Development and Decentralization Project (MDDP II) and adopted the
"State Program for the Second Stage of Georgia's Municipal Development", 2000-2005. The program
established an ambitious agenda to strengthen and improve the legal framework of decentralization. The
first project, MDDP I, linked demonstrable improvements in local government performance to access to
investment financing; the second project would build on this successful approach. Demonstrated results
included increased cumulative debt capacity of 12 Local Government Units (LGUs)1 by about 2.5 times
between 1998 and 2000, as well as 30% increase in budgetary incomes. Introduction of competitive
procurement procedures and elimination of ineffective staff positions was other evidence of commitment to
improvement. MDDP II represented a second and critically important stage in the Bank's involvement in
local government in Georgia. It intended to support the second stage of decentralization and municipal
development agenda through (i) providing assistance for municipal development policy framework, and (ii)
assisting LGUs to improve performance through providing access to finance and supporting their capacity to
identify, plan, deliver, and cost recover for local infrastructure and utility services.

The project would provide assistance to increase capacity and improve performance of LGUs that would
translate into an increased number of LGUs able to meet objective creditworthiness criteria and qualify for
financing for investment projects. Most of the funds under MDDP I were expected to be disbursed by the
closing date in December 2002. The supply of additional resources to the municipal sector through MDF
would allow maintaining the momentum of the financial improvement drive. It would also continue to fill
the shortage of investment funding at the local level. In the first phase of the project, the MDF would
primarily finance investments that were already identified and evaluated under MDDP I but could not be
financed due to shortage of resources.

The MDF, a government agency created to be in charge of project implementation, represented in itself a
promising institution and further involvement with MDF would ensure its further institutional strengthening.

Deteriorating infrastructure and service provision have become major obstacles for future private sector
development and resumption of economic growth. Therefore, MDDP II directly supported the key
objectives of the CAS in assisting Georgia to attain stronger and more broad-based growth, and removing



1According to legislations until 2006, the term LGU referred to Local Self-Governments (1,111 elected units) and
Local Governments (68Rayon units, which represented a deconcentrated arm of the central government). The Organic
Law on Local Self-Government Units (2006) abolished the Local Government level and consolidation all Local Self-
Governments from 1,111 to 69. The term LSG is currently more appropriate to use.

                                                                                                                 1

policy, institutional and infrastructure obstacles to private sector development and improving the
contribution of the urban areas to national economic growth. The strengthening of the financial and
management capacity of local governments and municipal service enterprises were targeted to contribute to
other CAS objectives by reducing policy and institutional constraints that, at the local level impeded private
sector development. The project also supported the two major objectives of CAS under preparation at the
time of project design, namely, assisting Georgia to attain stronger and more broadly-based growth, and
removing policy, institutional and infrastructure obstacles to private sector development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO is to increase the effectiveness of participating Local Government Units (LGUs) in identification,
planning, delivery and cost recovery of investment projects for local infrastructure and utility services.

Key performance indicators of the project at approval:

    · Participating LGUs increase their financial viability by increasing revenue from local taxes and fees
        by the end of the project above the baseline established at the end of year 1;

    · Increase in the amount of land tax (one of the major local revenue sources) collected in
        participating LGUs, from baseline established at end year 1, by 10% by year 2 and 20% by end of
        project;

    · The number of LGUs able to borrow from the Municipal Development Fund increases by 5 from
        year 1 baseline to 10 by end of project.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, the PDO indicators were revised based on formal agreement between
GOG and World Bank during the Mid-Term Review. The new set of indicators was as follows:

1. The number of LGUs able to identify their priority needs and reached out to MDF assistance increased
by 5 from year 1 baseline to 10 by end of project;
2. The number of LSGs borrowed from the MDF increased by 5 from year 1 baseline to 9 by end of
project; and
3. Adoption of a transparent system of local budgets and improved intergovernmental fiscal relation.

This revision was initiated in order to respond to the changed circumstances in the country. Specifically,
soon after the Rose Revolution, tax on land less than 5 hectares was abolished and, thus, increased land tax
collection could not be expected. Similarly, without the prior adoption of a transparent system for local
budget and improved intergovernmental fiscal relations, LSGs financial viability could not be secured.
Finally, the size and type of pipeline subprojects to be financed by MDDP II were not expected to make any
significant increase in local revenues from local taxes and fees. Therefore, a new set of indicators was
suggested to reflect changed priorities and realities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

The main beneficiaries of project's physical infrastructure investments and technical assistance are residents
and local governments of Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Rustavi, Gori, Poti, Batumi, Zestaphoni, Ozurgeti and Zugdidi.
The local population of these nine cities, which constitutes almost 50% of Georgia's total population and up
to 80% of the country's urban population, benefited from tangible and significant improvements in their
living conditions due to improved infrastructure, municipal services, and improved capacity of local
authorities to respond to their highest priority needs. For instance, improved access to, and quality of water,
supply was made possible to about 100,000 inhabitants in Tbilisi, Gori and Ozurgeti as a result of
successfully completed water rehabilitation investments under MDDP II. The project also stepped in
quickly to secure sustainable water supply to 130,000 inhabitants in Tbilisi during the flood calamity that
took place in May-June 2005 and which resulted in a disastrous increase of water level and serious damage


                                                                                                            2

to Tbilisi water system located in Aragvi Gorge (reservoirs, check dams, head-works, buffer ponds,
infiltration grounds, spillway, and feeding ducts). Local businesses also benefited from the project due to
improved water reliability, quality and improved access roads.

Local utility companies, mainly water and wastewater companies in Tbilisi, Gori, Ozurgeti and Batumi,
benefited from working with MDF during the thorough preparation of their investments (feasibility study,
environment management plan, estimating and considering the cost of operation and maintenance, etc.) and
from joint supervision during implementation. After investment completion, utilities benefited from cost
reduction in O&M as a result of significant reduction in leakages and frequent breakages in the system.
Street lighting subprojects benefited Tbilisi immensely in terms of energy efficiency gains (decrease in
annual O&M cost amounts to GEL 372,000) due to the introduction of high quality economic fixtures,
bulbs and cables.

The central government also benefited from the project since its decentralization agenda and strengthening
municipal governance was directly supported by the project during the period 2004-2007. Technical
assistance and equipment provided in support of establishing an integrated financial reporting mechanism
highly benefited both local government (all newly consolidated 69 LSGs) and central government (Local
Budget Unit, Ministry of Finance).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of two mutually reinforcing components: (1) Institutional Strengthening, and (2)
Investment Projects.

Component 1. Institutional Strengthening (Estimated cost: $3.6 million. Actual cost: $4.29 million of
which IDA financed $3.65) whose objective stated: "participating local governments gain improved
capabilities for financial management, investment planning, and sub-project preparation" targeted
provision of TA in support of further strengthening the municipal governance and enabling environment.
The TA activity was designed to expand TA provided under MDDP I and to concentrate on the following
key institutions: Ministry of Finance; Local Government Units; Local Utility Enterprises; and MDF.
Section 3.2 discusses actual results under this component

Component 2. Investment Projects (Estimated cost: $ 27.30 million of which IDA credit would finance
$16.35 million. Actual cost: $35.29 million of which IDA credit financed $20.8 million) whose objective
stated: "Long-term credits and grants for economic and social development investments are issued by MDF
to qualifying LGUs based on sound appraisal criteria". The objective of this component was to improve
provision of basic local services to the population by increasing the availability of financing for investments
in capitalized expenditure on local infrastructure and services equipment to local government units. To that
effect, the project provided capital resources to the MDF to finance economically justifiable rehabilitation
of infrastructure to creditworthy municipalities. All funded sub-projects were planned to meet appraisal
criteria based on ex-ante review of MDF. The MDF was already operating as a revolving fund. Thus,
reflows (after deduction of operating expenses) were planned to form part of its cash-flow, and
reincorporated into the project as a share of the loan portion of new investments. Section 3.2 provides
actual results under this component, while Section 3.3 discusses efficiency of physical investments made.


1.6 Revised Components

The original components were not revised. However, some fine-tuning of the proposed activities under
Component 1 was made to respond to the new reality in Georgia after the Rose Revolutions in 2003 (these
are described in sections below.)


1.7 Other significant changes

Amendment to DCA: The DCA was amended twice at the borrower's request. The first amendment in
August 2004 allowed refinancing of the project preparation advance for Tbilisi Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (PPF No Q0790-GE) from proceeds of MDPP-II Credit in the amount of $820,000. The World Bank

                                                                                                             3

Managing Director approved this transaction. The second amendment was made in July 2006 and reflected
an increase in the expenditure percentage for the "Goods" category from 60% to (i) 90% of foreign
expenditures and to (ii) 80% of local expenditures. All other terms and conditions of the DCA remained in
full force and effect.

Two Extensions: The project was extended twice. The first was from June 2006 to June 2007. The Project
proceeds were fully committed in 40 physical investment subprojects and 22 TA activities, but 17 contracts
were under implementation. The second extension was from June 2007 to December 2007. The Project was
98% disbursed but two water subprojects in Batumi and Ozurgeti were still open and six TA activities were
under implementation.

Increase in Tbilisi share of borrowing: Although the share of Tbilisi borrowing was set at the outset of the
project at no more than 30% of the overall available finance, the share increased up to 55% to finance the
emergency rehabilitation of the Tbilisi Water Supply system that was damaged during the 2005 flood
calamity. The request to finance the emergency rehabilitation subprojects, in the amount of GEL16.9
million, was made by the City of Tbilisi and strongly supported by the Prime Minister.

Breakdown of Sectoral investments: The sectoral share of credit proceeds indicated in the PAD changed.
No `Housing' or `Health' sector subprojects were requested by LGUs.

Credit capacity of borrowing LGUs: In connection with mid-term assessment recommendations, two
specific proposals were made and implemented (see Section 22).

Scope and size of project components: The original components were not revised. Their scope and scale
however changed as a result of major change in the political situation of the country caused by the Rose
Revolution. Decentralization and municipal development was announced by the new government as
priorities and were integrated into overall reform strategy and strongly tied by content and sequence with
other ongoing reforms. However, in order to match specific assignments under Component 1, Institutional
Strengthening, to the demands of central and local governments, the identification and definition of specific
consultant assignments under this component of the project witnessed some delays.

As for Component 2, Investment Projects, its objective was also not changed, but the mechanics of credit
capacity and investment caps were amended to respond to increased borrowing capacity of the LGUs after
the Rose Revolution on the one hand, and limited borrowing capacity of the LSGs due to delays in passing
the law on local budgets on the other. The final allocation for Component 1 was XDR 1.303 million, with
additional allocation XDR 53,505 for goods to support institutional strengthening (PC station to all LSGs
and MOF), while allocation for Component 2 was XDR 13.179 million. Respectively, outputs indicators of
both components were revised (as outlined in Section F).

Change in organizational structure of MDF: During the life of the project, the functions and size of the
MDF expanded since the MDF was made responsible for implementation of other Bank-financed and non-
Bank financed infrastructure projects. This was initiated and endorsed by the Government, and implemented
under the MDF Board's direct supervision. Corresponding changes in institutional structure of MDF were
approved by the World Bank.

Size of Financing for investment Sub-Projects: During project implementation, and based on demand and
increased credit capacity of the 5 Republican Cities (Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti and Rustavi), the limit for
sub-projects' size ($600,000) was revoked for LGUs (credit limit was the lesser of (i) investment cost or (ii)
credit capacity), but remained the same for smaller LSGs.

2. Key Factors affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Below is an analysis of major factors that contributed to the Project's achievements and shortcomings.

Soundness of background analysis:


                                                                                                              4

Being a repeater, the design of MDDP II reflected "lessons learned" from the implementation of MDDP I.
The first project linked demonstrable improvements in local government performance to access investment
financing; the second project built on this successful approach. As a result of experience accumulated
during implementation of MDDP I, the following were identified as important criteria for MDDP II design:
(a) need for realistic and simplified design; (b) need for developing the capacity of LGUs and including
institutional component as primary component of the project; (c) strong government commitment; (d) need
to preserve the autonomy of the MDF to make sound decisions without political pressure; and (e) involving
elected officials in approving the investment decisions as part of the budget process. These lessons were
fully addressed in the design of MDDP II. During the first phase of implementation (2002-2004), the
project focused on the seven Special Status (Republican) cities that had demonstrated borrowing capacity.
In the second phase, MDDP II expanded its market to include smaller local self-governments (LSGs) that
had improved their financial and management capacity.

A QAG-at-entry assessed the overall quality at entry as Marginally Satisfactory, and indicated that the
project design was affected by inadequate time devoted to project preparation. Impacts of the first project
could have been better examined prior to Board approval. There was no MDDP I beneficiary survey,
analysis of viability of investments made or poverty diagnostics to influence the design of MDDP II. The
opportunity to assess the cost effectiveness of MDF was not taken. The short preparation time also affected
quality of proposed benchmarks and monitorable indicators. Some of the indicators focused on outcomes
for which the operation could have only been partially accountable, i.e. increase in revenues. Strong
preparation aspects included: (i) the intervention strategy underpinning this project and flowing from the
lessons of MDDP I was clear and coherent: In a country with numerous governance problems, it was
appropriate in the short-term to focus more on local governments with a demonstrated willingness to meet
financial and other targets. It was not feasible to aim for substantive improvements in governance through
any single project, and the CAS continued the debate of whether and how much to use the leverage of the
whole lending program. (ii) Another lesson from MDDP I was the need to streamline the financial delivery
mechanism. The new steering committee of the MDF and changes in the management structure should
result in more effective delivery of funds to local governments. (iii) The project team has coordinated with
other donors, especially USAID, which has provided research and TA to local governments. (iv) The Task
Team was effective in drawing on the previous (restructured) project systems and practices in devising the
Project Implementation Plan. Continuing to use existing practices had its advantages in terms of speed and
continuity.

Adequacy of government commitment: Commitment to, and ownership of, the project was strong at all
times of project preparation and almost complete during implementation. During the project design, GOG
repeatedly expressed its interest in the Bank's continuing support to the local governance sector. At that
time, the government commenced Georgia's State Program for the Second Stage of Georgia's Municipal
Development for the period of 2000-2005. As project effectiveness criteria, the government once again
stated its support to municipal development to the Bank in the Policy Letter, describing changes to be
introduced on local governance front and specific actions planned over time of MDDP II implementation.

Assessment of risks: The potential lack of central government's commitment to improving the fiscal
framework of local government was rightly identified and rated at appraisal as "Substantial" as one of the
major potential risks associated with the project. In order to mitigate this risk, receipt of a Policy Letter
from the government was set as an effectiveness condition to reassure the Bank of the government's support
to municipal development. Other substantial risks at appraisal were: (i) possibility of central government
failing to implement the institutional recommendations emerging from project TA for legal and
administrative improvements in financial reporting and controls on the one hand, and (ii) LGUs reluctance
to implement recommendations, on the other. Actual achievements under intended reforms were dependent
on the presence of a set of exogenous factors including, supportive political environment, timely adoption of
intergovernmental fiscal relations system, etc. Assessment of the Government's readiness to proceed with
sweeping reforms in intergovernmental fiscal relations and decentralization overall was highly optimistic.
To a great extent, there was also overstated optimism with respect to the potential institutional development
and capacity of municipal governments at the project design phase. However, these risks were worth taking,
and no obvious alternatives were available under the prevailing fragile political and economic
circumstances at that time. The risk of poor collection of arrears from local government and of financial
status of MDF was not adequately assessed. It was only during project supervision that a thorough system

                                                                                                           5

of Receivable Aging Analysis was designed and put in place within the MDF to monitor municipal payment
and arrears monthly and alert management if actions were needed. Finally, a modest risk was connected
with the inability of central and local governments to provide required counterpart contribution for MDF
investments. However, during the implementation, the GOG was fully committed to provide timely and
sufficient counterpart funding, while LGUs contributed with their 20% shares to any new investment.

Assessment of adequacy of project Design: The Project's strategy to focus on ways to improve the viability
of each targeted LGUs as an entity, not only the "sustainability" of individual investments, made sense.
While progress was made under the previous project in increasing LGU revenue generation and establishing
better concepts and tools for fiscal management, there still was a long way to go for LGUs. Therefore
project design provided the right path for advancing LGUs further towards these goals. The strategic choice
of the project to expand MDDP I market to second tier cities has proven to be successful. While it was
difficult at that stage to determine future borrowing capacity of LGUs, the right estimate was made about an
increase in number of creditworthy entities over time, which proved to be correct.

Combining TA and investments under MDDP II was also the right strategic choice. Outputs of the
institutional component were directed towards establishing a suitable framework and enabling environment
for effective implementation of the physical investment component. While the results of the Rose
Revolution were highly positive on the implementation of the physical component of the project, it caused
some delays in the institutional component, followed by subsequent fine-tuning and reduction in its scope to
match the new Governments' reform plans.

The project designed criteria for appraisal and stipulated clear steps for the investment subproject cycle in
the Operations Manual, which provided an adequate and transparent process for acceptance or rejection for
financing by the MDF. Appraisal of the municipal investment subprojects was performed on the basis of
quantitative and qualitative criteria and covered the following areas: technical, financial, economical,
environmental and social evaluation. All above criteria were successfully applied throughout the project
implementation, as initially designed. In order to qualify for a loan from the MDF, each participating LGU
had to sign a Project Development Agreement (PDA) with MDF, which specified the terms and conditions
of MDF loans and grants, and the rights and obligations of the respective parties which were to be
monitored during project implementation. The following important aspects of the investment component
were well designed during preparation: eligibility of investments, parameters of creditworthiness
assessment and borrowing capacity, terms and conditions of municipal loans, and structure of financing
(20% counterpart contribution, 40% MDF loan, 40% government matching grant through MDF).

A number of actions for MDF's internal restructuring and adoption of Operations Manual satisfactory to the
Bank were made as effectiveness conditions. This set of internal procedures and external and internal
accountability mechanisms have strongly contributed to MDF's capacity to implement the project
satisfactorily and to prepare the framework for its growth and development.

QAG Assessment: A Quality-at-Entry assessment was made in August 2003. The review assessed the
overall rating of quality at entry as Marginally Satisfactory. The Fiduciary Aspects of project preparation
were assessed as Highly Satisfactory. Five aspects were assessed as Satisfactory- namely, Strategic
Relevance and Approach, Technical, Financial and Economic, Environmental Aspects, Policy and
Institutional Aspects, and Implementation Arrangements. Two aspects were evaluated as Marginally
Satisfactory- namely, Poverty and Social Aspects and Risk Assessment.

2.2 Implementation

The project became effective in early 2003, during a period where the Government was experiencing a
declining fiscal and institutional situation. The Rose Revolution at the end of 2003 ushered in a new reform
oriented government determined to fight corruption and get Georgia back on track, and during the first year
it was focused on a broad set of basic policy changes. It is not surprising, therefore, that during the period
just before and after the Rose Revolution, the commitment of IDA resources was slow and progress made
towards achieving the PDO was generally assessed as Unsatisfactory. Only a minor portion of the credit
was disbursed ($4.43 million; or 20% of the available IDA credit). The Bank team intensified its


                                                                                                            6

supervision and support to MDF during the period 2003-2004. A two-phase Mid-term review was
conducted in November, 2004, and September 2005. The MTR recommended a number of measures to
expedite project implementation with a view to meeting the project objectives and to disburse the available
credit fully and in a timely fashion. The measures taken included the following:

· Expediting the identification and preparation of physical project components to be considered for
financing with a view to fully utilize the available credit. Feasibility studies were prepared to utilize the
available credit fully. Additional feasibility studies were planned to be used by LGUs outside the project,
and some were indeed picked up by EBRD and MCG when they started operations in 2005.
· Expediting the identification and commencement of all technical assistance and training to be
undertaken under the project. The central government needed to provide guidance to the MDF on the
strategic direction of this assistance in support of the government's reform programs. As in the case of the
physical components, intensive interaction between the MDF and government officials were required, terms
of reference prepared, and the selection process advanced.
· Securing the services of an additional consulting firm to prepare feasibility studies and to review
detailed engineering designs for newly identified project components.
· Applying dynamic credit capacity assessment methods to increase the borrowing capacity of the project
cities.
· Permitting rayon subordinated cities (LSGs) to be financially assisted by their rayons to permit them to
undertake investments beyond their current credit capacity. The Ministry of Finance issued an internal order
to legitimize such transactions.
· Monthly monitoring of the status of all (a) physical and (b) technical assistance / training components
by the MDF including meetings at least monthly with responsible officials in all project cities.

The pace of project implementation improved significantly after the MTR, and by mid-2006 actual
disbursements exceeded those forecasts. Implementation progress was rated as Highly Satisfactory at that
stage.

The MDDP II was at the early stage of implementation during the Rose Revolution in November 2003,
which notwithstanding short term turbulence had a strong positive impact on the pace of project
implementation over the medium term. The new Government's strong performance towards improved fiscal
discipline, commitment to territorial-administrative reforms, and improvement in tax collection provided
solid evidence that risks identified at appraisal level were being minimized by this improved performance.
For some time after the Revolution, particular commitment to the project, and all other donor projects, was
not in evidence, especially as the Supervisory Board was dissolved. This required the Bank to maintain
intensive supervision and Aide-Memoires were written in a comprehensive manner to document all
discussions and recommendations. The government soon started to provide adequate leadership:                 the
Supervisory Board was restructured, it was chaired by the Prime Minister, and its active strategic
involvement and oversight of the MDF activities reflected Government commitment and support to the
municipal sector development in general and MDDP II in particular. The pace of project implementation
improved in the second half of project's life-time.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The baseline data for the revised indicators were prepared and the monitoring system was simple, based on
measurable outputs. MDF carried out overall monitoring of the project, output indicators and reported these
quarterly to the Bank. The MDF had a well-established Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. Sustainability of
M&E arrangements beyond the project implementation period could be positively ascertained. As for results
on the ground, the revised set of indicators proved to be relevant. As shown earlier in Section F, and in
Annex 1, almost all indicators were either fully achieved or exceeded targets.

MDF monitored implementation of all subprojects and TA activities, reported on inputs, outputs and results
(see tables in Borrower's contribution, Annex 8). A post-project Beneficiary Survey was also conducted by
a consulting firm to identify the extent to which citizens in participating cities benefited from infrastructure
improvements made under MDDP II, and their satisfaction. Performance indicators were collected from
participating municipalities and utilities to reflect the before-and-after the project scenario on the


                                                                                                              7

institutional side. (see Section 3.6 and Annex 6). Post-investment economic analysis was also conducted for
a selected number of large scale subprojects, covering all sector (see Section 3.3 and Annex 3).

MDF has also been monitoring loan repayment for MDDPI and MDDP II. The period 2002-2003 witnessed
high rate of repayment arrears and defaults (20% bad loans of total loan portfolio, mainly inherited from
MDDP I). MDF took firm actions in restructuring debts in agreement with borrowers, or taking the case to
court if no agreement reached. As of April 31, 2008, Samtredia had an overdue amount (for principal,
interest and penalties) of GEL 31,714, of which 64% was overdue principal, while Ambrolauri (from
MDDP I) had an overdue amount of GEL168,606, of which 99.9% was overdue principal. Most of
Ambrolauri's current receivables were accumulated in 2003-2005. Kazbegi (from MDDP I), was in defaut
until 2006 when MDF took the case to court. Following a court decision in favor for MDF, the city repaid
all payables to MDF including penalties, interest and total principal receivable. MDF applied penalty is
calculated on the daily balances amounted to 0.06% of the total overdue principal and interest amounts.
MDF. To date, bad loans (arrears and defaults) as factor of total loan portfolio had gone down from 20% in
2003 to less than 0.5%.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment and social safeguards: Project design took into account the Bank's safeguards policies and
included procedures and implementation arrangements to ensure full consideration of environmental
safeguards in accordance with OP 4.01. Specifically, guidance on procedures and arrangements for
environmental screening, assessment, consultations, disclosure, as well as EMP during implementation,
were clearly stated in the OM. On the social safeguards side, OP 4.12 was not triggered since no land
acquisition was anticipated to result from any subproject. The OM included a check list to be used as part
of the feasibility study of individual subprojects, so any subprojects that may trigger OP 4.12 would be
detected at the subproject preparation stage. No feasibility study anticipated land acquisition to occur during
subproject implementation. A Beneficiary Survey was conducted as part of this ICR. Focus group
discussions conducted in Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Gori did not reveal any social impact grievance as a result of
implemented subprojects.

Financial Management: Financial Management of the project was carried out in accordance with project
design and the legal agreement. While the Financial Management System including budgeting, accounting,
internal controls, funds flow, auditing, and reporting was adequate and acceptable to the Bank's minimum
financial management requirements at project appraisal phase, the system was strengthened and upgraded
during project implementation in 2002. The internal controls system under the project in general was
deemed to provide timely information and reporting on the projects. However, some inconsistency was
observed in the timeliness and quality of the interim un-audited financial reports (FMRs) submitted to the
Bank.

A formal audit of the project and of the MDF was carried out on an annual basis. The audit confirmed the
adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls and the reliability of the Statement of Expenditure
(SOEs) as a basis of credit disbursements and compliance with the legal covenants. While the audits were
carried out in accordance with International Standards on Auditing each year, some reports were submitted
with substantial delays.

Procurement: The role and responsibilities of the MDF expanded considerably in the last few years of the
life of this Project. The expansion obviously led to additional work-load and pressures for the Procurement
Department of the MDF which coped with the new challenges in a generally competent manner.
Procurement under the Project was carried out in accordance with project design and in agreement with the
provisions of the legal agreement. No major procurement issues were identified during project
implementation. The overall procurement capacity of MDF has grown to cope with the new challenges
encountered and workload. Procurement functions were carried out by the MDF Procurement Department
in a satisfactory manner and in full compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures. Bidding
documents, evaluation reports and contracts were prepared and presented in a competent manner. Filing and
record keeping have been found in good order. On balance, there were only a few delays in the procurement
process, some of which occurred due to communications difficulties between the MDF and the beneficiary
LSGs. Submission of prior review contracts for the Bank's records and data entry was sometimes late due


                                                                                                             8

to failures by LSGs to forward contracts (including amendments) in a timely manner. The delays and
failures were noticeably fewer in the last year of the Project as all parties involved better understood and
responded to the requirements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Future of MDF: As MDDP II project entered into the late phase (from 2006 onward) the MDF was assigned
a larger range of responsibilities by the Government of Georgia, including the management of certain other
projects financed by the World Bank (i.e. Second Georgia Social Investment Fund, Second Education
Project, the Irrigation Project and its Supplementary Financing), the EBRD and the MCG. The overall
vision of the MDF, as well as of the Government, was that MDF should be strengthened to be capable of
managing the country's major municipal infrastructure investment projects in the long run. The Task Team
intensively discussed with the GOG two possible strategic options for the future of MDF: i) MDF would
continue lending to the municipal sector and act as a Financial Intermediary, or ii) MDF would act as an
implementing agency of Bank and non-Bank projects. Overall, the MDF's future prospects were promising
towards increasing its funding, portfolio, and efficiency in order to better and more efficiently respond to
growing needs of Georgian municipalities. Interest earnings continued to provide the basis for operational
sustainability beyond MDDP II, while accumulated loan capital would be on-lent. Such an approach
implied support to the lending model, as well as MDF's institutional standing. The government's opted to
replicate the lending model utilized under the MDDP II for its future investments financed from the budget
as well as from donor funds and confirmed confidence in the project's approach.

The MDF has grown steadily from a loan portfolio of GEL 3.9 million at the end of 2001 to GEl 32.3
million at the end of 2006. During this same period interest income has increased from GEL 0.3 million to
GEL 4.6 million. The net interest income, i.e. income from interest less operating expenses, has steadily
improved from a deficit of GEl 0.1 million in 2001 to a surplus of GEl 3.6 million in 2006. This margin is
probably the most important statistic for the sustainability of the MDF because it is the major source of
GOG/MDF contribution to new loans and grants. In order to grow further, the MDF must issue new loans
in excess of capital repayments each year.

As of to-date, the financial model of MDF shows that it has grown steadily from a loan portfolio of GEL 3.9
million at the end of 2001 to Gel 32.3 million at the end of 2006. During this same period interest income
has increased from GEL 0.3 million to GEL 4.6 million. The margin of interest income, i.e. income less
operating expenses, has steadily improved from a deficit of Gel 0.1 million in 2001 to a surplus of Gel 3.6
million in 2006. This margin is probably the most important statistic for the sustainability of the MDF
because it is the major source of GOG/MDF contribution to new loans and grants. In order to grow further,
the MDF must issue new loans in excess of capital repayments each year. This is now secured due to the
new requested IDA/IBRD follow-in project.

infrastructure net of other committed donor funding; b) the need to continue institutional support to local
governments, especially after the consolidation of LSGs, application of an equalization grant system and
enforcement of new financial reporting system by all LSGs to MOF. In demonstration of MDF's ability to

act as a sustainable financial intermediary, it will repay the IBRD loan. The new project is planned to be
delivered within 10 months after the closing of MDDP II. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has also approved a Municipal Services Development Project, which will be implemented by MDF,
following up the footsteps of MDDP II.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of the project objectives is rated high. The project objective, as stated in the PAD, focused on
increasing the effectiveness of participating LGUs in identification, planning, delivering and cost recovery
for local infrastructure and utility services. Although a number of the government's policies, strategies, and
priorities were reconsidered after the Rose Revolution, the MDDP II objectives have been relevant and
consistent, both before and after the Rose Revolution. Municipal development, improving infrastructure and
local service provision to the population constitute an important objective of and activity under the
Government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP), as well as important
components of Basis Data and Development documents. The project design and implementation remain
very relevant for the current stage of Georgia's development.

Improving infrastructure service delivery has been a central theme in each of the past CASs throughout the
life of the project, including the current CPS dated August 2005. The overall goal of the CPS Reduction in
Extreme and Overall Poverty and Improvement in Living Standards is directly supported by the outcomes
of the project through contribution to (i) improved infrastructure; (ii) improved local governance and inter-
governmental fiscal relations; and (iii) strengthened municipal and community service delivery.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Significant progress has been made in meeting the project development objectives. After actively assisting
five Republican Cities and eight local self-governments to identify and prioritize their most needed physical
investment needs, MDF consolidated project resources on 40 high priority investment subprojects located in
the largest five cities (used to be called Republican Cities) and four local self-governments, which passed
the credit-worthiness tests. The MDDPII financed investments in nine municipalities included: (Tbilisi ­ 21
projects, Poti ­ 3, Rustavi ­ 3, Zestaphoni ­ 1, Kutaisi ­ 6, Batumi ­ 3, Samtredia -1 project, Gori ­ 1
project, Ozurgeti ­ 1 project )- see map in Annex 11. Urban road projects dealt exclusively with the
rehabilitation of existing urban roads in Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Zestaphoni, Poti, Samtredia and Rustavi.
Water supply projects included water main and sewerage network repair works in Tbilisi, and rehabilitation
of distribution networks of Rustavi. In Gori, the construction of new wells and the installation of a new
gravity fed supply line provided a reliable and permanent water delivery to inhabitants who previously had
only intermittent or no access to running water. Road rehabilitation benefited roads that had deteriorated to
a point where vehicle transit, especially for public transport, had become virtually impossible thereby
imposing severe hardship on the residents, especially those in outlying and frequently poorer
neighborhoods. Rehabilitation of the damaged road enhanced the road capacity. Provision of completely
new, high quality and energy efficient street lighting system in Tbilisi created convenient conditions for
safety and improved traffic flow. The water supply projects financed by the MDF had visible positive
results (see Annex 3 and 6 for more analysis of outcomes and beneficiary's assessment of impact).

The PAD has established the following key indicators as measures of achieving the project's defined
objectives:
     (i)     The number of LSGs able to identify their priority needs and reach out to MDF assistance:
             While the target was 9 LSGs, 12 have been accommodated under the project.
     (ii)    The number of LSGs able to borrow from MDF: 5 special status cities and 4 LSGs were
             targeted and assisted under the project.
     (iii)   A transparent system of local budgets and improved intergovernmental fiscal relations was
             adopted in 2006 and came into force in the 2008 budget.

Based on this assessment, the PDO is rated Satisfactory.



                                                                                                           10

These indicators capture largely the effectiveness of the Institutional Strengthening Component of the
project, which was achieved through implementation of the following improvements in the institutional and
legal framework of Georgia's municipal sector (i.e. institutional outputs):
    (i)      Law on Local Budgets has been adopted, introducing improved central-local government fiscal
             relations, and transparency and enabling local governments to have predictable revenues;
    (ii)     Tbilisi has initiated a strategic program for improved financial management and investment
             planning (although the target was 4 cities under the project, only one was assisted because the
             USAID-funded Georgia Employment and Infrastructure Initiative, implemented by CHF
             International, supported the strategic planning process in 20 other LSGs);
    (iii)    MOF developed a sub-national database, adopted and disseminated standard reporting formats
             for all LSGs; and
    (iv)     all 69 LSGs in Georgia went through training and budget preparation process in 2007 in order
             to comply with MOF instructions for complete changes in financial reporting procedures since
             January 1, 2008 (while the target of the project was 9 municipalities only).

In addition, technical assistance has been provided directly to Batumi municipality (i.e. Development of
GIS-based Utility Database) and Tbilisi municipality (i.e. Local Economic Development Strategy, and
Urban Traffic Assistance), in order to help these LSGs to develop the technical background and capacity to
efficiently discharge their responsibilities. Feasibility studies and designs for 45 investments were provided.
Forty were implemented by MDDP II, while others were implemented by MCG, EBRD or the
government's own resources. (Detailed assessment of outputs and results is provided in Section F and
Annex 2).

The outcomes of activities completed under Component 2, Physical Investment, are rated as Satisfactory.
The number of investment subprojects that passed feasibility studies and met appraisal criteria based on ex-
ante review by MDF exceeded the targeted amount ­ which was 30 - and reached 40. The number of
municipalities eligible to access MDF funding (able to meet the agreed creditworthiness criteria defined at
the outset of the project) has increased to 9. As a result of implemented investment subprojects, provision
of basic local services to the population in borrower municipalities has improved, and the projects benefited
the population, including the poor. While not a stated project objective, the quality of works were
implemented to a satisfactory standard and has been better than prevailing practice in Georgia due to careful
project supervision. Since approximately 40% of the physical investments were urban road construction
(which does not permit direct cost recovery) and since the water supply component of the project did not
feature improved collections, cost recovery in the classical sense from user fees was not enhanced by the
project. Cost recovery, or more accurately cost savings, was enhanced by financing investments that
reduced operating costs. This was better exhibited by selection of project components that had a high
economic rate of return.

One of the key other achievements of the project is the successful establishment of MDF as a potentially
long-lasting financial institution (Section 2.5), attracting several other donor agencies, as well as the GOG,
to channel their funds through it.

3.3 Efficiency

The process of selecting subprojects based on priority assessment and feasibility studies was applied.
Feasibility studies were conducted for all subprojects as part of their appraisal by the MDF. It is clear from
the economic analysis of all investments made, as well as from the post-project Beneficiary Survey that
investments were of high demand in all localities. Particularly noteworthy were the high economic rates of
return on a) the road sections through motor vehicle operating cost (MVOC) savings, b) energy savings in
water supply schemes due to the shift from pumping to gravity-based systems, and c) energy savings by
means of using more energy efficient fixtures, bulbs and cables for street lighting. The ICR's economic
analysis has corrected some of the mistakes made in the feasibility studies and adopted a conservative
scenario for values that could not be observed for the ICR analysis. The findings suggest the investments to
be economically sound. Details of methodologies used and assumptions employed, as well as the detailed
analysis of selected subprojects, are outlined in Annex 3. Beneficiaries' assessment of the project's impact
and efficiency is outlined in Annex 6.


                                                                                                            11

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall outcome of the project is rated satisfactory on the basis of the high relevance of the project, the
high level of achieving the project development objectives, efficiency of investments made, and citizens'
satisfaction, as revealed in the Beneficiary Survey. Increased effectiveness of participating cities and LSGs
in identification, planning, delivery and cost-recovery for local infrastructure and utility services was
significant. The number of LSGs able to identify their priority needs and to borrow from MDF increased
from 5 to 9. The local budget system became more transparent as a result of adoption of the new local
budget legislation and integrated system of financial reporting to MOF. Intergovernmental fiscal relations
improved due to adoption of a formula based equalization system. Building upon the achievements so far
and the lessons learned, the project set the stage and standards for future municipal infrastructure
investments and municipal borrowing that is being replicated by the Government under other donor-
financed projects. The project also greatly contributed to the formation of MDF as a long-lasting non-
banking financial institution, equipped with appropriate institutional mechanisms, professional skills, and its
own revolving fund mechanism.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The direct impact of the Project on lower-income urban population and other vulnerable groups was not
taken into consideration at appraisal, and no poverty analysis was conducted at the subproject preparation
stage. Gender issues were not reflected at the preparation stage, neither was gender impact monitored during
implementation.

Nevertheless, the Project, through subproject implementation, did assist the population in participating
municipalities to gain improved access to infrastructure and municipal services. While subprojects cannot
improve the livelihood of the entire citizenry of beneficiary cities, they are highly appreciated by local
citizens, as the findings of the Beneficiary Survey, including focus group discussions, indicate. Indeed,
some road rehabilitation subprojects improved the mobility of a large number of local citizens, as
demonstrated by the economic analysis.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project's institutional development impact, which is defined in ICR guidelines as the extent to which
the project `has improved the agency's or country's ability to make effective use of its human and financial
resources' is rated highly satisfactory. The development objective of the project "to increase the
effectiveness of participating Local Government Units (LGUs) in identification, planning, delivery and cost
recovery of investment projects for local infrastructure and utility services" is directly linked to institutional
change and strengthening. The institutional strengthening component targeted provision of TA to central
government (MOF) in support of further development of the national local government framework, to LSGs
for improving capacity required for effectively discharging their responsibilities, to utility services for
improving capacity to provide better services more cost-efficiently, and to MDF for strengthening its
capacity. Various TA interventions touched upon certain components of local governments' capacity, some
on the country level and some on the level of client municipalities. The creation of an Integrated Financial
Management System at MOF and LSGs financed under MDDP II has contributed to the establishment of a
transparent and accountable financial management and reporting process throughout country. In addition,
the project contributed to the establishment of a transparent local budget equalization process. In general,
the project has promoted principles of good and efficient governance through introduction of a participatory
process in selection of the investment projects. Involvement in the MDDP II project demonstrated good
practice in preparing, appraising, financing and implementing municipal infrastructure projects of client
municipalities.

Impact on the MDF's institutional capacity stands out as the foremost success. As a result of experiences
obtained during implementation of MDDP II, MDF has earned the status of a reliable and capable
institution. It has achieved a level of institutional standing that has exceeded the earlier assessed
expectations.


                                                                                                               12

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
Addressing the Parking Problem in Tbilisi- TA under Component 1, Institutional Strengthening The
assignment identified high priority traffic management measures (including optimal organizational
structure) and proposed a near term (5-year) investment program in order to assist the Tbilisi Transport
department to improve traffic conditions in Tbilisi. The activity also included design of on-street parking
policy and the city is currently in the process of implementing a parking program that features a 15 year
concession to a single parking system concessionaire selected on a competitive basis.         The selected
concessionaire will pay the city 60% of the gross proceeds from parking and violation fees. It is estimated
that city's additional income will initially amount to at least $2.7 million annually and this figure is
expected to substantially increase over time as more parking spaces are included under the concession
agreement. This innovative scheme deserves careful observation and assessment of lessons learned as it
proceeds into implementation for possible replication in other developing cities worldwide. There are few
other municipal initiatives that are able to address a serious problem, provide a potentially significant
revenue source for the city, and require virtually no city investment. (for more information about this
assignment and public-private-partnership transaction, see Borrower's contribution).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A Beneficiary Survey was conducted by an independent consulting firm during the period January to May
2008. The survey aimed to identify the extent to which citizens in participating LGUs benefited from
infrastructure improvements made under MDDP II, and their satisfaction. The beneficiary assessment
included a sample household survey (size 1000 households) and focus group discussions. The survey was
implemented in one neighborhood in Tbilisi, Gori, Kutaisi, Ozurgeti and Rustavi. An attempt was made to
have cities being paired as control groups for others in assessing different water and roads investments
made. In addition to the Beneficiary Survey, In-depth Interview and Performance Indicators were collected
from participating municipalities and utilities to reflect the before-and-after the project scenario on the
institutional side. Key findings of the survey include:

· Roads: Residents are very positive about the road improvements in their cities and the impacts they made
  in improving accessibility, travel time, environment and improving economic livelihood. But they are also
  concerned about maintenance and some unintended consequences (fast driving on better roads).
· Water: Almost all residents are happy with the improved quality and quantity of water supplies, but some
  complain that either they are still on schedules or have low pressure in top floors.
· Lighting: Lighting projects are widely embraced. Participants rave about improved, public safety,
  convenience, aesthetics, pride and economic opportunities that they have experienced because of outdoor
  lighting.

More detailed findings and performance indicators review can be found in Annex 6, while the full report is
in files.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: LOW
The likelihood that some changes may occur that are detrimental to the ultimate achievement of the
project's development outcome are low. There are no risks related to the sustainability of the project's
impact. The government's focus on infrastructure drives an observed trend of increased financing to the
municipal infrastructure sector. The Table below shows a trend of steady and stable increase in local
budgets. The government has allocated in the budget of 2008 an amount of GEL 328 million unconditioned
equalization grants in addition to GEL 232.4 million for a) regional infrastructure projects (gas lines,
electricity and highways), b) delegated functions (social, health and military mobilization), and c)
emergency operations in territorial units.

The supporting legal framework of municipal development and the overall structure of subnational
government have improved. Local governments have been consolidated, their functions redefined, their
revenues restructured, and their system of political accountability somewhat modified. In general, the
direction of reform has been positive, which reduces risks. In the short term, however, there are questions
about the appropriate division of resources between the central and local tiers of government and the extent
of equalization that the system should attempt to achieve. Recent changes in the system of transfers were
introduced in the 2008 budget (i.e. locating personal income tax at the central level and increasing instead
the pool of equalization from GEL 11 million in 2007 to GEL 328 million in 2008). Applying this
equalization system will increase income of 42 LSGs, reduce income of 20 LSGs, while 7 LSGs will not be
effected. In the short term, such recent changes will need to be tested when rigorously applied and executed
local budgets figures are published in March 2009. Over the longer term, there are questions about a) the
ability of LSGs to generate sufficient funding for their long term capital investment and maintenance needs,
and b) willingness of the financial market to support subnational borrowing.

The government's plan to replicate the MDDP II lending model to other projects (i.e. funded by ADB or
WB new project under preparation) suggests that strong support for development outcomes of MDDP II has
been institutionalized and ensures further accumulation of MDF's own capital through on-lending. The
support and appreciation that MDF enjoys from the government and from donors involved in the municipal
infrastructure sector is a very important component of likely sustainability and low risk of development
outcome. There are no other technical, social, economic or environmental threats to the development
outcomes. Natural disaster threat risks, similar to the last flood that took place in Tbilisi in 2005, exist but
the city is better prepared this time.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Quality at Entry was assessed by the QAG during the period August- October 2003. The result of the
review was to set the overall rating for quality at entry as Marginally Satisfactory. The QAG reviews
identified a number of weaknesses and areas for improvements. Major deficiencies identified, and with
which the ICR assessment concurs, were lack of explicit integration of the lessons and assessment of
poverty and social impacts from MDDP I, presentation and risk assessment not being candid, and unclear
strategy as to how to deal with poorer performing LGUs.

This ICR assesses the Bank's performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project as


                                                                                                             14

moderately satisfactory. The composition and balance of the Bank team was adequate. It consisted of three
core sector specialists, six fiduciary and safeguards members, and was supported by three consultants in the
areas of municipal finance, and urban development. The project had basically the character of a follow-on
project.   The project preparation period was relatively short (3 months between identification and
appraisal), which did not allow a) careful analysis of MDDP I impacts and efficient incorporation of all
lessons from MDDP I into the project design, and b) building up a solid pipeline of investment subprojects
to be financed under the project and prepare at least feasibility studies for those which would be financed
during the first year. Monitoring indicators were not effectively set, and neither poverty/social impact
analysis was conducted. Unsurprisingly, the project design had to include six effectiveness conditions.
Also, assessment of bad loans under MDDP I was not adequately analyzed, neither a corrective action plan
suggested.    Potential risks were rightly identified, but the assessment of Governments readiness to
undertake necessary reforms on local governance front was overly optimistic. Therefore, some disconnect
with the actual scope and pace of promised reforms was evidenced during implementation.

On the other hand, the design of physical investments component was effective and a thorough assessment
of the MDF financial model was made. All major details for effective implementation were considered in a
well structured operation manual which created a framework for successful implementation of the project.
The Borrowers' compliance with Bank's safeguard policies and fiduciary matters was adequately assessed
and adequate arrangements were put in place. Strategic choices were appropriately made at the design and
preparation stage such as (i) focus on creditworthy municipalities with demonstrated willingness to meet
financial and other targets, (ii) combining TA and investment capital, (iii) streamlining financial delivery
mechanisms, (iv) focusing on MDFs institutional capacity, and (v) combination of a grant and repayable
loan, with co-financing from LSGs. Quality at entry therefore is rated, as a whole, as moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The quality of project supervision carried out by the Bank is rated as highly satisfactory. The quality of
supervision was efficient in all respects; there were no shortcomings in ensuring timely project
implementation and effective response to emerging issues and a changed political environment. The
supervision worked extensively with MDF during the first year of operation to build up a solid pipeline of
prospective investments, assess the credit capacity of beneficiaries, prepare feasibility studies and
engineering design, and thus build the framework for expedited rates of disbursement to happen in the
following years of implementation. The 18 month extension of the project was mainly attributed to a) slow
start of the project for the reasons discussed above, b) the need to fine-tune the institutional strengthening
component, and c) the post-Rose Revolution period which slowed down the implementation of projects for
6-8 months.

Bank supervision missions visited Georgia regularly twice or three times a year and responded to
implementation issues in a timely manner as they were emerging. It engaged in efficient and enriching
exchange of ideas and was engaged in continued and extensive policy dialogue with MDF, government,
non-governmental organizations, and the international community on municipal reform issues. Advice
provided during the MTR was timely and of high quality which insured efficient fine-tuning of the
institutional strengthening activities, expedited process of subprojects preparation, revisions in the credit
capacity assessment to consider forward looking parameters of LG increased revenues, and adjustment of
the results indicators. The supervision team comprised, on average, 3-4 sector, fiduciary and safeguards
specialists from the headquarters and locally recruited staff. The team's close monitoring of and effective
professional communication with MDF contributed to the strengthening of its institutional capacity and
professional standing. The supervision team provided substantial emphasis on monitoring indicators. Over
the course of project implementation the project had the same task team leader and sector specialists, while
the fiduciary and safeguards team changed only once. Such a continuity of team composition ensured
efficiency of inputs and dialogue with the client. This was particularly important when the Executive
Director of MDF changed two times along with some of MDF key staff. Relations with the borrower were
excellent at all phases of project implementation. The Bank team actively participated in the policy
dialogue with the government on decentralization and local governance issues, while the locally recruited

senior specialist was a member, among other donors, of an advisory committee and participated in regular
meetings of a government working group. Aide Memoires were well-written and two ISRs were archived
annually. The supervision team also closely cooperated with other donors involved in the sector. The
strength of the Bank's supervision resulted in a Fee-for-Service Agreement between the Bank and
MCC/MCG for Bank supervision of US-funded Regional Infrastructure Development Project.

The task team also successfully observed suggestions of QAG at entry as follows: (i) intensified
supervision and monitoring of arrears, which resulted in a drastic decrease of bad loans inherited from
MDDP I; (ii) very intensive monitoring of Receivable Aging Analysis throughout project implementation
(Analysis was attached to every single Aide-Memoire); and (iii) focusing on results on the ground
checking to ensure that at least minimum public participation was involved in decision-making on
investment projects, which contributed to establishing successful public participation precedents and taking
in account the population's priorities in determining priority infrastructure investment projects.

Based on above, the ICR rates project supervision as Highly Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The rating of overall Bank performance is Satisfactory, being moderately satisfactory at entry and highly
satisfactory during supervision.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Government performance is rated Satisfactory on the basis of its strong supporting role during project
preparation and implementation. This project enjoyed support of both old and new governments. There was
close coordination and dialogue between relevant government entities and the Bank at all times. Strategic
support became more evident after the Rose Revolution. The only period during which the Government
was not directly engaged in project guidance and leadership was for a period of about eight months right
after the revolution. The new government needed time to reconcile reform and institutional objectives of all
ongoing policies and projects with its new objectives and strategies. Since 2005 the Government
demonstrated very strong commitment to achieving the development objectives and support to municipal
capacity building in identification, planning and implementation of major infrastructure investments at the
local level. Development objectives of the project perfectly matched priorities of the new government:
focus on infrastructure investments, municipal sector reforms, and increased fiscal discipline. The
Supervisory Board of the project was effectively restructured and chaired by the Prime Minister.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The Municipal Development Fund's performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. MDF went the extra mile
during the implementation of the project to achieve the project development objective, manage timely and
quality TA to central and local level agencies, engage actively in the decentralization debate and
infrastructure sector reforms, establish its own database on municipal credit capacity, conduct thorough and
transparent credit capacity assessments, establish a receivables ageing analysis database to monitor loan
repayments, and enforce repayment when default/arrears occurred. There were no major shortcomings in
MDF's performance throughout the project. Its institutional capacity has proven to be adequate and
efficient to handle the increasing number of subprojects and TA activities under the project. The MDF was
well managed and adequately carried out all technical, fiduciary, legal and safeguard issues of the project.

The Director of MDF changed twice during the life of the project: in 2005 and 2007. The government
selected high level professionals for this position including the Deputy and First Deputy Minister of
Finance. Such changes did not cause any delays in project implementation. On the contrary, the pace of the
project implementation continued to progress substantially. All effective institutional processes and
procedures were maintained and strengthened by the new management, and new effective practices were
introduced in order to further strengthen MDF. For instance, a new internal audit department was

                                                                                                           16

established, and on the advice of the Bank, safeguards professionals were hired. The MDF managed to
respond effectively and in a timely manner to the Tbilisi flood emergency.

MDF's strong capabilities and performance made it to be seen locally and by donors as Georgia's most
credible institution to design and implement municipal infrastructure and development projects. Since 2006
it has thus become the implementing agency of MCC (under a service for fee arrangement), EBRD,
Japanese Government funding, and four other World Bank projects/grants. Starting from end of 2008, it
will also implement a new project financed by the ADB.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall Borrower performance takes into consideration both the Government and the Implementing
Agency's performance during preparation and implementation. On the basis of justification provided
above, the Borrower's overall performance is rated Satisfactory. The Borrower complied with all covenants
and agreements towards achievement of development outcomes.

6. Lessons Learned

The design and implementation of the project offers some considerations that might be useful in shaping
future projects of this nature in the sector, in Georgia, as well as in some other countries of the region:

  · In countries where access to finance for municipal infrastructure is limited, MDF type of semi-
    autonomous Financial Intermediary can play an important role in assessing municipalities, providing
    financing (in grant and credit depending on the credit capacity of LSGs), and increasing municipal
    capacity in the identification and implementation of municipal investments. With careful design of
    MDF's financial and cash flow model, revolving funds can significantly contribute to new financing and
    cover MDF's own operational cost, thus ensure sustainability. MDF, however, does not work in a
    vacuum. Its nature should be linked to the status of decentralization in the country; i.e. local government
    powers, performance, fiscal discipline, governance, and intergovernmental fiscal relations.

  · It is advisable to focus municipal lending to those local governments with a) demonstrated ability to
    meet financial criteria (creditworthiness and capacity), and b) political will to identify and prioritize
    investment needs in consultation with their respective local councils. Simple design of creditworthiness
    and credit capacity assessment criteria is key for ensuring transparency and local government
    understanding. Such criteria should be included in the OM and made transparent to all local government
    units.

  · In absence of a law on local budget, signing municipal development agreements (MDAs) between MDF
    and borrowing LSGs proved to be crucial, especially when arrears/default occurred and some legal
    actions had to be taken. Loan portfolio management should include a receivable aging analysis method,
    whose monthly monitoring could inform MDF on the status of arrears. Immediate actions by MDF to
    respond to arrears and defaults are crucial. A soft stance may encourage other borrowers to default
    themselves. In the meantime Ministry of Finance should not bail out any defaulter.

  · Very careful consideration should be given during project design to define `realistic' cost recovery. Full
    cost recovery is impossible for several municipal infrastructure investments, e.g. local roads
    rehabilitation, street lighting, wastewater and drainage. Consideration should be given instead, in such
    cases, to efficiency and savings in operation and maintenance cost.

  · Unexpected changes in the Government's structure and policy may be an opportunity to be seized by
    the task team to improve project implementation and ensure the new Government's commitment to
    ownership of the project. By the same token, unexpected new donors' support emerging during
    implementation could be an opportunity, but it requires considerable effort by the Bank team and
    government to ensure coherence of the overall support being provided.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: The following outputs were produced under the institutional component of the project:

At National Level:
Assistance on Legal Framework for Decentralization: An advisor has been provided to MOF to review
and advice on municipal development strategy and draft a law on local budgets. The Government went
through a long 3 year process working on this draft Law. While the draft law provided under the MDDP II
did not create a full base for the adopted Law, it contributed to the final version which represented an
amalgamation of the three draft laws: one by MOF, one by a group of leading NGOs, and one by the
MDDP II funded consultant. The outcome of the activity is satisfactory.

Intergovernmental Fiscal relations Study: TA has been provided to the Government to develop an
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Study and equalization grant formula. The new Local Budget Law
passed in 2006 (applied from January 2007) and adopted a formula based equalization system. While the
recommendations of the study were not fully adopted, they provided substantial contribution to the
governments' analysis during the design of the reform, which partially drew on recommendations of the
study. The outcome of the activity is highly satisfactory.

Establishment of Local Government Budgeting and National Financial Reporting System: TA has
been provided to establish integrated local budget reporting system in the Ministry of Finance and
respective financial management in the municipalities to ensure effective planning, implementation and
reporting system. Software, hardware and training has been provided and the system has been adopted and
in use since mid-2007. There is evidence that the applied system increases transparency and accountability
of financial reporting and is instrumental for improved effectiveness and responsiveness of LGUs. The
outcome of this activity is highly satisfactory.

Minimum Qualification Requirements for Local Public Servants: Minimum qualification requirements
and a set of necessary skills and knowledge have been developed. However, the final recipient of this study,
Public Service Bureaus, has been abolished and no ownership has been developed by any other agency to
bring it up to the policy level. Until the government designates the ownership and applies the results of the
study, the outcome of the activity is moderately satisfactory.

At City Level:
Tbilisi Local Economic Development Strategy: The assignment conducted in-depth analytical study
assessing the city's economy and competitiveness. The Consultant conducted a SWOT analysis, made an
assessment of the city's existing economic assets, economic base, identified factors contributing to the
city's competitiveness, characteristics of the existing investment projects, drew the profiles of investors, and
defined the opportunities/potential for future investment and business clusters that have the highest growth
potential. The Consultant also identified the problems facing these sectors/clusters, and suggested specific
actions to address the impediments. Five reports have been produced: (1) Local Economy Assessment and
SWOT Analysis; (2) Competitiveness Analysis; (3) Guidelines for Viable Economic Activities; (4)
Effective Strategy Implementation Methodologies; and 5) LED Strategy. While several of the
recommendations and action plan are now in implementation, this LED has led into the start of a full City
Development Strategy process, with technical and financial support from the Cities Alliance Program and
the city's budget. The outcome of the activity is highly satisfactory.

Tbilisi Urban Traffic Assistance: The assignment identified high priority traffic management measures
(including optimal organizational structure) and proposed a near term (5-year) investment program in order
to assist the Tbilisi Transport department to improve traffic conditions in Tbilisi. Tbilisi municipality has
developed strong ownership of the project outcomes and recommendations are applied in number of areas
with the vision to follow further the suggested strategy. The activity also included design of on-street
parking policy. The city is currently in the process of implementing a parking program that features a 15
year concession to a single parking system concessionaire selected on a competitive basis. The selected
concessionaire will finance, build, operate, enforce and maintain the parking infrastructure and equipment
for the entire concession period. The concessionaire will pay the city 60% of the gross proceeds from


                                                                                                             20

parking and violation fees. It is estimated that city income will initially amount to at least $2.7 million
annually and this figure is expected to substantially increase over time as more parking spaces are included
under the concession agreement. More specifically, the concessionaire is expected to initially invest
approximately $5 million in signage, pavement and curb marking, Pay & Display machines, cellular
parking, electronic in-vehicle meters, enforcement vehicles and equipment to operate a 15,000 parking
space system and a fully transparent and comprehensive billing system that can be monitored on-line and
real time by city officials. The average charge per space will be approximately $0.50 equivalent per hour.
The outcome of the activity is highly satisfactory.

Information Database for Batumi Utility Services: The city was provided with a modern management
information system based on GIS technology to make the management of the water supply, roads and solid
waste more efficient. The system was adopted by the municipality; however it is not applied as a
management tool in decision-making or planning future development. While the activity was planning to
pioneer this sub-project in Batumi and further replication to several other client cities, such scaling up to
other locations was supposed to be undertaken with other donor's support. Therefore, the outcome of the
activity is satisfactory.

Feasibility Studies and Engineering Designs: Overall, feasibility and designs for 45 investments were
provided. Forty were implemented by MDDP II, while others were implemented by MCG, EBRD or the
government's own resources. The outcome of these activities is satisfactory.

Component 2: The following outputs were produced under the institutional component of the project:
Forty high priority infrastructure investment subprojects implemented in 9 municipalities. The distribution
of subprojects by cities is as follows: Tbilisi ­ 21 projects, Poti ­ 3, Rustavi ­ 3, Zestaphoni ­ 1, Kutaisi ­ 6,
Batumi ­ 3, Samtredia -1 project, Gori ­ 1 project, Ozurgeti ­ 1 project. Chart 2 below illustrates
distribution of subprojects by sectors. The Borrower's contribution documents in more detail outputs
achieved under each subproject.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

Given the demand-driven nature of MDDP II, the type and size of subproject investments were not known
during project preparation stage. Instead of computing an economic rate of return at the time of project
appraisal, the Operational Manual required a financial and economic analysis to be performed as part of each
subproject preparation and appraisal process. Since 40 subprojects have been completed under MDDP II, a
sample from the most significant subprojects in terms of investment costs are representing all sectors has
been selected, covering: 2 street lighting subprojects, 2 water subprojects, 3 roads subprojects. Wherever
feasible, the economic analysis carried out in the feasibility study has been replicated for the purpose of this
ICR analysis, correcting some methodological or mathematical errors.

A. Street Lighting Subprojects

The two subprojects implemented in Tbilisi (cost: GEl 800,507 and GEl 1,197,060) replaced the street
lighting system in various areas of Tbilisi, including the road to the airport and the Western exit road to
Kutaisi, on the premise that the operational and maintenance (O&M) cost of the old system was high, while
the lighting quality was poor. Both subprojects adopted the same framework of economic analysis, including
similar approaches to assessing O&M and energy savings, though with slight variation on some of the
assumptions. Evidence, including results from the Beneficiary Survey, suggests that the lighting quality has
improved significantly in these locations, despite the lower watt consumption per light bulb and the lower
number of light poles. The ICR analysis can confirm a slightly higher ERR and NPV compared to the
appraisal analysis.

The annual energy savings are easily computable and verifiable from the specifications of the old and the
new lighting systems. The old system included 400 watt light bulbs versus the 250 watt light bulbs employed
under the new lighting system for each location. For the Airport road, the number of light poles decreased by
107, whereas for the Western exit road the decrease was 4572, generating additional energy savings. Since
the computation of the maintenance costs included non-economic positions, such as salary savings (which
should not be included in the presence of an economy with significant unemployment), or social, road and
other taxes, these positions were excluded in the computation of differences in the maintenance costs between
the with- and without-project scenarios. Also excluded from the maintenance costs are savings arising from
the decline of transport intensity, as these were based on assumptions that cannot be verified without a traffic
count. What is included in computing differences in maintenance cost, is the material replacement (i.e. light
bulbs) for servicing previous light fixtures versus news ones.

Similar to the two economic analyses at appraisal, the difference between energy consumption for the with-
and without-project scenario was computed and the same assumption reference the usage of streetlights,
which is 11.12 hours per day on average, was adopted. Different from the appraisal analyses, the ICR
employed the cost-recovery price for a kilowatt hour of electricity, rather than the tariff net of taxes, as
employed in the feasibility study. This is the correct approach, since the economic cost of electricity
provision are not mirrored by tariffs that generally include explicit and implicit subsidies. Using an average
cost recovery tariff estimated for Georgia for the year 20053, this tariff rate was suitably converted to 2005
US dollar prices.

For reasons, not explained in the feasibility study or the analysis, the investment costs were adjusted in both
studies by a factor of 0.83 in addition to the typical conversion factor of 0.8 to transform financial prices to
economic ones. In the ICR analysis, the investment costs were only adjusted by 0.8 to remain on the
conservative side. The results are presented in table 3.1 below. Despite the more conservative assumptions
made on the maintenance costs and the conversion factor, correcting some errors that reduced the size of the
benefit stream, the NPV and economic rate of return estimated at appraisal can be confirmed for both sub-
projects by the data.


                                                 22

For the improved lighting system at the Airport road in Tbilisi, the ICR analysis computed an economic rate
of return of 14.89 percent and a NPV of almost USD 49,000. These results are comparable to the analysis in
the feasibility study that computed an ERR of 13.89 percent and a NPV of USD 12,491. A quick sensitivity
analysis on these findings shows ­ assuming all other economic parameters unchanged ­ that lowering the
electricity tariff by about 25 percent to USD 0.052 kilowatt hour would start yielding a negative NPV. In
contrast and assuming all things equal, only when increasing O&M costs by 50 percent under the new system
(thus decreasing estimated savings) will the NPV turn negative. A quick robustness check on the findings for
the other street lighting subproject in Tbilisi shows an even lower sensitivity of the results to electricity tariff
changes or changes in maintenance costs. The higher NPV in the ICR analysis can be explained by the lower
discount rate (12 percent) assumed. And if computed with the same discount rate as at appraisal (15 percent),
the projected NPV is halved to about USD 90,000, thus more in the range of the appraisal estimate of USD
55,000.

Finally, it should be noted that enhanced street lighting generates benefits beyond the economic resource
savings computed in this analysis, including, among others, enhanced road and pedestrian safety. These
benefits are not simple to estimate, as a variety of confounding factors influence safety and are therefore not
quantified in this ICR analysis.


B. Road Subprojects
Thirteen road rehabilitation subprojects were implemented in three cities- namely, Tbilisi (4), Kutaisi (6) and
Rustavi (3). Economic analysis was conducted as part of the feasibility study for each subproject. Savings in
vehicle operating cost (VOC) due to improved road conditions were, in the early phase of the project,
computed using a comparable case study: $0.02 per km for light vehicles and $0.03 per km for heavy vehicles
were used to compute benefit streams, in addition to the reduction in travel time compared with the detour
used by motorists before the project. On the cost side, the road agency cost, which is the sum of capital cost
and recurrent maintenance cost, was used. Based on the advice from the Bank team, the Highway
Development and Maintenance Model 4 (HDM 4) was used during project implementation, resulting in a
more solid economic analysis.

Three roads rehabilitation subprojects, one implemented in Kutaisi, one in Rustavi and one in Tbilisi, have
been selected for a detailed economic analysis. Wherever possible, the original assumptions and data used in
the feasibility studies are employed. However, since some key assumptions on road characteristics are not
included in the feasibility studies, default values provided by HDM 4 are employed in addition to data from
other Bank funded road projects. Some of the key assumptions, as well as modifications made to the original
feasibility studies, include:

    · Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and NPV of subprojects are assessed over a 20 year period,
         at the discount rate of 12%. Earlier feasibility studies used 15% as discount rate.
    · Feasibility studies assumed the "do-nothing" scenario as baseline. In the ICR, the "do-minimum"
         scenario, including responsive patching and crack sealing, has been employed to obtain a more
         realistic picture.
    · Since an ex post traffic survey had not been conducted, the level of traffic volume, assessed during
         the feasibility studies, has been used. Traffic growth, however, is assumed at 5% per year, given the
         rate of economic growth during project implementation, although lower traffic growth rates were
         often used especially in the earlier feasibility studies.
    · Benefit streams comprise of estimated savings in motor vehicle operating costs, travel time and
         maintenance cost at the price of feasibility studies and over 20 years starting from the first year after
         the feasibility studies4.
    · Non-motorized traffic is assumed at 600 ADDT.
    · Salvage value is assumed at 20% in the ICR economic analysis, unlike in the feasibility studies that
         did not take into account salvage values.
    · For data not provided in the feasibility studies, de fault value of HDM 4 and data from Bank
         supported road projects are used.

Since some assumptions are made for lack of data, supplementary analysis has been conducted to look at
broader aspects of the economic benefits arising from the road rehabilitation subprojects. Since rehabilitated
roads mainly serve local residents and connect the neighborhoods to city centers, cost effectiveness of
investments, measured by the number of residents in the neighborhood per $1,000 of investment, has been
conducted to assess broader benefits that accrue to local residents beyond motorists. In addition, the cost of
investment per square meter of roads rehabilitated was compared against international benchmarks. Both these
statistics have been computed in addition to the NPV and ERR for each of the subprojects.

Subprojects in Tbilisi and Kutaisi generated reasonable NPVs, with the EIRRs above 30%. Subprojects have
the benefit cost ratio (BCR) larger than 2. The subproject in Rustavi has yielded an NPV of $190,000 and the
BCR is 0.19. However, its cost effectiveness, which stands at 78.5, is much higher compared to the other two
subprojects, reflecting the fact that the road serves a large number of local residents. The subproject in Tbilisi,
which serves a larger neighborhood, has also yielded a sound cost effectiveness ratio. Should Georgia
continues to enjoy a high rate of economic growth and increased rates of car ownership, the high cost
effectiveness figures indicate that more local residents, including the poor, will directly benefit from the
improved road conditions.

A sensitivity analysis shows that all subprojects have yielded EIRRs above 12% even when twenty percent
lower traffic levels or two percent lower traffic growth scenarios are assumed. Investment costs per cubic
meter of road rehabilitated compare favorably against international benchmarks as established in the Road
Cost Knowledge System (ROCKS). The investment cost per cubic meter is high for Rustavi but this
subproject was almost a full reconstruction, which involved complete change of the road base, which justifies
the relatively high unit cost.


C. Water Subprojects

The largest two water rehabilitation subprojects completed under MDDPII were in Gori and Ozurgeti. Each
aimed at providing 24-hour water supply to the cities' residents, by increasing the pressure in the system
through a shift from pumping (which was frequently interrupted due to blackouts) to a gravity-fed scheme.


                                                  25

The respective feasibility studies conducted in 2005 projected that not only would these shifts trigger
significant energy savings, but would also eliminate the cost of maintenance and repairs at the obsolete
pumping stations, as well as salaries of staff who operated them. In this ICR analysis, salaries are not
considered as an economic cost in an economy with large unemployment. The ICR analysis does, however,
include the maintenance savings, that consist of both salaries and materials, which are difficult to
disaggregate. Instead, banking on household data collected under the beneficiary assessment, the ICR analysis
monetizes the changes in coping behaviors by households for the portion of the population that has moved
from an interrupted supply schedule to a continuous one. Also included in the benefit stream are energy
savings from shifting to a gravity-fed system, valued at their economic costs. The methodology and the data
are discussed in more detail below, followed by a more detailed section for each of the evaluated subprojects.

Statistics and Methodology

In the absence of baseline data, the household survey for the beneficiary assessment included questions on the
extent to which water supply has been intermittent in 2005 and 2008, respectively. For the purpose of the ICR
economic analysis, the percentage increase from 2005 to 2008 of households with 24 hour water supply was
computed to get the size of the population who would no longer need to haul water from other sources or buy
water tanks for collection and storage; thus would no longer require to incur coping costs due to intermittent
supply. Specific questions in the survey helped identify the percentage of households that cope with
intermittent supply in certain ways. Different coping strategies were monetized by valuing the time spent on
collecting water, at a conservative estimate of GEL 5 per day (the lower end of the unskilled wage rate in
Georgia- a here a proxy measure for increased leisure time) and by using the depreciation cost of the average
water tank (GEL 500, depreciated at a 5 percent rate annually), as applicable to households.

Some notes of caution are warranted here when interpreting the results: (a) households may still continue to
haul water from other sources, if tap water quality is of concern (and the evidence suggests it is, as will
emanate from the more detailed discussion on the beneficiary survey in Annex 6); (b) households may not
trust the permanency of improvements in the steadiness of supply and will continue to invest in water tanks, in
case they need them; and (c) the household sample is small in size - sample percentages displayed in table 3.3
below may not mirror population percentages.

With respect to the sample size, results of the Ozurgeti case should be dealt with caution because 118
households were not asked about their supply situation in 2005 due to wrong skip patterns in the survey
instrument, while 31 households did not respond. However, the Ozurgeti feasibility study suggests that
households were getting on average only 2 to 3 hours of water in 2005, which is significantly lower than the
computed mean5 of almost 10 hours that emanates from the response of 138 households for 2008. The sample
sizes for Gori are larger and the loss of household observations due to the error in skip pattern is lower, thus
the estimates for Gori are more robust.

Both cities show improvement towards moving to a 24-hour water supply schedule, but none of them has yet
achieved this objective. Contrary to the initial findings from focus group discussions in one of the


                                               26

neighborhoods, Gori, with 91 percent of the households reporting steady supply in 2008, appears to have a
well-maintained system. Gori received assistance under the two consecutive IDA projects (MDDP I & II) and
one would expect the investments made to generate visible benefits to consumers (see focus group
discussion). However, one needs to bear in mind that most of the water investments were geared towards
improving the efficiency of water delivery (by reducing its cost of production through energy savings) and
securing a more steady flow of water into the piped network (by reducing reliance on electricity, which in the
presence of power outages is one of the causes of intermittent supply). However, without fixing the water
leakages in the piped network simultaneously, increases in water pressure are only felt marginally at the
recipient end. Similarly, without addressing water quality concerns through investments in adequate treatment
systems, the expected reduction in coping costs arising from poor water supply may not ensue.

On the energy side, the feasibility studies ­ similar to evaluations of the lighting systems ­ have employed
electricity tariffs to approximate the size of savings in energy costs. As explained above, implicit and explicit
subsidies generally distort the price of electricity and the ICR analysis uses the cost-recovery estimate for
Georgia computed by the more detailed study referenced above. In addition, the feasibility study assumed a
24 hour pumping schedule for computing energy savings, which is not based on the actual schedule but seems
to be motivated by simulating a counterfactual scenario for the old pumping scheme with the assumption of
ensuring sufficient water to be sent to the network to enable a 24 hour water supply schedule. This seems
sensible, since today's reasons for the continued existence of intermittent supply are most likely related to
leakages in the piped network downstream. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to reconstruct
different counterfactual scenarios.

The ICR analysis adopts the same assumptions with regard to the standard conversion factor (0.8) and the life
of the project investments (30 years). The detailed findings and town specific assumptions and computations
are elaborated below.

Water Supply in Ozurgeti (cost: GEL 4,010,598).

Based on the 2002 Census, Ozurgeti had a population of 17,705 inhabitants. According to the city's municipal
development plan6, the city experienced a 9.5 percent population growth between 2002 and 2005. Applying
this growth rate yields a population of 23,245 people at the start of the project in 2005 (coinciding largely
with the feasibility estimate of 24,000 inhabitants). The ICR analysis assumes the same growth rate until 2008
and no further growth from then onwards. Among the 169 households surveyed, 65 percent responded to
address water shortages either by collecting water from another source (31 percent), invest in storage tanks
(11 percent), fill bathtubs and other containers to collect water when available (97 percent), or a combination
of these options.

Although the latter coping behavior ­ i.e. the filling of bathtubs and other containers ­ is not quantified in this
analysis (for lack of reliable consumption data due to absence of household metering), the costs arising from
water wastage and from potentially increasing water borne diseases could be sizeable. Monetizing the leisure
time lost ­ a household in Ozurgeti spends on average 17 minutes per day hauling water ­ and the
depreciation cost for water tank investments yields between GEL 200,000- 230,000 per year. Since 10 percent
of the population has switched between 2003 and 2005 to a 24 hour water supply schedule, the reduction of
coping costs is only computed for these households, leading to an annual average saving of about GEL
20,000- 23,000. As these savings are very small, justifying the investments in Ozurgeti on coping costs alone
would not have been feasible, as can also be seen in table 3.4 below. More sizeable benefits arise from energy
savings, computed by multiplying the 585 kilowatt hour consumed when operating the three well fields that
have served the city before the investment with the hours of operation per day and converting these kilowatts
into economic cost by using the cost recovery tariff of GEL 0.12 per kilowatt hour. What remains unclear
from the feasibility study and its economic analysis is whether additional pumping is required under the new
gravity scheme. A sensitivity analysis is carried out on the assumed kilowatt savings to account for such

Notes: Shaded area is the assumed base case scenario

Given the small benefits generated from the reduction of coping cost, it is not surprising that the estimates for
the economic rate of return (ERR) and the net present value (NPV) are not sensitive to changes in the value
assumed for leisure time or the number of minutes spent estimated for water collection. Neither are the results
sensitive to the estimated percentage of households that now have 24 hour water supply. In contrast, the
values are highly sensitive to assumptions made on avoided pumping hours and the kilowatts per hour
consumed by these pumps. While the base case scenario, shaded gray in the above table, shows a robust ERR
of about 20 percent ­ much above the appraisal estimate of 8.9 percent that emerges from the available excel


                                                   28

sheet computations7 ­ one can see a rapid decrease in the rates of return when lowering the number of
pumping hours for the counterfactual. The NPV turns zero, when a 14.3 hour pumping schedule is assumed.
Similarly, and assuming all else equal, if the expected savings of 585 kilowatt hour from operating the
pumping scheme is lowered by 40 percent, because additional pumping is needed under the new gravity
scheme, the NPV turns zero. Whether or not a 30 or 20 years horizon is adopted has no sizeable impact on the
results.

Water Supply in Gori (cost: GEL 2,304,324).

There is not much of an agreement on how many people reside in Gori in 2005 or today ­ the feasibility study
suggests 74,000 in 2005, other web statistics8 put the number for 2005 at 45,000, and the consultants carrying
out the beneficiary assessment propose 149,000 for 2008. Seemingly, the most reliable population statistic
comes from the Census data of 2002, which proposes a population of 49,522 in 2002. This shall be used in the
ICR analysis as a starting point. Comparing the percentage of households with 24 hour water supply in 2005
and 2006 (table 3.3 above), shows that on average 12.5 percent additional households are no longer obliged to
supplement their water consumption due to quantity constraints. Unsurprisingly, the number of households
that incur coping cost is small (20 observations), and of them, only 5 percent collects water supply from other
sources. Another 5 percent has invested in a water tank. However, almost all households (95 percent) which
report incurring coping costs fill their bathtubs to collect water when available. Since there are too few
observations ­ i.e. 5 percent represents one household ­ to reasonably compute the coping costs, the analysis
for Gori includes the benefits from energy savings only.

Using the same cost recovery tariff as above and the energy consumption for the obsolete pumps (assessed in
the feasibility study at 400 kilowatt hour), results in an economic rate of return of 23.3 percent. This rate is
significantly higher than the feasibility study estimate of 14.6 percent and the difference can by explained by
computing the energy savings on the basis of the cost recovery tariff instead of the financial one for
electricity. Relaxing the assumptions on the number of kilowatt hours saved and the number of pumping hours
for the counterfactual scenarios shows that the results are sensitive to changes in these values. The switching
value for the kilowatt hours saved is 212, meaning if the new gravity scheme consumes 188 kilowatt hours on
a 24 hour schedule ­ because pumping is still necessary ­ then the NPV becomes zero. Similarly, the
switching value for the pumping hours is 12.7 hours, meaning if the feasibility study had overstated the
pumping requirements for the former scheme by approximately 50 percent, then the NPV of the investments
would be zero.

Concluding Remarks
As with all household data and economic analysis, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results
since the former is measured with a sampling error (a significant one in this case because of the small survey


                                                  29

sample size) and the latter remains always incomplete. Benefits from water investments are at times difficult
to quantify as they do require solid household data for understanding the coping costs, or they require
epidemiological data to trace health improvements back to project investments.

The case of the water investments reviewed above is no different. However, robust results with respect to the
ERRs and NPVs can be found by relying on energy savings priced at their economic cost alone. However, if
improvements in the water system are expected to translate into visible outcomes at household level then
concomitant improvements in the overall piped network and the treatment system are needed. In the absence
of baseline data and the difficulty of asking specific recall questions to a household, the actual changes in
coping behavior could not be measured from the available data.

Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results

An international consulting firm, in association with a local firm, conducted a Beneficiary Survey
during the period February-April, 2008, in several cities that benefitted from investments under the
MDDP II. This Beneficiary Survey included qualitative and quantitative public opinion research that
aimed to assess the impact of investments made in water, road and street lighting subprojects on
households and businesses.

The research methods aimed to isolate, as much as possible, impacts due to MDDP II activities from
other interventions. Although no baseline survey was undertaken to permit before-and-after
comparisons, feasibility studies for each investment included problem statements, descriptions of
existing infrastructure, and expected outputs and conditions, which permitted comparisons of project
results to either prior conditions or goals.

The Beneficiary Survey included a Structured Survey as well as Focus Group Discussions in 5
municipalities where MDDP II financed infrastructural subprojects (Tbilisi, Gori, Kutaisi, Ozurgeti,
and Rustavi). These subprojects intended to reverse the decay of services that had set in with the
collapse of the Soviet Union. The project's 40 infrastructural interventions in 9 Georgian cities
included:

    · 10 water projects with apparent city-wide impact in 5 cities
    · 6 projects involving pairs of localized water and road projects
    · 12 localized road rehabilitation projects
    · 4 localized water rehabilitation projects
    · 2 road lighting rehabilitation projects

The Beneficiary Survey focused on the following:

    · Three water supply and/or sanitation projects in Tbilisi, Gori and Ozurgeti
    · Three road improvement projects in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, and Rustavi
    · Two street lighting improvement projects in Tbilisi

Household Structured Survey
The household survey of 1,000 respondents focused on the users of infrastructure improvements. The
survey instrument made comparisons of post-intervention results against pre-project conditions and
goals, as well as against respondent recall of pre-project conditions. Sampling for this survey
involved designing localized random samples of household and formal business beneficiaries in
Tbilisi where localized impacts were expected. For the other cities, representative sampling for the
given city was applied. The sample was broken down as follows: Tbilisi (water and road): n=100;
Gori (water): n=225; Kutaisi (road): n=281; Rustavi (road): n=225; Ozurgeti (water): n=169.

Focus Group Discussions
Eight focus group discussions were conducted in Georgia between February 19 and March 1, 2008
Four groups were conducted in Tbilisi, two in Gori and two in Kutaisi. The purpose of the groups was
to evaluate the impact of several infrastructure projects among households and formal enterprises in
the three cities.

I. Main Findings of Household Structured Survey and Focus Group Discussions:

Water
· Ninety-five percent of households have a piped water connection, and 8 percent of them say they
   got it within the last three years. The main reason given for switching to a piped connection is
   being able to afford it. Data on the water sources for respondents without piped connection are
   not statistically significant.

· Those with a piped connection have reasons to be satisfied with the improvements in supply: 24-
   hour service has reportedly increased from under one-third of households to almost half (48
   percent) in the last three years. Geographical differences are very big in that regard, with Ozurgeti
   laying very much behind the rest (20 percent only). Rustavi, at 60 percent, also has a lot of
   catching up to do with Tbilisi and Gori, both with over nine out of ten households with 24-hour
   service.

· In the cities with MDD II projects, Tbilisi, Gori, and Ozurgeti, big increases in piped connections
   were found: from 30 to 91 percent in Tbilisi, from 78 to 91 percent in Gori, and from 10 to 20
   percent in Ozurgeti. Water supply has improved for residents living on all floors of multi-family
   buildings, but the most marked increase has benefited those living on the highest floors: 24-hour
   supply now reaches 34 percent of high-floor residents, compared to 6 percent three years ago.
   Medium floors have seen an increase from 10 to 39 percent, and lower floors from 29 to 50
   percent.

· Many Tbilisi residents are happy with their water supplies, but others were still on schedules or
   had worse schedules than before the reconstruction. Some expressed concern about quality and
   safety of the new water supply as well. Projects in Gori received very mixed reviews. While some
   residents have noticed improvements in their water supply, their neighbors on the next street over
   or floor up still on schedule. Some parts of Railway Settlement in Gori have no water or sewage
   service, which breeds resentment toward the parts of the city that do have it.

· Indicators of water pressure, reliability, purity, and taste are reported to have improved in the last

                                                                             34

  three years. However, the cities where they reportedly have improved the most are Rustavi and
  Kutaisi. Some residents in Gori and Tbilisi are not satisfied with recent quality (purity and taste)
  of water. Water pressure and quality reportedly still need improvement in Ozurgeti.

· There is an observed increase of water usage for showers and baths in all cities. However, water
  use for personal hygiene has grown from 1.27 weekly showers and 1.7 baths three years ago to
  1.37 showers and still 1.7 baths now. By location of household in a building, the most marked
  increase in personal hygiene water use occurred in the highest buildings, suggesting an
  improvement in their traditionally worse water service.

· Almost all homes surveyed are connected to the sewage network, except for the city of Ozurgeti,
  where less than half are (47 percent). Single-family homes are the least likely to be connected,
  since multi-family homes do have sewage even in Ozurgeti. Old people are less likely than
  younger ones to have a connection to sewage. None of the households surveyed shared a toilet
  with another household.

Roads
· Kutaisi residents were very positive about the road improvements in their city, but are concerned
  about workmanship. Road projects in Tbilisi were noticed and appreciated, but received mixed
  reviews. Participants are concerned about workmanship, adequacy and unintended consequences
  (drivers drive faster on better roads).

· Automobile-maintenance expenditures increased. Regarding gender differences, men have more
  automobile-related expenses, with tires showing the most marked difference (121 annual costs for
  men, compared to 72 for women).

· In cities with road projects, more survey respondents think their car maintenance costs have
  decreased in the last three years than the contrary: thirty-six percent versus 24 percent. For 11
  percent, they have stayed the same. In contrast, in water project cities opinions are more muddled:
  the percentage of respondents for whom costs have diminished is 33 percent, compared to 30
  percent who consider they have augmented. These results show that more drivers in road project
  cities consider the maintenance for their cars to have decreased, and fewer think they have

                                                                                   35

   increased. These results coincide with the impressions received at focus groups in the road project
   cities, where drivers said their automobile repair expenditures had gone down in the last three
   years.

· There is a significant increase of 15 percent in bus service in cities with road projects compared
   to three years ago. Although bus service appears to have also grown in cities without MDDPII
   investments, the increase in the road project cities is significantly higher: ninety-five percent of
   respondents there say they have now bus service within 10 minutes of walk, compared to 89
   percent who had it three years ago.

· The roads are used by 96 percent of respondents in Rustavi, and about eight in ten in Tbilisi and
   Kutaisi. Over the last three years, those who think trip is faster now than three years ago are eight
   in ten in Kutaisi, almost seven in ten in Rustavi and about four in ten in Tbilisi. Respondents tend
   to credit the road projects for the reduction in travel time requirements to everyday destinations.
   The mean savings are 10 minutes on trips that are usually under 20 minutes.

Health Issues / Benefits
· Severe diarrhea has diminished spectacularly everywhere. A mean of 0.07 household members
   are reported to have had severe diarrhea in the past month, and 0.22 within the last year. For
   2006, the mean was that 0.34 household members suffered severe diarrhea.

· Traffic accidents on project roads are perceived as having stayed on the same level for a majority
   of respondents, except in Rustavi, where a plurality of four in ten thinks so. They have increased
   since rehabilitation for almost one-third of respondents. A vast majority of those who think
   accidents have increased cite as culprits faster driving on better roads and increased traffic.
   Fifteen percent think accidents have decreased, and they tend to attribute it to fewer potholes after
   rehabilitation, and to somewhat lesser extent to police controls and traffic signals functioning
   well.

· Residents of road project cities appreciate a reduction of dust on project roads, although they
   worry about non-reconstructed side roads still producing it. Most survey respondents in Rustavi
   and Kutaisi think that the project road is as dusty as before, but almost six in ten of Tbilisi
   residents think the project road has become less dusty in the last three years. Even in Rustavi and
   Kutaisi those who think the project road is less dusty clearly outnumber those who see the
   contrary.

Street Lighting
· Lighting projects are widely embraced. Light projects have no downsides associated with them.
   Participants raved about improved aesthetics, public safety, convenience, pride and economic
   opportunities that they have experienced because of outdoor lighting. This was the case in all
   three cities.

· Focus groups participants confirmed an increased feeling of physical safety on the streets thanks
   to the new lights.

Perceptions of and Priorities for Local Government
· The perceptions of local governments' performance on public services are high in all cities, and
     for most public services. Ozurgeti stands out negatively among water project cities because of
     low marks to water and sewage services: Only 6 percent of respondents give them the highest
     grade, compared to three-fourths in Gori and seven in ten in Tbilisi. In the last there years, survey
     data show very significant improvements in public services across the board and in all cities.

· Water supply and roads are the highest priorities cited in both the quantitative and qualitative
     research. In the survey, both were signaled by over a third of respondents, who added business
     development as the third highest priority in public services. Cities with water projects cite
     business development ahead of road maintenance.

· Municipal officials and technicians are very satisfied with the MDDP II infrastructure investment
     projects and wish to have access to more funding to improve the dilapidated water systems.


II. Main Findings of In-Depth Interviews

In-depth Interview and Performance Indicators were collected from participating municipalities and
utilities to reflect the before-and-after the project scenario on the institutional side. In-depth
interviews were conducted in four cities: Gori, Rustavi, Ozurgeti and Kutaisi, and comprised both
quantitative and qualitative components.

Water Projects
Interviews were conducted in Tbilisi, Gori and Ozurgeti. Respondents from all cities evaluated their
water projects as having been successful because this service has significantly improved for the
population, though there are some problems remaining because the projects implemented in Gori and
Ozurgeti were aimed at replacement and rehabilitation of only the main water pipelines and
headworks. In these two cities, the internal networks are still in a dilapidated state, which prevents the


                                                                                37

envisioned outcome of full improvement from being achieved (old pipes urge lower pressure from
headworks).

During conversations with the officials, as a result of the works conducted, they said that water
supply for businesses has improved, which promotes economic growth. In parallel with the
improvement of service, there has been a marked increase in public utility fee payments for water
services; although overall the amount of payments remains low due to poor social conditions.
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the payment of water fees from the side of business organizations
has sharply increased. After project completion, the amount of water leakage in the system in Gori
and Ozurgeti is still high because the internal network remains dilapidated.

As for the water quality, the situation is within norms, as stated by the respondents, although damage
to the internal network causes water supplies to be contaminated in some locations. In this respect
improvements can be achieved only after the internal network is rehabilitated.

Road Projects
Road rehabilitation projects were implemented in Tbilisi, Rustavi, and Kutaisi. The results were
simultaneously evaluated as significant and successful by all respondents. Rehabilitation of roads has
significantly improved the environmental condition of adjacent territory, creating carrying capacity
for vehicles on the roads and simplifying the movement and flow of the population.

Rehabilitation by means of paving has positively affected businesses. Opening of new businesses is
noticeable in areas with newly paved roads. In addition, property value has increased in these areas as
a result.


III. Overall Conclusions and recommendation of the Beneficiary Survey:
Conclusions

· Improvements to municipal infrastructure are one of the bright spots Georgians see in a generally
    difficult economic picture, and are one of the reasons cited for their cautious optimism about the
    country. Investment needs are plentiful.

· Georgians in the cities in the study are well aware of the road, water, and light improvements
    made in their areas through the MDDP II and see tangible improvements in their lives and
    businesses as a result. These advances include improved circulation of traffic, reduced
    maintenance costs, quicker access to work, and easier access to supplies for the road
    improvements; noticeable gains in water supply and quality; and better safety and improved
    municipal appearance for the lights. There are qualifications as well: Concerns about quality and
    workmanship of roads as well as increased traffic and rising fuel prices, and complaints about
    uneven benefit, schedules, low pressure, and costs of water projects.

· The city of Ozurgeti stands out negatively for its low rates of piped and sewage connections and
    the low quality of its water services. In general, though, citizens are satisfied with the
    improvements in water supply and quality and they simply want more.

· Some areas in project cities feel neglected. Faster public service improvements in some places
    may cause envy or resentment in others. They may also prevent the neglected inhabitants from
    experiencing satisfaction at the advances in their own neighborhoods.

· Lighting projects are unanimously praised. New lights offer immediate quality of life and


                                                 38

    economic benefits at a much smaller cost than water and road investments.

· Municipal officials and technicians are very satisfied with the MDDP II infrastructure investment
    projects and wish to have access to more funding to improve the dilapidated water systems.

· Some residents blame water reconstruction projects ­ fairly or unfairly ­ for changes in the
    quality or schedule of their water, and complain about reduced quality and health concerns. Other
    residents express disappointment in the remaining shortcomings of the water service ­perhaps
    showing unrealistic expectations.

· For future infrastructural development, those surveyed gave the highest priority to water supply,
    followed by road work and business development. Road rehabilitation projects are especially
    desirable because of the economic boost they provide.


Overall Recommendations

· Georgians' concern with unemployment and poverty in the country now and over the past 15
    years should inform every investment decision. Thus, continue to invest in water, road
    rehabilitation and lighting projects. Water and roads are the citizens' highest priorities regarding
    public services. Water has an enormous impact on quality of life, and road rehabilitation helps
    households and business development. Lighting, for its part, provides immediate benefits for
    citizens and businesses at a relatively low cost.

· There is a strong need to continue to invest in Ozurgeti's water and sewage services to bring them
    more in line with prevailing standards in other Georgian cities.

· In future projects, there is a need to pay attention to local and neighborhood sensitivities and try
    to be balanced in supporting public priorities.

· There is also a need to pay much more attention to public communications. They are needed to
    manage residents' expectations; to assuage their worries about quality or workmanship of road
    repairs; to dispel urban legends on projects being responsible for whatever new problem with the
    service; and to increase awareness of the MDF.

1. Background

To implement the MDDP II, the Government of Georgia (GOG) has revised the Charter of
MDF by Presidential Decrees # 210 of May 3, 2002 and # 409 of September 24, 2002. The
MDDP II (Cr.37010, SDR 15.4 million) was approved in August 1, 2002, and became
effective in February 19, 2003. The closing data of the project was June 30, 2006, but was
first extended on the request of the GOG until June 30, 2007 and again until December 31,
2007.

2. MDDP II Objectives and Components

The main objective of MDDP II was to build the effectiveness of participating Local
Government Units (LGUs) in identification, planning, delivery and cost recovery for local
infrastructure and utility services. In doing so, the project aimed to support the initial stage of
the decentralization process aimed at shifting responsibility and accountability in terms of
delivery and maintenance of urban services to municipalities. Specifically, the project
intended to "(a) assist the decentralization process at the central and local government level;
(b) promote improvements in financial and administrative management as well as municipal
investment programs; (c) support urgent local investments; and (d) generate employment
opportunities". The project's central effort was aimed at establishing an institutional
mechanism which would use performance based lending as a way to leverage institutional
reform and management improvement measures at local government level.

In this respect the MDF provided financing to the municipalities which met the MDF
financing criteria. Key development goal for the Technical Assistance component was to
create conditions under which LGUs in the medium and longer-term, would become able to
satisfy their investment needs through borrowing from MDF. Under those conditions the
Government and the MDF considered sustainability of urban service delivery as a critical
factor in achieving development objectives of the MDDP II. This Project built on the success
of the previous MDDP I project. One of the major factors affected implementation of MDDP
II was the government crisis and shuffles during the pre-election period in November, 2003,
and the period immediately after the Rose Revolution. Uncertainties and absence of the MDF
Supervisory Board for 8 months slowed down of the Project's implementation for almost a
year. In 2004, the political situation improved, stability reached and the GOG declared
Territorial Integrity and Increasing State Revenues as the government's highest priorities.
Improving local infrastructure, through better policies and increased investments, was also
declared by the new government as a key priority of the country's sustainable development.
However, frequent changes in local administrations during the immediate period that
followed the Rose Revolution continued interrupted the continuity of dialogue between the
MDF and local governments in building up the investment pipeline and discussing completed
feasibility studies and engineering design.

However, despite the above, the MDDP II investment component performed without
substantial delays. Major reason for that, apart from the improved planning of the projects, is
the improved general condition in the country. Until the Rose Revolution there were the
political difficulties and Government could not experience in expediting the implementation
of an ambitious agenda for decentralization and local government development. The new
government that came to power after the Rose Revolution         demonstrated strong commitment
to transforming Georgia's economy from a weak and corrupted one to a fast developing
market-oriented system. The economic reform program for 2006 and beyond aimed to
improve the macroeconomic performance in order to foster broad-based growth in support of
poverty reduction.     Key priorities of the Government for 2006 and 2007 remained the
infrastructure rehabilitation and, social, healthcare and education sectors.




                                                42

Because of the strong State revenue performance, the Government requested the approval of
two supplemental budgetary amendments, which allowed increased spending in the priority
areas, including social welfare, infrastructure rehabilitation, modernizing the army to bring it
closer to NATO standards, and other local expenditures, e.g., election administration.

A major difficulty encountered during the first half of 2006 was the drastic rise in
construction material prices due to a booming construction industry in Georgia. Worldwide
increase in oil prices also put financial pressure on the construction companies which
concluded agreements with MDF based on the 2005 prices. These problems did not
substantially hinder the implementation of the projects.

The new government maintained strengthening local capacity and decentralization as declared
priorities. Major development policy was to supersede decentralization and local capacity-
building efforts: (1) designing territorial-administrative reform, and (2) Bringing order into
State budget and increasing the State revenues. Fairly, decentralization and further capacity
building of local governments were shifted and implemented after above two reforms were
designed. Therefore, maintaining this sequence of developments, the government proceeded
in a speedy manner and designed territorial administrative reform and introduced fiscal
discipline, on the one hand, and implemented important steps for laying the ground for
decentralization on the other.

Parliament of Georgia has ratified European Charter of Local Self-Government on December
8, 2004 and Charter entered into force on April 1st, 2005. Following the ratification of the
European Charter Georgia started to plan necessary changes and amendments to the local
self-government legislation, in order to harmonize the current legislation with the European
charter. In March 2005 Parliament of Georgia ratified Law on Property of the Local Self-
Government Bodies (a.k.a. Law on Transfer of Property), and several other very important
laws that were stated in the Government's Policy Letter (the new organic law, the laws on a
self-government unit's property, budget and state supervision). In 2004, the President
established the State Commission Territorial Reform and Good Governance, Chaired by
himself, and tasked the Commission with the design and implementation of the
decentralization strategy.

Municipal development and increasing local self-government budgets had been set as a
priority to be completed by 2006. The Government's plan was to adopt law on local budgets
before the local self-government elections planned in November 2006, so that newly elected
local self-governments had prepared their budgets starting from 2007 based on the new laws.
At the same time the Parliament was currently reviewing and discussing a draft law on
Administrative and territorial arrangements of Georgia, that also was adopted before 2006
local self-government elections. Parliament also was reviewing and discussing the
amendments to other laws and draft laws that were related to the local self-government
development, including Law on State supervision of local self-government and Amendment
of law on citizens' participation on local self-government.

The new Organic Law on Local Self-Government (ratified by Parliament in December 2005)
sets new territorial-administrative structure of self-governance. Namely, from existing 1,072
LSG units it was reduced to 69. As provided in the new organic Law on Local Self-
Government Units two level administrative framework was applied consisting of central
government and local self-government levels. The new law was based on the concept that
local self-government bodies should play an important role in the local economy's
development, and that for this purpose they need a corresponding economic scope.
Accordingly, the issue of consolidation of local self-government units was raised. It can be
said that the reform carried out in Georgia is one of the examples of consolidation of self-
government bodies.



                                                43

The new model of self-government has both positive and negative aspects. Positive aspects
include: an adequate economic scope, which better provides for the local economy's
development and makes it possible to have more resources at the local level. The newly-
adopted Law on Local Budgets introduces equalizing grants that are allocated by the central
budget to needy self-government units for the development of local socio-economic
infrastructure. The competence of self-government units from the viewpoint of the local
economy's development has been considerably extended. The new law gives them the right to
elaborate and implement the plans of local socio-economic development. Adoption of the
Law on Property of a Self-Government Unit was very important. According to this law, a part
of state property should be handed over to self-government units (this process is now
underway), which is very important for the local socio-economic development. However, it
should be stressed here that the new law has not changed the restriction, according to which it
is banned for self-government units to take loans from the private sector and the law does not
determine any norms that could regulate the principles of funds distribution inside the district.

Actual Revenues of LSGs have increased significantly during the period 2004-2007, and
fiscal discipline enforced. Ministry of Finance introduced transparent planning and budget
formulation process - the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) - within which the
Cabinet and central agencies established credible contracts for allocating public resources to
their strategic priorities while ensuring overall fiscal discipline. The process entailed two
main objectives: the first aimed at setting fiscal targets, the second aimed at allocating
resources to strategic priorities within these targets.

The government designed a new approach to equalization fund in order to ensure the adequate
level of the equalization fund annually to make sufficient resources available for each unit for
undertaking of local government functions. The level of equalization of grants greatly
influenced capacity of local self-governments to provide quality services and investments for
rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure. The central government realized that it
should ensure that transfer of responsibilities related to decision-making and provision of
services and infrastructure is aligned with appropriate adequate local capacity to effectively
accomplish these tasks. All of these activities formed good foundation for successful
implementation of MDDPII, accountability at the LSGs to implement the subprojects at high
quality and to repay loans to MDF.

3. Outputs/ Achievements of MDDPII objectives:

The GOG rates the outcome and achievements of the project as satisfactory. The project
produced a number of concrete and visible results on the ground. Most of these results had a
positive impact on the livelihood of the beneficiary population in the nine participating
municipalities. The MDDP II also created a financing mechanism for municipal investments
which, to date, operates efficiently and has reasonable prospects of sustainability. The credit
was fully disbursed. 40 Investment Projects had been completed. The cost of these projects
amounts GEL 57.831 million. The Institutional Development Component of the project was
completed by the closing date of the credit.

The sections below provide a detailed evaluation of the outputs of each of component and
their respective sub-components.

I. Institutional Development

The GOG rates institutional strengthening component as satisfactory. Outputs under this
component have to be separated into two categories: (a) sub-national development output in
terms of training, studies, and technical assistance; and (b) national institutional development
output in terms of training, studies, and technical assistance.



                                                44

(a)    Sub-national development:
The MDDPII provided technical assistance for the preparation and signing of Development
Agreements (DAs) in nine municipalities (Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi, Poti, Rustavi, Samtredia,
Zestafoni, Ozurgeti and Gori). All of these municipalities developed an investment program.
The objective of DAs was to provide, for each participating municipality, the framework of
institutional reforms and management improvement measures whose implementation would
condition the access to investment financing provided by the Government through the MDF.
In principle, any MDDPII investment to be financed by the MDF was only if it was part of an
officially approved DA. The preparation of investment proposals by participating
municipalities started seriously in the beginning of 2003 and the first nine projects were
identified in the spring of 2003. The municipal creditworthiness improved more than it was in
life of the MDDPI project. On average, participating municipalities advanced better in terms
of budgetary management and staffing efficiency. Participating municipalities increased their
own-source fiscal revenues at a significant reduction in staff. The introduction of competitive
procurement procedures and improved management of sale or lease of municipal property
produced additional revenue stream. Most importantly, cumulative debt capacity increased.
.
Training:
Over the life of the project, the MDF organized a total of over 15 training seminars that
benefited about 1,000 staff of participating municipalities. Topics included legal aspects of
municipal management and taxation, tax codes, budgetary management techniques,
procurement,     information   technology,   accounting    standards,   computerized     budget
implementation and reporting. The training program was prepared by MDF, but some of the
trainings were provided exclusively by consultants. The MDF also organized study tours for
MoF staff in Antalia on Project Implementation Workshop, and for a Water utility staff in
Tbilisi to exchange experience in Erevan. MDF management and staff also participated on
various seminars and workshops, including international workshops in Washington DC and
Canada on MDF global experiences, where three consecutive Executive Directors of MDF
made presentations and engaged actively in discussion.

Information systems: MDF supported the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance in
developing a sub national fiscal database, IT and human capacity for collection, aggregation
and analysis of local budgets data, with the purpose to use such analysis in forecasting, policy
development and impact assessment. MDF assisted in the implementation of a computerized
budgeting system including training, software and hardware supply to all consolidated LSGs.
In all, 91 computer work stations (86 for LSGs and 5 for the Ministry of Finance's Budget
Department) were procured and installed. This activity was closely coordinated with the
Urban Institute which, under USAID funding, in coordination with MDF and World Bank
provided assistance to municipalities in local budget planning and accounting.

MDF also provided the city of Batumi, in pilot basis, with a modern management information
system based on GIS technology to make the management of the water supply, roads and
solid waste more efficient. The system was adopted by the municipality.

Strategic Studies:
The Municipality of Tbilisi also requested the preparation of a Local Economic Development
Strategy. The objective of the assignment was to conduct in-depth analytical study assessing
the city's economy and competitiveness. Under this assignment, the Consultant conduct a
SWOT analysis, make an assessment of the city's existing economic assets, economic base,
identified factors contributing to the city's competitiveness, characteristics of the existing
investment projects, drew the profiles of investors, and defined the opportunities/potential for
future investment and business clusters that have the highest growth potential. The Consultant
also identified the problems facing these sectors/clusters, and suggested specific actions to
address the impediments. The consultant provided 5 reports: (1) Local Economy Assessment



                                               45

and SWOT Analysis; (2) Competitiveness Analysis; (3) Guidelines for Viable Economic
Activities; (4) Effective Strategy Implementation Methodologies; and 5) LED Strategy.

Tbilisi also requested to prepare a Traffic Management Plan. The objective of the assignment
was to help the city establish a urban transport unit, and b) to assist this unit to prepare 5 year
traffic circulation improvement program aiming to improve the traffic flow and reduce the
accident rate. Progress on the urban transport technical assistance to Tbilisi is very promising.
The Consultant produced crisp to-the-point reports in a power point format.                         More
importantly, the Consultant interacted closely with the City (including the Deputy Mayor in
charge of transport, the City Transport Department, the City Architectural Department, and
the City Council). Two Transport Department officials were assigned to work with the
Consultant as required in the study terms of reference. The Consultant interviewed all 32
employees of the Transport Department to assess their capabilities. The Patrol Police have
provided the consultants access to accident records which were plotted geographically. Focus
groups were interviewed and the findings recorded. The Consultant prepared seven technical
reports in addition to regular monthly reports: (a) Inception Report; (b) Functions and
Responsibilities of Tbilisi Transport Department; (c) Parking Management Policy and
Preliminary Implementation Program; (d) Preliminary Urban Transport Strategy; (e) A 5 Year
Transport Investment Program, f) A 2 Year Traffic Circulation Improvement Program; and g)
ToR and Bidding Materials for A Parking Scheme under Public-Private Partnership.


Box 1: Example of Successful TA at the Local Level with Impacts Exceeding Expectations

Addressing the Parking Problem in Tbilisi- TA under component 1, Institutional Strengthening:

Tbilisi has a serious parking problem. There is a shortage of legal on street parking places and almost
no off street parking lots in the central area of the city. This shortage, combined with lack of
enforcement, has resulted in illegal parking with consequent blocking of intersections, sidewalks, and
travel lanes. This has in turn adversely affected travel speeds and pedestrian safety. Moreover revenue
to the city has been relatively low due to low parking fees and poor collection practices.

To address these shortcomings, Tbilisi city officials, with the assistance of an international consulting
firm, has prepared an on-street parking policy and is in the process of implementing a parking program
that features a 15 year concession to a single parking system concessionaire selected on a competitive
basis. The selected concessionaire will finance, build, operate, enforce and maintain the parking
infrastructure and equipment for the entire concession period. The concessionaire will pay the city 60%
of the gross proceeds from parking and violation fees.

It is estimated that city income will initially amount to at least $2.7 million annually and this figure is
expected to substantially increase over time as more parking spaces are included under the concession
agreement. More specifically, the concessionaire is expected to initially invest approximately $5
million in signage, pavement and curb marking, Pay & Display machines, cellular parking, electronic
in-vehicle meters, enforcement vehicles and equipment to operate a 15,000 parking space system and a
fully transparent and comprehensive billing system that can be monitored on-line and real time by city
officials. The average charge per space will be approximately $0.50 equivalent per hour. Parking fees
will be collected by means of a cashless system featuring pay and display parking meters, cellular
parking, in-vehicle electronic meters operating on smart cards. Assuming only 300 hours of chargeable
operation per year, the total revenue collected per parking space per year is expected to be
approximately $300 including parking charges and fines.

To permit this innovative scheme to be implemented both national and city level laws had to be
changed. The concession agreement is structured to take into account both the interests of the city and
that of the private sector concessionaire, and is flexible to permit changes throughout the concession
period. The concessionaire prepares detailed parking plans which are annually updated subject to city
approval. Since there is a revenue sharing arrangement, there is a mutual interest on both sides in the
partnership to make the system work. The concessionaire was selected primarily on the basis of the
share of parking revenues and fines going to the city, but the technical proposals and qualifications of
the candidate concessionaires were also considered.


                                                    46

This innovative scheme deserves careful observation and assessment of lessons learned as it proceeds
into implementation for possible replication in other cities. There are few other municipal initiatives
that are able to address a serious problem, provide a potentially significant revenue source for the city,
and require virtually no city investment.



Management of public services:
The MDF also funded the preparation of several detailed engineering designs for the
rehabilitation works, as follows:

Preparation of detailed engineering design for urgent rehabilitation of the Tbilisi water
supply system. The Consultants prepared the design for the following projects:

     · Rehabilitation of the pipeline at the crossing of the Tedzami and the Aragvi rivers

Preparation of Detailed Design of Rustavi Water Supply Headwork and Mains
The objective of this assignment was to prepare the detailed engineering design of Rustavi
Water Supply Headwork and Mains.


(b) National institutional development.
 The MDF was extensively involved in coordinating donors efforts involved in local
government support in Georgia.

Advisor to Ministry of Finance
An International Advisor to MoF was selected through competitive process who worked in
Tbilisi during the period 2003-2004. The primary objective of the consulting service was to: i)
understand the basic underpinnings for local government revenues in light of the 2004
Georgian Tax Code and the draft Local Budget Law; ii) prepare a draft set of
recommendations for policy development in the field on intergovernmental fiscal relations;
and iii) present an action plan for a local government data analysis. This review was
undertaken in a series of steps. A series of recommendations were developed to assist in
designing the technical approach. In June 2004, MoF officials asked the Advisor to assist in
the redrafting of the Local Budget Law. A draft Local Budget Law was completed in
consultation with MDF, USAID (Urban Institute), Council of Europe, GTZ, Association of


                                                  47

Young Economists, the Commission for Effective Governance and Territorial Arrangement
Reform, and sent to the MoF in July 2004. An advanced draft of this law was later presented
by MoF and adopted by the Parliament in 2006. The final report of the Advisor was submitted
to MoF in August 2004.

Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Consultant
Since the local budgets law was supposed to include an equalization system, MDF hired
through ICB process a Consultant who worked closely with MoF, its Advisor and other
stakeholders to design the scheme. The Consultant delivered a final report in September 2004,
which a) discussed the policy context in Georgia and the constraints faced in the design of an
equalization grant; b) analyzed the desirable properties and structure of the equalization grant,
with the discussion of several technical issues relegated to an appendix; c) proposed a
concrete system with a formula and funding rule, and it provides a range of simulations for
the impact the new equalization grant system would have in Georgia using data for 2003 as
the benchmark; and d) recommended the next steps in the full development of an equalization
grant system for Georgia. The proposed system formed the first foundation of equalization in
Georgia, stimulated debate, and a formula was included in the local budgets law. An
amendment to the equalization system was further made in 2007 after the amalgamation of
LSGs.

Minimum Qualification Requirements
The State Commission for Effective Governance and Territorial Arrangement Reform
requested to prepare and define the Minimum Required Qualification Criteria for the Public
Servants in Local Governments. Assignment was completed and the materials were handed
over to the State Commission. Based on these materials the Commission would develop the
required minimum training package for the Public Servants in Local Government


II. Investment projects-Physical investments

The GOG rates physical investments component as satisfactory. The MDDPII financed
investments in nine municipalities: Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi, Poti, Rustavi, Samtredia,
Zestaphoni, Ozurgeti, Gori; 40 Investment Projects have already been completed (Tbilisi ­ 21
projects, Poti ­ 3, Rustavi ­ 3, Zestaphoni ­ 1, Kutaisi ­ 6, Batumi ­ 3, Samtredia -1 project,
Gori ­ 1 project, Ozurgeti ­ 1 project ). The total cost of these projects amounts GEL 57.831
million. As mentioned above, the preparation and implementation of subproject investments
started in the spring of 2003. There were no delays in preparation and implementation of
subprojects. The LSGU eligible for a loan from the MDF had borrowing capacity and their
own revenue sources. The consultant prepared 28 feasibility studies and submitted to the
MDF, it was fulfilled on a substantial degree.

A total of 40 investment projects were financed and implemented by the MDF in nine
municipalities. About 55% for water supply projects, 41% of investment funding was used for
urban road rehabilitation projects, and about 11% for the Lighting projects. Urban road
projects dealt exclusively with the rehabilitation of existing urban roads in Tbilisi, Batumi,
Kutaisi, Zestaphoni, Poti, Samtredia and Rustavi. Water supply projects included water main
and sewerage network repair works in Tbilisi, and rehabilitation of distribution networks,
installing meters and pumping installations in Gori (second stage), rehabilitation of
distribution networks of Rustavi, Batumi water supply system had gate rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation of lighting networks in Tbilisi.

Benefits of urban road rehabilitation and light network projects are more difficult to assess
but are considered substantial. Road rehabilitation benefited roads that had deteriorated to a
point where vehicle transit, especially for public transport, had become virtually impossible
thereby imposing severe hardship on the residents, especially those of outlying and frequently
poorer neighborhoods. Rehabilitation of the damaged road enhanced the road capacity.


                                               48

Provision of complete and high quality lighting. Creation of convenient conditions for safe
traffic flow.
The water supply projects financed by the MDF had visible positive results. In Gori, the
construction of new wells and the installation of a new gravity fed supply line provided a
reliable and permanent water delivery to inhabitants who previously had only intermittent or
no access to running water at all.

Provision of reliable water supply for Tbilisi City, Improved quality of potable water supplied
to the City. Protection of water supply facilities against raised water level in the river Aragvi.
Number of people who benefited from safer roads and water supply, and quality lighting is in
the range of many hundred thousands.

4. Assessment of Objectives

In its principles, the MDDPII responded to issues on the Government's agenda and addressed
problems that were - and still are - of real need. However, decentralization and local
government development, especially in a country with no previous tradition in this area, is
necessarily a lengthy and complex process. Immediate results should not be expected and a
sustained long-term support is essential for achieving lasting results. Primarily for this reason,
the Bank agreed to have the MDDP followed by a second operation, MDDP II

The implementation of the MDDP II had no difficulties at the staring stages but one of Major
factors affecting implementation of MDDP II was the government crisis and shuffles during
November 2, 2003 pre-election period and immediately after Rose Revolution that delayed
the implementation of Fund's activities. These major developments on countries' political
arena caused slow down of project implementation. Difficulty MDF encountered during the
first half of 2006 when there was the drastic rise in construction material prices due to the
booming construction industry. Nevertheless, these problems did not substantially hinder the
implementation of most of the projects. In itself, the concept of the MDDPII was attractive. It
promoted performance-based lending to municipalities as a way to leverage institutional
reform at local level. The project was well-adapted to the political, institutional and social
realities of the country. The project design was complex and relied on assumptions on the
actual institutional, financial and technical capacities of both the Government and the
participating municipalities. The concept of the DAs as a legally binding agreement between
the Government and the participating municipalities was approved by the Georgian
authorities. An assessment of the actual financial capacity of the major municipalities and
potential project beneficiaries was carried out. To effectively protect MDF against possible
defaults on loan repayments by participating municipalities there was put a mechanism of
paying a fine.

Institutional development impact:
After the assessment of the current status of the local government reform in Georgia, it is not
difficult to determine to what extent the MDDPII had a specific and critical institutional
development impact on the local government system as a whole. The institutional
development component expanded the market of potential borrowers by assisting LGUs to
meet the eligibility criteria by strengthening local management, especially financial
management, and improved revenue collection. The component supported further
development of the national local government framework by incorporating project experience
at the local level. The component was needed for the LGUs to demonstrate sound financial
capacity, including the ability to incur and repay debt by meeting objective criteria.

An additional assurance for quality was achieved through very active participation in project
identification and formulation and monitoring of works by LGU's. In line with recent changes
in the country LGU's showed more ownership to the projects which they were co-financing.


                                               49

Although technical capacity to prepare the project is still low in LGU, the attitude towards the
investments has substantially changed. Projects before their submission to MDF were widely
discussed in local assembly's (Sakrebulos), and based on the political support LGU's were
allocating financial resources for co-financing. The political and financial responsibility has
resulted in more adequate follow up of LGU's on the performance of the project. MDF
supported the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance in developing a sub national
fiscal database and IT and human capacity for collection, aggregation and analysis of local
government data for forecasting, policy development and impact assessment purposes. MDF
assisted in the implementation of a computerized budgeting system including training,
software and hardware supply to a selected number of prospective LSGs. 91 computer work
stations (86 for LSGs and 5 for the Ministry of Finance's Budget Department) were procured
under the contract with supplier Elite Computers. The consultant has designed the software
and piloted it in Rustavi municipality. This activity was closely coordinated with the Urban
Institute which under USAID funding was providing assistance to municipalities in local
budget planning and accounting.

6. Government Ownership and Stakeholder Involvement:

In its principles, the MDDPII responded to the Government's development priorities. It
coincided with the aims of the State Program for Municipal Development and its concept was
fully supported by the Government. Government involvement with the World Bank in the
design of specific features of the project and implementation arrangements was significant.
An additional assurance for quality was achieved through very active participation in project
identification and formulation and monitoring of works by LGU's. In line with recent changes
in the country, LGU's showed more ownership to the projects which they were co-financing.
Likewise stakeholder involvement was substantial. Under these circumstances, MDF
organized several workshops to explain the project concept to these municipalities, a true
commitment and ownership was not difficult to obtain.

7. Project Administrative Structure & Implementing Agency:

The MDF ­ which was in charge of part of MDDP I ­ was restructured before MDDPII
started. The restructuring of previous implementation arrangements addressed a series of
issues that emerged from the implementation of the MDDP I. It took into account the main
lessons learned: (i) dividing the responsibility for project implementation between two
different agencies reporting to two different parts of the government was a source of conflicts
and inefficiencies; (ii) technical assistance had been closely linked to, and complementary of,
investment activities at the local government level; and (iii) the project required close
coordination with other government agencies involved in local government issues, as well as
with the members of the donor community active in this area.

The MDF of Georgia is a legal entity of public law, the objective of which is to support
strengthening institutional and financial capacity of local government units, investing
financial resources in local infrastructure and services, improving on sustainable basis the
primary economic and social services for the local population (communities), developing
renewable energy (midget power plants and geothermal) sources, creating sustainable
economic basis for refugees, rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems.

For this purpose, the MDF cooperates with the local self-government units and population,
mobilizes financial resources from the international organizations, donor agencies and foreign
countries, central and local governments and other organizations. In its work, the MDF acts
according to the Legislation of Georgia, Agreements signed by Georgia with international
financial organizations and other donors. Coordination and management of the MDF
activities is conducted by the Supervisory Board appointed by the Decree of the Government
of Georgia. The Fund is accountable to the Government of Georgia, Supervisory Board of the


                                                50

Fund and Ministry of Finance of Georgia. With the purpose of better coordination and
improvement of social investments implementation, the Government decided in 2005 to
integrate Georgia Social Investment Fund and Irrigation and Drainage Community
Development Fund in 2006 into the MDF. The MDF itself is managed by an Executive
Director. Such kind of changes had positive and effective impact on the projects
implementation.

The MDF increased its range of responsibilities, including the management of other projects
financed not only by the World Bank, but by the EBRD and MCG. Its institutional capacity is
very successful, so GOG determined the strategic future and role of MDF as a semi-
autonomous financial intermediary project implementing agency under the oversight of the
Supervisory Board, which will continue to lend to creditworthy LSGs as well as pay for its
own operational coast.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
There were no significant problems in the areas of procurement and financial management,
Monitoring of implementation progress, physical results, and development outcomes of the
project. The MDF tried to solve against defaults on loan repayments.

Factors generally subject to government control:
While at the time of project start up in country was political stability, but the economy in
Georgia remained in a precarious state. In 1998, when Georgia joined the Council of Europe,
it expressed its willingness for decentralization of the state power and inculcation of local
self-government in the country. Accordingly, the country's government assumed the
obligation to ratify the European Charter of Local Self-Government and hold local elections.
In spite of the fact that local elections were held twice, an effective local self-government in
Georgia has not been formed. Small and powerless local government units being short of
resources were unable to provide for solving the local problems and had been gradually losing
their popularity among the population. By 2004 Georgia's local self-government system was
in a deep crisis. The scope of qualified personnel's outflow became catastrophic; the local
self-government bodies lost their autonomy and found themselves under the dictate of the
central government. The country's government that came to power after "The Revolution of
Roses" started the reform in July 2004 with setting up the Commission on Decentralization
and Effective Administration, as well as ratification of the European Charter of Local Self-
Government.

In July 2004, several very important laws (the new organic law, the laws on a self-
government unit's property, budget and state supervision) were adopted. The new Law on
Budgets of Local Self-Government Units was adopted in June 2006 which provided for
equalization of local budgets based on objective formula. The equalization was applied to
2007 budget which ensures a more objective allocation of resources between the local self-
government units. Building up a new Georgian state and shifting of national economy to
market-based relations created appropriate conditions that gave rise to starting successive
reforms in municipal sector.

Costs and financing:
The total original cost of the project was $30.9 million. The IDA contribution was $19.4
million (SDR 15.4 million) the Government ($0.54 million), MDF ($5.45 million) and the
participating municipalities ($5.5 million). At the date of ICR preparation the project fully
disbursed $24.73 million IDA credit and the total project cost was $39.86 million. Local
counterpart funding was made available by the Government in a timely and adequate manner
Funding by participating municipalities was provided in accordance with agreements. All
audits were carried out in time and were qualified.

8. Sustainability


                                               51

The institutional framework for municipal development formed under MDDPII, in order to
provide for the further strengthening of the results achieved i.e. make the results further
sustainable, it would be necessary to resume working with the local government entities in
several issues of the institutional component, including further supporting the development of
sustainable, effective system of trainings; facilitating a more comprehensive application of
information systems in daily practice; providing information and incentives (in several
forms) to municipalities to help them gain more experience on several matters of municipal
management to then apply the knowledge gained effectively to work etc.

As for sustainability of the physical investments made, MDF was closely monitoring and took
the responsibility for the state of the physical investments during the defects liability period,
when the contractors were responsible for the proper functioning of roads, water supply
systems, etc. Only after the completion of the defects liability period MDF was transferring
the physical investments to the beneficiary municipalities. It should be mentioned that MDF
included the clause on the requirement of the maintenance and current repairs expenses to be
included in the local budgets. All projects financed by the MDF under the MDDPII in the
participating municipalities were handed over upon completion to the municipal authorities or
their utilities for regular operation and maintenance. Guaranteeing the future availability of
budgetary resources for satisfactory maintenance was a precondition that participating
municipalities had to fulfill in order to obtain a loan from the MDF. Similarly, identifying
and taking the necessary steps to improve their financial situation and ultimately achieve their
financial autonomy was a precondition for utilities to become eligible for the financing of
sub-projects. The risks for the sustainability of the infrastructure might be: The unsatisfactory
operation of the facility; the abuse of the facility; lack of the operational expenditures and
unsatisfactory execution of the sustainability plan.

The ICR rates the sustainability of the MDDPII as likely.

        capital;
    · Rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure, including melioration system, via
        increasing the role of private sector.

Regarding the MDDP II, the concept for a follow-on project is under preparation. GOG has
requested an allocation of $30 million from the IDA and IBRD for this project. The
counterpart funding and coordinated inputs from MDF and LSGs may value at about $48
million in total. The goal of the project would be i) strengthening the capacities of selected
local government to provide adequate public services to their constituents through financing
rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure, along with development and implementation of
plans for sustaining services; ii) continue and expend support to MDF to administer and
coordinate financial and technical assistance to local governments within the context of on
going program in Georgia is support of effective local government and territorial reforms.
