MEORANDUM AND RECOMiMNDATION OF TE1 PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PONDO VIAL NACIONAL
WITH THE GUAANTEE OF THE REPJBLIC OF COLO!.IA
FOR TIlHMRD RATIONAL ROADS IECT   PROJECT
I'        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$266.0 million equivalent to the Pondo Vial Nacional (National Highway
Fund), with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia, is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, including five
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help
finance the Third National Roads Sector Project.
2.        Sector Background.  Colombia, with an area of about 1.1 million
square kilometers, and a population of 33 million, enjoys access to both the
Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. This advantage, however, is offset by
the difficulty of movements between the coastal zone and the interior. The
three massive ranges ef the Andean mountains, running two thirde the length of
the country, present a serious obstacle to communications. In addition,
average hauls are large; the distance from the capital Bogot& to the Atlantic
ports is about 1,000 km. Consequently, land transport costs are high. The
recent report on the role of Transport in International Trade (8900-CO,
November 1990) has shown that transport costs constitute 301 of the Import
price of wheat and as -high as 70S of the export price of coal.
3.        Colombia has now developed an extensive road network consisting of
112,000 km, of which the national network accounts for about 26,300 km. The
latter includes about 10,800 km (412) of paved roads and 15,500 km of unpaved
roads. Of the total national network, about 61 of the paved roads and 22Z of
the unpaved roads are classified as in bad condition. The proposed project
includes rehabilitation of a large part of these roads. Colombia has about
1,400 km of navigable waterways of which the most important is the Magdalena
River. General cargo on this river has been declining steadily, reflecting in
part the restriction of navigation to the wet season; this issue will be
addressed by the proposed project.
4.        The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT) is directly
responsible for the planning, construction and maintenance of the country's
national highway network (26,300 km). An autonomous national agency, the
National Fund for Rural Roads, is responsible for rural road construction,
improvement and maintenance over a network of 46,500 km. In addition,
secondary (departmental) roads (39,200 km) are under the jurisdiction of the
autonomous regional entities ("departments"). The Government is considering
the transfer of a major part of the national road network to the Departments.
Given the high variation in the Departments' capacity to manage and maintain
the roads already under their jurisdiction, any transfer of additional roads,
labor, equipment and financial resources requires careful study and planning;
otherwise, the risk is high that the quality of the network as a whole will
deteriorate rapidly. This issue is being addressed by the Project through a
detailed study to be followed by an agreement between the Bank and MOPT on the
modalities of the decentralization process.

5.        The quality of MOPT engineers is adequate. However, lack of up-to-
date standards and guidelines have resulted in highly variable quality of
pro3ect preparation and consequent need to change project design during
execution, tine delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, MOPT has often over-
programed its reawurces, which led to lack of counterpart funds and
consequent delays in completion of works. The proposed project includes
various mectan1sms to improve project programming and quality of engineering
studies.
6.        Maintenance of the national road system is the responsibility of
the MOPT. Allocation for road maintenance has generally been in line with
requirements. About 301 of all maintenance service is contracted out to
private contractors (compared to 13S in 1987), reflecting the Government's
emphasis on contracting out services to the extent possible.  This share will
grow to over 331 under the proposed project. In addition, over 151 of
maintenance work will be contracted to small cooperatives (micro-enterprises)
of 10-15 workers, who have proved very effective in the past. While the
overall allocation for road maintenance has been reasonable, there is lack of
detailed planning of such maintenance activities. Efforts were made in prior
loans to systematize maintenance planning including preparation of a pavement
and equipment management system in three pilot districts. The design of these
systems has been completed, but has not been implemented at the field level
because of lack of management com-tment. During preparation of the proposed
project, a Five Year (1991-95) Maintenance Plan was prepared by MOPT staff
under Bank guidance and with full support of MOPT's management. The proposed
project includes technical assistance to update the existing data base, train
DOPT otaff, and implement the new system in the field.
7.        Transport regulations are in general satisfactory.  The trucking
sector is efficient, entry into the sector is not restricted, and the
Goverment does not interfere in setting tariff rates. The decree setting out
limits on axle loads is satisfactory and its enforcement is being strengthened
under an on-going project. Imports of vehicles, which have been restricted
for many years, were fully liberalized in 1991.
8.        Gasoline and diesel prices, which were priced in mid-1991 at
US$0.59 per gallon, were raised in January 1992 by 261, bringing them to a
level of US$0.72 per gallon, above the border price level of US$0.67. The
Government bas further committed itself to maintain the average price level of
gasoline and diesel at least equal to the border price level plus distribution
costs. However, even after the recent price increase, road user charges
(taxes on fuel, road tolls, registration fees, differential duties, etc.)
would cover only 621 of all economic costs of carrying the existing public
road network (i.e. maintenance, rehabilitation and improvements). This is
caused by the fact that, while the total fuel tax per gallon is about US$0.19,
only the differance between the retail price and the international price level
(US$0.05) can be considered an economic tax. It is estimated that a tax of
US$0.12 above the international price level is needed to bring road user costs
and charges into balance in the absence of any real increase in other charp"s.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that road user charges will be
raised in stages as to cover 1001 of road costs by 1994.

9*        Ratlonale for Bank Involvegent.  The project is an integral part of
Bank support for the Government's strategy to open the economy to
international competition and to make more efficient use of economic assets.
This objective is being pursued at the level of macroeconomic and sectoral
policy through a coherent eet of reforms of the trade regime, financial,
industrial, transport and power sectors. The Bank is supporting this strategy
of "aiertura" through a series of operations including the recently approved
Public Sector Reform Loan, Industrial Restructuring Project, and others under
preparation.  The proposed project will further this strategy by providing
part of the infrastructure needed to support the export drive and by reducing
transport costs through bettfsr maintenance and rehabilitation. At the same
time, it aims to correct the institutional weaknesses observed under the past
Bank loans in investment proparation, programming and budgetary control.
10.       Under the ongoing Secend National Highways Sector Project (Loan
2829-CO), a major effort was put into paving sections of a north-south highway
corridor linking BogotA and other major population centers with the Atlantic
ports of Santa Marta and Cartagena. The proposed project will finance the
completion of this corridor, which will replace the existing mountain route
and reduce transport costs by about 301. As a second priority, works will
continue on a second north-south corridor connecting Medellin and Popayan, two
important centers, with the Atlantic ports, and on providing improved linkages
between other production and population centers with these two north-south
corridors.
11.       The experience under the Second National Highways Sector Project
has been mixed. While major progress has been achieved in terms of physical
execution and improving management information, some institutional objectives
have not been fully achieved. First, while the design of the road maintenance
system has been completed, it has not been implemented in the field. Second,
programming of project implementation was deficient and resulted in
overcoamitment of resources and consequent delays and costs overruns. Third,
the quality of project engineering was inconsistent, requiring changes in
design during project execution. The proposed project addresses these issues
by introducing a rolling five-year investment plan and a five-year revenue and
expenditure plan which will be updated twice a year under Bank supervision.
It will assure adequacy of financial resources for the implementation of the
approved subprojects. Also, a manual for engineering design and agreed
standards for pavement structures and road geometric design will improve the
quality of engineering preparation work.
12.       The project will assist in the decentralization of the national
road system from the planning stage through implementation and the
restructuring of NOPT based on studies to be financed by the project and by
the Public Sector Reform Loan., The Bank's involvement will ensure efficient
pricing of petroleum products and adequacy of user charges. Finally, the
Dank's financing will result, for the first time, in a direct supervisory role
for the central Government over the execution of a project by MOPT.
13.       Proiect Ob1ectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) reduce the transport cost of freight, especially long-distance import and



-4-
export traffic; (b) improve the quality of project preparation by MOPT and its
consultantss (c) improve road maintenance planning and practices; (d) improve
project planning and execution and reduce construction costs; (e) assist MOPT
in the process of decentralization of the national road system and in its own
restructurings and (f) improve the environmental management of MOPT.
14.       Proiect DesctIgtion.  The project finances a share of the Five-esar
1991-95 Highway Investment Plan including: (i) completion of about 2,000 Im of
roads started either under the prior Bank loan or with MOPT's own resources;
(ii) construction and rehabilitation of twelve high-priority new road projects
totalling about 400 kkm; (iii) a bridge rehabilitation program; (iv) a program
of river training and dredging and river port improvement; (v) purchases and
rehabilitation of road maintenance equipment; (vi) road safety works; and
(vii) technical assistance, studies and training in the areas of management
and operations, road engineering, road maintenance, management information and
environmental control.
15.       Imnlementatign Arran_ements.   The proposed loan would be made to
the National Highway Fund (FyI). PVN is an autonomous legal entity, which is
able to contract financial obligations and finances the construction,
maintenance and supervision tasks carried out by MOPT. Preparation and
execution of specific project components will be carried out by MOPT's various
directorates as follows: Highways Directorate for the roads and bridges civil
works, the planning and execution of the road maintenance 7rogram and the
supervision of technical studies and assistance; Directorate of Navigation and
Ports for the river dredging and river port improvement component;
Subdirectorate of Equipment for purchase and rehabilitation of equipment;
Office of Planning for supervision of economic studies and related technical
assistance; and Directorate of Industrial Relations for the training program.
Overall project coordiuation and follow-up will be done by a newly formed
Project Implementation Unit in MOPT. Environmental control will be provided
by a new Environmental Unit within MOPT. All civil works and their
supervision will be carried out by contract. The procurement methods and the
proposed allocation of loan proceeds are attached in Schedule B. Government's
352 contribution to the program will serve as counterpart funds; it will be
fully documented and monitored as an integral part of the project.
Retroactive financing, up to a total of US$18.7 million, is recommended for
payments made after September 1, 1991 but before the date of loan signature,
for ongoing road civil works and for consultants. A Special Account will be
established in Banco de la Rep6blica with an initial deposit of US$15 million.
MOFT will contract private external auditors to audit project expenditure, the
Special Account and Statements of Expenditures.
16.       Environmental Impact.  All road projects that are proposed by the
MONP are subject to an environmental review by MOPT and the national
environmental agency-INDEUNA. However, MOP? staff has not been assigned full
time to this task and the environmental analysis has been done on an ad hoc
basis. During project preparation, agreement was reached on detailed terms of
reference for an environmental unit and its staffing plan. Purthermore, a
training program was designed for upgrading the quality of MOPT staff in
environmental management. In terms of specific project environmental issues,



only the river training and dredging work will require a full Impact
assessment study because of its potential impact on fisheries. Among the road
and bridge sub-projects (ongoing and now) only three roads and one bridge
require a more limited environmental analysis. These, as well as any new
project, will be subject to an environmental review and approved by INDERENA,
as required by Colombian law. No new sub-project w$.11 be approved by the Bank
without a satisfactory onvironmental evaluation.
17.       Aareed Actions. The main actions agreed with MOPT and the
Government during negotiations are: (i) a Performance Plan to be signed
between the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Department and MOPT,
whereby the first two, with the help of consultants, will supervise and
monitor the project based on an agreed set of quantitative indicators; (ii)
carrying out a study and zonsultations on the implementation of the national
road network decentralization; (iii) a five-year highway investment rlan snd
PNWl revenues and expenditures program and twice-yearly updating of these
plns;l (iv) a five-year road maintenance plan and its annual updating and
reorganization of the maintenance functions of MOPT; (v) approval by the Bank
of new sub-projects only if: (a) they satisfy economic and environmental
criteria; (b) PVN has sufficient funds to carry out the sub-projects according
to schedule; and (c) the Bank is satisfied with the overall execution of the
project; (vi) putting into effect new prequalification guidelines for civil
works' contractors; (vii) implementing a comprehensive river maintenance
program; (viii) maintaining the average retail price of gasoline and diesel
products at least equal to the average border price level plus distribution
costs of such productst and (ix) assuring that road user charges cover the
cost of maintaining and improving the total road network by 1994 and
thereafter (with interim targets for 1992 and 1993). The conditions for loan
effectiveness ares  (a) establishing a new Envirounental Unit within MOPT; and
(b) creating a Project Implementation Unit within MOPT to monitor and
4dminister the project.  The conditions for disbursement of the river works
are: (a) submission of an acceptable river maintenance program; and (b)
carrying out an environmental impact study of the river works and agree on
necessary mitigatory actions. The legal documents also provide for detailed
annual reviews in key project areas. In particular, the annual reviews will
cover the topics of road network decentralization, organizational
restructuring of MOPT, project physical progress, institutional strengthening,
environmental mitigatory actions, progress on road user charges, and the road
investment and maintenance programs and their corresponding financing plans.
The project also inclirdes a detailed action plan on technical and
institutional aspects.
18.       ProlectS  Senefits.  The project will result in substantial upgrading
of about 10  of the total national road network and a significant reduction in
vehicle operating costs and improved access to markets.  The river component
will improve navigation and allow year-around movement of export goods (mainly
coal and petroleum) and bulk imports along the Nagdalena River. The project
will improve the pricing efZiciency of gasoline and diesel and ensure that
road users pay the cost of maintaining and improving the road network. The
project will provide guidance to the road decentralization program, which has
been approved in principle by the Government. Other project benefits include
higher availability of road equipment, reduction in road maintenance cost,



-6-
upgrading the quality of engineering designs, and improving sector planning
snd budgetary control.
19.       irogect &iPk_.  There are three technical issues which present
project risks (a) failure to Improve the quality of engineering work could
cause design changes and cost overruns; (b) over-programming and deficient
supervision could lead to delays in project execution; and (c) the elimination
in July 1991 of earmarking of fuel taxes raises concerns regarding timely
availability of c-anterpart funding. The proposed project aims at minimizing
these risks by improving project preparation through the introduction of up-
to-date standards fov project design, guidelines for preparation of
engineering studies, a project supervision manual, and a rolling ftie-year
investment plan, which will be updated twice a year. No new subproject will
be approved unless it can be accommodated within the anticipated budget
allocation. The Performance Plan contract to be signed by MOPT and the
Government will install a tight supervision mechanism and increase the
probability of the project performing as s^heduled. As part of such plan, the
Government has agreed on simplified procedures for budg.tary transfers. Also,
detailed budget contributions have been agreed with the Government for
maintenance work required for the whole network. The fragile security
situation in the country presents another risk, because it could result in
interruption of works and inability to supervise and monitor works in the
field. Recent political changes are expected to reduce this risk.
20.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
