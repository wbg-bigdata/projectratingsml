(a) the provision of shelter services and related community
facilities for about 44,000 low income residents in Bamako;
(b) improvement of health and sanitary conditions in Bamako
(garbage collection, drainage, water supply and public lava-
tories); (c) provision of market facilities and financial
assistance to the informal sector, and promotion of local
building materials; (d) provision of essential water and
sanitation services to secondary cities (Mopti, Kayes and
Gao); (e) strengthening of the urban sector through the estab-
lishment of new institutions and the provision of outside
expertise; arid (f) an investment programming study for Bamako,
and a study to prepare a possible follow-up project. Some
75 percent of the total project cost would directly benefit
the urban poverty group.
Project Risk:  Project risks; relate to (a) institutional arrangements for
project execution, (b) cost recovery, and (c) conformity of
ultimate beneficiaries to the initial target population.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR AN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit for the equivalent of US$12 million on standard IDA terms to the
Republic of Mali to help finance a proposed urban development project.
US$6 million of the proceeds of the credit would be relent to the District
of Bamako and the Municipality of Mopti for 23 years, including 3 years
of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled an "Economic Memorandum on Mali" (1134a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive! Directors on January 5, 1978. The following
paragraphs are based on that report and the findings of subsequent staff
visits. Country data are ccontained in Annex I.
3.        With a population of about 6.3 million and a per capita GNP of
US$130 in 1.978 Mali is one cof the poorest countries of Africa and among the 29
least deve].oped countries identified by the United Nations. It is handicapped
by serious obstacles to development. The extreme variability of rainfall
causes sharp fluctuations in crop and livestock production. Access to foreign
markets is made difficult by its landlocked position and the long distances -
more than 1000 km - to the nearest seaports, Abidjan and Dakar.  Development
is also constrained by the substantial internal distances (the country covers
an area of 1.24 million km2) and by the shortage of skilled manpower and the
narrow domestic market for industrial products. About 90 percent of the popu-
lation depends for a livelihood on crop farming, animal husbandry, forestry
and fishing. Exports consist almost entirely of agricultural commodities and
livestock.
4.        Over the fifteen years following independence, economic growth has
barely kept: ahead of the growth of population.  During the 1960s, GDP in real
terms increased at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. During the drought
of the early seventies, GDP declined and Mali's problems were further aggra-
vated by international inflation, excessive credit expansion and growing
budget and balance of payments deficits. The Government has initiated action
to redress major financial imbalances through credit restraint, through some
reduction of the subsidy element in the prices of essential consumer goods,
fertilizers and agricultural !quipment, and through improved tax collection.
Good crop seasons in 1975, 1976 and 1977 facilitated the implementation of
these measures and contributed to an average annual growth rate for the 1970-77



-2-
period of 5 percent per year. In 1978, another drought year, Mali experienced
a 3 percent decline in GDP. However, as a result of a good 1978-79 crop season,
real growth in 1979 is expected to be around 5 percent.
The Drought Years: 1972-1974
5.        All economic sectors were in varying degrees affected by the drought
of 1972-1974, and the recovery of these sectors has followed different pat-
terns. The full extent of loss of human life resulting from the drought
is not known but it was particularly severe among nomadic groups and espe-
cially the young and elderly.  With respect to the cattle herd, estimated 5.5
million head in 1971, it was reduced by 15 to 20 percent.
6.        In an effort to maintain essential supplies at a sufficient level,
the Government resorted to large imports of cereals, only partly financed by
external aid, and to consumption subsidies. Thus cereal imports shot up from
64,000 tons in 1972 to 235,000 tons in 1974, and the resource gap widened to
nearly one-third of GDP in 1974. To finance losses incurred by state enter-
prises in charge of imports and sales of subsidized goods, growing amounts of
bank credit were used. The GDP deflator, reflecting subsidization through
officially controlled prices, increased at an annual rate of only around
5-6 percent between 1970 and 1974, although prices in the open market had
risen more steeply after the onset of the drought.  Because supplies of
exports were affected by the drought, export receipts did not increase as much
as the favorable world prices would have permitted, and the policy of price
containment and subsidization translated into very large external deficits.
These years, apart from imposing appalling human suffering on important
segments of the Malian population, left an unfortunate legacy on Mali's
public finances.
Uneven Recovery: 1975-1977
7.        Normal rainfall resumed in 1975, and real GDP increased by 12.7,
9.0 and 7.4 percent respectively for the following three years. The resource
gap was reduced from one-third of GDP in 1974 to 10 percent of GDP in 1977.
Over the same period, net foreign assets declined from minus MF 83.7 billion
to minus MF 92.4 billion (US$184 million). Public dissaving continued as
growth of revenues lagged behind rapidly rising expenditures, particularly
expenditure on personnel. The wage bill increased because of cost of living
adjustments and the policy of Government to serve as employer of last resort
of nationals who complete secondary or higher education. Current revenues did
increase significantly as a result of efforts to improve tax collection, but
not enough to keep pace with rapidly growing expenditures.  Nevertheless, the
current budget deficit decreased from MF 8.6 billion in 1975 to MF 5.8 billion
in 1977, or about 12 percent of total current revenues.
8.        In 1976 and 1977, improvement in GDP growth continued, largely as a
result of a good harvests, but also because of continued growth in the secondary
sector.



- 3 -
9.        Credit expansion in 1976 was reduced sharply from 1975 levels,
with an overall increase in outstanding indebtedness of the economy to deposit
banks amounting to about 20 percent, as compared with 47 percent growth rate
in 1975. However, it must be recognized that much of what is included under
"credit to the economy" in effect finances operating losses of public enter-
prises.  (When substantial improvements in indebtedness have taken place, such
as in 1976/77, they have largely been attributable to the export earnings of
SOMIEX, the state export monopoly.) At the beginning of 1975 the Central
Bank discount rate was raised from 3.5 to 6.0 percent with corresponding
increases in the whole set of borrowing and lending rates of deposit banks.
And a new banking law, providing for legal minimum cash reserve and liquidity
ratios has recently been promulgated. This took place within the framework of
a new monetary agreement with France in mid-1977. This agreement aims at
bringing about the conditions requisite for Mali's membership in the West
Africa Monetary Union by 1981, imposing a very restrictive credit policy on
the operations of the Central Bank, notably in establishing more stringent
conditions on rediscount facilities, thereby precluding the financing of
operating losses of state enterprises, one of the most persistent drains on
Mali's economy.
10.       During 1978, credit to the economy grew by nearly 25 percent, mainly
because of a sharp increase in seasonal credit to finance the larger 1978/79
crop, and also because of the substantial rise in non-seasonal credit to the
commercial and industrial sectors, the former largely for increased import
financing, and the latter to the state enterprise sector, often to finance
operating 'Losses. With respect to public finances, the 1978 current deficit
is estimated at MF 4.5 billion; including capital expenditures, the deficit
amounts to nearly MF 8.0 billion. As in the past, most of the increse was for
wages and salaries (9 percent).
11.       The 1978 current account balance registered a substantial decline
compared to 1977, moving from a surplus of US$12.8 million to a deficit of
US$74.5 million. In large part this came about because of a US$20 million
increase in cereals imports (about half of which was financed by foreign
grants), and a US$33 million drop in exports of cotton, due both to a sharp
drop in exlport unit values of cotton and a two-thirds drop in groundnuts
exports resulting from a sharp reduction in marketings of the latter crop.
On the capital account, net long-term capital flows increased by US$28
million in 1978, to a level of US$68.6 million, or almost six-fold since
1975, so that the overall deficit was only US$9.3 million, as compared with
US$51.6 million in 1975. Most of the deficit was financed by increases
in the operations account with the French Treasury, bringing it to an
operating balance of MF 35.7 billion.
Foreign capital and debt
12.       Public investment is mainly financed by foreign aid.  During most
of the sixties the USSR and the People's Republic of China were the most
important aid donors. At the end of 1975, they held in roughly equal pro-
portions nearly 57 percent of Mali's external public debt disbursed and



- 4 -
outstanding. Gross disbursements (grants and loans) from DAC sources
increased from US$24 million in 1969 to US$127 million in 1974. Roughly
60 percent came from bilateral sources (mainly France, United States, Germany
and Canada). Since the early seventies the amount of public aid received by
Mali has increased very rapidly and grants account for most of the increase.
13.       Mali's external public debt outstanding at the end of 1977 (exclud-
ing drawings on the operations account with the French treasury) was US$570.5
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$193.4 million. IDA's share in
the total amount disbursed and outstanding was 19.5 percent. Repayments of
principal and interest due in 1977 would have claimed more than a quarter of
foreign exchange earnings, but actual debt service payments have been small,
about 2 percent owing to the rescheduling since 1970 of Chinese, Russian and
some other debts. However, projections indicate that the actual debt service
ratio may go up to about 19 percent by 1980 unless some further rescheduling
of debt takes place,which is probable. In transactions with the IMF, Mali
drew SDR 5.0 million under the 1974 oil facility and obtained another credit
of SDR 3.99 million (in March 1976) under the 1975 oil facility. In addition,
Mali borrowed US$4.6 million from the IMF trust fund facility in January 1978.
Development prospects
14.       The return of more normal weather conditions in 1975 strengthened
the economy's short run position, at least through 1977. However, the poor
harvest of 1977/78 represented a set-back in Mali's development prospects
and, together with weaknesses in the export crop sector, may have retarded
some necessary improvements in Mali's economic management. In any event, over
the medium and long term Government must address two sets of interrelated
objectives. The first is to correct the profound financial imbalances that
have developed over the years, especially since the early seventies; the
second is to accelerate the pace of economic growth against a background
of minimal improvement in per capita income since 1960.
15.       Government began in 1975 to tackle some of its financial problems
and has been relatively successful in readjusting some key prices to more
realistic levels. Thus, incentives to agricultural production are stronger,
consumer prices more closely reflect economic costs, the burden of subsidies
has been somewhat alleviated and credit expansion has slowed since official
prices to producers and consumers have failed to keep pace with rising costs.
Reform of public enterprises is being undertaken, but is unavoidably a very
gradual task and much remains to be done, particularly in the area of cereals
marketing. The budget is still basically unbalanced, but Government is now
seriously reconsidering its employment policy with a view to make it more
selective so as to check the growth of current expenditure; yet this is
clearly a longer-term project.
16.       Prospects for real long-term growth are probably better than in
most other Sahelian countries. Agriculture has considerable potential for
expansion both in the south where rainfed agriculture meets relatively favor-
able conditIons and in the vast inland delta of the Niger river. The river



-5 -
also offers much potential for power development. Planned investment in new
capacity for cotton seed oil extraction, cotton textiles for export, and in
sugar production, together with increasing crop and livestock production, will
eventually strengthen the balance of payments. Mineral resources (iron ore,
phosphates) remain at present unexploited, but may offer interesting longer
term development possibilities.
17.       'Che Five-Year SociLal and Economic Development Plan (1974-1978)
gave priority to agriculture, water and power development, industries proces-
sing agricultural materials, and road transport.  The overall size of the
investment program is estimated at MF 543 billion (about US$1.2 billion).
Altogether MF 427 billion of- this total was expected to be realized during the
plan period; in mid-1977, the latest date for which data are available, total
investments realized amounted to MF 122 billion. The problem is more one of
implementation than financinig with continuing delays being encountered in
project preparation and execution, particularly at startup. Project financing,
on the other hand, is reasonably well advanced, with MF 429 billion having
been received or firmly committed. With regard to investments being under-
taken under the revised plan (revisions having been made in 1976 and 1977),
priority is currently being given to food crops, animal husbandry, minor
irrigation works and more efficient manufacturing activities.
18.       Despite the fact that economic performance since the drought has
been largely good, sustained and viable growth in the longer run depends
crucially on investments and policy measures that will strengthen the economy's
export base, particularly in cash crops.  Mali's capacity to finance new
investment, however, is severely constrained by the limited savings potential
resulting from the extremely low per capita income level, a situation reflected
in the Government's budget and further complicated by serious financial
difficulties particularly in the public enterprise sector. Borrowing on
conventional terms would add considerably to the burden of servicing an
already sizeable external debt. External aid, accordinglv, should be on soft
terms and should finance, besides foreign exchange outlays, a significant
proportion of local currency costs.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
19.       The proposed credit would be the Association's eighteenth operation
in Mali, which would bring total commitments of IDA funds to US$165.2 million.
US$84.9 million had been disbursed as of April 30, 1979. Of the seventeen
credits already approved, six have been for transport, eight for agriculture,
two for education and one for telecommunications. Agriculture represents the
largest share (48 percent) of past commitments followed by transportation (41
percent). Experience with ongoing operations has in general been satisfactory.
Notes on the execution of ongoing projects are set out in Annex II.
20.       The Bank Group's strategy in Mali is governed by the extreme poverty
of the country and the need to raise productivity in agriculture, on which



90 percent of the population depends for a livelihood. Thus major objectives
of Bank lending in Mali focus on the promotion of agricultural and rural
development and on the provision of adequate infrastructure facilities. Agri-
cultural and rural development projects cover most of the country's cultivable
area and benefit the majority of farm families. Basic infrastructure is
being developed with the assistance of IDA projects in road and railway con-
struction and maintenance, and in telecommunications. In education the focus
is on providing appropriate basic and secondary education and vocational
training. In the urban sector, the Bank's focus would be on providing low-
cost replicable urban services for a growing urban population.
PART ITT - THE URBAN SECTOR
21.       Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces accelerating
urban growth. Whereas Mali's population is increasing at 2.5 percent per
year, its urban population is growing at 4.5 percent annually. Nearly 14
percent of its 1978 population of 6.6 million was urban. Bamako, the capital
of the country, now has about 470,000 residents, or about half of the country's
urban population, and has been growing at about 8.7 percent per year since
1965. Bamako could reach 2 million by the year 2,000, nearly 5 times its
present size.
22.       Growth in Mali's secondary centers is also rapid.  While small
relative to Bamako, six urban areas with populations over 30,000 are growing
at 4.3 percent annually: Segou (72,000); Mopti (62,000); Sikasso (52,000);
Kayes (50,000); Gao (33,000) and Koutiala (30,000). Urbanization trends
indicate that these cities will at least double their population by the year
2000. Of the six cities, Government is particularly concerned about the role
of Mopti, Kayes and Gao in national economic development and has requested
that these cities be included, along with Bamako, in the first urban develop-
ment project.
Bamako Urban Environment
23.       A shortage of housing affects all income levels with the burden of
the shortfall on the poorer residents. Privately built housing in the formal
sector is only affordable by the higher income groups, and is not built in
sufficient numbers to meet the demand, intensifying speculation. The high
costs of imported building materials, particularly cement and corrugated
roofing, are deterrents to increasing the private housing stock. The Govern-
ment is seeking to remedy the situation by promoting the use of improved local
building materials.
24.       Deficient infrastructure services are a major problem.  Bamako's
residents are poorly served by the water system, and have only limited access
to potable water. The sewer system serves less than 10 percent of the popula-
tion, and the lack of sanitation facilities in many schools and market areas
constitute a considerable health hazard. Whereas Bamako's population produces



about 270,000 m3 of solid waste yearly, the Distri5t's maintenance office has
a solid waste collection capacity of only 90,000 m per year. Uncollected
waste is dumped either into the streets or into drainage ditches, accumulating
into mounds of garbage that breed a host of diseases. In addition, almost all
roads in Bamako are in very poor condition, which hampers even minimal collec-
tion of garbage. Storm water drainage is provided for by a well-conceived,
but poorly maintained network of lateral open ditches in the older sections of
the city; newer areas are not served at all. The poor condition of the
system, cotupled with the water disposal problem are major factors in the
deteriorating quality of the urban environment. One result is a high i-cidence
of malaria, which is the major cause of death among children under five.
25.       T'he urban poverty threshold for Mali is MF 30,000 (US$69) per
household per month. Approximately 40 percent of Bamako's households have
incomes below this level. Government and state enterprises dominate the urban
employment base, but the government payroll is severely burdened, and it is
unlikely that the public sector will increase rapidly enough to absorb the
growing numbers seeking income-earning opportunities in the city. In the
absence of a sizeable and vigorous formal private sector, the informal
sector, accounting for nearly 50 percent of total employment, represents a
potentially attractive, albeit limited area for employment growth.
Mopti, Kayes and Gao Urban Environment
26.       Sanitation is the most urgent problem facing Mopti, in a context of
extreme poverty and limited Government resources. The storm drainage network
serves only 30 percent of the city, contributing to severe flooding in the
rainy season. When the water level of the Bani River rises, the old and the
new parts of the city become two islands connected by a road strip. Solid
waste is not collected except in the commercial zone, forcing most of the
population to dispose of its; garbage outside the city limits or in low-lying
areas of the city, posing serious health problems when there is flooding.
There is no waterborne sewerage system, with most of the modern buildings
relying on septic tanks which are periodically but infrequently emptied by the
municipal sanitation service. The mud-brick houses use pit latrines.
27.       Inadequate water supply is a particularly serious problem in Kayes
and has been aggravated by recent breakdowns of the intake works. Nearly 15
percent of the town's population lives in the rapidly growing Ndi area, which
has no access to potable water.
28.       Gao, the capital of the 7th region, Mali's most arid zone, also
faces serious water supply problems. These are related to production as
well as distribution of water, problems which are heightened by a large influx
of temporary residents and cattle during the dry season. This temporary
migration doubles the town's population of 33,000. Only about 1/3 of the
residents have access to a piped water supply. The remainder is forced to
seek water at the few available wells in the town.

Government Responses to Urban Needs
29.       Given the projected level of urban growth, the extreme poverty, and
the difficulty to reverse these trends in the short term, Government faces a
major dilemma in responding to the needs of its urban population. It is
increasingly realizing that the urban sector cannot compete for scarce re-
sources with the countryside, but must support and promote productive growth
in the rural areas. Thus, it is willing to examine the issues of cost recovery
standards and the capacity to pay of its urban households. As a first step,
this project will explore low cost, replicable solutions to the provision of
urban services. Government has also acknowledged that public institutions
that are responsible for providing urban services face serious financial and
manpower problems, which must be solved if they are to be effectively respon-
sive to increasing demand. In this context, Government is undertaking several
actions which will assist the District of Bamako in meeting its responsibil-
ities. These include: (a) further elaboration and completion of a schematic
plan for the Bamako area; (b) revision of tenure legislation and elaboration
of a land management policy; and (c) a detailed review of the institutions in
the sector. With regard to urban services, project identification and prepa-
ration efforts are under way for urban roads, water supply and electricity.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       An IDA mission identified the project in 1976 and a feasibility
study was submitted in 1978. The project was appraised in October 1978.
Negotiations were held in Washington from May 7 to 14, 1979. The Mali
delegation was led by Mr. Sekou Ly, the Minister of Interior. The Appraisal
Report (No. 2444-MLI) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
Project Objectives
31.       The project would assist the Government in providing affordable
urban services, particularly shelter, water supply, garbage collection,
drainage, schools and health care to low income urban residents. To enable
replicability and maintenance of project components, cost recovery will be a
major goal.
32.       The specific objectives of the project will be to (a) provide
shelter services and related community facilities to meet about half of the
growth in demand for low income groups in Bamako, (b) improve health and
sanitary conditions in Bamako, (c) stimulate productive employment through
financial assistance to the informal sector and the promotion of local build-
ing materials, (d) provide essential water and sanitation services to secon-
dary cities, and (e) establish and strengthen institutions that deal with the
urban sector, particularly the Bamako regional Directorates of Habitat and
Taxes, the Land Management Agency and the District Housing Directorate and
Technical Services Directorate.



-9-
Project Description
33.       The proposed project, to be carried out over a three and one half
year period (1979-1983), consists of:
(a)  Shelter Services, Bamako:  (i) upgrading of the squatter
neighborhood of Ma,gnambougou through the provision of basic
infrastructure (water supply, drainage, roads), community
facilities (12 classrooms, a health center and a retail
market) for 22,000 people and home improvement loans to
plotholders; (ii) preparation and servicing of new lots
adjacent to the area being upgraded, and covering about
100 ha. Services include public water standpipes, drainage,
street lighting, roads and community facilities (12 class-
rooms and a retail market).
(b)  Improvement in municipal sanitary conditions, Bamako:  provi-
sion of vehicles and equipment for garbage collection, repair
and maintenance of drainage ditches, repair and extension of
the public standpipe system, and provision of public lavatories.
(c)  Assistance to the informal sector, Bamako:  provision of
retail market facilities; credit (workshop construction
and equipment loans) to artisans who are beneficiaries
of lots under the project; and promotion and development
of the use of local building materials.
(d)  Essential services in secondary cities:  provision of
equipment for sewage and garbage collection in Mopti
and improvements in water supply and distribution in
Gao and Kayes.
(e)  Advisory services for project implementation:  technical
assistance for: (i) the Project Unit; (ii) aerial surveys
to prepare cadastral survey for a new municipal tax system;
and (iii) auditing of project accounts.
(f)  Assistance to Institutions:  provision of vehicles, office
materials and equipment for the Project Unit, the Bamako
Land Management Agency (CAFOBA), and the Regional Director-
ate of Taxes and D)omain of the District of Bamako.
(g)  Studies:  provision of consultant services for:  (i) an
investment programming study for the District of Bamako;
and (ii) preparat:Lon of a possible further urban project.
Project Execution
34.        The Ministry of Interior would have overall responsibility for pro-
ject implenentation. A Project Unit would be established in the Minister's
office to coordinate, monitor and supervise project implementation. The Project
Director, who would be head of the unit, would report directly to the Minister



- 10 -
and would lead a team working in the various executing agencies (see para. 35).
In addition to local administrative staff, the Project Unit would be assisted
by six internationally recruited experts - an administrator, systems analyst,
municipal management expert, municipal engineer, mechanic and local building
materials expert (Section 3.01(b) and Schedule 4 of the Credit Agreement).
35.       Responsibilities for individual project components are summarized
below:
Executing Agency                               Component
1.   Minister of Interior                      Technical assistance.

- 11 -
36.       As part of the institution building effort under the project, a Land
Management Agency (CAFOBA) would be set up to manage all state owned land in
the Bamako region. It would be an autonomous agency under the tutelage of
the Ministry of Finance. The phased establishment of CAFOBA will be monitored
by the Project Unit (Section 3.03 and Schedule 5 of the Credit Agreement).
Technical Assistance
37.       Provisions have been made under the project for 313 man-months of
consultant services at an average cost of US$11,00 per month excluding con-
tigencies (salaries and related benefits are US$3,000 per month). Of these,
the Project Unit would utilize 228 man-months. The remaining 85 man-months
have been retained for the preparation of the studies mentioned in para. 33(g)
above (Section 3.06 and Schedule 1 of the Credit Agreement).
Allocation Procedures
38.       At present, the land in Magnambougou belongs to the State, but
it will be transferred to the District of Bamako before lots are allocated.
Residents in the upgrading area will be given 20-year leaseholds with option
to pu5chase. I4 the sites and services area, where lot sizes can range from
160 m to 500 m , the majority of lots would be allocated by lottery and
leased to beneficiaries for 20 years with a lease-purchase contract. Only
the largest lots (50 lots of 500 m2) would be sold freehold. The lease will
require that a house be erected on a lot and will specify the period within
which it should be built (one year) and that the beneficiary live on the
lot. Beneficiaries wishing to sell or transfer lots in the sites and services
area within the lease period will return the lots to the District Housing
Directorate and receive compensation for improvements made (cost of material
plus an imputed cost for labor). In case of default the Housing Directorate
would repossess lots and buildings (Section 3.02 and Schedule 6 of the Credit
Agreement, Schedule 1 of the Project Agreement).
Cost Recovery Arrangements
39.       The following principles of cost recovery would be applied to
the various elements of the project: (a) costs which are ordinarily recovered
through user charges or tariffs will be similarly recovered (e.g., primary
infrastruct:ure for water, electricity, markets); (b) urban services provided
by the Dist:rict will be recovered via special taxes (e.g., garbage collection,
street cleaning, water from standpipes); and (c) all site development related
costs (on-site infrastructure, building loans, design, engineering and super-
vision) are borne directly by beneficiaries. It is expected that 60 percent
of total project costs will be directly recovered. Unrecovered costs represent
mainly teclnical assistance and studies (30 percent) and primary infrastructure
(10 percent:). Lot charges in the sites and services area would vary in price
according to location, accessibility, size and form of tenure. Leasehold lots
would be sold at prices varying from slightly below cost to slightly above cost.
Freehold lots would be sold at market prices. Development costs are estimated



- 12 -
2
at US$3.20 per m . A downpayment of 10 percent would be required on leasehold
lots in the sites and services area. Beneficiaries would also be entitled to
a construction loan at 12 percent per annum over a maximum of 20 years.
Recovery of the costs of retail markets will be through stall fees based on
current market rates, which are sufficient to recover costs over ten years at
12 percent interest rate. Loans to artisans for construction of workshops and
to finance purchases of materials or small equipment and tools would be at 12
percent interest, repayable over ten years, for construction loans, and over
three years for materials and tools (Section 3.05 and Schedule 6 of the Credit
Agreement, Section 2.09 of the Project Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
40.       The total cost of the project including contingencies is estimated
at US$15.3 million. Taxes account for US$1.2 million. The proposed IDA
credit of US$12.0 million would finance 85 percent of project costs excluding
taxes and would cover 100 percent of estimated foreign exchange costs (US$7.3
million) ar.d 78 percent of local costs excluding taxes and land. The Government
would provide the balance of US$3.3 million or 20 percent of the total costs.
Government would make the proceeds of the IDA credit and its own contribution
available to the various executing agencies as loans (50 percent) or budget
allocations (grants). In addition to the Project Agreement between the
District of Bamako, the Municipality of Mopti and IDA, subsidiary loan
agreements would be entered into between Government and the District and
Mopti, respectively. Terms of the subsidiary loans will be 7.5 percent
interest repayable over 23 years including a 3-year grace period.  The sub-
sidiary loan agreements will cover all funds on-lent by Government, and which
relate mainla to the sites and services and upgrading components and to the
improvement rf municipal services.  The balance of project costs, which
relates to items for which costs are not normally recovered ,lirectly from
beneficiaries, e.g. technical assistance, studies, primary infrastructure,
health and educational facilities and water supply in Gao and Kayes would be
granted to exec.ting agencies by budgetary allocation (Sections 3.01 (c) - (e)
and 7.02 of the Credit Agreement).
4i.       To ensure prompt availability of counterpart funds, Government
would establish a fund of US$230,000 at the beginning of the project. It is
proposed that these funds be deposited in a special project account in the
name of the Project Unit as an additional condition of effectiveness of the
credit (Section 7.01(b) of the Credit Agreement).
Procurement
42.       Contracts for a total value of US$4.7 million will be let on
the basis of international competitive bidding, in accordances with IDA guide-
lines for the procurement of:
(a)  eq-ipment and vehicles for (i) improvement of municipal services
1c Bamako (US$1.5 million), (ii) municipal services in Mopti
(IJ3$0.2 million), (iii) water supply in Kayes (US$0.1 million),
and



- 13 -
(b) civil works for major contracts for (i) on-site infrastructure for
Magnambougou sites and services (US$1.4 million), (ii) on-site
infrastructure for Magnambougou upgrading, (US$1.0 million), and
(iii) off-site water supply for Magnambougou (US$0.5 million).
A margin of preference of 15 percent or the applicable customs duty, which-
ever is lower, will be applied to domestic bidders offering domestically
manufactured goods. Local contractors will be given a preference of 7.5
percent in the evaluation of tenders for civil works.
43.       Contracts totalling US$2.5 million, for civil works for municipal
services, community facilities, and secondary cities components, which would
not be attractive to foreign suppliers or contractors, and estimated to cost
less than the equivalent of US$400,000 each, would be procured on the basis of
local competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA. Small
equipment items costing less than US$50,000 each, which will not in the
aggregate total more than US$800,000 will be purchased after solicitation of
quotations from at least three suppliers. Labor for the clearing/repair of
drainage ditches, and repair of standpipes will be provided by the technical
services of the District.
Disbursement
44.       Disbursement of thie IDA credit will be made on the following basis:
(i) 70 percent of expenditures for civil works; (ii) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for equipment, vehicles and materials or 80 percent of local
expenditures; (iii) 100 percent of expenditures on loans to beneficiaries
for construction and on credits to artisans; and (iv) 100 percent of expendi-
tures for consultant and advisory services. Retroactive financing totalling
US$450,000 would cover costs relating to setting up the Project Unit. Dis-
bursements will be fully documented, except for loans to beneficiaries under
(iii) where disbursements will be against a certified statement of expendi-
tures for which the documentation will be retained by the executing agency.
These expenditures will be reflected in separate accounts which will be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association semi-annually
within six months of the endl of each semi-annual period. An advance of
US$240,000 from the Project Preparation Facility was made to prepare the
Project during 1978 and a further advance of US$240,000 was made to continue
project preparation for the rest of 1978 and in 1979. Both advances will be
refunded upon the effectiveness of the credit (Section 2.02(b) of the Credit
Agreement).
Benefits, ]?overty Impact ant Affordability
45.       The project would have an important demonstration effect, parti-
cularly with regard to: (i) cost recovery; (ii) least cost solutions for
services provided; (iii) the use of indigenous building materials; and (iv)
improvement of the tax base of the city. Direct benefits would arise from:
(a) the provision of low cost essential services in the upgrading and sites
and services areas; (b) the improvement of sanitary conditions in Bamako; (c)



- 14 -
employment generation in the artisan and building materials sectors; and (d)
the provision of improved water supply and sanitary conditions in secondary
cities. The cost recovery mechanisms described in paragraph 39 are expected
to generate surpluses to the District Housing Directorate (cumulative total
US$1 million by 1985) which would be used to finance similar projects in the
future (Schedule 1 of Project Agreement).
46.       The project is expected to have particular impact on the urban poor.
The shelter services component will benefit 32,000 of the estimated 100,000
urban poor in need of shelter services in Bamako. Approximately 80 percent of
beneficiaries in the sites and services area, and 60 percent of beneficiaries
in the upgrading area, are below the poverty level for urban households. The
improvement in municipal services will have a broad impact on the urban poor,
who represent about 50 percent of the beneficiaries from this component. An
estimated 75 percent of the total project cost would directly benefit the
urban poverty group in terms of goods and services. Of the credit amount of
US$12 million, urban poverty lending is 75 percent, or US$9 million.
47.       In the sites and services area the minimum lot option plus a con-
struction loan sufficient to self-build two rooms in banco (adobe) would be
affordable to about 85 percent of the population of Bamako. Total project
cost per household for all improvements averages US$710 in the upgrading area
and US$1,110 in the sites and services area. Per capita costs are US$88 and
US$138 respectively. Half of the beneficiaries would be selected from house-
holds with incomes between the 15th and 35th percentiles of income in Bamako,
and 85 percent of the beneficiaries would have incomes below the median city
income. For the lowest income groups no more than 18 percent of income would
need to be allocated for housing. Monthly payments for the upgrading area
would amount to about 7 percent of income, or 8 percent if a house improvement
loan is included. The smallest lot will be affordable by the 5th percentile.
The table below sets out cost and affordability under the project:

48.       A total of about 9100 jobs are expected to be generated in the
project areas by the assistance to the informal sector. The average incre-
mental cosi: per job is estimated at about US$760. This cost is below the
urban poveirty capital/labor threshold for Mali (US$900).
Rate of Reiturn
49.       The economic rates of return were calculated for upgraded, and sites
and service areas, using expected increases in rental values brought about
by the improvements made under the project. The sites and services component
would yield an estimated economic rate of return of 19 percent and the
upgrading component 26 percent. The combined economic rate of return of
both components, which represent 42 percent of project costs, would be 22
percent. Rates of return were not computed for other project components
due to difficulty in quantifEying their benefits.
Risks
50.       As the first urban development project in Mali, the project has
a number of features which ;are subject to risk, although Government has
expressed its commitment to these initiatives. Three main areas of risk can



- 16 -
be identified: (a) the institutional arrangements for project execution, (b)
cost recovery, and (c) con'ormity of the ultimate beneficiaries to the initial
target population.
51.       Regarding the institutional arrangements, the complexity and multi-
sectoral nature of the project will require efficient management and close
coordination among the different executing agencies. To reduce coordination
problems and to ensure efficient management, responsibility for the project
has been centralized under the Minister of Interior aided by a Project Unit
that will report directly to the Minister. It will be supported by appro-
priate technical assistance to strengthen the institutions involved in project
execution.
52.       The replicability of the project depends upon effective implementa-
tion of the cost recovery mechanism. The introduction of lot charges and
building loan repayments is relatively new to the population groups to be
served by the sites and services and upgrading components. Surveys and
discussions with project communities indicate, however, that beneficiaries
are prepared to pay for security of tenure and the provision of essential
services. The District Housing Directorate will have to work closely with the
local community to ensure recovery of costs. Failure to collect the proposed
taxes will result in lower standards of service, inability to meet debt
repayment obligations and a need for subsidies from the central Government.
The importance attached to the rapid introduction of the new taxes cannot
therefore be overemphasized. However, the risk is considered worth taking in
view of the expressed willingness to pay for improved services and the oppor-
tunity that the new taxes provide for reducing state subsidies to the urban
sector.
53.       As regards conformity of the ultimate beneficiaries to the initial
target population for the sites and services component, project design
reduces risks to an acceptable level by both (a) short, and (b) long-term
measures. (a) In the short-run - (i) site location (both social and spatial),
lot size, level of services and type of tenure, would be des:igned to respond
to needs of the low-income population and lots are not expect'ed to be taken up
by higher income groups; (ii) the proposed project will itself satisfy about
half of new land demand arising during execution; (b) In the long run the
institution building component proposed under the project will greatly assist
the Government in increasing the supply of urbanized land.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Mali
and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are

Credit 277-MLI       Mopti Rice Development Project.  US$9.5 million Credit of
January 6, 1972 (as amended on April 11p, 1975); Effective
Date: June 26, 1972; Closing Date: May 31, 1978 extended
to September 30, 1979.
Development in the first two years was hampered by the droughts of
1972/73 and 1973/74 which brought very low flood levels. In the following three
years development of irrigable areas, of yields, total production and marketed
production followed revised appraisal estimates fairly closely, but the project
experienced another year of exceptionally low flood levels and deficient rains
in 1977/78. On April 30, 1979, 98 percent of the Credit have been disbursed.
Arrangements have been made for a smooth transition to the Second Mopti Rice
Project.
Credit 321-MLI       Telecommunications Project.  US$3.6 million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: April 4, 1973; Closing
Date: July 1, 1976 extended to June 30, 1979.
Following substantial cost overruns and lack of financial resources
in the country, the Credit Agreement was amended in 1976 to execute the
project in two phases. The first phase is progressing satisfactorily and the
main project compcnents are nearing completion. The second phase could be
part of a future investment program. The General Manager has the situation
well in hand and the trend is encouraging for the fulfillment of the
institution-building objectives of the project. Financial performance
is expected to improve as capacity increases.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that th;y do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 383-1ILI      Second Highway Project.  US$17.8 million Credit of
May 23, L973 (as amended on June 12, 1975); Effective
Date: September 12, 1973; Closing Date: July 15, 1977
extended to July 15, 1979.
The Project consists of (a) reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou
(222 km) and Bamako-Bougouni (167 km) roads; (b) procurement of highway
equipment; (c) technical assistance to DPW; (d) preinvestment studies for
the Bamako-Kolokani road; and (e) a study of the trucking industry. Cost
overruns on the Bamako-Bougouni road limited USAID funds to reconstruction of
a bridge and some access roa,ds. All project components have been completed
except for reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou road which is expected to be
completed in July 1979.
Credit 420-MLI       First Education Project.  US$5.0 million Credit of
July 11, 1973; Effective Date: November 15, 1973
Closing 'Date: December 31, 1979.
The physical implementation of the project is about 14 months behind
schedule, mainly due to slow progress by contractors. Construction of the
Technical/Vocational Institute and three of the science blocks was completed
in December 1978; the remaining science blocks were completed in March 1979.
The programs of the Technical/Vocational Institute, designed to meet local
manpower needs, are being prepared with technical assistance financed under
the project and should be ready for the next academic year. The project is
well managed and is expected to be completed by the end of 1979, about one
year behind the appraisal estimate.
Credit 538-MLI       Livestock Project.  US$3.3 million Credit of
April 11, 1975; Effective Date: July 24, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project is a broad-based effort to improve livestock production
in Mali's fifth region and includes the management of a grazing scheme,
reinforcement of animal health services, development of stock watering facili-
ties, livestock markets, an abattoir and a trial station as well as a training
and functional literacy program and the preparation of a follow-up project.
Overall progress in project implementation has been disappointing. The grazing
scheme has not yet been inaugurated, the veterinary service has been neglected
and cost overruns have created doubt as to whether the objectives of the proj-
ect can be fully met. Actions are however being proposed to improve management
and redress the present sittuation.
Credit 599--MLI      Third Hi.ghway Project.  US$10.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project comprises (a) improvement of feeder roads; (b) execution
of backlog maintenance on paved roads; (c) procurement of spare parts and



ANNEX II
- 26 -                         Page 4
equipment for workshops ani the training center; and (d) technical assistance
and consulting services fo (i) the training center, (ii) a transport plan
study, and (iii) the detailed engineering for the Bamako-Bougouni road (167
km). Construction of feeder roads and the backlog maintenance program is
underway. All spare parts and equipment for the workshops and the training
center have been delivered. Courses at the training center are proceeding
regularly. The transport plan study began in April 1977 with the participa-
tion of Malian specialists.
Credit 669-MLI       Mali-Sud Agricultural Project.  US$15.5 million Credit
of December 23, 1976; Effective Date: September 13, 1977;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
The project was signed year-end 1976, but administrative reasons
delayed effectiveness until September 1977. For this reason capital invest-
ments and a number of specific project activities were delayed. However, the
project is now proceeding satisfactorily with production on target. Good use
has been made of technical assistance and management is competent.
Credit 713-MLI       Third Railway Project.  US$10.5 million Credit of
June 10, 1977; Effective Date: November 22, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Though a three month delay in effectiveness caused some slippage
in the start up of the Project, Government and the Railway have made excellent
progress. The efficiency shown by the Railway in implementation leads to
believe that the Project will be implemented smoothly. Contracts already
signed and quotations received remain within appraisal estimates. Thanks to
strict financial control, the Railway is achieving a better than expected
financial performance.
Credit 733-MLI       Second Education Project.  US$10.0 million Credit of
September 30, 1977; Effective Date: January 30, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The physical implementation of the project is about ten months
behind schedule, the site for the National Management Institute is not yet
decided, and the programs for the rural education centers and the livestock
technician training center are not yet completed. These programs will deter-
mine the type of construction needed. Implementation of the educational
components is progressing satisfactorily. Project management continues to be
satisfactory.
Credit 753-MLI       Mopti Rice II Project.  US$15.0 million Credit of
December 8, 1977; Effective Date: May 15, 1978;
Closing Date: November 30, 1983.
The project aims at the consolidation of the first project and
at moderate expansion of the cultivated area. Preparation of works is pro-
ceeding on schedtle, all contracts for works and services have been concluded
and technicel assistance is being recruited.

Credit 854-MLI       Office du Niger - Technical Assistance/Engineering
Project. US$4.5 million Credit of October 30,
1978; Effective Date: March 30, 1979; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982.
The project comprises a three-year program of technical assistance
and a pilot program of rehabilitation works. Other project components include
support for agriculcuka research and trial programs, an aerial photographic
survey, a socio-economic study of the settler population, an audit of the
Office du Niger accounts, and training scholarships for Malian engineers.
The project has recently become effective; however, equipment has already
been ordered and major technical asssistance contracts signed.
Credit 883-MLI       Forestry Project.  US$4.5 million Credit of May 25,
1979; Effective Date: August 23, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
The Credit was signed on May 25, 1979. It has not yet become
effective.
