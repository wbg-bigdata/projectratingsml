EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Volta River Authority (VRA) is constructing a new 161 KV Power Transmission line from
Prestea in the Western Region to Obuasi in the Ashanti Region in order to enhance the power
carrying capacity of the transmission network in the western segment of Ghana. This additional
line is required in order to provide stability in the whole transmission network which is currently
experiencing severe stresses on some major segments, even under normal operational
conditions
The project involves the delivery to site, erection, testing and commissioning of a 112 km 161 KV
transmission line, with a 112 km optic fibre conductor (OPGW) in place of one shield wire,
between Prestea and Obuasi. Minor civil works related to modifications at the Obuasi substation
and at Prestea substations to accommodate line terminations will be carried out. The project is to
be executed by ABB Solutions, Italy. Due to certain deviations along the route as a result of social
and technical consideration, the total distance of the transmission line is now 114.6 km.
In order to maintain control over the implementation of the project and also ensure that
commitments made in the project's EIS document are acted upon in a comprehensive and
acceptable manner, an Environmental Management Plan [EMP] has been developed.
The EMP identifies the Environmental Management Team, their qualifications and functions as
well as the functions of the Project Environmental Coordinator. It provides information on the
general environmental management procedures to be followed during the project implementation.
Summary of activities, their related potential impacts, the corresponding recommended mitigation
and activities to be monitored during the pre-construction, construction, and operation phases of
the project has been provided in the EMP.
An institutional strengthening and training programme for implementation of various
environmental measures and the schedules and reporting on various environmental
issues/measures have also been provided in the EMP.
Estimated financial resources for implementation of the EMP have also been provided.

1.0   INTRODUCTION
1.1   The Project
The Volta River Authority (VRA) proposes to construct a new 161 KV Power Transmission line
(CONTRACT TK 210) from Prestea in the Western Region to Obuasi in the Ashanti Region in
order to enhance the power carrying capacity of the transmission network in the westem segment
of Ghana. This sector is significant not only for the economic importance of the increasing mining
activities i n t he a rea b ut a Iso b ecause t he c urrent additions to the country's power generation
capacity are both in the Westem Region.
These are the expansion of the Takoradi Generating station at Aboadze to 600 MW and the new
GNPC 140 MW Plant to be stationed at Effasu. In addition, during the current retrofit of the
Akosombo Hydroelectric plant, the additional power supply requirements are either provided from
Aboadze or imported from La Cote d'lvoire and passes along the western segment.
Generally, the proposed route runs parallel with the existing line at a distance of approximately 30
m (100 ft) to the West. There are diversions in the right of way at Bogoso and Dunkwa to avoid
the urban settlements. The project also involves the delivery to site, erection, testing and
commissioning of a 110 km 161 kV transmission line, with a 110 km optic fibre conductor
(OPGW) in place of one shield wire, between Prestea and Obuasi. Minor civil works related to
modifications at the Obuasi substation and at Prestea substations to accommodate line
terminations are to be carried out.
The pre-construction activities of the project include route survey, tower spotting and acquisition
of the necessary RoW. The construction activities involve various levels of vegetation clearing to
standards prescribed by VRA. The other activities are excavation of tower foundations, erection of
towers and stringing of lines. The substation expansion works are also included. Once the line is
in place and transmitting power, the main operational activities are mostly those related to the
maintenance of the lines, towers, accessories and the RoW.
The project is being executed by ABB Solutions, Italy. The contractual work programme is
attached as Appendix 1.

2.0   ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
In order to maintain control over the implementation of the project and also ensure that
commitments made in the project's EIS document are acted upon in a comprehensive and
acceptable manner, an Environmental Management Plan [EMP] / Training Programme has been
developed in this section.
This Plan seeks to identify the various institutional responsibilities to manage the environmental
aspect of the project. It provides a summary of activities, their related potential impacts and the
corresponding recommended mitigation to be carried out during the pre-construction,
construction, and maintenance phases of the project.
The EMP has taken into consideration the guidelines provided in the ISO 14000, which deals with
Quality Standards associated with the management of the environment and the World Bank
Operational Policy (OP4.01) for Category A projects.
2.1   Environmental Management Team
The corporate structure of the VRA provides for a department of Environment & Sustainable
Development Department (ESD), headed by a Director. This department, which is new, is
responsible, among others, for pre-project development as well as the post project
implementation of all environment-related activities of the VRA. Project environmental teams for
all development activities in VRA reside in this department. The proposed structure of the
department is still under review.
In pursuance of the objective of ensuring compliance with environmental regulations, an
Environmental Coordinator from the Project Environmental Team has been appointed to
coordinate environmental activities of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that has been
constituted for the project. The Project E nvironmental C oordinator i s a m ember o f t he P roject
Implementation Unit and reports on the project through the Project Engineer to the Project
Director who in turn reports on all environmental issues concerning the project.
The Environmental Coordinator is directly responsible for all environmental issues at the pre-
constructional and constructional phases of the project. Management of the post constructional
operational phase would be incorporated into the Authority's Corporate Environmental
Management Plans, which is presently administered by the Environment & Sustainable
Development Department.

2.5    Scheduling & Reporting
Results of environmental monitoring activities will be reporting to allow for identification of mitigation measures that need corrective action. From
preconstruction to operation/maintenance phases, VRA will have the ultimate responsibility to ensure environmental reporting procedures are
being undertaken. The Project implementation Unit will hold monthly discussions on the project which will form a forum for discussions on
environmental issues, and decision making with regard to further mitigation, monitoring, or changes to construction practices. The Environmental
Coordinator will report to the Project Engineer on all environmental activities for inclusion in the project monthly reports.
The Environmental Coordinator will use these monthly reports as the basis for the preparation of an annual environmental report (as a
requirement of the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations) to be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and relevant
international agencies.
All monitoring and reporting documents will be kept on file, as part of VRA documentation procedures.

3.0 Financial Resource Allocation
Financial provisions have been made to ensure that mitigation commitments (including
compensation), monitoring and training programmes could be effectively implemented. VRA
has made the necessary budgetary provisions to cover all the commitments.
Compensation Budget
VRA would pay full replacement cost for compensable assets. Approved estimates by VRA are
provided below:
Actual Cost 2003
Land under Right of Way                                          1,400,000
Structures                                                     221,000,000
Crops and Economic Trees                                     2,856,000,000
Access Tracks and Construction                                 490,000,000
Damages
10 % Contingency on Damages                                    49,000,000
Total                                3,6178,400,000
In assessing compensation, the open market value plus the cost of disturbance was used as
basis.
Budget for Project Implementation Unit
A budget of US $700,000.00 has been made for the Project Implementation Unit under a
supplementary credit to supervise the construction of the line. This supplementary credit is from
the World Bank and it is also supplementary to the Takoradi Thermal Power Project Credit.
In the absence of this credit however, VRA has also made budgetary provision of ¢1.4 Billion
from its internal resource for the Project Implementation Unit.

Appendix 4
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN
In the construction of the transmission system, vegetation clearing is done within the right-of-way,
access tracks, tower spots and camp sites. These activities results in loss of vegetation cover. Some
effects of vegetation loss:
-     Exposure of some streams thus increasing the rate of evaporation.
-     Clearing of vegetation and compaction of soils could lead to death and displacement of some
faunal species.
-     Soils within the project area would be prone to erosion when cleared at high spots and when
subjected to the weight of heavy plants and machinery
-     Loss of closed canopy and reduction in the number of tree species resulting in increase
evaporation particularly of small streams/water bodies.
-     Falling trees (especially tall trees beyond the RoW) will cause extensive damage to
vegetation/crops in the landing area.
-  Excavating for tower foundations will destabilise the soil structure and expose the soils to
erosion. In swampy areas, there will be the need to pump out water from the excavations and
this would further increase erosion from surface runoff and increase sediment flow into nearby
water bodies.
For the entire transmission system project, the area of loss of vegetation cover would be 346.5 ha. The
breakdown is as follows:
VeQetation clearinQ within riQht-of-way
The contract specifies that all tall trees and scrub within a distance of 15 m on either side of the
centreline of the transmission line (i.e. approx 30 m wide area) shall be cut down to a height of not
more t han 1.25 m a bove g round; t he g round cover i s n ot to be removed. In addition any tall trees
outside the RoW, but of such height as could fall within 2 m of the conductors, shall also be felled.
Forest reserves
Of the estimated 112 km total length of the transmission line, only 3.05 km passes through the Opon-
Mansi and Denyau forest reserves. The total distance of the line through the Opon-Mansi reserve is
approximately 0.8 km. Based on a width of 30 m, the land area taken up by the RoW in the Opon-
Mansi reserve is about 2.4 ha (out of a total of 116.6 sq. km or 11,660 ha). With the Denyau
Shelterbelt reserve, the total distance through the reserve is 2.25 km. Based on a width of 30 m, the
land area taken up by the RoW through the reserve is about 6.75 ha (out of a total of 12.4 sq. km or
1,240 ha).
Thus the total area through the reserves will be 9.15 ha.
Clearing of tower foundations
Following the clearing of the tower track, the selected tower spots will be widened further to
accommodate the tower pads or foundations. The land area to be cleared will cover an area.equal to
the dimensions of the tower base (about 5 m square) plus an additional 2 m on each side.
38
'R4 / 'IT1/ EmnirtnmentaffManagement 'fan/Septem6er 200.



With an estimated 300 towers to be erected, the additional total area to be cleared for tower
foundations is estimated to be only about 1 ha over the entire length of the route.
For the entire 112 km, the 30 m RoW will cover an area of 336 ha.
Vegetation clearing of access tracks
At various selected points along the proposed route, construction of access tracks of approximately 3.5
m width (linking from public roads), will be cleared to enable materials, equipment and machinery to be
transported to the spots chosen for erecting the towers. Along the proposed route, the farthest distance
from the road to the lines is about 1.6 km (1 mile) and there will be a total of about 30 km such access
tracks (based on the existing lines). These tracks will be cleared completely of all trees, stumps, scrub
and vegetation to leave a graded surface.
Based on the foregoing, it is estimated that the total area of access tracks to be cleared will be
about 105,000 sq. m or 10.5 ha.
Mitigation measures
Measures to be employed to ensure a reduction of erosion, loss of cover for agricultural purposes,
restoration of embankments, re-vegetation,
-     Since the proposed line is to run close to the existing line, the roads and paths already used for
line maintenance (but now overgrown) will be used to provide access for surveyors.
-     Construction of new tracks will be kept to the barest minimum. Track routes will be selected in
such a way as to minimise any damage to farms and crops.
-     Mechanical control will be used for all vegetation clearing. If weed killers are to be used, they
would be vetted against approved World Bank OP 4.09 Pest Management; and that of the
Ghana EPA.
-     The path of access tracks will be selected so as to avoid crossing streams and other water
bodies.
-     Where this is unavoidable, suitable culverts will be installed; under no circumstances will water
bodies be blocked to provide for construction access. The exact number of culverts and
streams to be affected will be determined at the time of construction and monitored by the
Project Environmental team.
-     Removal of stream bank vegetation (especially bamboo) will be avoided as much as possible.
-     Compaction of soils along the graded tracks will be reduced by regulating the number of passes
of heavy trucks to and from the sites.
-     The ground surface at each tower site will be graded to provide drainage away from the tower
legs. Where necessary (particularly on sidehills), terracing, cribbing or riprap may be used to
provide protection for tower foundations.
-     Within the forest reserves, the guidelines of the Forest Service Division in the form of an MOU
to be prepared will be strictly adhered to.
-     Cutting of trees will be done by a certified timber contractor, and strictly in line with the
prescribed safety guidelines; those involved shall be competent workers supervised by the
39

Forestry Services staff. The landing area of falling trees will be carefully selected to minimise
damage to farms. Adequate waming will be given to ensure that public safety is not
compromised.
ABB will place Warning notices ("NO ENTRY", "NO TRESSPASSING" etc.) at entry to access
roads. In addition, random security patrols s hall b e c anied o ut. T he U nit C ommittees i n t he
communities shall be involved in educating the people and enforcing these provisions.
Existing campsites within the project area should be utilized.

Budgetary provision for vegetation management will be part of the contractor's cost.

MANAGEMENT OF ARCHEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL PROPERTY
Affected Cultural Property and Mitigation Measures
World Bank policy as well as good intemational practice requires that interfering with shrines and
cultural properties should be avoided. Therefore the final selection of tower spots will be made in such
a way as to avoid enclosing these shrines within the RoW.
Apart from the sacred grove enclosing the River Bogo shrine, three other shrines have been noted in
the communities of Asikuma, Damang and Pemenso. The people of Ayensukrom have a cemetery
located within the proposed RoW.
Mitigation measures
-     Wherever possible, any impact on such structures such as cemeteries, shrines and other
cultural properties shall be avoided.
-     If avoidance is not possible, the owners of such cultural practices would be consulted
for an appropriate compensation to be paid.
-     Where possible, such cultural properties like shrines will be relocated upon the
performance of the necessary ceremonies.
Procedure for Archeological and Cultural Chance Finds
Even though the possibility for any archeological chance finds in the project area is low due to the
specific area and the works involved, they may still be the chance finds during the implementation.
Examples of chance finds may include archeological heritage, which has remained unnoticed in the

-     As part of the contractual obligations, ABB Solutions is to report immediately to VRA of any
potential site that may have some cultural significance. If this happens VRA is to consult with
the local residents to discuss how the issue would be solved.
-     Where the site requires a specific intervention, VRA will notify the Department of Museum.
Consultations will then be held between the VRA, the Department of Museum and local
authorities in order to develop an appropriate response.
-      Supervisors responsible for clearing of bush and earthmoving equipment will be
sensitised and to identify cultural significant features and to report on them where required.
