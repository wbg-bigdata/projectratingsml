Executive Summarv
The Ministry of Energy (MoE) is seeking to improve the electric power distribution system of the
Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) to levels consistent with best industry practice in order to
support the Government of Ghana's economic development goals. In line with this objective,
MoE proposes to apply some of the funds obtained from the World Bank under the Ghana
Thermal Credit facility (IDA 2682) to finance some projects of ECG under the Distribution
System Upgrade Project (DSUP).
In compliance with the requirements of the Ghana EPA and the World Bank, the borrower
(MoE/ECG) is required to undertake environmental and social impact assessments of the
proposed developments under the DSUP to address potential adverse impacts, if any, that could
arise during the implementation. The World Bank disclosure policy further requires that
the environmental (biophysical) and social assessments should be made and
disclosed in separate documents. This report therefore covers the Compensation
and Resettlement Plan resufting from the assessment of the social impacts of the
DSUP.
The DSUP components cover both improvements to physical systems (sub-stations,
transmission circuits, communications systems etc) as well improvements to financial operations
and other forms of institutional support.
The impact assessment commenced with an Inception (Scoping) phase during which the scope
of the assessment was determined through consultations, desk studies and field evaluations.
From the findings of the Inception report, it was decided to focus the assessments on the
following components of the DSUP:
* Construction of Primary sub-stations
* Laying of Underground cables
* Construction of Overhead lines
* Upgrading of LV systems
1eeFost/DSUPi- /E Sm-r4



The various institutional, regulatory and policy issues related to the project implementation
have been duly considered in this phase of the assessment.
Among those considered are:
*  Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1999 (LI 1652),
*  Energy Commission Act, 1997 (Act 541) and PUBLIC NOTICES
*  National Museum Decree, 1969, (NLCD 387)
*  Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) Regulations, 1964 (L.I. 334)
*  Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) (Amendment) Regulations, 1964 (L.I. 346)
1  Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) Act, 1963 (Act 186)
*  Factories, Offices and Shops Act, 1970, Act 328
a  ECG Safety Policy 1995
*  ECG Environmental Management Plan 1999
*  The Road Reservation Management - Manual for Coordination
*  World Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) (Note that the
policy revision is OP 4.12, but this project is governed by the earlier version of the
policy)
Relevant sections of these provisions and guidelines have been used in the appropriate sections
of the report. The World Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement provides the basis
for the socio-economic baseline and impact assessment on income loss due to disruptions to
persons/economic activities that would result during the project implementation.
The Road Reservation Management Coordination Manual prescribes procedures for dealing with
disruptions to utilities and traffic management during such works.
The project components are described in sufficient detail as is consistent with SIA practice in
order to point out the issues of environmental concem.
The section on the description of the existing environment presents general information on the
three (3) urban centres - Accra, Tema and Kumasi where the major DSUP components under
consideration in the ESIA will be implemented.

Also provided is information on those components of the socio-economic/cultural environment
that would be impacted by the project implementation activities. These would serve as a basis
of predicting and evaluating any anticipated impacts (magnitude, extent and significance).
The major components of the socio-economic environment expected to be affected by the
proposed project implementation are the people and the economic activities that fall within the
right-of-way (RoW) of the selected circuit routes.
During this phase of the assessment, detailed baseline surveys were carried out along the
proposed routes. The surveys involved identifying project-affected persons using the criteria
prescribed in the World Bank Policy OD 4.30.
The affected persons include:
i.)    Those whose structures are of a temporary nature - movable kiosks, tables etc.
ii.)   Those whose structures are of a permanent nature - set in concrete
iii.)  Those who sell on the pavements and sidewalks (hawkers/seasonal sellers)
The findings are presented in Tables covering each of the proposed routes. The summary of the
affected persons and structures is presented below.
Table ES 1 - Summary of Affected Structures and Persons
No. Route         Permanent Structures I Affected Persons  Movable Structures / Affected Persons
1    Accra Route 1  15 structures  44 Persons         27 structures    46 Persons
2    Accra Route 2  9 structures   19 Persons         36 structures    * 36 Persons
3    Accra Route 3  Nil            Nil                  200 Persons (seasonal sellers)

TOTALS       28 structures     69 Persons         137 structures    356 Persons
*Reld Estimated numbers
The impacts on affected persons and structures are estimated from the data gathered during
the field surveys based on the worst case scenarios. From the calculations, it was found that at
exchange rates of 1 USD = 9,000 Ghana Cedis, the total compensation payable by ECG for loss
of income to those to be affected would be about USD 2840 over a period of about 4 months
disruption.
Refo-t/DSUP/C-mpn-t,., .nJ Se_eti__n plan /Fkcumo_                                   i



Allowing for possible 100% increase in this figure at the time of implementation (delays beyond
4 months, overstatement of incomes beyond those used in estimates) that would be about USD
6,000.
Allowing a further USD 20,000 for "disturbance allowance" including the cost of removing and
reinstating some of these permanent structures and allowing a further USD 10,000 for assisting
the nearly 350 persons in temporary structures to move to nearby locations, this would give an
estimated total cost of mitigating the economic impact of about USD 34,000. The provisional
estimate of USD 100,000 made for the DSUP by ECG should therefore be adequate to address
these concerns. In practice, every effort shall be made to keep the disruptions to the barest
minimum. In most cases, displacements shall be avoided by careful selection of trenching points
and pole positions.
ECG Environmental Management Plan (1999) and ECG Safety Policy (1995) provide guidelines
and systems for managing the environmental and health and safety aspects of the project
implementation.
Appropriate monitoring criteria shall be established to verify the predicted impacts of the project
on the environment and adjust the mitigation measures where necessary.
The Project Unit of ECG shall ensure that monitoring programmes are instituted and carried out
to cover the under listed areas. Relevant records shall be kept to ensure compliance with sound
environmental practices recommended in this report.
ECG's Environmental Officer (assisted by a Social Impact Coordinator) shall oversee and report
all monitoring activities and reports to the Director of Engineering.
The monitoring criteria are outlined in detail in the report under the following headings:

A section outlining a provisional Management Plan to ensure the application of sound
environmental practices during the various stages of the project is also incorporated in the
report. The provisional plan discusses and allocates appropriate resources for items identified
under mitigation and monitoring.
In addition to the Environmental Officer, ECG shall appoint a Project Social Impact Coordinator
who will also serve on the Project Implementation Unit with support from the Projects
Department, to oversee the implementation and monitoring of the social issues such as
consultations with affected persons, compensation payments and handling of complaints. The
person shall carry on this assignment into the operational phase of the project.
Since all the specific structures to be physically damaged/disturbed are not known precisely at
this stage, the social impact coordinator shall ensure that a log book is made available to
document all details of such instances of damage/disturbance, repairs/reinstatements and
compensation paid. This record shall be available for inspection by relevant persons and
authorities including the World Bank.
Details of consultations held with the various identified stakeholders are presented in a further
section on consultations. The report concludes with a recommendation for the implementation
of the project subject to monitoring of the various commitments made for mitigating the
environmental and social impacts.

1.0   Introduction
The Electricity Company of Ghana Ltd, (ECG) is a public utility service provider registered as
a private limited liability enterprise under the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179). Currently,
the Government of Ghana is the sole shareholder of ECG.
The company is responsible for the distribution of electric power over the southern sector of
Ghana which comprises six (6) out of the ten (10) administrative regions namely Ashanti,
Eastern, Volta, Western, Central and Greater-Accra. The regions in the northern sector of
Ghana are served by the Northern Electricity Department (NED) of the Volta River Authority
(VRA).
ECG has further subdivided the six (6) administrative regions into nine (9) operational
regions, namely:
Accra West         Ashanti East      Eastern      Central     Tema
Accra East         Ashanti West      Volta       Western
In the course of its operations, ECG has not been able to match the demand of electricity
with the needed network upgrades and expansions. Insufficient tariffs have placed the
company in a poor financial state with inadequate investments such that most of the
equipment in operation are obsolete, and the transformers and associated distribution
systems are constantly overloaded. This has resulted in high distribution system losses, poor
electricity supply quality and reliability leading to considerable customer dissatisfaction.
It is the objective of the Ministry of Energy (MoE) to improve the electric power distribution
system of the Electricity Company of Ghana to levels consistent with best industry practice
in order to support the Govemment of Ghana's economic development goals.
In line with this objective, MoE proposes to apply some of the funds obtained from the
World Bank under the Ghana Thermal Credit facility (IDA 2682) to finance aspects of ECG's
investment programme under the Distribution System  Upgrade Project (DSUP). In
compliance with the requirements of the Ghana EPA and the World Bank, the borrower
(MoE/ECG) is undertaking a Social Impact Assessment of the proposed developments under
the DSUP to address issues of compensation and resettlement.
IFost/D.vUp/tompencot -J P-tti.-tPl-



REFAST Consulting, a Ghanaian Engineering and Environmental consultancy has been
engaged to facilitate the conduct of the impact assessment.
1.1   Objectives of the SIA
An initial screening and evaluation (Scoping) was carried out at the inception of the SIA to:
• Identify the components of the DSUP that could have adverse impacts on the socio-
cultural and economic conditions within their sphere of influence
* Identify all relevant stakeholders in relation to the proposed DSUP
* Determine the scope and methodology for assessing the potential impacts expected from
the implementation of the DSUP
* Assemble all necessary information including various Regulatory and Institutional
arrangements and guidelines (World Bank, GoG etc.) relevant to the conduct of the SIA.
Based on the findings of the inception phase, the main objectives of this phase of the SIA
are to:
* Focus the detailed social impact assessment on the investment components covering the
sub-transmission and HV/LV systems that involve physical works. These include projects
in Accra (3 projects), Tema (2 projects) and Kumasi (2 projects).
* Propose Mitigation and Management Plan (including compensation and resettlement) for
dealing with the impacts assessed above.
* Prepare a Draft Report for study by the Client (MoE/ECG) and the World Bank
1.2   Approach and Methodology
The inception report further proposed that in order to meet the above objectives, the
procedures to be adopted in the SIA should be to:
* Hold consultations with identified stakeholders on details of the DSUP, to address their
concerns and expectations.
* Carry out detailed route surveys on the proposed circuit routes in Accra and Kumasi to
identify main socio-economic characteristics along the proposed routes and the extent
and significance of potential impacts in relation to Ghana EPA regulations and the World
Bank's safeguard policies (i.e. OD 4.30 - Involuntary Resettlement).

In particular, it was found that the two (2) sites acquired for new constructions in Tema and
Kumasi are in properly zoned locations for development and have no significant socio-
economic and cultural characteristics.
Both sites have been properly acquired from the bona fide title holders and were not
previously occupied by other users. The Tema site was acquired from the Tema
Development Company at the prevailing commercial value and the Kumasi site was obtained
from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Site plans for both sites
are attached as Annex 1.
1.3   Institutional, Regulatory and Policy Considerations
The Ministry of Energy is the Government agency responsible for policy issues in the energy
sector. The ECG, through its Board of Directors, reports to the Government through the
Minister of Energy. The availability of a reliable and cost effective supply of electrical energy
is considered as a very critical component of the Government's agenda for growth and
poverty reduction.
The Ministry, through the ongoing Self Help Electrification Programme (SHEP) and the
National Electrification Programme (NEP), has facilitated the extension of power to all
District capitals and to various rural communities. In the search for more sustainable sources
of power supply, the Ministry has put in place a Renewable Energy programme which is
exploring alternatives such as solar and wind generated power.
The relevant policies and the regulatory conditions that must be considered for the
successful implementation of the DSUP project have been assembled and reviewed during
this phase of the SIA process and appropriate consultations have been held with some of
the relevant institutions and agencies.
Among those considered are:
*  Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1999 (LI 1652),
*  Energy Commission Act, 1997 (Act 541) and PUBLIC NOTICES
*  National Museum Decree, 1969, (NLCD 387)
*  Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) Regulations, 1964 (L.I. 334)
*  Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) (Amendment) Regulations, 1964 (L.I. 346)
oa Re-et~t Pl-



* Lands (Statutory Wayleaves) Act, 1963 (Act 186)
* Factories, Offices and Shops Act, 1970, Act 328
* ECG Safety Policy 1995
* ECG Environmental Management Plan 1999
* The Road Reservation Management - Manual for Coordination 2001
* World Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30)
The Energy Commission's PUBLIC NOTICES EC. N. 001 and 003, require ECG to register the
proposed project with the Commission prior to commencement of the project as part of the
licensing process.
The components of the DSUP that involve construction of overhead and underground
circuits raise issues regarding the acquisition of wayleaves (Right-of-Way RoW). The
determination of the final routes and acquisition of the RoW shall be carried out with due
consultations with the communities/affected persons or their representatives within the
project areas of influence. The various Lands (Wayleaves) legislation identified above
provide the necessary legal procedures for acquiring the RoW and these will guide ECG and
stakeholders concemed.
Consultations with some members of the local communities and their
representatives have been undertaken as part of the baseline survey for this SIA
process. The details of the findings are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.
In the event of the chance finding of any archaeological artefacts in the course of clearing or
excavation for the construction works, the National Museum Decree, 1969, (NLCD 387)
provides the necessary framework for action. Procedures to be followed on the discovery of
any such artefacts are clearly outlined in the document.
Socio-economic issues involve temporary disturbance to businesses, income losses to people
who may have to relocate from the project area, and aspects of both public/occupational
health and safety particularly in the working environment. It is important to note that ECG's
installations and facilities including those proposed in the DSUP are to be in compliance with
the Factories, Offices and Shops Act (Act 328, 1970).

The World Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) provides the
necessary guidelines for dealing with the various issues related to impacts of the DSUP
activities on persons and properties within the RoW along the various proposed circuit
routes in both Accra-Tema and Kumasi.
The baseline survey has been carried out by following the Ghana EA Regulations and the
recommendations of OD 4.30 in identifying the affected persons. These are discussed in
Chapter 3.
The ECG Safety Policy outlines the various safety procedures that are to be applied at all
stages in carrying out activities on the ECG networks to ensure the safety of workers, the
general public as well the plant and machinery. ECG's Environmental Management Plan also
prescribes procedures for dealing with various concerns arising from ECG operations
including waste handling, EMF effects, Emergency response procedures etc.
The Road Reservation Management Manual for Coordination is a comprehensive document
developed between the various utility service providers in Ghana (ECG, Ghana Water
Company, Ghana Telecom, Volta River Authority), the Road Agencies (Department of Urban
Roads, Department of Feeder Roads and Ghana Highway Authority) and the relevant
statutory and regulatory agencies (Lands Commission, Environmental Protection Agency,
Lands Valuation Board etc.) for the efficient management of road reservations for the
installation of utility services such as pipelines, cables and transmission lines. Specifically,
the manual deals with the procedures for the handling of disruptions of utilities and traffic
during construction and issues of valuation for compensation, which are relevant for the
DSUP implementation.

2.0   Project Description
The components of the DSUP being considered in detail in this phase of the ASSESSMENT
may be grouped into four (4) types of project activities. These are:
* Construction of Primary substations
X Laying of Underground cables
* Construction of Overhead lines
* Upgrading of LV systems
This section describes these components in sufficient detail as is consistent with SIA practice
so as to be able to identify those aspects that raise social concerns. It must be noted at this
stage that all construction activities will be carried out by certified contractors to ECG's
documented Standards and Specifications, which are specified in the contract of works.
2.1         Construction of Primary substations (Tema and Kumasi)
Primary substations in the ECG distribution system consist of 33/11 kV transformers which
receive 33 kV input and step down to 11 kV for further distribution in the ECG networks.
There are proposals to construct 2 new primary substations under the DSUP.
These are:
i.)   Tema - 2x20/26 MVA at Ashaiman
ii.)   Kumasi - 2x20 MVA at Boadi, KNUST
The main activities involved in constructing such stations are:
* Site clearing - substation sites are cleared completely of all vegetation, leaving a bare
surface at commencement of construction. This will not involve the dislocation of any
people, since there are no people currently occupying those areas.
* Excavation - excavations are carried out to lay foundations for transformer platforms
and housing (and cables where appropriate). Some of the excavated soil is used to
backfill as necessary.
* Concrete works - concrete works for the foundations and footings are carried out as
required.
* Erection of Transforrmers - transformers and associated switch gear, and circuits are
carefully mounted in their specified locations.

Gravelling and Fencing - the exposed ground areas of the substation are covered with
granite chippings and kept free of weeds at all times. The entire area is provided with
appropriate security fencing to prevent accidental electrocution of tramps and homeless
people who may wander into the area.
2.2          Laying of underground cables (Accra and Kumasi)
Underground circuits in the ECG distribution system are found mainly in built up urban areas
and in places where there is the need to avoid obstacles or crossing points. Under the
DSUP, the proposals for underground circuits are:
i.)   Accra: From Mallam BSP to Substation 'B' Korle Bu - sections of New 2x40 MVA
circuits 33 kV 500 sq. mm Cu 3x1C. Distance of approx. 9 km.
ii.)  Accra: From Achimota 'H' to Makola 'G" - New 2x40 MVA circuits 33 kV 500 sq.
mm Cu 3x1C. Distance of approx. 8.7 km.
iii.)  Accra: From Odorkor 'A' to Korle Bu 'B' - Replacementof existing cable with 40
MVA 33 kV 500 sq. mm Cu 3x1C. Distance of approx. 6.6 km.
iv.)  Kumasi: From Kaasi 'D' to Buadi-UST (New proposed S/S) - sections of New 40
MVA 33 kV. Distance of approx 1 km.
The main activities involved in such works are:
a Excavation of cable route (trenching) - In the ECG system, 33kV cables are buried at
between 900mm - 1100mm depth, with a trench width of about 500mm. Trenching is
done by a combination of machinery and manual labour depending on the location and
nature of the soil. ECG's Standard specifications for trenching and laying of 33kV and
11kV lines are presented in Annex 2.
Laying of cables - The space immediately below the cable position is filled with dry sand
to a depth of about 100mm and forms a bed along the entire length of the trench. The
cable is uncoiled from the cable drum and laid out on the sand bed and covered with an
additional layer of dry sand before the trench is backfilled with the previously excavated
soil. The surface layer is then compacted and restored to the original condition.
J  Protection of cables - Coloured warning tapes are buried near the surface during
backfilling to provide warning in event of any subsequent excavations works by other
utility service providers (e.g. water, telecoms etc).

In addition properly labelled concrete pillar markers are located at various points along
cable routes especially in way of cable joints to provide for ease of locating for repairs
and maintenance.
In certain cases, cables may be laid next to each other at the same depth or even in layers
at various depths. In each case, ECG Standard Specifications, which provide for safety and
efficiency, are available to guide the contractor.
The procedures to be adopted during implementation shall be such as to ensure minimum
disruption to persons and economic activities as well as providing for maximum public
safety. To this end every effort shall be made that trenches are covered by close of work
each day.
2.3   Construction of Overhead Lines
Overhead lines constitute the bulk of the circuits in the ECG distribution system for both HV
and LV. Under the DSUP, the proposals for HV overhead circuits are:
i.)   Accra: From Mallam BSP to Substation 'B' Korle Bu - sections of New 2x40 MVA
circuits 33 kV OHL 3W SC Tower 265mm Al. Distance of approx. 11 km.
ii.)  Tema: From Steelworks to Ashaiman (New  proposed S/S) - New 2x40 MVA
circuits 33 kV OHL 3W SC Tower 265mm Al. Distance of approx. 7 km.
iii.)  Kumasi: From Kaasi 'D' to Buadi-UST (New proposed S/S) - New 40 MVA 33 kV
OHL 3W SC Tower 265mm Al. Distance of approx. 12 km.
NB. For these proposed lines, underground cables would be used at specific sections where
it is not feasible to go overhead (e.g. in sharp bends and crossing obstacles). Maps of the
routes are presented in Annex 3.
The main activities involved in OHL works are:
* Positioning of Towers - The average span for the 33kV OHL is about 100 m. During
construction, sites for locating the towers will be selected in accordance with ECG
standard specifications and environmental considerations such as visual intrusion.
At the specified locations, towers may be buried to a depth of about 1800mm. The
average height of the towers/poles ranges from 10-12 m.
CeleFet/DSP/(_opetoo.....oztrn ion-......... 8



Stringing of Lines - In most cases, lines are strung by manual labour. The minimum
clearance of the lines to ground is about 6 m at the lowest point of sag and this
increases to about 8 m in way of road crossings. The wayleaves for 33kV lines span a
width of 10 m (5m on either side of the centreline). In built up urban settlements this
space may be reduced in certain situations due to space constraints.
2.4   Upgrading of Low Voltage (LV) Systems
The project activities proposed under this section consist mainly of transformer injection (i.e.
adding additional transformers to an existing substation) or replacing an existing overloaded
transformer with one of a higher rating. In some cases, the upgrading works will involve
replacing existing conductors with higher capacity.
Some of these activities do raise issues of significant socio-economic concern, especially
those that may involve the temporary displacement and relocation of people and properties
to make way for the project. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

3.0   Description of Existing Socio-Economic/Cultural Environment
The major projects of the DSUP under consideration in this assessment are in the urban
settlements of Accra, Tema and Kumasi. The substation sites and circuit routes are located
in populated and extensively built up areas. This section on the existing environment
presents general information on these three (3) urban centres along with information on
those components of the socio-economic/cultural environment that would be impacted by
the project implementation activities. These would serve as a basis of predicting and
evaluating any anticipated impacts (magnitude, extent and significance).
3.1 Urban Profiles
Accra
Accra is the administrative capital of Ghana, with a population of about 2,207,147 people
(PHC 2000). It is also the seat of Government, and important arms of the state such as the
Parliament House, the Supreme Court, the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies of
state are housed here.
Major economic activities here include manufacturing industries, commercial houses, utility
and service providers and the headquarters of many industrial and commercial concems.
Accra is the hub of business and commerce in Ghana. The Accra-Tema area is key to
Ghana's Gateway Project, which seeks to make Ghana the entry point and arrowhead of
economic and industrial activity in the West African sub-region. Accra has a high demand for
electric power and is served by a 250 MVA BSP at Achimota and 150 MVA BSP at Mallam.
Tema
Tema is an important industrial city in Ghana, and lies 25 kilometres east of Accra. It is the
capital of the Tema Municipal Area, which is home to about 506,637 (Population & Housing
Census, 2000). Tema Township itself has a population of 280,000. It is a coastal city with a
shipping harbour and a fishing harbour.
Tema has the largest concentration of industries in Ghana, with more than 185
manufacturing and industrial concems. There is also a large number of small and medium
scale enterprises, especially in the wood processing, metal fabrication, food production and
textile industries.
10



The major economic activities in Tema include fishing (subsistence and commercial),
manufacturing, industry, commerce, fishing, stevedoring and agriculture. Thus Tema
provides employment for a significant section of the urban population in the general Accra-
Tema area. Tema accounts for about 13% of ECG's sales with a peak demand of 100 MW.
The Greenwich Meridian runs through Tema, and major cultural and tourist sites, coupled
with its beaches make Tema an attractive tourist destination. Thus hotels and other
hospitality services also abound.
The Tema harbour is a major port along the West African coast, with an average annual
traffic of about 1170 vessels. Expectedly, downstream shipping activities such as
stevedoring, freight clearing and forwarding, warehousing abound in the township.
Kumasi
Kumasi is the second largest city in Ghana after Accra. It also has the second highest
concentration of manufacturing industries after Accra-Tema. It has a population of about
1,171,311  (PHC   2000).  Manufacturing  industries  include  sawmills,  breweries,
pharmaceuticals, and electrical appliances. Kumasi has a current peak demand of about 130
MW and accounts for 15% of ECG's total sales.
Kumasi is a nodal city with many outlying towns and villages. It is therefore and important
trade and commercial centre for foodstuffs, raw materials for industry and finished goods.
Its central location in Ghana ensures that goods in transit to and from Ghana's northern and
western neighbours, i.e. Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and La Cote dIvoire (Ivory Coast) pass
through Kumasi.
The proposed development of an inland port in Boankra, near Kumasi will go to enhance
Kumasi's position as an international trade centre, serving Ghana's landlocked neighbours
who will utilise the port. Kumasi is also a much preferred tourist destination due to its rich
cultural heritage. Thus the hotel and hospitality industry is also well developed.
3.2   Socio-Economic Environment
The major components of the socio-economic environment expected to be affected by the
proposed project implementation are the people and the economic activities that fall within
the circuit routes.



During this phase of the assessment, detailed baseline surveys were carried out along the
proposed routes. The surveys involved identifying project-affected persons using the criteria
prescribed in the World Bank Policy OD 4.30. The affected persons include:
i.)    Those whose structures are of a temporary nature - movable kiosks, tables
ii.)   Those whose structures are of a permanent nature - set in concrete
iii.)  Those who sell on the pavements and sidewalks (hawkers)
The affected persons were briefed about the project, potential impacts and mitigation
measures. They were also interviewed to obtain the basic information needed for the
assessment. The findings are presented below.
Route 1- Accra: Mallam (BSP) to Korle Bu 'B'
This is the proposed route for new 33kV line from the Mallam BSP in the western end of
Accra to substation 'B" at Korle Bu, Link Road, over a distance of about 20 circuit-km. The
circuit will run underground (9 km) where it runs within the residential areas of Dansoman
and Lartebiokorshie with overhead lines (11 km) used for road crossings and in open areas.
Movable Structures
Estimated number of 27 movable kiosks and 46 affected persons were identified to be lying
within the Right-of-Way of the proposed circuit route.

Route 2 - Accra: Odorkor Substation 'A' to Korle Bu 'B'
Route 2 consists of an existing underground 20 MVA circuit, which is to be replaced with a
40 MVA circuit to improve security of supply and meet load growth in the sprawling
residential settlements in the area. This route runs through Lartebiokoshie, Mataheko,
crosses the main Kaneshie - Mallam road to Odorkor Police Quarters area to Substation 'A'
at Odorkor.
Permanent Structures
There were a total of nine (9) permanent structures and 19 persons identified to be lying
within the road reservation, which would be disturbed during excavation works. These are
presented in Table 3.

Movable Structures
A total of thirty-six (36) movable structures were identified on this route. However, the
owners could not be interviewed as they had closed their shops, probably to avoid
Metropolitan revenue officials who were carrying out a tax recovery exercise during the
survey period.
Route 3 - Accra: Achimota substation 'H' to Makola 'G'
This route is a proposed new construction for 33 kV underground cable which runs along the
main Achimota Road, through Accra Girls' Secondary, crosses the road at the Gold House
intersection, through Kanda Highway, Barnes Road, Novotel, ECG Accra East Head Office to
Substation 'G' at Makola market area. The proposed cable route will be along the sidewalk.
Permanent Structures
This route forms part of the official ceremonial route, which is used to welcome VIPs. There
were no permanent structures along the route as the road reservation and sidewalks are
kept clear by security personnel because of the ceremonial use of the road.

Hawkers/Seasonal Sidewalk sellers
An estimated two hundred (200) hawkers/seasonal sidewalk sellers were identified to be
selling their wares along the pavement on the final stretch of the route from Novotel area to
the Makola market located in the prime business area. The items sold include bread, ice
creams, tissue paper, used clothing, used shoes etc. These hawkers avoided the survey
teams as they suspected them to be City revenue officials who wanted to grab them for tax
payment. A few who cooperated stated their daily earnings to be in the region of 5,000 -
15,000 Ghana Cedis.
Route 4 - Kumasi: Kaasi 'D' to Boadi-KNUST (new Substation site 'G')
The route runs from the Kaasi substation through settlements in 'Kuwait', Atonsu Dompoase,
Kyirapatre New site, Gyinyase, Kotey Deduako, Apemso, Emena to end up at the proposed
site for the new substation at Boadi. A long stretch of the proposed line will pass through
the easement provided by the reservation for the VRA 161 kV line.
Movable Structures
A total of 74 movable kiosks and make shift structures were identified to be within the right
at way (RoW) of the proposed underground cable project. Of this number, ten (10)
consisted of kiosk, fifty-two (52) were identified to be selling on tables and the remaining
twelve (12) comprised make shift structures. Most of these kiosks were found to be tailoring
shops manned by single occupants.
It was noted that the City Management (Kumasi Metropolitan Authority, K.M.A) had marked
most of these structures for removal so it could well be that by the time construction starts
the actual figures would have changed considerably.

Route 5 - Tema: Steelworks to Ashaiman
This route runs through vacant lots in the industrial area and along the reservation of the
abandoned Tema to Shai Hills railway line. There are no permanent structures on the RoW
of this route.
Note on Incomes
Many of the persons interviewed were unwilling to disclose their full incomes for fear that
they could have tax implications. The incomes indicated above were obtained from some of
the affected persons who were persuaded to cooperate after seeing some of the project
documentation. For most of the owners, the incomes represent their net profits after taking
out what they spend on food during work and what they pay to their assistants/apprentices
and other overheads.
Similarly for the employees who are mainly trainees or apprentices or in some cases,
relatives of the owners, the incomes represent the net 'take-home' income and does not
include allowances given daily for food, transport etc.

4.0    Potential Impacts and Mitigation
This section discusses the impacts expected at various stages of the project implementation
and recommended mitigation actions to minimise these impacts.
Impacts on livelihoods and economic activities - A summary of the baseline survey
data presented in Chapter 3 is presented below:
Table 5- Summary of Affected Structures and Persons
No. Route        Permanent Structures / Affected   Movable Structures / Affected
Persons                           Persons

2    Accra Route 2  9 structures  19 Persons       36 structures   * 36 Persons
3    Accra Route 3  Nil           Nil                200 Persons (seasonal sellers)
4    Kumasi      4 structures      6 Persons       74 structures   *74 Persons
TOTALS      28 structures     69 Persons      137 structures    356 Persons
* Field Estimated numbers
The impacts on livelihoods and economic activities would occur as a result of the temporary
disruptions expected to be created during excavation for underground cable construction
works. Once the cables are installed and the surfaces are reinstated, most/all of the
activities would resume.
From the summary presented in Table 5, it is estimated that up to 356 persons working in
movable structures including about 200 seasonal/mobile sidewalk sellers would be affected.
For most of these people, they would tend to move on to more convenient locations to ply
their trade. Those selling from tables would move over to the other side of the street or to
other more accessible locations. The impacts on this group of persons would therefore be
minimal. Arrangements would be made to assist occupants of movable structures like Lotto
Kiosks to move over to more convenient spots in the immediate vicinity of their existing
locations.
The more significant impacts would be on those with permanent structures who may have
to shut down for a period and would be required to be compensated for loss of earnings. It
is estimated that about 28 permanent structures involving about 69 persons would be
affected. Based on consultations with the Project Management, it is established that such
excavations usually take place in the dry seasons and works are completed quickly in order
18

to avoid the difficulties posed by the rainy season. The dry season for the areas under
consideration (Accra, Kumasi) runs from January to April, a maximum of about 4 months.

TOTALS                     28      41  4,530,000  1,860,000  18,120,000  7,440,000
The estimate of potential income loss is based on the worst case scenario where all the
permanent structures identified would be out of service for the maximum   period of 4
months. Based on this assumption, the calculations above show that 69 persons (28 owners
and 41 employees/apprentices) could be directly affected with an estimated total income
loss of GHC 25,560,000 (18,120,000 for owners and 7,440,000 for employees).
At estimated exchange rates of 1 USD = 9,000 Ghana Cedis, the total compensation payable
for loss of income to those to be affected would be about USD 2840. Allowing for possible
100% increase in this figure at the time of implementation (e.g. delays beyond 4 months,
overstatement of incomes beyond those used above) that would be about USD 6000.
Allowing further USD 20,000 for the cost of removing and reinstating some of these
permanent structures and allowing a further USD 10,000 for assisting the nearly 350
20
~~~~WotDS -o ntl nJ C9stlretPo



persons in temporary structures to move to nearby locations, would give an estimated total
cost of mitigating the economic impact of about USD 34,000. The provisional estimate for
compensation payment by ECG of USD 100,000 made for the DSUP should therefore be
adequate to address these concerns.
As stated above, this assessment is based on the worst case scenarios where everything in
the RoW will be adversely affected. However in practice, much of the displacement shall be
avoided. Every effort would be made to avoid disturbing as many structures and persons as
possible. No structures will be destroyed in the process and any damages to structures
during construction will be duly remedied. Trenching routes will be shifted where
appropriate to minimise the potential disruption to business and economic activities. As
much as possible, once the construction works are completed and the pavements are
restored, those displaced would return to continue with their activities.
As agreed in the World Bank comments on the Inception Report, the details of
compensation determination will be worked out prior to implementation. The
formulae to be applied for the various scenarios as well as the mode of payment
shall be decided in consultation with the affected persons and their
representatives.
From comments on the earlier draft of this report, it would appear that the stated incomes
are generally low. This is however consistent with the general conditions within the country
where incomes are considerably low. The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS)
identifies the poor as earning less than 900,000 Ghana Cedis per annum. In relation to the
relative disparities between the stated income of some of the hawkers and those operating
from kiosks, the following should be noted:
i.) The hawkers under consideration operate in a prime business area, are highly mobile
and sell at higher prices while the kiosk owners are located in the suburban areas.
ii.) The hawkers generally avoid all tax and rates obligation and have no operational costs
and overheads.
iii.) Some hawkers pick wares and items from kiosk owners to sell and make a profit for
themselves.
iv.) Hawking is an insecure and risky vocation and is not the preferred form of employment.
Many of the kiosk workers are apprentices/trainees who expect to earn better incomes in
future after their training.

5.0    Monitoring
Appropriate monitoring criteria shall be established to verify the predicted impacts of the
project on the environment and adjust the mitigation measures where necessary.
The Project Unit of ECG shall ensure that monitoring programmes are instituted and carried
out to cover the under listed areas. Relevant records shall be kept to ensure compliance
with sound environmental practices recommended in this report.
ECG's Environmental Officer shall oversee and report all monitoring activities to the Director
of Engineering through the Director of Projects.
The monitoring criteria are outlined under socio-economic/cultural issues
5.1   Socio-economic/cultural issues
Following the guidelines and procedures of the World Bank and Ghana EPA, the monitoring
will cover the following:
* Identifying all affected persons
* Assessment of compensation
* Payment of compensation (adequate amounts, timely payments)
Employment and job creation
* Archaeological chance finds (if any)
For archaeological chance finds, the procedures as outlined in the National Museum Decree,
1969, (NLCD 387) will be followed. Comprehensive record keeping and documentation shall
be maintained for the above as proposed in the Provisional Management Plan in Chapter 6.
22



6.0    Provisional Management Plan
This section outlines a provisional management plan to ensure that affected persons are not
worse off economically during the various stages of the project. It discusses and allocates
appropriate resources for items discussed under mitigation and monitoring.
6.1   Social Impact Management Structure
ECG shall appoint a Project Social Impact Coordinator who will also serve on the Project
Implementation Unit together with the Environmental Officer and supported by the Projects
Department, to oversee site construction activities and monitor specific social impact criteria.
The person shall carry on this assignment into the operational phase of the project.
The provisional plan discussed in this section has taken into consideration guidelines
provided in the World Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30).
6.1.1 Functions of the Project Social Impact Coordinator (PSIC)
The functions of the PSIC shall include:
Identifying all affected persons
*  Assessment of compensation
*  Payment of compensation (adequate amounts, timely payments)
*  Coordinating grievance procedures and log book for damages
*  Employment and job creation
*  Archaeological chance finds (if any)
Grievance Procedure
A grievance procedure will be adopted in consultation with the affected persons and their
representatives, so that any persons who are dissatisfied with the levels of compensation
payment or any other issues related to the project impacts can make formal petition to ECG
for redress. All such cases will be duly documented and made available in periodic reports
by the PSIC.

Damaae and ComDensation Loa Book
Since all the specific structures to be physically damaged/disturbed are not known precisely
at this stage, the social impact coordinator shall ensure that a log book is made available to
document all details of such instances of damage/disturbance, repairs/reinstatements and
compensation paid. This record shall be available for inspection by relevant persons and
authorities including the World Bank.

7.0   Consultations
During the Inception phase, a number of stakeholders of the DSUP interventions were
identified. During this phase of the assessment, discussions were held with some of these
stakeholders to identify/address their concerns and expectations.
Interviews and consultations were also held with some of the potentially
affected persons and this informed the information presented in Chapter 3 and
the impacts assessed in Chapter 4.
Table 7 below is a list of the organisations consulted and the contact persons. The issues
raised during the discussions are also presented after the Table.

Ghana Telecom
* Provisions of the Road Reservation Management Manual will be applied.
25



* Provision of layout showing the proposed route to be used by the Electricity Company of
Ghana to enable GT to insert drawings of places where network exist.
* Furnishing of GT with work plan/time schedule to enable technical personnel of the latter
to be on the field with EGC staff to give guidance and assistance where necessary.
* Rapid and free flow of information and co-operation among staff of both organisations to
facilitate the smooth progress of work when it commences and to avoid the destruction
of underground cables and ducts, thereby disrupting services within project area and
adjoining towns.
Energy Commission
ECG is required to furnish the EC with a brief but detailed write up on the project to
enable the Commission to give appropriate/ relevant guidelines for successful
implementation of the project. The detail drawings should show cable routes, sites
earmarked by ECG as suitable for the positioning of transformers, capacities of new
transformers etc.
Accra Metropolitan Assembly
* Provisions of the Road Reservation Management Manual will be applied.
* ECG to present to the Assembly drawings on proposed project indicating the route and
other infrastructure to be installed ie the scope of the project
. An application letter should accompany these drawings and sent through the ECG
representative on the Accra Metropolitan Planning Committee to the Town and Country
Planning Department for further action
* In places where the proposed route passes through properties or will require relocation
of affected persons or property, a detailed compensation plan will be necessary
* ECG is required to work in close collaboration with other utility agencies to ensure the
continuous availability of the services of the other service providers
Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly
Service to some parts of Kumasi, particularly the Industrial Area, has been erratic and
unreliable.
26
~~~~~~eot1;r S St.od...Ssti.s>. D



. This area has the highest concentration of heavy-machinery industries, including
breweries, sawmills and other industrial concems.
* The project would thus improve power supply and quality, especially in the industrialised
areas such as Kaasi, Atonsu and Ahinsan, and is a welcome development.
Energy Foundation
. The principal complaint from consumers has been frequent power failures and
unavailability of power supply to certain parts of the city.
* If the project would improve the quality of power supply and make it possible for supply
to be extended to new development areas then it would spell relief.
Ghana Chamber of Mines
. The main complaint from their members has been irregular and inconsistent power
supply, which result in equipment damage and increased production costs.
Mining concerns have to rely on diesel- powered generators for power so often that their
fiscal projections are frequently distorted, because power from generators is more
expensive.
* The project is thus welcome if it will ensure system reliability.
Association of Ghana Industries
Irregular power supply has been the bane of industrial concerns in Ghana, especially in
Accra and Kumasi. Therefore, if the project will improve power supply and efficiency
then it is good news.

8.0   Conclusions
Electric power supply is a major contributor to progress and development and forms a key
part of the Government of Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy. Electricity is
needed to boost productivity and provide employment as well facilitating the provision of
much needed basic services such as education, water and health services for the people.
ECG is the main service provider in this sector and any inefficiency in its performance
impacts adversely on the overall national economic performance. The DSUP interventions
are therefore very much welcome by all the stakeholders concerned.
From the assessment carried out on the DSUP components, it can be seen that there are no
major environmental risks associated with the project implementation. The major works will
be carried out in the urban centres of Accra, Tema and Kumasi and there are no protected/
sensitive areas and/or species to be affected.
ECG has adequate resources within its structure and operational systems to deal with the
environmental and social concerns that may arise during the construction and operational
phases.
The main issue of concern has to do with the social impact of potential loss of income to
persons whose economic activities would be temporary disturbed to various degrees while
excavation works are undertaken along road reservations and sidewalks.
From the assessment carried out, the levels of compensation liability are quite reasonable
and the project budget has set aside adequate resources to cater for the payments.
It is therefore recommended that the DSUP should proceed and effective monitoring carried
out to ensure compliance with the various mitigation commitments.
