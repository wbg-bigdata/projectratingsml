INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO OFFICE NATIONAL DE L'ELECTRICITE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Office National de l'Electricite (ONE) with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Morocco for the equivalent of US$25 million to help finance a project for the
expansion of the generation and transmission facilities of Office National de
l'Electricite. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 4 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Morocco" (EMA-42) was distributed to the Executive Directors in September
1971. More recent economic information is given below. The next economic
mission is currently visiting Morocco. A country data sheet is attached as
Annex I.
3.        Morocco's traditional social and political order has been essentially
maintained since independence in 1956 while the country's economic structure
has been changing gradually. In agriculture, the small modern sector has ex-
panded, specializing in commercial crops mainly for export, but subsistence
farming remains the mainstay of more than half of Morocco's active population.
In industry, the relative importance of modern manufacturing has risen slowly,
but phosphate mining is still the main industrial activity. Traditional craf`ts
and services have continued to provide substantial employment. International
tourist traffic has been attracted to Morocco and tourism has become the econ-
omy' s most dynamic sector. Despite these changes, the economy remains vul-
nerable to droughts which from time to time set back agricultural output and
incomes. With only moderate economic expansion and rapid population growth,
unemployment and underemployment have reached high levels. The differences
in cultural and economic status between regions and population groups remain
substantial.
Past Developments
4.        The growth of the Moroccan economy at an average annual rate of 2.7
percent barely kept pace with population increases from 1956 to 1967. Invest-
ment, which showed a moderate expansion, was only about 13 percent of GNP by
1967. With the implementation of the Second Development Plan (1968-72),
there was a sizeable increase in public investment. Private investment which
did well during the initial years became more sluggish later because the
Government did not suceed in sufficiently encouraging private initiative,
particularly for investment in manufacturing, and also because of political
uncertainties in 1971 and 1972. Total investment ranged between 13 and 15
percent of GNP, compared to the Plan target of 17 percent. Aided by favora-
ble weather and consequent good crops, economic growth nonetheless accelerated



-   -
to an average annual rate of 5.6 percent in 1967-72, thus exceeding the Plan
target: of 4.3 percent.  Agriculture grew by 6 percent a year and manufacturing
by 5.3 percent during the Second Plan period.
5.        At the same time, the implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal
policies resulted in a signif:icant improvement in Morocco's Linancial position.
Domestically, a combination c1- new tax measures, higher income from state en-
terprises and expenditure restraint led to an increase in Government savings,
but private savings remained relatively low. Externally, Morocco's balance
of pa-yments began to move into surplus in 1969 attaining a level of $75 mil-
lion in 1972.  Current receipts increased in the last four years by 11 per-
cent annually -nainly due to tourism, workers' remittances and phosphate ex-
ports. Gross public capital flGws also increased initially but, when invest-
ment stagnated in 1971, they fell to about their old level of $130 million a
year.  Stagnation of investments a'lso lowered the import of equipment goods.
Part of the improvement in Mo-rocco's roreign accounts is for that reason of
a temporary nature and explains why gross official reserves climbed in Feb-
ruary 1973 to a historical record of $274 million, equivalent to 3 months of
total 1972 imports.
6.        Economic expansion was not enough, however, to absorb all new addi-
tions to the labor force during the Second Plan period. Emigration was an
expanding outlet for the unemployed; an estimated 250,000 Moroccans were work-
ing outside the country in 1972. Further, despite increases in the work re-
lief program, th,ere were still mDire than 350,000 unemployed or 15 percent of
the labor force outside agriculture.
Development Prospects
7.        The outlook for 1973 is dominated by a poor cereals crop (probably
30 percent smaller than in 1972) due to drought. This is expected to reduce
farmers' incomes and the growth of domestic demand. The country may be left
with a substantial shortage of cereals during the 1973/74 season requiring
large imports. Private investment may be temporarily affected by recent
legislation which gives the majority control of private enterprises in serv-
ices and selected industrial subsectors, producing mainly for the domestic
market, to Moroccan nationais. At the same time, the Government intends to
establish shortly a new system cf incentives to promote private investment,
including foreign investmenat _n export industries.   On balance, private in-
vestment may still be sluggish in 1973.    Despite continued increases in
tourism, workers' remittances and other sectors, these factors indicate
that developments in output, investment and trade may be less favorable in
1973 than in .he recent past.
8.        The Govern-nent began a thorough revision of its development policies
when, on August 4, 1971, King Ilassan II set out the broad objectives in a
major speech. Since then, and particularly in the last four months, increas-
ing attention has been paid to a number of social objectives including the
nee9 to expanc education, improve income distribution and accelerate land
reform.  These, together with the faster decision making apparent recently,
,he adoption of a new tax systemr and the forthcoming adoption of a new economic



3-
development plan and a revised investment code give hope of accelerated
development and improved performance in the longer perspective of the new
plan period.
9.        The main objectives of the Third Plan are (1) to accelerate output
growth, particularly for export, (2) to improve the distribution of income
gains among the population, and (3) to ensure balanced economic and social
development among regions. It maintains existing priorities for agriculture,
professional training, education and tourism, and puts increased emphasis on
employment creation and export-oriented industries. It also calls for more
public spending on social services, notably public health, community services
and housing. Targets for annual growth in real terms are: for GDP 7.5 per-
cent, exports 10 percent, investment 18 percent and domestic saving 21 percent
from 1973 to 1977. These are high compared to past performance. The objec-
tives, strategy and targets of the Plan generally seem to be in the right
direction, and Morocco has considerable potential for growth, particularly
in irrigated agriculture, manufacturing and tourism. However, the attain-
ment of the Plan targets would severely tax the implementation capacity of
the Government, both to carry out its own program of expenditures and re-
forms, and induce the required dynamism in the private sector. There is
therefore a possibility of shortfalls. A firmer assessment will have to
await the results of the next economic mission, now in the field.
10.       The Plan assumes that sizable increases in external financing will
be obtained to supplement rising private and public savings for the financing
of projected investments. Regarding the Government's investment program, the
Plan calls for $860 million in net external financing compared with $360 mil-
lion during the Second Plan. This large increase implies strenuous efforts
on the part of the Government to improve project preparation and aid coordina-
tion. At the end of 1972, Morocco's external public debt amounted to an es-
timated $815 million on a disbursement basis. Service payments on this debt
decreased somewhat to a level of 8 percent of goods and services exports.
Morocco retains the capacity to service substantial additional debt. Imple-
mentation of the new Plan will probably put the balance of payments under
more pressure than before and the debt service ratio will in that case rise
to higher levels.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MIOROCCO
11.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco consists of 18 projects amounting
to $325.6 million (net of cancellations), of which $121 million over the last
two years. Four projects have been financed under IDA credits totalling $36.8
million. IFC investments amount to $2.9 million. The sectoral distribution of
these operations is as follows: 32 percent in agriculture, 6 percent in edu-
cation, 35 percent in industry, 4 percent in transportation, 8 percent in tour-
ism, and 15 percent in urban water supply. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of July 30, 1973, and
notes on the execution of on-going projects. The implementation of projects
is often slow to start, but with time performance usually improves. The Sebou



-4-
irrigation project (Loan 643-MOR of November 13, 1969 for $46 million) on
which little progress was made for a long time, is a case in point. Initially
hampered by management difficulties, the slow processing of necessary land
reforms and a flood of unprecederted magnitude in 1970 substantially delayed
progress. At present, however, the project is proceeding well. Project im-
plementation by the three autonomous financial institutions in agriculture,
industry and tourism to which the Bank lends, is generally satisfactory.
12.       The Bank Group program aims at a£sisting Morocco in the implementa-
tion of po]4-ies to curtail uinemployment, develop agriculture and industry,
and improve urban and rural living conditions, and in furthering necessary
institutional and sectoral reforms. The Third Five Year Plan (1973-1977)
proposes a much more ambitious development program than the modest Second
Plan (1968-1972). This enlarges the scope for potential Bank contribution to
Morocco's development. When the Bank has completed its review of the new Plan,
discussions will be held with the Goveriment on how the Bank can best assist
with the implementation of the Plan, However, the pace at which Bank Group
iending can be zarried out will continue to depend largely on the speed with
which the Government prepares ?rojects and takes related policy decisions.
13.       In the financing of agricultural projects the Bank has so far helped
develop large scale irrigation schemes and agricultural credit of the tradi-
tional type and further projects of that type are under preparation for Bank
Group consideration. in this connection, the Bank has stressed the importance
of efficient organization of the sector, of land reform and of the development
of small scale farms.  The Government has recently accelerated land distribu-
tion and is presently preparing projects for small farmers for which it is ex-
pected to seek financing.
14.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.   Two
IDA credits have been made for educationi and a third project is under prep-
aration for later consideration. The first two projects, however, have en-
countered some difficulties (see Annex II) but performance has recently im-
proved. The Government has recently requested that a UNESCO project iden-
tification mission, in the framework of the Bank UNESCO cooperative program,
visit the coun_ry to help identify the third project.
15.       The financing of _-Austry and tourism has so far been made through
the two DFC's (Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique and Credit
Immniobilier et Hotelier).  Whi2- these DFC's are expected to continue to be
main channels for Bank lending in these sectors, the Bank is presently ap-
praising a large phosphoric acid project and is helping to prepare a tourism
i-nfrastructure project as Executing Agency for a UNDP financed study. Proj-
ects in these sectors help Morocco to enlarge its foreign exchange earnings
and thley also -provide an opportunity for the Bank to help improve sectoral
policies and encourage the creat;on of employment opportunities.
16.       The first transportation loan, a $14.6 million Bank/IDA blend, was
for a highrway project and included financing of a sector review wnich is now
serving as a basis for future transport investments as well as recommendations
on transport policy. Already, a second highway project has been appraised by
the Bank.



-5-
17.       The first Bank financing of public utilities in urban areas is the
$48 million Water Supply loan signed in July 1972, and the second is the
presently proposed $25 million power project. By means of these two projects
the Bank is trying to help the Government to bring about much needed improve-
ments in the organization of public utilities. The social problems due to
currently rapid urbanization are also expected to be tackled directly through
a site and services project which is being prepared with the Bank's assistance.
18.       A consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April, 1967.    It
includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, the Netherlands,
Spain, the U.K., the U.S., IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African Development
Bank and the European Investment Bank. The Group last met in October, 1971,
when it welcomed the Government's new polices and affirmed continued support
for Morocco. The next meeting of the Consultative Group is tentatively sched-
uled for the spring of 1974. It will consider Morocco's Third Five Year Plan
(1973-77). Official foreign assistance to Morocco has shown a rising trend,
from a total DH 651 million in 1966, to DH 848 million (of which DH 92 mil-
lion in grants) in 1971. The major sources of aid were the U.S., Germany,
the Bank Group and France.
19.       At the end of 1971, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's external
public debt was 10 percent on a disbursement basis, and 19 percent including
undisbursed amounts. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was 13 per-
cent in 1971. Future trends in these shares will be easier to establish after
the Government's program of external borrowing during the Third Plan period
(1973-77) has been reviewed by the current economic mission and considered
by members of the Consultative Group for Morocco in spring 1974. The Bank
Group's share in public debt will probably remain on the same level, and on
the basis of undisbursed amounts it is likely that the share in debt service
will tend to rise slightly.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN MOROCCO
20.       Power is available to roughly one third of Morocco's population of
15 million, mostly in urban centers. In 1971 per capita consumption of power
was 120 kWh, about the same as in other Maghreb countries. By the end of 1972
total installed capacity was about 870 MW of which 150 MW (i.e. about 17 per-
cent) was captive plant owned mainly by large industries. The remainder be-
longed to the public power sector. The power system is well designed and
operated; this is reflected in the relatively low losses in production and
transmission. Plant losses were 4 percent of gross production, and trans-
mission losses 12.5 percent.
21.       The bulk of the power sector, previously controlled by four private
companies, was nationalized almost 10 years ago, and at present comprises:



'0 -
Office National de 1'Electricite (ONE), a Government-owned
enterprise which generates practically all electric power
and transmits it to the main load centers; it is also respo-n-
sible for some distribution outside large cities and accounts
for 40 percent of retail sales;
-    Twelve municipal regies, which are departments of municipal-
ities; they purchase power in bulk from ONE and distribute it
in _he main urban centers, accounting for 58 percent of sales
to consumers; they also handle water distribution;
-    Ministry of the Interior, which operates small systems in about
110 isolated localities; ONE is responsible for the maintenance
of these systems, the total sales of which come to only 0.3
percent of public consumption;
-    Electras Marroquies, which remains in private hands, has limited
generation facilities and also buys bulk power from ONE: its sales
come to 2 percent of public consumption and are concentrated in
the northern part of the country.
22.       Jurisdiction over the Moroccan power sector is divided between two
ministries. ONE, the main generator of power, and Electras Marroquies are
under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works, wlhile the municipal
regies and the small systems are under the Ministry of the Interior. Author-
itv within the sector is, however, diffuse due to a lack of adequate legis-
lation, and the scope of operations of the various power entities and the
relationship between them are not adequately defined. This matter was dis-
cussed during negotiations and the Government has decided to engage consul-
tants to study the present organization of the sector and to assist in the
formulation of sound policies for its improvement.
23.       The lack of cohesiveness and coordination in the power sector has
also resulted in financial and economi;ic imbalances between the "production"
and "distribution" portions of the sector, While ONE internally finances
about 27 percent of its development program, the regies, without recourse to
borrowing, currently financq the total of their investment requirements and
generate a surplus as well.   The financial results of the regies' operations
indicate a distortion of the tariff structure in favor of the regies. Power
tariffs have, in the main, remained unchanged for 14 years, they are disparate,
and do not reflect the cost of supply. The above-mentioned study of the orga-
nization of the sector also includes a study of the tariff structure at the
distribution (retail) level.



-7-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Power Project Office National de
l'Electricite Morocco" (No. 26a-MOR dated August 22, 1973) is being distributed
separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. The project
was appraised in July 1972 but due to delays in processing the appraisal and
the need to update cost estimates and financial forecasts, negotiations were
postponed. An updating mission visited Morocco in March 1973. Negotiations
for the proposed loan were held in Washington D.C. on April 2 to 6, 1973.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. Tazi, General Manager of ONE; ,Ir. Bekkali,
also representing ONE; and Mr. Essaghir from the Ministry of Finance. Board
presentation of the project was delayed, however, pending final Government
agreement on outstanding issues.
The Borrower
5.        The proposed Borrower is the Office National de l'Electricite (ONE),
which was created as a Government-owned enterprise in 1963. The Royal Decree
creating ONE is essentially a charter of incorporation defining in detail its
role in the sector. In the past two years ONE has prepared several drafts
for the regulation of its operations (Cahier des Charges), defining its
rights and duties and those of its customers without, however, reaching
agreement with the other interested parties. The latest draft will be im-
plemented as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. It is ac-
ceptable to the Bank.
26.       ONE has a six-member Board of Directors, which limits itself to
general policy and leaves all specific decisions to management. The Board
is chaired by the Minister of Public Works, the other five Board members
being high-level civil servants. Management is generally satisfactory.
There is still a number of expatriate advisers. ONE's General Manager,
his deputy and department heads are all Moroccans. The process of Moroc-
canization is being implemented as trained Moroccans become available for
line positions. ONE has an effective engineering organization, but the ac-
counting and financial aspects of management are weak. A senior officer is
to be appointed which should result in a greater degree of control and finan-
cial management. There are no audit requirements under Moroccan law, although
a resident Ministry of Finance inspector checks and authorizes ONE's transac-
tions. ONE's accounts and financial statements will, however, be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
27.       By the end of 1972, ONE's generating capacity totalled 698 MW of
which 369 MW were hydro, 281 MW steam, 16 MW in one gas turbine, and 32 MW
diesel plants. Transmission facilities at the end of 1971 consisted of 340
km of lines at 225 kV, 1,665 km at 150 kV, 4,400 km at 60 kV, and 5,521 km
at 22 kV. Its distribution system totalled 1,950 km of 5.5 kV lines and
2,760 km of low voltage lines. Until the mid-sixties hydro-electric power
was ONE's main source of electricity. However, because most hydro potential
has already been exploited, ONE has had to turn to the construction of thermal



- 8 -
plants for meeting base load demand.   The main item of this thermal development
was the construction of a 165 MW[ coal fired steam plant at Jerada, the first
two 55 MW units of which ON'E cornissioned in 1971 and the third in 1972. The
plant was engineered, supplied and erected by the U.S.S.R.
28.       Planning of ONE's generation and transmission program is based on
a long-term plan set up with the help of Electricite de 'rance in 1967.    In
1970 and 1971 this comprehensive study was updated. The quality of the tech-
nical side ,A ONE's planning is high. ONE will, however, continue to employ
consultants for the planning and design of future thermal plants.    On the
distribution side, planning is satisfactory and is carried out mainly by
ONE's distribution department.,
29.       Through 1971 the Government has been paying for half of ONE's major
investment costs by means of grants, and because of this, long-term debt rep-
resents only 25 percent of OIN1E's capitalization. This proportion is not ex-
pected to increase through 1977 even though the Government has advised ONE
that future capital support will only be 34 percent of major investment costs
and despite borrowings of DH 353 million (US$84 million), including the pro-
posed Bank loan.   ONE's debt service requirements are consequently relatively
modest, so that in spite of a low financial rate of return - only 2.6 percent
is expected in 1973 - ONE fineances about 27 percent of its investment out of
internal resources. The low financial rate of return is partly due to the
fact that ONE's asset base recently was revalued on a replacement basis and
includes major plant (the Jerada steam plant) yielding a low return, the in-
stallation of which reflects the Government's desire to increase the use of
coal from its Jerada coal mine so as to save foreign exchange and to provide
employment and partly because ONE's bulk tariff is relatively low and enables
the distribution regies to achieve substantial surpluses on power sales. The
Government and ONE have, however, recognized that ONE's tariffs should be suf-
ficient to provride an adequate rate of return on realistically valued average
net fixed assets in operation. Rates of return would be increased progres-
sively so as to achieve at least 7 percent by 1981, but will be reviewed
after completion of the ongoing tariff study (paragraph 23).
The Project
30.       The project proposed for Bank financing is part of ONE's 1973-77
investment program, which is estimated to cost DH 975 million (US$232 million).
The five-vear program provides for the upgrading of most of the existing 150-kV
transmission system to 225 kV and the expansion of this system to interconnect
Lhe major production and consuimption centers.
31.       The proposed project comprises:
i.   the -nstallation of two 20-MW gas turbines, at Agadir and
Tangiers;
ii.   the construction of 563 km of 225-kV transmission line and one
substation;



iii.   the upgrading from 150 to 225 kV of 340 km of line, and the
upgrading or extension of 8 existing substations;
iv.   consulting services for studies of future generation expansion
and tariffs.
32.       The estimated total cost of the project, including physical and price
contingencies, is equivalent to $39.4 million. The proposed loan of $25 million
would finance 63 percent of estimated total project costs, equivalent to the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the project and the local value added in
contracts expected to be awarded to local suppliers. This is justified on proj-
ect grounds. Of the contracts already awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding to local suppliers, such suppliers were the only bidders in
80 percent of the cases and were the lowest bidders for practically all the
other contracts. Detailed cost estimates are summarized in Annex III.
33.       The gas turbines included in the project will provide peaking capac-
ity in Morocco's interconnected system and will increase the reliability of
supply in the Agadir and Tangiers areas which are located at the extremes of
ONE's transmission system, both between 300 and 400 km from the main generat-
ing plants. The construction of new transmission lines and the upgrading of
existing ones, together with works on related substations form part of the
build-up of the main transmission system in Morocco.   While the gas turbines
will be of stanaard industrial type and, therefore, pre-designed by the manu-
facturer, ONE plans to continue designing the lines and substations using its
own engineers. ONE will also carry out construction supervision.
34.       Procurement of goods and services under the proposed loan is being
made in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. However, Bank procedures had
not been applied as far as the public opening of bids is concerned up to the
time of negotiations because ONE followed the official legal Moroccan require-
ments whereby all bids were opened in the presence of a statutory bid analysis
commission. This procedure, while providing safeguards against post-opening
changes in the substance of the bids, commensurate with the purpose of public
bid opening is not in agreement with Bank procedures and therefore it was
agreed during negotiations that procurement for outstanding contracts will
follow the Guidelines in all respects, including bid opening. Bid evaluation
is on the basis of a cost comparison at the place of delivery exclusive of
taxes and duties and takes into account a 15 percent preference for local
suppliers or the actual tariff applicable, whichever is lower. Of the con-
tracts to be financed under the proposed loan, Moroccan suppliers are likely
to win contracts amounting to $6.2 million for transmission line towers, steel
structures, civil works and erection.   The local value added of these contrac_s
is estimated to be $1.4 million.
35.       Disbursement from the proposed loan would cover (i) the full CIF
cost of equipment procured abroad; (ii) the full ex-factory cost (less iden-
tifiable taxes) of equipment contracts won by Moroccan manufacturers under
the 15 percent local preference evaluation procedures; (iii) 50 percent (i.e.
the estimated average foreign exchange component) of the civil works and erec-
tion parts of contracts for gas turbines, or substations and 30 percent for
similar works for transmission lines; and (iv) the foreign exchange cost of
consultant services.



36.       In view of the urgency and time constraints of the project, the
Bank had approved bid invitations cturing appraisal for approximately 50 per-
cent of the then proposed loan, in the expectation that loan negotiations
would be concluded in Late 1i72, and that retroactive financing would not
exceed US$0.5 million for con.tracts awarded prior to loan presentation.  Sub-
sequent delays in processing the project ana in the need to update cost esti-
raates and financial forecasts a&d after negotiations to reach agreemient with
the Government have caused a fu-ther oacklog of contracts awaiting award.
The Bank, in order riot to delay the project still further, has therefore con-
curred with award of contracts for ano.her 30 percent of the project cost,
involving total retroactive financing, sinice January 1, 1973, of about US$2.2
million.
37.       The ecological impact of the gas turbines is negligible because
the turbines will be situated on the coast outside population centers and
convection air currents will maKe a concentration of fumes unlikely. The
proposed transmission lines also avoid population centers and run mostly
through sparsely populated, semi-desert regions where aaenity considera-
tions are minimal.
38.       The benefits of the project arise mainly from savings in system
operating costs, but there are also other benefits, some of wnich are un-
quantifiable. The economic rate of return on the investment in gas turbines
is about 11 percent. This uriderstates the full economic return, since it
takes no account oL the further benefits in the form of the reduction in
power failures and associated ezonomic losses resulting from the increased
security of supply with the gas turbines. The economic rate of return of
the transmission lines and substations varies from 13 to 20 percent. As
with the gas turbines, this und-rstates the full return, since it takes no
account of the unquantiLied ber;n_its attributable to the greater security
of supply with these transmission lines.

Cr. io. 79  7irst 'Education Project:  US $11 million Credit of October 11, 1965:
Closing Date:  September 30, 19714.
Considerable dela;;s l-ave affected the implementation of the project,
which  has been considered   p ,roblem project since 1968.  However, performance
has improved significantly since September, 1972;   construction and equipment
of all schools (except industrial equipment in two schools) has been completed,
and all schocls are in use, oroject management is now satisfactory, construc-
tion accounts have been brouight up-to-date, loca'l funds have been released for
the project and the Association's procurement procedures for international
oidd'ing for furniture and ecuipment are being followed.  The Closing Date has
been extended three times from 'the origin.1 d:te of Tune 30, 19S71, to Septem-
ber 3), 1974,L to allow for rebidding of the industrial eoui`pmenz and complete
disbursements ($1.9 million remained undisbursed at end J'uly 1973).
Cr.     2(c. 2(  Second 3ducaticn Project:  US $8.5 million Credit Of August 1. 1971;
Closing Datee  April 30, 1976.
The project included the exoansion and irmprovement of specific sections
of the secondary, vocational ancd higher educational systems of the Borrower,
and technical assistance for project administration and ,chool miaintenance.
Subsequently the Association agreed not to finance the two Vocational Training
Centers and tne Denariment of Veterinary iMedicine.  Accordingly, an estimated
amount of' US $1..0 million or 11.8 per cent of' the Credit, representing the
financing of the above-mentioned project Items, has been transferred to the
unallocated ca-egorv for future reallocation and/or cancellation.
The project is about ten months behind schedule due to earliy delays
.n the appointment of conslLItan; architects and in the recruitment of' local
personnel and technical ass-istance _-perts for the Project Unit. Imlement-
ation has progressed significantly since September, 197:', but no disbursements
had been made by the end of ;o'_, 1973.   The poroject is nevertheless ex-ected
to be cormleted by the C< CS''!'-:, Date of April 3'D, 1976.

progress o pro, jects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lea,s TATnich are being encountered, and the action being ta'ken to remedy
thr`1. m he. should be read in this sense, a-d with the understanding that

Ln. No. 642, Cr. No. 167  Highway Project;   US $14.6 million of November 13,
i969; Closing Date: February 28, 1974.
The first highway project is progressing satisfactorily, after some
initial delays. By July 1973 only $8.6 million had been withdrawn out of the
combined credit/loan, mainly because of cumbersome Government disbursement
procedures. The supervision mission in July 1973 discussed ways of expediting
paymrents.
Ln. No. 643  Irrigation Project;   US $46 million Loan of November 13, 1969;
Closing Date: November 30, 1978.
After initial management difficulties, progress in implementing the
project is satisfactory. However, distribution to small farmers of foreign-
owned lands which were to be expropriated has not proceeded rapidly mainly
because Government was revising its policy on land reform on a national basis.
Government has now decided to nationalize all foreign owned lands and distribution
in the project area is expected to resume in the near future. A flood of
unprecendented magnitude occurred in 1970. A reassessment of flood damage
was then conducted under the project and indicated the need for additional
work to protect the project. Experience gained in the course of project
implementation confirmed that sugar cane could be successfully cultivated in
the project area but that its harvest would overlap with that of sugar beet,
requiring construction of a new sugar cane factory and reinforcement of the
m ad network. A second project to provide for the additional investment now
required is expected to be appraised in October/November 1973.
Ln. No. 660  Fourth BNDE Project; US $15 million of March 6, 1970;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1973.
The amount of the loan was reduced to $11.8 million following a
cancellation of $3.2 million as BNDE was unable to comply with the 90-day rule
following the terminal date for submission of projects. At the Closing Date of
June 30, 1973, BNDE had requested disbursements for a total of $11.5 million.
All requests have subsequently been processed, leaving $0.3 million undisbursed.
Ln. No. 704 First Hotel Development Project; US $10.0 million of August 12, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Disbursements have been lagging behind commitments as construction
of some hotels ran into difficulties in 1971-72 and cancellation of a limited
amount of the loan is possible. By the end of July, disbursements amounted
to $5.0 million.
Ln. No. 736 Fifth BNDE Project: US $35 million of May 20, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The Terminal Date for the submission of projects has been postponed
from June 30, 1973, to December 30, 1973.   Due mainly to sluggish investment
activity disbursements fell behind operations in 1971 and 1972, but with the
return of investors' confidence disbursements are expected to pick up the lag.

Ln. No. 8L8  Second Hotel Develpoment Project;  US $15 million of June 30, 1972;
Closing Date: Decomber 31, 1976.
Commitments are lagging somewhatc behind expectations and the loan should
be fully committed by mid-1974, as against original estimates oI year-end 1973.
Ln. No. 850  Water Supply Pro jet;  US $48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Water Supply Project was declared effective only on May 2, 1973.
A supervision mission visited Morocco in june and reported thati substantial
efforts have been made by the Government to clarify ONEP s funct'ions5
strengthen its financial autonomy, and enforce water tariffs applicable to
distribution agencies. Although some problems remain, progress is acceptable.
The Bank will keep in close touch with the situation.
Ln. No. 861, Cr. No. 338 Seccond Agricultural Credit Pro-ject; US $34.0 million
o' October 10, 1972;  Closing Date: Agust 31, 1976.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily and disbursements had
reached $4.1 million by the end of July.
Ln. No. 890  Sixth BNDE Projects  US $2L million of May 14, 1973;   Closing
Date:  December 31, 1976.
The date of effectiveness has been extended to September 10, 1973,
because of delays in the transmiLttal to the Bank of documents necessary for
the effectiveness of the loa-r an;d to give the Bank an opportunity to review
these docurnents.
