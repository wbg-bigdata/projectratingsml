APPRAISAL OF
A POWER PROJECT
OFFICE NATIONAL DE LtELECTRICITE
MOROCCO
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project to expand the genera-ion
and transmission facilities of Office National de l'Electricite (ONE), the
Government-owned enterprise responsible for generating electriciLy for public
consumption and for distributing energy outside large cities. In large cities
municipal enterprises ("regies") distribute power purchased from 0NE.
ii.       The proposed project is part of ON.E's 1973-1977 construction program
which is estimated to cost DH 975 million (US$232 million). The Project
comprises:
(i) the installation of two 20-MW gas turbines at Agadir and
Tangier;
(ii)  the construction of 563 kIn of 225-kV transmission line
and one substation.
(iii)  the upgrading from 150 to 225 kV of 340 km of line, and the
upgrading or extension of 8 existing substations.
(iv) consulting services for studies of future generation expansion
and tariffs.
OTNE expects to commission the gas turbines in 1974 and 1975, and plans the
completion of the transmission facilities by early 1976. The proposed US$25
million loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of this project,
the total cost of which would be DF 166 million (US$39.4 million). It would
be the first Bank loan for power in Morocco.
iii.      The gas turbines included in the proposed project are to provide
peaking capacity in Yorocco's interconnected system and to increase the
reliability of supply in the Agadir and Tangier areas. The economic return
on the gas turbine investment is about 11%. The proposed transmission lines
and substations form part of the expansion of the main transmission system in
Morocco. A new 225-kV system as compared to the extension of the existing
150-kV system is the least cost alternative for all discount rates up to 20%.
The economic return on the transmission investment is at least 13%.
iv.       The Bank would disburse for:
(i) the full CIF cost of equipment procured abroad;



- ii -
(ii)  100% of the cost (less identifiable taxes) of equip-
ment contracts won by Moroccan manufacturers who
would be allowed a 15% preference of the CIF costs
for bid evaluation;
(iii)  50% of the cost of the civil works and the erection
portions of the installation contracts for the gas
turbines and substations and 30% of similar costs
f_; the transmission lines; and
(iv) the foreign exchange cost of consulting services.
v.        The presentation of the proposed loan to the Board of Directors
of the Bank has been unusually delayed because of country reasons following the
negotiations which took place in April 1973. It is recommended that retroactive
financing not exceeding US$2.2 million be accepted in respect of payments
against supply contracts and for engineering services that have had to be
made after the date of the appraisal to avoid delaying the project.
vi.       Through 1971 the Government has been paying for half of ONE's major
equipment costs by means of grants, and because of this, long-term debt
represents only 25% of ONE's capitalization. This proportion is not expected
to increase through 1977 despite borrowings of DH 353 million (US$84 million),
including the proposed Bank loan. ONE's debt service requirements are conse-
quently relatively modest, so that in spite of a low financial rate of return,
ONE finances about 27% of its investment out of internal resources. In
connection with the proposed loan, the Government and ONE have accepted the
principle that ONE's tariffs should be sufficient to provide an adequate rate
of return on realistically valued average net fixed assets in operation. Rates
of return would be increased progressively so as to achieve at least 7% by
1981, but would be reviewed with ONE after completion of an ongoing study of
the tariffs including the cost and incidence of these on the economy, expected
for early 1974.
vii.      There are no audit requirements under Moroccan law, although a
resident Ifinis-ry of Finance inspector checks and authorizes ONE's transactions.
ONE has agreed to appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.  It has
also agreed to engage a senior financial executive to eliminate existing
weaknesses in financial control.
viii.     Jurisdiction over the Moroccan power sector is divided between two
major ministries and this has resulted in difficulties and delays in overall
planning and in financial and economic imbalances between the "production"
and "distribution" portions of the sector. These problems have been discussed
between the Bank and the government both before and after negotiations, and
the government has decided to engage consultants to study the present organiza-
tion of the sector and to advise and assist in the formulation of sound policies
for its improvement.
ix.       In view of the agreements reached with the Government and ONE as
set forth in Section 7, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$25 million to ONE for 20 years including 4 years' grace.



APPRAISAL OF
A POER PROJECT

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million would assist the most
important power entity in Morocco, the Government owned Office National de
l'Electricit4 (ONE), in financing the 1973-75 part of its 1973-77 investment
program. It would be the first Bank loan for power in Morocco.
1.02      In 1971, Morocco's electric power system, with an installed capacity
of 663 MW, reached about one-third of the country's 15 million people.
Electricity consumption per capita was 120 kWh, about the same as in other
Maghreb countries (Algeria: 130 kWh; Tunisia:  115 kWh).
1.03      Much remains to be done to provide electricity to the bulk of
Morocco's population, particularly to people with modest incomes. The
Government will be able to assign to this task the proper priority within
its economic program only after it has formulated a comprehensive power sector
policy. To this end and after prolonged discussions with the Bank, the Govern-
ment has decided to engage consultants to advise the Government and the Borrower
on the requirements and steps to be taken to unify and improve the organization
of the power sector so as to ensure a judicious allocation of scarce capital
resources available to the sector.
1.04      Bank staff conducted identification missions to Morocco in 1965-66
and 1968. As a result, the Bank suggested a study of ONE's requirements in
general and particularly its capacity to generate internally a reasonable
portion of its investments. EdF carried out the study in 1970, and in
September 1971 updated their conclusions which, among other things, called
for a new accounting system. In February/March and November 1971 Messrs. C.
De Beaufort, R. Ribi and E. Wessels reviewed progress made in the implementation
of the new accounting system and in the preparation of a project suitable for
Bank financing. Messrs. R. Ribi, R. du Mee and H. Maeda appraised the project
in July 1972. Messrs. W.F. Kfipper and A.J.D. Hutchins visited Morocco in
March 18-25, 1973 to update the information for this report.
2. THE SECTOR
History
2.10      Until the early sixties the public power sector of the Kingdom of
Morocco consisted of four private companies, Energie Electrique du Maroc
(EEM), Societe' Marocaine de Distribution (SMD), Societe Che'rifienne d'Energie



-2-
(SCE), Electras Marroquies, and some small installations operated by the
Ministry of the Interior. The first three companies vere founded in 1923
and owned by French interests and Electras Marroquies, also founded in the
twenties, was owned by Spanish investors.
2.02      EEM was granted a concession to generate and transmit electric
energy to the main load centers but progressively also distributed power to
ultimate conisumers through subsidiaries with concessions outside the main
cities.  SI) used to purchase the bulk of the energy produced by EEM for
distribution in and around the large cities, and SCE was founded to manage
and maintain isolated systems owned by the Government or, in exceptional
cases, by municipalities. Finally, Electras Marroquies, generated, transmitted
and distributed power in Spanish Morocco (including Tangier), which was
integrated into the Kingdom of Morocco in 1956.
2.03      In 1962, when SMD's concession in Casablanca expired, the muncipality
of Casablanca took over those SMD assets located within its territory and
created a municipal enterprise - Regie Autonome de Distribution (regie).
During the subsequent years when the other concessions of SND ended, most of
the other cities followed the example of Casablanca and created their own
"regies" (see 2.10).
2.04      In 1963, the Government purchased the assets of EEM and transferred
them together with EEM's concession to a newly-founded Government enterprise,
the Office National de l'Electricite' (ONE) which also took over the distribu-
tion in those cities where municipalities did not create r4gies. In 1965
the Government integrated SCE into ONE. The only entity private remaining is
Electras Marroquies whose concession was substantially curtailed when, in 1967,
the city of Tangier interconnected with ONEts transmission system and created
a regie.
2.05      Thus today, the public power sector comprises:
(i) ONE, generating practically all electric power, transmitting
it to the load centers, and distributing some of this energy
(i.e. about 40% of public consumption) outside the large cities;
(ii) the twelve municipal regies, purchasing their power from
ONE and distributing it in and around the large population
centers and accounting for 58% of public consumption;
(iii)  Electras Marroquies, still privately owned, with limited
installed capacity and distribution area in the extreme
north of the country, accounting for 2% of public consumption; and
(iv) the Ministry of the Interior which manages and operates small
systems in about 110 isolated localities, where ONE is responsible
for maintenance; however, sales in these systems do not aggregate
more than 0.3% of total public consumption (see also 2.09 and
Annex 1).



-3-
Power Sector Organization
2.06      Although the Government nationalized the bulk of thLe power sector
almost 10 years ago, there is still little coordination betweten the various
power entities, and the legal, financial and economic relationship between
these entities remains extremely complex. This is illustrated by the following:
(i)  ONE and Electras Marroquies are under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Public Works, but the regies and thLe small
systems are under the Ministry of the Interior and little
coordination exists between the two ministries;
(ii)  up to 1971 the Government used to contribute about 50% toward
ONE's investment in major plant in the form of grants. As
from 1973 the Government plan is to reduce this percentage to
34%.
(iii) the Government subsidizes the cost of coal supplied! to ONE
from its Jerada mine. ONE pays DH55/t, which compaLres with
a current production cost of about DH96/t, including depreciation
and financing charges but excluding identifiable taxes and
duties;
(iv)  while ONE earns a very low return on its invested capital and
finances internally about 27% of its development program, the
regies, without recourse to borrowing, currently finance 100%
of their investment and generate a cash surplus as well, i.e.,
assuming approximate equal average capital cost requirements
for the generating and for the distributing sector, the power
sector as a whole internally finances at least 50% of overall
power development, which is adequate but for the apparent
inequities in sharing revenue; and
(v) the present power tariffs which, in the main, have remained
unchanged for 14 years are disparate and do not reflect the
cost of supply.
The Government, in the face of this confusing situation, has asked Electricite
de France (EdF) under ONE's supervision to:
(i) study the impact of the cost of electricity on the costs of
of Moroccan products and services and on the competitiveness
of Moroccan manufacturers;
(ii)  study the present relationship between the cost of supplying
electricity (including the incidence of the local and imported
fuel prices) and the tariffs; and
(iii)  submit proposals for possible modifications in the tariffs.



-4-
This assignment whose Terms of Reference (see Annex 7) are acceptable to the
Bank, is progressing satisfactorily and should be completed by the end of 1973.
During negotiations the Government and ONE agreed that they would discuss
with the Bank the conclusions of EdF's study and the measures they propose
to take in connection with the results of this study so that ONE's rate
of return can be modified appropriately by mutual agreement (see 6.11).
2.07      Authority within the sector is diffuse and ill defined due to a
lack of adequate power sector legislation. Thus the scope of operations
of the various power entities and the relationship between the entities
are not defined. The Royal Decree that created ONE is essentially a charter
of incorporation (not a law) defining in detail its role in the sector. In
the past two years, ONE has prepared several drafts for the regulation of
its operations, defining its rights and duties and those of its customers
without, however, reaching agreement with the other interested parties.
The latest draft of these regulations or "cahier des charges" (for a summary
see Annex 8) is acceptable to the Government and the Bank, and ONE have agreed
that the "cahier des charges" be approved as a condition of effectiveness
of the loan.
2.08      The ultimate objectives of coordinating the electricity sector by
subordinating the whole sector to a single authority, and of formulating
one comprehensive power sector policy and legal basis, including the setting
and regulation of tariffs, is unlikely to be achievable in the short term
because the major question of Ministerial jurisdiction has significant
political implications. After further examination of the question subsequent
to the negotiations for the loan;, the government has undertaken to engage
consultants to study the reorganization of the electricity sector. This
study will be undertaken by EdF under the terms of reference which are accepta-
ble to the Bank and will take into account the results of its ongoing tariff
study and the conclusions reached in discussions with the Bank after the latter
study has been completed. The Government is expected to discuss the EdF
recommendations for the reorganization of the sector with the Bank prior to
or in connection with any future loan that may be proposed for electricity
projects.
Installed Capacity and Sales
2.09      By the end of 1972 the total installed capacity in Morocco was
about 870 MW of which 150 MW (i.e. about 17%) was captive plant owned
mainly by large industries. A capacity of 718 MW belonged to the public
power sector. Hydro plants accounted for 52% (373 MW) of this capacity.
steam plants for 39% (281 MW), eiesel plants for 7% (48 MW), and gas
turbine plants for 2% (16 MW). For details of sales in ONE's systems and
the systems connected to it, see Annex 1. The following table shows the
principal capacities and sales figures for the public supply sector.

Power plant losses were 4% of gross production, and transmission and distribu-
tion losses 12.5%. These relatively low losses (e.g. transmission and distri-
bution losses of a system of similar size in Mexico and in tlhe southern U.S.
are about 15% and 10% respectively) reflect the high standards used in designing
the Moroccan system and facilities. Annex 2 shows a breakdolwn of the sector's
sales by category of consumers.
The RJ'gies
2.10      The most important entities of the power sector besides ONE (which
is described in Chapter 3) are the 12 re'gies, which are departments of muni-
cipalities, and which distribute water and power (purchased from ONE) in the
main urban centers. Six of these rggies, Casablanca, Rabat-Sale,. Fes, Meknes,
Tangier and Marakech, with a total of 414,000 consumers in 1971, account for
about 90% of electricity sales by distributors other than ONE (see Annex 6).
2.11      In 1972, the twelve regies sold about 1,136 GWh to some 500,000
consumers and employed some 1,900 persons.  The re'gies pay ONE between
10 ctms (USd2.4) and 12 ctms (US42.9) per kWh. They add on to this
price from 52% (Casablanca) to 94% (Tangier), and sell to their own consumers
at a price varying between 16 ctms (M) (USd3.8) and 22 ctms (M) (US45.2) per
kWh, and in addition to charges for consumption, consumers also make sizeable
contributions in aid of construction.
2.12      In 1970 and 1971 the re'gies financed DH 83 million in expansion
of their distribution facilities out of internal resources and consumers'
contributions without recourse to borrowings and there was still a cash
surplus of about DE 16 millior., which was available for other public services.
During 1973-77 the re'gies have projections showing new construction of some
DH 298 million, also to be financed entirely by internal resources and consumers'
contributions.  This estimate is probably over optimistic hcwever, so in
practice the cash surplus on electricity operations is likely to exceed the
regies' forecast of DH 20 million.

3.01      ONE was created as a Government-owned enterprise by a Dahir (Royal
Decree) of August 5, 1963 which also vested in ONE the assets of EEM, the
former concessionaire. The Royal Decree further stated that the creation of
ONE did not affect existing concessions by municipalities except that, if
such a concession were to expire and the municipality did not create a regie,
ONE would take over distribution in that locality. ONE is responsible to
the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Finance exercises control
over ONE's finances in accordance with the Dahir of April 14, 1960, which
equally applies to all public enterprises (see 6.04).
Board
3.02      The Dahir of August 5, 1963 stipulates that ONE is to be controlled
by a Board chaired by the Minister of Public Works. The five other Board
members are representatives of the Ministries of the Interior, Finance,
Agriculture, Industry and Labor. They are appointed by Royal Decree for three
years and may be reappointed for further terms. The Board usually meets twice
a year with further meetings if special circumstances arise. It limits itself
to general policy and leaves all specific decisions to management.
Organization and Management
3.03      ONE's management is generally satisfactory.  The utility's Chief
Executive is the General Manager. The incumbent, a Moroccan electrical
engineer trained in France, has been ONE's General Manager since its creation.
He has led ONE, without major disruption, through the difficult period which
often occurs when a foreign-owned private utility is nationalized. The
General Manager is assisted by a deputy who at the same time heads the training,
financial, stores and procurement divisions. These are separate from the main
organizational structure of ONE which consists of four major departments:
Generation and Transmission, Distribution, Planning and Construction, and
Administration. All the department heads now Moroccans, three of them engineers
trained in France. They are competent but still rely heavily on foreign
assistants, who are gradually being transferred to advisory posts as trained
Moroccan specialists become available for line positions.
Personnel
3.04      At the end of 1971, ONE had a total of 3,855 employees; i.e. 11
(0.3%) more than a year before, and 880 (30%) more than in 1965; at the
same date, the number of foreigners (mainly French) employed by ONE was 150,
or 25 less than at the end of 1970. The size of ONE's staff is reasonable.
ONE has a relatively low number of customers (about 200,000 in 1971) in
relation to its installed capacity, because 61% of its sales are to
wholesale distributors and only 39% directly to ultimate consumers. This
combined with the fact that ONE distributes in the countryside and small
towns, as well as maintains much of the equipment of its major clients and



-7-
the small isolated undertakings of the Ministry of the Interior (paragraph 2.05),
results in a high sales per employee ratio of 0.45 GWh and a relatively
low ratio of customers per employee of 55:1. In any event, both sales per
employee, and customers per employee are increasing, which indicates that ONE's
efficiency is improving (Annex 9).
3.05      In recent years, ONE has been replacing expatriate staff by Moroccan
personnel. This process of "moroccanization" has been progressing smoothly
because the Government has allowed ONE to replace foreign employees at a
reasonably slow rate. The training of a sufficient number of skilled
Moroccan workers and middle echelon employees has been a major task, but ONE's
training center is efficient and trained about 200 people in various technical
skills in 1971. EdF has continued to train many ONE senior technicians (about
45 in 1971). However, while ONE's technical training efforts appear satisfactory,
there is little or no training given in finance and accounts (see 6.03).
3.06      In the short run ONE will have problems replacing senior qualified
men. In 1972 alone, about 60 French employees, or about one--third of the
expatriates remaining at the end of 1971, have left. Part of this reduction
was planned, but an unusually high number of senior employees chose not to
renew their contracts. ONE is likely to have to seek temporary staff from
EdF until Moroccans earmarked for major posts have completed their training.
ONE's Facilities
3.07      By the end of 1972, ONE's generating capacity totaLled 698 MW of which
369 MW were hydro (136 MW at Bin El Ouidane, 94 MW at Afourer-, 139 MW at 17
plants oE less than 35 MW), 281 MW steam (92 MW at Roches Noires near Casa-
blarnca, 165 MlW at the head of the Jerada coal mine, and 24 MW at Oujda which
will be scrapped during 1973), 16 MW in one gas turbine at Siidi Kacem, and
32 MW diesel plants.
3.08      Diesel plants totaling about 7 MW are installed in isolated systems.
The remaining 691 MW of ONE's installed capacity forms part of the inter-
connected system, in which the 1972 peak demand was 470 MW. The relatively
large difference between installed plant capacity and peak demand is due to
the low firm capacity of the hydro plants because these plants depend primarily
on water reserved for irrigation.  Furthermore, the firm capacity, as well as
the average production potential of the plants located downstream from expand-
ing irrigation areas, is decreasing steadily at an annual rate of about 2 to 3%
due to increasing upstream diversions. Only a small proportion of this water
returns to the river in the form of drainage water. These factors combine to
make the cost per kW of firm capacity (and thus ONE's rate base), and the
generating cost per kWh higher than would otherwise be the case.
3.09      Until the mid-sixties hydro-electric power was ONE's main source
of electricity. However, because most hydro potentials have already been ex-
ploited (and are steadily decreasing in power output), and new potentials are
in general either small or cannot be developed economically, ONE has had to
turn to the construction of thermal plants for meeting base load demand. It



did so, based on a long-term development study carried out by EdF in 1967
in connection with the preparation of the current five-year plan.
3.10      The main item of this thermal development was the construction
of a 165-MW coal fired steam plart at Jerada, the first two 55-MW units
of which ONE commissioned in 1971 and the third in 1972. The plant has
been engineered, supplied and erected by the U.S.S.R. Its financing was
based on a barter agreement between the Moroccan and the Russian Governments
as a result of which the cost of the plant is presently carried in ONE's books
at DH 269 million, which includes an unusually large village for staff quarters
costing some DH 23 million. The gross cost of this asset is equivalent to an
overall average installed cost of US$380 per kW 1/ including the staff quarters,
or US$350 1/ per kW without. This average cost further inflates ONE's rate
base, and even without the village is thought to be about 20% to 25% higher
than it would have been if procured under international competitive bidding.
The selection of this project was influenced by the Government's desire to
increase the use of coal from its Jerada coal mine so as to save foreign
exchange and to provide employment; and to utilize a foreign trade credit.
The plant was therefore not specifically selected on economic grounds although
the Government expects that, with ONE utilizing 60% of the anticipated (increas-
ed) output, the present heavy subsidy to the Jerada coal mine will be able
to be phased out by the end of the decade.
Planning
3.11      Planning of ONE's generation and transmission program is based on a
long-term plan set up by EdF in 1967. In 1970 and 1971 ONE's engineers in
collaboration with EdF, updated this comprehensive study, using a series of
computer programs to simulate ONE's generating and transmission systems.
At the same time, they expanded the study to include the detailed design
features for the items scheduled for construction. EdF is studying a 225-kV
interconnection with Algeria; th_s study is being financed by the African
Development Bank.
3.12      The quality of the technical side of ONE's planning is high.
However, ONE uses essentially financial rather than economic considerations
in justifying its investment decisions. Nevertheless, except for Jerada (see
3.10), the main facilities constructed in the past decade seem to be also
economically justified. During negotiations ONE confirmed that consultants
will be employed for the planning and design of the future thermal plant to be
completed during this decade, and to this end the foreign exchange cost of
the studies for the Roches Noires steam unit and further gasturbines at
Agadir and Tangier would be financed from the proposed loan.
1/   Calculated at the then prevailing rate of exchange of DH 4.66 = US$1
at current rates the equivalent figures would be about US$425 per
kW and US$390 per kW respectively.



-9-
3.13      On the distribution side ONE's planning is satisfactory.  It is
carried out entirely by ONE's distribution department except for that part
of rural electrification which is financed by Government contributions.
This is planned jointly by ONE and the communities involved and approved
by a special commission of the Ministry of Public Works.
3.14      By the end of 1971 ONE's transmission system consiisted of 340 km
of lines at 225 kV, 1,665 km at 150 kV, 4,400 km at 60 kV, and 5,521 km
at 22 kV, while its distribution system included 1,950 km of 5.5-kV lines
and 2,760 km of low voltage lines.
3.15      All of ONE's installations appear to be in very good working
condition.
Insurance
3.16      ONE presently insures only its major generating plants against
fire, for which the premium for 1971 was DH 0.4 million. ONE adopted this
philosophy in 1968 when it was found that the cost of fire premiums on other
installations would substantially exceed the value of the statistical risk
involved. ONE employs a full time expatriate insurance manager, who reviews
the situation from year to year and negotiates the premiums. During negotia-
tions ONE agreed to insure its assets for appropriate amounts with responsible
insurers against the usual risks and in accordance with sound practice.
4. THE PROJECT
ONE's 1973-1977 Investment Program
4.01      The Bank project is part of the first stage of ONE"s investment
program fEor the period 1973-1977 which corresponds to the Government's next
five-year economic plan. ONE's program includes work on some hydro plant,
450 MW of thermal plant, 1,030 km of 225-kV lines, 15 km of 150-kV lines,
1,200 km of 60-kV lines, 1,07C MVA of 60 to 225-kV substations, and DH 175
million of distribution expansion and rural electrification (see Annex 10).
This program has been defined with due regard to economy.
4.02      ONE expects to complete the following thermal plants during 1973-77:
(i)  two 20-MW gas turbine units, one at Agadir in 1973, the
other in Tangier in 1974, followed by a second couple of
20-MW units in 1976-77 at the same locations; and
(ii)  the third 60-MW oil-fired steam unit at Roches Noires (1975).
The other generating plants are expected to be completed after the end of the
1973-77 plan; the Kenitra steam plant (2 x 60 MW) in 1978-79, and the Mohammedia
steam plant (2 x 125 MW) in 1981-82; the feasibility study of the latter plants
is expected to show whether additional gas turbine plant would be required for
optimum clevelopment.



- 10 -
4.03      The five-year program provides for upgrading most of the existing
150-kV transmission system to 225 kV and the extension of this 225-kV system
to interconnect the major steam plants in the north-eastern corner of the
country, and Casablanca and Kenitra with the main consumption centers of
Casablanca, Rabat, Fes, Meknes, KeniLtra and Tangier. By 1981 only the
southern system will still transmit at 150 kV to Marrakech, Agadir and other
cities in that area.
4.04      Of the DH 161 million for distribution included in ONE's program,
DH 100 million is for the normal extension of ONE's distribution system and
DH 61 million for the electrification of small towns and villages, i.e. in
population centers of less than about 10,000 inhabitants. Of the latter,
part would be financed from a special fund consisting of 4% of ONE's annual
revenues, which is set aside to be used mainly for reinforcement and exten-
sion of existing systems in rural areas. The Government would provide the
remaining required funds which would be exclusively applied to bringing
electricity to new areas far from existing systems. The rural electrifica-
tion part of ONE's program is ambitious, and at the time of appraisal still
lacked a comprehensive development plan to allow an appropriate evaluation
of its merits.
4.05      The cost estimates for the Project and program are reasonable.  ONE
has based them on actual costs of equipment in the world market, on facil-
ities recently installed in Morocco and on bids received.   Allowance for
physical contingencies is adequate: up to 30% for civil works and 5% to 10%
for equipment. A price escalation of 5% is considered adequate for both local
and foreign exchange cost components because all main contracts have already
been awarded, some of which allow escalation up to a ceiling of 5Z.  Annex 10
gives an analysis of the total cost of ONE's 1973-77 investment program which
is estimated at Dff 975 million (US$232 million equivalent).
The Bank Project
4.06      A Bank loan of US$25.0 million to ONE for 20 years including 4 years
of grace is proposed to cover the full estimated foreign exchange cost of the
project. The components of ONE's 1973/77 investment program to be financed
from the proposed Bank Loan are:
(i) The installation of two 20 MW gas turbine units, one at
Agadir, the other at Tangier, to be commissioned in 1974
and 1975;
(ii)  the construction of a second 225 kV line Jerada-Oujda-Meknes,
a new 225-kV line Meknes-Kenitra, and the tie lines between
Kenitra and the existing Rabat-Tangier line; overall length
is estimated at 563 km and completion is expected by early
1975;
(iii) the construction of 20 km of 225-kV line (temporarily
operated at 63 kV) between the Roches Noires team plant and
the Tit Mellil substation in Casablanca (1975);



(iv)  the upgrading to 225 kV of the 340 km long existing 150-kV
line between Casablanca and Tangier; and
(v)  the cornstruction of a new 225-kV substation at Kenitra,
the extension of existing 225-kV substations at Oujda, Fes,
Meknes, Rabat and Casablanca, and the upgrading to 225 kV
of the existing 150 kV substation at Tangier; ONF expects
to complete these substations in 1976.
4.07      The purpose of the gas turbine units is not only to provide peak-
ing capacity but also to improve the reliability of supply in the Agadir
and Tangier areas which are situated at the extremes of ONE's transmission
system, both between 300 and 400 km from the main generating plants.
4.08      The 225-kV lines and substations included in the project represent
that part of the 225-kV system upgrading and expansion (see 4.03) which ONE
expects to construct substantially in 1973-75. They will increase the trans-
mission capability to meet the expected increased load in the load centers
and the increased capacity to be installed in the main thermal stations
(Jerada and Roches Noires). The Jerada-Kenitra line, in particular, will
allow transmission of the full capacity of Jerada (165 MW) whereas the
existing first line (financed by the African Development Bank) limits trans-
mission capacity to about 125 MW.  At the same time the line will improve the
reliability of the tie between Jerada and the main load centers.
4.09      Annex 11 gives a breakdown of the cost estimates for the project.
The foretign exchange component includes the cost of all equipment of poten-
tially foreign manufacturer, whether likely to be won by Moroccan manufac-
turers under local preference evaluation or not (see 4.15). The following
is a summary of these estimates:
DH (million)           US$ (million)      of Total
Local Foreign Total   Local Foreign  Total   Cost
Gas turbines                8.0    27.7   35.7    1.9        6.6    8.5     22

- 12 -
4.10      The cost of the gas turbines used in the above estimate corresponds
to a cost of about US$185 per kW erected, excluding taxes and customs duties.
This is reasonable because the high outside temperatures under which the units
will operate require units of about 23-25 MW nominal capacity to generate 20
MW continuously.
4.11      The cost of the transmission part of the project is based on the
results of bids received and recent construction costs. Excluding taxes and
duties, this estimate is equivalent to about US$18,000 per km of single circuit
225 kV line and US$6,200 per MVA of a 100 MVA transforming/switching substation
unit. These costs are considered reasonable.
Ecological Aspects
4.12      The ecological impact of the gas turbines is negligible because they
will both be situated on the coast outside population centers and convection
air currents will make a concentration of fumes unlikely. The proposed trans-
mission lines also avoid population centers and will run mostly through sparsely
populated, semi-desert regions where amenity considerations are minimal.
Design and Supervision
4.13      While the gas turbines will be of standard industrial type and,
therefore, pre-designed by the manufacturer, ONE plans to continue designing
the lines and substations using its own engineers, who are qualified to do so.
ONE will also carry out construction supervision through its own personnel;
this procedure is satisfactory.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.14      Procurement of goods and services under the proposed loan is being
made through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. However, the Bank's procedures had not been
followed as far as the public opening of bids is concerned up to the time of
negotiations because ONE had followed the official legal Moroccan requirements
in this respect whereby all bids were opened in the sole presence of a statutory
"Bid Analysis Commission" whose members comprise representatives of the ministries
of Public Works, Finance and Industries as well as ONE. Although this is not
strictly in accordance with the Bank requirements of public bid opening, Bank
staff confirm that the main purpose of public opening i.e. to provide safeguards
against post-opening changes in the substance of bids, was meticulously met
by the rigid ONE procedures. Except for the bid opening procedure, evaluation
and award proposals were in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. During
negotiations ONE agreed that the procurement procedures for outstanding con-
tracts will follow the Bank's Guidelines in all respects, including bid opening
procedures.
4.16      ONE evaluates bids and awards equipment contracts on the basis of
a cost comparison at the place of delivery exclusive of taxes and duties (i.e.,
the evaluated comparative costs would, as in the past, not reflect preferential



- 13 -
treaties), and takes into account a 15% preference for Moroccan manufacturers
which the Government has requested. Moroccan suppliers are expected to win
contracts amounting to an estimated US$11 million equivalent, mainly for
transmission line towers, steel structures, civil works, and erection. The
foreign currency component of these contracts would amount to about US$6.2
million equivalent.
4.16      Disbursement from the proposed loan would be made for the items
listed in Annex 12. They would cover:
(1)  the full CIF cost of equipment procured abroad;
(ii)  the full ex-factory cost (less identifiable taxes) of
equipmernt contracts won by Moroccan manufacturers tmnder
the 15% local preference evaluation procedures (see 4.15);
(iii)  50% (i.e. the estimated average foreign exchange component)
of the civil works and erection parts of contracts for gas
turbineE; or substations, and 30% for similar works for
transmission lines; and
(iv) the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
4.17      In view of the urgency and time constraints of the project, the
Bank has aipproved bid invitations issued in or after August 1972. The pro-
cessing o; the loan has been unusually delayed mainly because of country and
sector problems beyond the control of the borrower (see 2.08). The Bank,
in order not to delay the project, has agreed to the award of contracts for
about 80% of the project cost, which will involve a total retroactive financing
of about US$2.2 million (i.e. about 9% of the foreign exchange costs of the
project).
4.18      Annex 13 shows the expected schedule of loan disbursements.  The
proposed closing date for the loan of June 30, 1976, would allow enough time
to process applications for reimbursement and provide for some slippage in
the execution of the project. Any balance remaining on the loan account on
completion of the Project should be cancelled provided it is not required for
further studies by consultants of measures to meet ONE's continuing expansion
requirements.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Growth of Power Market
5.01      Since ONE was created in 1963, its sales have grown at an average
rate of 7.2%. However, the increases have been erratic from year to year and
appear to be relatied to the size of agricultural crops. Thus, in the dry year
1967, ONE's sales grew only by 3.4% while in 1969, when both water and crops
were abundant, sales increased by nearly 10%. Nevertheless a certain pattern



- 14 -
of annual growth during the past eight years becomes apparent: an average
rate of 5.2% during the period 1963-1967 when thb economy grew only slowly,
and a rate of 9.5% during the period 1967-1972. In forecasting maximum load
and energy consumption, both known future industrial loads and past experience
have been taken into account, resulting in a 9% annual increase in sales and
demand (Annex 5), slightly below the average of the last 5 years.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.02      Gas turbine or diesel plant is the only type of plant that can be
installed in time to meet the 1975 peak demand requirements. At the estimated
maximum of about 1000 hours of annual operation, gas turbine plant (which would
cost about US$40 kW less to erect than diesel plant, but would operate at a
higher cost of about US$mil 7/kWh) was found to be the least cost means of
meeting demand up to a discount rate of 15%.
5.03      The transmission items included in the project are part of the build-
up of the 225-kV system designed to interconnect ONE's main thermal plants and
the main centers of consumption (see Map). They will permit full utilization
of existing and planned generating capacity and also increase system reliability.
The only feasible alternative would be the reinforcement and extension of the
existing 150-kV system, but the 225-kV system was found to be the least cost
solution at discount rates up to at least 20%.
Economic Evaluation
5.04      The gas turbine and the transmission parts of the proposed project
were considered separately to determine their economic rate of return (ERR),
as shown in Annex 14. The following summarizes the procedures and results of
this study.
Costs and Benefits
5.05      For the economic evaluation of the proposed project the relevant
costs are the costs to the economy. Taxes and duties have to be excluded,
therefore, and shadow prices used in valuing project resource inputs whose
opportunity costs differ from their money costs to ONE. The main resources
required are foreign exchange, labor and fuel (coal and oil). Foreign ex-
change was valued at the prevailing official exchange rate. The labor re-
quired for the construction and operation of the project was valued at its
estimated money wages since it will largely consist of skilled and semi-
skilled grades for which there are alternative employment opportunities.
The labor required for mining the coal for the Jerada steam station, on the
other hand, consists mostly of unskilled workers, who would otherwise be
unemployed in view of the high level of unemployment in Morocco. It was
valued, therefore, at 50% of its money wage. Shadow prices were also used
for coal and oil, since the opportunity costs of these resources to the
economy differ from their prices to ONE.
5.06      The benefits of the project consist mainly of savings in system
operating costs which it will make possible, but there are also other benefits,



- 15 -
some of which are unquantifiable (see below). The benefits of the different
parts of the project were compared with the respective costs; as described in
Annex 14 and are summarized below.
Gas Turbines
5.07      The gas turbines are primarily designed for peakinig service in the
interconnected system but they will also increase the reliability of the power
supply :Ln the Agadir and Tangier areas. Their installation will result in
certain benefits,, quantifiable and unquantifiable, which could not be secured
by any alternative means on the same timescale. The quantifiable benefits
were derived by comparing the total costs to the economy over the assumed
15-year life of the turbines, given the projected load, of the system with
and without the gas turbines. These benefits consist of:
(i)  savings in system operating costs with the gas turbines,
since part of the energy which they will supply would
otherwise have to be generated by captive diesel plants
with higher running costs;
(ii)  further operating cost savings in the "with turbines" case,
since they will, in "wet" years, reduce the use of' less
flexible steam plants and maximize the use of the available
hydro energy; and
(iii)  the value at the existing tariff levels (see Annex: 15) of the
shortfaLlls in electricity supply below the projected requirements
which would occur in certain "dry" years if the gaLs turbines
were ncit installed.
5.08      The economic return on the investment in the gas turbines, which is
the discount rate! which equalizes the present worths of their costs and the
above benefits, was found to be about 11%. This understates the full economic
return, since it takes no account of the further benefits (which could not be
quantified with the data available) in the form of the reduction in power
failures and associated economic losses resulting from the increased security
of supply with thte gas turbines.
Transmission Lines and Substations
5.09      Separate calculations were made of the economic returns on the pro-
posed Jetrada-Kenitra 225-kV lines and on the short Rochies Noires-Tit Mellil
line, together with their associated substation equipment. The Jerada-Kenitra
lines will result in system operating savings and represent the least cost
method of achieving these savings at discount rates up to at least 17%. The
savings were calculated by conparing the total system costs, capital plus
operating, of meeting the projected load forecast with and without the lines
over their assumed life of 40 years. These savings represent the benefits of
the transmission investment. The economic return was found to be 13% on the
assumptions adopted. As with the gas turbines, this understates the full



- 6
return, since it takes no account of the unquantified benefits attributable
to the greater security of supply with these transmission lines. A similar
calculation for the Roches Noires-Tit Mellil line resulted in an economic
return on this part of the project of 20%.
Sensitivity Testing
5.10      The sensitivity of the calculated rates of return on the gas turbines
and the Jerada-Kenitra lines was tested for variations in the main assumptions.
A 10% increase or decrease in capital costs reduces or increases the return on
the gas turbines by 0.7 and on the transmission lines by 0.6 percentage point.
If fuel costs are 10% higher or lower the return on the turbines rises or
falls 0.8 percentage point and on transmission lines 1 percentage point. A
variation of plus or minus 10% in the annual rate of load growth raises or
lowers the return on the turbines by 2.2 percentage points and on the lines by
2.5 percentage points.
6. FINANCES
Accounting
6.01      From its inception in 1963 through 1970 ONE recorded excellent
statistics but published no financial accounts. Revenue, expenditure and
accounts receivable and payable were accounted for internally. Such asset
values as were available were based on incomplete records inherited from
former concessionnaire companies, and inventories were controlled on a
physical basis. For this reason no accounts prior to 1971 have been in-
cluded in this report.
6.02      In 1971, an accounting system was implemented with the help of EdF
and ONE's fixed assets were given book values as at January 1, 1971 based on
replacement cost less estimated depreciation to reflect the age and expected
remaining useful life of the assets. By this method ONE's first complete
set of financial accounts were compiled as at December 31, 1971. EdF is
currently preparing recommendations for cost accounting which ONE plans to
implement in 1973.
Financial Management
6.03      Although ONE has an effective engineering organization, the direction,
organization and control of its financial and accounting functions are weak.
During negotiations ONE agreed :o employ a financial manager at a senior level
of management to improve this aspect of control and planning. The Bank out-
lined the extent of his proposed responsibilities which would include account-
ing, budgetary control, financial forecasting, financial advice to management
and the operations of the internal audit department.



- 17 -
Audit
6.04       ONE's accounts are not subjected to an annual external audit, but
some control (see 3.01) is exercised by the Ministry of FinaLnce through two
employees of the Ministry (a "Controleur Financier" based in Rabat, and an
"Agent Comptable" working in ONE's offices in Casablanca) wh,o are responsible
for the authorizaLtion of all of ONE"s transactions. This type of prefacto
control unnecessarily restricts the speed of ONE's steadily growing operations
and in practice materially reduces the autonomy of ONE. One has agreed to
have its accounts and financial statements audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank.
1971 Actual Financial Positions
6.05       Annex 16 shows ONE's 1971 actual balance sheets and its forecast
balance sheets for 1972 through 1977. Additional details of the assets and
liabilities at December 31, 1971 are given in the "Notes on the Financial
Statements" in Annex 19 and in summary show:
(a)  Gross fixed assets of Dh 1,972 million, whose book, value is
higher than usual for power companies in developing countries,
partly because of the 1971 "replacement" basis of valuation
(see 6.02) and partly because of the high cost of the Jerada
steam generating station (see 3.10) and the inclusion of hydro
generating stations that are underutilized (see 3.08). It is
estimated that the overall gross fixed assets are about 35% -
40% higher than they would have been had the above factors not
applied.
(b)  A net current ratio of 1:3 which is reasonable, but which
includes accounts receivable of DH 69 million of which
DH 38 million were for electricity consumption equivalent
to an overall average of 64 days sales. These include the
Government's outstanding accounts of DH 16 milliot (aver-
aging 192 days consumption), which is excessive (see 6.06).
Inventories at DH 34 million were also somewhat high (see 6.07).
(c)  Equity of DH 1,011 million comprising capital of DH 867 million,
representing the value of ONE's original assets at their some-
what high valuation (see (a) above); DH 105 million in subse-
quent contributions towards construction of which DH 85 million
was from the Government for construction and DH 10 million for
rural electrification; and DH 39 million of retained earnings,
etc. which includes DH 22 million reserves as a "Special Fund"
for rural electrification (see 4.04).



= 18 -
(d)  A relatively low amount of long-term borrowing of DH 301 mil-
lion mostly repayable over 5 to 15 years (see Annex 19,
paragraph 10).
(e)  A long-term liability of DH 38 million comprising consumer's
deposits (DH 8 million) and the staff pension fund (DH 30
million.
As at December 31, 1971 ONE's debt:equity ratio was 25:75 which is not ex-
pected to alter significantly at least through 1977. ONE has agreed not to
incur additional long term debt unless its debt service in any future year is
expected to be covered at least 1.5 times by its net cash generation.
Government Receivables
6.06      Annex 19 paragraph 6 shows that on December 31, 1971 Government
departments owed ONE DH 29.8 million of which DH 15.8 million was for power
consumption and the balance for unpaid installation and construction work.
Some sections of the Ministry of the Interior owed the equivalent of 2.5
years' consumption, while the Department of Commerce had not paid for its elec-
tricity consumption for the last five years. Lack of adequate control by ONE
over receivables is due primarily to non-allocation of financial responsibility
in this area. The Government has agreed to settle its past accounts with ONE
by December 31, 1974, and to arrange for future bills to be settled within 90
days of their presentation.
Irnventories
6.07      ONE carries heavy inventories although these were appreciably re-
duced in 1971. Apart from fuel, the inventories represent several years usage
of spare parts and maintenance materials (see Annex 19, paragraph 7), the re-
gional engineers' main concern being to ensure availability of sufficient
materials and parts. Because of the disparity in type of equipment and al-
ledgely long lead times for the delivery of spares, this has resulted in an
excessive build up of inventories and the financial manager will need to
examine the reordering procedures with a view of reducing ONE's inventories.
Actual and Future Operations
6.08      Annex 17 shows the 1971 Income Statement and those forecast for
1972 through 1977. In 1971, 1976 GWh were sold at an average price (including
sales tax of 6.38%) of 12.1 ctms/kWh (US42.88/kWh) resulting in electricity
sales of DH 217 million.  Other revenue was DH 7 million and operating expen-
ses were DH 184 million (of which DH 63 million was depreciation).  The Net
Operating Income was therefore DH 40 million representing a rate of return on
the average net fixed assets in operation of 3.8%.



- 19 -
6.09      ONE's forecast operating results do not anticipate the recommen-
dations of the ongoing EdF tariff study but are based on the existing tariffs
with an expected annual increase in sales of 9%. Expenses have been examined
in detail with ONE's staff and the resulting forecasts show that overall
operating expenditure including depreciation is expected to increase at
about 11% and 14% in 1972 and 1973 respectively because of the coming into
operation of Jerada; and thereafter by about 8% annually. The resulting Net
Operating Income drops from DH 40 million in 1971 to DH 3i million in 1973
before rising again to some DH 59 million by 1977.
Financing Plan 197:3/1977
6.10      ONE Plani; to finance its 1973/1977 construction program by means
of long term loans (36%), contributions (3%), government grants (34%) and
cash generation (27%). The project comprises 17% of the program and will
itself be financed 63% by the proposed loan, 34% by the Government and 3%
by cash generation. This financing plan, which is shown in detail in Annex
18 is reasonable and can be simmarized as follows:

Rate of Return Cov4r.an-
6.11      On rhe basis of the existing tariffs which will, in practice, be
increased after the completion of the EdF study (see 6.13), ONE's rate of
return is shown as deteriorating further from the 1971 3.8% on average net
fixed assets in operation, before rising to 3.5% by 1977 (see Annex 17).
During negotiations ONE and the Government agreed to charge tariffs sufficient
to achieve a minimum rate of return of 3% by 1974 and progressively higher
rates thereafter so as to attain at least 7% by 1981. These rates will be
subject to agreement between the Bank and ONE after having reviewed the recom-
mendations of the EdF tariff study due to be completed in 1973.



- 21 -
6.12      Despite the low rate of return that would result from the continua-
tion of the existing tariffs, Annex 17 shows that ONE would be able to finance
27% of its 1973/77 construction program from its own cash generation. This
is partially due to the relatively low level and favorable terms of its borrow-
ings which by 1977 carried an average interest rate of about 6.8% per annum,
and partly because the ONE rates of return forecast in Annex 17 cannot real-
istically be compared with the average rates of return usually achieved by
power companies in general due to ONE's comparatively high as;set values
(see 6.05(a)) and to the underutilization of hydro resources (see 3.08). This
underutilization cannot be quantified at this stage, but if the full revaluation
of the 1971 assets had not taken place and if Jerada costs had averaged US$300
per kW installed (which should have been readily achievable under conditions
of international competitive bidding) the rate of return expected to be achieved
through 1977 on the resulting lower rate base would have been about 7% even
at the existing tariff level.
Present Tariffs
6.13      ONE's tariffs today are essentially the same as thoDse of EEM which
have remained unaltered since 1958. They are complicated and disparate (see
Annex 15) because:
(i) they attempt, in part, to reflect 1958 costs of supply
which bear little relation to current prices;
(ii) they take into account privileges in existence before
ONE was created;
(iii) certain rates are the result of hard bargaining by
communities which opted to have their distribution
systems integrated into ONE rather than to create a re'gie.
It is expected that the Government will remedy this state of affairs as a
result of the EdF study, after discussion with the Bank (paragraph 2.06).
7. AGREEMENT REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Government has agreed:
(a)  To settle its past accounts with ONE by December 31, 1974,
and to arrange for future bills to be settled withkin 90
days of their presentation (see 6.06).
7.02      ONE ancl the Government have agreed:
(a)  To reviLew the recommendations of the ongoing EdF tariff
study with the Bank and to agree on an appropriate rate
of return for ONE in the light of the recommendatiLons
(see 2.06).



- 22 -
(b) To maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to earn an
annual rate of return on its average net fixed assets
in operation of not less than 3% for 1974 and progres-
sively higher rates for subsequent years so as to attain
at least 7% by 1981, provided that, having discussed the
recommendations of the ongoing EdF tariff study with the
Bank; the Government, ONE and Bank may agree on such other
annual rates of return as shall be required to enable ONE
to finance from internal cash generation a reasonable por-
tion of its expansion needs (see 6.11).
7.03      ONE has agreed:
(a) To have its accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (see 6.04).
(b)  Not to incur additional long term debt unless its debt
service in any future year is expected to be covered at
least 1.5 times by its net cash generation (see 6.05).
7.04      Subsequent to the loan negotiations, the Government has undertaken
to engage consultants (EdF) to study the organization of the electricity
sector of Morocco. The terms of reference of this study are acceptable to
the Bank and the Government is expected to discuss the EdF recommendations
with the Bank prior to or in connection with any future Loan that may be
proposed for electricity projects (see 2.08).
7.05      In view of the above agreements, the Project provides a suitable
basis for a Bank loan to ONE of US$25 million for a period of 20 years in-
cluding a grace period of 4 years.

Energy Cost and Tariff Study
1.        In accordance with the March 1971 terms of referernce, EdF is
carrying out this study on the following basis:
2.        In a first part, the study should include analyses of:
- the impact of the cost of electric energy on the costs of
products and services;
- the incidence of the cost of electric energy on the com-
petitiveness of the Moroccan industry in general and the
exporting industry in particular;
- electric power as a consumption good and the repercussion
of its price on the cost of living;
- Moroccan prices for energy in all forms as compared to
those of other countries; and
- the repercussion of changes in electric energy pricing on
the economic growth of the country.
3.        In acco:rdance with the second part, EdF should (i) examine the
cost of producing, transporting and distributing electric energy taking
into account the incidence of the source of primary energy (local or
imported), (ii) study the financial situation of the different entities
producing, transporting and distributing electric power, and (iii) submit
proposals for electricity tariffs which would assure the financial viability
of the different entities involved in the electric power sector, in par-
ticular, an internal cash generation sufficient to contribut,s a reasonable
percentage of investment from internal resources.

FIRST POWER PROJECT (ONE)
EcDnomic Justification of the Project
A. GENERAL
1.        The gas turbinos and the transmission parts of the proposed Bank
project were considered separately to determine their econo1ic: justification.
For this purpose the relevant costs are the costs to the econcmy. Taxes and
duties haNre to be excluded, therefore, in calculating costs and shadow prices
used in valuing resources whose opportunity costs differ from their financial
costs to O)NE.
2.        The main resources which enter into the calculationts are foreign
exchange, labor and ftuel (coal and oil).  These were treated as follows:
Foreign Exharge
This was valued at the prevailing official rate of exchange.
Labor
The labor required for construction and operation of the Project was
valued at its estimated money wage, since it will largely consist of
skil:Led and semi-skilled grades for which there are alteirnative employment
opportunities., The labor used at the coal-mine, on the other hand, is
mostly unskilled, which would otherwise be unemployed. It was valued,
therefore, at only 50% of its money wage.
Coal
Shadow prices were used for coal from the Government-owned Jerada
mine, since the relevant cost is neither the subsidized price (currently
DH55,/t) paid by ONE, nor the full cost of extraction, including deprecia-
tion and charges, to the Government (about DH96/t) ,but the additional
expenditures,capital plus operating, incurred in supplying coal for elec-
tricity generation. For this purpose past capital expenditure is ignored
as I'sunk costs" and mining labor shadow-priced as described above. Account
was also taken of an additional cost which the utilization of coal imposes on the
econoDmy. This arises from the fact that coal is an exhaustible resource,
which will have to be replaced by an alternative fuel when all the reserves
have been exhausted. Assuming the alternative is imported fuel oil (as
used currently for the steam stations other than Jerada) this will give
rise to a foreign exchange cost in the fature, the present value of which
has to be reckoned as one of the costs of using the coal for electricity



ANNEX JL
Page 2 of 5
generation, However, the coal reserves are so large in relation to the
expected rate of utilization, and their exhaustion date so far into the
future, that this is not a significant element in the cost of coal.
Oil
The heavy fuel oil and the diesel oil used for electricity genera-
tion have to be imported.  The relevant costs, therefore, are not the
prices paid by ONE but the foreign exchange costs plus landing and deli-
very chargesA The resulting shadow prices are DH 105/t for fuel oil
and DH 24O/m3 for diesel oil.
3.        Using the above values, the justification of the different parts of
the project was examined as described below.
B. GAS TURBINES
Purpose
4.        The two gas turbines proposed for Agadir and Tangier will serve the
following purposes:
(i)  provide peaking capacity in the interconnected Moroccan system,
especially during"dry "years when the firm capacity of hydro plants
is low;
(ii) during "wet" years, substitute during peak hours for output from
less flexible coal-fired steam units at Jerada, thereby permitting
greater use of available hydro energy, with consequent savings in
system operating costs (see paragraph 6(iii));
(iii) substitute for diesel units whose operation is expensive; and
(iv) increase the reliability of the power supply in the Agadir and
Tangier areas which are situated at the extremes of ONE's trans-
mission system, between 300 and 400 km from the main generating
stations.
Economic Return
5.        The installation of the gas turbines will result in certain benefits,
some of which are quantifiable and some not, which could not be secured by any
alternative means, since it is too late to advance the commissioning of other
generating capacity to 1973 and 1974, when the turbines are due to come into
operation. The quantifiable benefits were calculated by comparing the total
costs to the economy of operating the power system to meet the projected load
with and without the gas turbines. In both cases an analysis was made of the



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 5
best way for the system to meet in any year (i) the 80-hour peak (ii) the
average demand during the 250 hours of highest yearly load, (iii3 the average
demand during the 1,900 daytime hours in winter, and (iv) the total annual
consumption0  This analysis was carried out for an  average "dry"year, an
average "wet" year and a "noxmal" year. The actual frequency curve of the
yearly potential hydro production was approximated by giving the potential
production corresponding to these three representative years probabilities
of occurrence of 0.3, 0.3 and 0.4 respectively.
6.        The resulting quantifiable benefits are as follows:
(i)  There would be savings in system operating costs over the life of
the turlbines (assumed as 15 years) attributable to the fact that,
without the turbines, ONE would be unable to meet the full demand
with its existing plant, and part of the shortfall would have to
be met lby captive diesel plant with higher fuel costs. It was
assumed that the captive plant could supply up to 15 GWh in any
year for this purpose.
(ii) Even allowing for this contribution from captive plant, the system
without the gas turbines could not meet the full projected demand
in certain "dry" years.  It was assumed that 50% of the resulting
shortfall in supply would fall on low voltage consumers and the
other 50% on industrial consumers. With the gas turbines, however,
the system will be able to meet the full demand. This represents
an additional benefit of the gas turbine investment, the value of
which can be considered as at least equal to the amount paid by
the affected consumers, at the existing tariff levels, for the
electricity involved.
(iii)  The gas turbines will result in further system operating savings.
During"wet"years, without the gas turbines, the coal-fired steam
units at Jerada would have to operate at periods of peak demand.
Since they cannot be operated for substantial periods at levels
below about 60% of their rated capacity of 60 MW their use at the
peak would necessarily involve off-peak operation also, when they
would produce energy that could have otherwise been generated at
zero marginal cost by the hydro plants. The use of the gas tur-
bines, on the other hand, because of their greater operational
flexibi'lity, can be restricted to the peak hours, allowing maximum
use of the available hydro energy.
7.        The economic return on the investment in the gas turbines is the
discount rate which equalizes the present worth of the above benefits and
the present worth of the turbine capital costs. This was found to be about
11% on the assumptions adopted. This understates the full economic return,
since the calculation takes no account of the increased reliability of the
power supply to Agadir and Targier with the gas turbines. This will result



ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 5
in further benefits through the reduction in power failures and the associated
economic losses, although these could not be quantified with the data available.
The sensitivity of the return was tested for variations in the assumptions.
If the capital cost of the turbines is increased or decreased by 10%, the re-
turn decreases or increases by 0.7 percentage point. If fuel costs are 10%
higher or lower the return rises or falls by 0.8 percentage point.  A varia-
tion of  10% in the annual rate of load growth raises or lowers the return
by 2.2 percentage points.
C. TRANSMISSION LINES AND SUBSTATIONS
Purpose
8.        The transmission items in the Bank project are part of the build-up
of the 225 kV transmission system interconnecting ONE's main thermal plants
(presently located near Casablanca and Jerada and later also at Kenitra), and
the main centers of consumption (Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, Fes and Tangier).
The main item, the second 225 kV line between the 165 MW coal-fired steam
plant at Jerada and Meknes, in conjunction with the existing line will allow
transmission of the full 165 MW from Jerada. It will also improve the re-
liability of the tie between Jerada and the main load centers. The 225 kV
line between Meknes and Kenitra will provide an inter-tie between the Casa-
blanca-Tangier connection (to be upgraded to 225 kV under the proposed project)
and the Jerada-Meknes line. The short line between the Roches Noires steam
plant and the Tit Mellil substation in Casablanca is necessary to allow the
transmission of the full output capacity of Roches Noires by 1975, when a
new unit will be commissioned there.
Justification of 225 kV System
9.        The only feasible alternative to the build-up of the 225 kV system
would be the reinforcement and extension of the existing 150 kV system.  However,
the 225 kV system was found to be the least cost solution at discount rates
up to at least 20%.
Economic Return
10.       The installation of the proposed 225 kV lines linking Jerada and
Kenitra will result in system operating savings and represents the least cost
method of achieving these savings at discount rates up to 17% at least. The
savings were calculated by comparing the total system costs, capital plus
operating,of meeting the projected load forecast with and without the lines
oVer their assumed life of 40 years. The respective costs were calculated on
the basis of the requirements in the "average" dry year, "normal" year and
"wet'"year as in paragraph 5. Without the lines it would be possible to trans-
mit only 125 MW out of the 165 SK capacity of the Jerada steam station and



the difference would have to be made good from other generating plant with
higher running costs. The resulting savings in system operating costa re-
present the benefits of the investment in the lines. The economic return
was found to be 13% on the assumptions adopted. The sensitivity of this
result was tested for variations in the main assumptions. An increase or
decrease of 10%, in the capital costs decreases or increases the return by
0.6 percentage point. A 10% increase or decrease in the cost of coal re-
duces or raises the return by 1 percentage point. A variation of + 10%
in the rate of load growth assumed raises or lowers the return by about
2.5 percentage points. As with the gas turbines (see paragraph 7) these
returns include no allowance for the additional unquantifiable benefits
attributable to the greater security of uspply with the tranamisaion lines.
11.      A serate calculation showed that the econcmic return on the
short Roches Noires-Tit Mellil transuission lin was over 20%.

FIRST POWER PROJECT (ONE)
ONE's Power Tariffs
General
1.        ONE's power tariffs discriminate in function of:
(i) the voltage at which the consumer takes over the energy;
high voltage (150 and 60 kV), medium voltage (22 and 5.5 kV)
and low voltage (440 and 220 V);
(ii)  the geographical location with respect to the main plants existing
in 1958, when the present basic tariffs were set;
(iii)  the type of consumer (ultimate consumer, or distributor);
(iv)  the time of the day the consumption takes place;
(v) privileges certain communities had before 1963, i.e. before
the creation of ONE; and
(vi)  the bargaining power of those communities which decided not to
create their own regies and whose systems were inteigrated into
ONE's.
All the tariffs are degressive, i.e. they tend to encourage higher consumptions.
High Voltage Tarilfs
2.        High voltage tariffs include four elements:
(i)- a charge proportional to the subscribed maximum capacity with an
adjustment if the actual demand exceeds this subscribed capacity;
(ii)  a charge proportional to the number of kWh consumed;
(iii)  rebates for consumptions exceeding certain discrete levels;
(iv)  special rebates for particular technical characteristics of
consumption (e.g. high power factor) or to take into account
points (v) and (vi) in paragraph 1 above.
3.        In 1970 ONE's net revenues (excluding taxes) from high voltage sales
were 0.096 DH/kWh from its 14 distributors and 0.080 DH/kWh from its 29 large
industrial consumers.



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 2
Medium Voltage Tariff
4.        A few customers at medium voltage have tariffs similar to the
high voltage tariffs described above except that the tariffs are nine per
cent higher. Most of ONE's 1,105 consumers in this category have a tariff
based on a kWh price which varies with the subscribed maximum capacity (and
is adjusted if the actual maximmm demand exceeds the subscribed capacity),
the load factor, and the time of the day consumption takes place.
5.        In 1970 ONE's average revenue (excluding taxes) from medium
voltage consumers was 0.112 DH/kWh.
Low Voltage Tariffs
6.        The tariffs for low voltage consumption are based throughout on
kWh charges differentiating between day and night consumption and decreasing
for higher consumptions. In 1970 ONE's about 188,000 low voltage consumers
produced an average revenue (excl. taxes) of about 0.30 DH/kWh.

NOTES:
Assumes an annual expected growth of 9% and does not take into account any increase of the present tariff that may result from
the EdF study.
g/ Expatriate staff (182 in 1971) are expected to decline in numbers. By 1974 60% will probably have been replaced by Moroccan staff
at lower salary levels. Local salary scales have been assumed to rise by about 5% per annum during the period.
No price increase has beeen assumed for fulel since during the forecast, the major generating thermal station will be Jerada using,
coal. This fuel is so'l to ONE at subsidised rates and it is likely that any economies of scale achieved at the mine will be
absorbed in decreasing the subsidy and is unlikely to be passed on to ONE.
4/  "Taxes" comprise 6.38% sales tax and corporation tax as applicable in the year in which it is paid.
5/ "Other" includes any employment of expatriate operating assistance on a short-term contract basis.

NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenues
1.        Power revenues are based on a 9% annual increase in output
from 1972 to 1977. No change in tariffs or average revenue is projected.
Normally average revenue tends to fall when there is no tariff increase.
However, only 6% of ONE's sales are to domestic consumers at low
voltage.
2.       Power bills include a 'production' tax of about 6.38% which
is paid over to the Government when collected.
3.        Other revenues consist of meter and other rentals, recharge-
able expenses and other minor items.
Fixed Assets and Depreciation
4.        ONE's fixed assets were valued at replacement costs, less
accumulated depreciation, on January 1,1971. The result of the
valuation is summarized below:-
Category              Valuation    Average estimated  Average

is assumed to come into operation in that year and one third in each
of the following two years.

- Divisional inventories    6.6             31.9

There is no record of the utilization of spare parts, which are disparate
because of the variety in type of equipment. Inventories of spares
probably represent several years' usage.
