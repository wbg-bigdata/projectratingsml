EMORANDUl AIND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERN&TTONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$32.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and wo.ld help finance
an Integrated Pest Management Training project in Indonesia. The project will
be cofinameed by a USAID grant of US$7.0 million which would be administered
by the Bank.
2.        Intetrated Pest Manatement (IPM) . Agricultural Production and the
Environment. The Government of Indonesia (001) has pursued a policy of, and
been successful in achieving self-sufficiency in rice. This was not only
efficient, given Indonesia's comparative advantage in labor-intensive
production, but was equally a policy for alleviating poverty, because rice
production was the main economic activity and source of income of the rural
poor. Rapid increases in rice production were based, however, on intensive
cultivation and heavy use of inputs, including pesticides. A serious outbreak
of Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) took place in 1986, and government authorities
attributed this to the overuse of pesticides. This caused GOI to reconsider
its strategy for controlling pests to stabilize production. The authorities
concluded that the extensive and indiscriminate use of, particularly, broad
spectrum insecticides upsets the delicate ecological balance of the crop
environment, favors pest resurgence by destroying natural predators and raises
serious environmental and health concerns. On-farm insecticide-related risks
affect human, livestock and fish populations, and there are also risks during
pesticide manufacture, distribution and storage, and in the consumption of
pesticide treated products.
3.        Government's Focus.  To address these problems, the Government,
starting in 1986, has banned the application of 57 insecticides on rice,
phased out pesticide aubsidies sad recommended the use of integrated pest
management (IPM) methods. 1PM is based on the use, either singly or in
combination, of
(a) cultural control,
(b) host plant resistance,
(c) biological control, and
(d) chemical control, i.e., occasional use of selected pesticides as a
last resort when pest numbers are xcessive.
4.        Management measures include planting of rice during months when
vector populations are low, rotation of rice cultivars with different types
and degrees of resistance, and selective applications of insecticides. The
Presidential Decree (Decree No. 3, November 1986) formalized the adoption of
IPM as a national crop protection strategy. The national IPM program was
started on a pilot basis in 1989, with USAID grant funding and PAO technical

assistance, under the coordination and management of the National Development
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). Since May 1992, the pilot program ha. been
supported under an ongoing Bank loan (Ln. 2748-IND). The program, covering 12
major rice growing provinces, has focused on training pest observers,
extension workers and farmers in the use of IPM, using adult education methods
that emphasize participatory learning. Farmers are encouraged and assisted to
understand and monitor the ecological dynamics of their fields and make the2.r
own decisions regarding pest control action, in a bottom-up approach rather
than focusing on centrally-developed and relayed messages. It has also
supported specific IPM-related field investigations and studies to strengthen
the scientific basis of the pest control measures and the training program.
5.        By the end of June 1992, about 1,100 pest observers and about
140,000 farmers had been trained in IPM methods to enable them to make more
educated decisions on managing rice fields. About 5,000 field extension
workers who assist in the selection and training of farmers groups, have also
received an orientation course in IPM methods. Studies and investigations
have been carried out under contract by Universities and the Agency for
Agricultural Research and Development, and field-based action research has
besn undertaken to rapidly develop practical technologies for the control of
the White Stem Borer. The program has also initiated an occupational health
study in Central Java to obtain reliable data on pesticide exposure and
poisoning.
6.        Lessons Learned from Past O,erations.  The Bank has assisted GOI in
developing national research and extension systems for almost two decades.
The research projects contributed to the physical expansion of agricultural
research and strengthened research capabilities. A number of constraints
emerged during project execution, including deficiencies in s: stematic
planning of research priorities, inadequate provision of operational funds,
imbalance between commodity-oriented research programs and location specific
farming systems research, which are now being addressed in the ongoing
Agricultural Research Management Project (Loan 3031-IND). Through three
projects, extension and training and a nationwide infrastructure has been
established and staff recruited and trained. Major lessons learned are:
(a) the present system, which was largely designed to relay centrally
developed messages to farmers participating in commodity programs,
needs to be made more flexible and relevant for a more diversified
agricultural economy; and
(b) standardized packages contributed to enhancing rice production, and
were appropriate when the training and visit (T&V) system was
introduced. Now the need is for a training approach emphasizing
participatory learning and enabling the farmers to make their own
decisions.
The IPM program brings a new and more flexible approach to Extension and
Research and would strengthen the existing research and extension services and
extend farmer-participation to replace the old "top-down" approach. Under the
new approach, Government services would be less dominant and farmers
themselves would take more initiative.
7.        Rationale for Aank Involvement. The IPM strategy, the elimination
of subsidies for pesticides, and the banning of hazardous insecticides for



rice have brought about a significant overall decline .n pesticide use in rice
while maintaining or even increasing yield levels at a considerably reduced
cost to the farmer and the economy. The overall success of the program to
date can be attributed to a sound scientific/ecological basis, strong
leadership, an effective training system, a supportive policy environment, and
strong Government comitment. The Government now wishes to:
(a) expand the program,
(b) focus on wider-ranging institutional sustainability as well as the
policy/regulatory aspects, and
(c) integrate the program at the natioval level with the mainstream
activities of the Ministry of Agriculture.
8.        Bank support of the project would help the Government implement this
strategy. Strengthening and expanding IPM would help ensure the longer-term
sustainability of the 1PM program, by gradually extending it beyond the rice
ecosystem to other crop ecologies, and to other aspects of crop and farm
management. The presence of the Bank, and the external accountability that
this implies, may also help the Government resist any pressures from pesticide
manufacturers to reverse its pest control policies.
9.        Proeect Objectives.  The main objective is to stabilize agricultural
production, particularly paddy, and promote environmentally sound crop
production systems, i.e., a safe and efficient approach to environmental
management, pollution mitigation and control by:
(a) strengthening and expanding the use of the IPM program;
(b)  educating farmers rather than instructing them,
(c)  supporting field investigations and studies, and stronger linkages
with research and extension; and
(d)  strengthening the regulatory and environmental management framework
for pesticides to reduce risks associated with the manufacture,
distribution and application of pesticides.
10.       Proiect Description.  The project, which would be completed in five
years, would support:
(a)  human resource development, leading to training of about 520 pest
observers, 1,100 extension workers and 800,000 farmers, with about
30 percent of trainees being wovmen
(b)  field investigations and studies, to develop appropriate, farmer-
responsive technology, including a program of investigation into
pest/natural enemy interactions in different ecosystems, an
occupational health study, and contracted-out research to local
universities; and
(a)  strnthening the regulatory and environmental management of
posticides, enhancing the effectiveness of the Pesticides
Commission, and phasing out of the most hazardous pesticides,



-4-
collation/dissaemination of information, and improvements in
labelling, packaging, storage, as well as undertaking the
enviromental audits of manufacturing/formulation plants.
11.       Total project costs are estimated at US$53.0 million.  The proposed
loan of US$32.0 million would finance 65 percent of the total costs, exclusive
of taxes (US$3.3 million) and reserved procurement of vehiclee (US$0.2
million). USAID would provide US$7.0 million of grant cofinancing, to be
administered by the Bank. The Government of Indonesia would provide the
equivalent of US$14.0 million. A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are presented in Schedule A, and the amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement in Schedule B. A timetable for key project processing events
is in Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is
given in Schedule D. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Rieport No.
11377-IND, dated December 31, 1992 will be distributed separately.
12.       Prolect Im=lement^Sion.  The project would use the existing
organizational arrangements. The national level coordination will be provided
by an interministerial Steering Committee under the general guidance of an
Advisory Board. Implementation at field level would be by Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) staff.
13.       Protect Sustainabilitv.  IPM as structured to date relies heavily on
the provincial and district staff under local government control, and future
sustainability at these levels will therefore largely depend on a willingness
of the local government authorities to continue to assign staff and funds to
IPM. There are clear signs of local government interest and commitment to
IPM. At the national level, the long-term sustainability of IPM will depend
on GOI policies and strategies for the organization, management and
implementation of agricultural training, extension and research. The Agency
for Agricultural Education and Training has agreed to provide one year of IPM
training at the end of the in-service training course for field extension
workers (PPLs). The Directorate General of Food Crops will allow pest
observers and PPLs to continue their involvement with 1PM. The representation
of the AARD on the research commission will help improve the coordination of
the research agendas of the National IPM Program and AARD. At farmer level,
IPM will be self-sustaining as farmers trained under the project pass on the
acquired skills more widely to other farmers.
14.       Role of Wom   . Women are centrally involved in crop management
practices by virtue of their decision-making power, their control of the farm
budget, and their labor input. Making women knowledgeable of IPM practices
will significantly increase the sustainability of the project benefits, which
depends heavily on the horizontal spread of IPM practices from farmer to
farmer. The proposed project would analyze the soci-economic dynamics of
Indonesial's major rice areas to target the priority areas for increasing
women's participation, looking at social, economic, or other cultural factors
which influence women's need to know about IPM, and include data on women's
participation In monitoring and evaluation indicators. Women would constitute
about 30 percent of all traines in training programs.
I5.       Environmental Imract. Pesticide pr.llution is a major cause for
concern in Indonosia's densely populated village communities, particularly
where water for drinking and bathing is in limited supply. Moreover,
pesticide use represents a sizeable opportunity cost since the presence of



pesticides prevents farmers from raising fish in rice paddy fields. In
addition, the disposal of hazardous wastes produced by the pesticide industry
and pesticide run-off at the point of use are serious problemi. The reduced
reliance on pesticide use under IPM would alleviate these problems. Moreover,
1PM extends the life-span of rice varieties and helps to maintain genetic
diversity in the rice ecosystem.
16.      Agreed  titons.  Goverr ent's agreement to the following key actions
was obtained at negotiations:
(a)  the Action Plan for strengthening the regulatory and environmental
management of pesticides would be implemented, as reviewed and
agreed with the Bank;
(b) membership of the IPM Working Group would be expanded to include all
agencies implementing the Action Plan, no later than September 30,
1993, to coordinate with the pesticides regulations/environment
experts;
(c)  senior PHPs (pest observers) would be fully seconded to the IPM
program during the life of the project;
(d) the job descriptions of PUPs and field extension workers would be
amended at the outset of the project so that they can carry out the
IPM-related farmer training activities during the regular course of
their duties;
(e)  the utility, quality and effectiveness of the contracted-out
research would be monitored and evaluated;
(f) the draft Annual Work Programs, semi-annual progress reports, and at
least three monitoring and evaluation reports (end of the first
year, prior to mid-term review and the final project year) would be
submitted to the Bank for its review and comments;
(g) a mid-term review of the project, including the policy support
component related to the pesticide industry regulatory environment,
would be undertaken in 1995 to review all the targets/priorities,
including the progress of consolidation of the IPM program within
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA); and
(h)  planning and financial management procedures for project
implementation, as agreed with the Bank, would be maintained.
17.      Proiect Benefits.  The use of IPM generates a broad range of social
and economic benefits at the farm, village and national levels. At the farm
level, these include cash savings from reductions in pesticide use, lower
production risk, higher yields, health benefits for farmers and farm laborers
from all social and economic strata, and a cleaner village environment. At
the national level, the large-scale implementation of IPM will reduce the risk
of major pest outbreaks, result in substantial savings of foreign exchange
(estimated at US$17 million during the life of the project), contribute to the
conservation of biodiversity in the rice ecosystem and reduce environmental
damage resulting from the production, transportation, storage and use of
pesticides. Farmer education would also result in higher accountability and



- 6 -
responsibility of agricultural support services. The project's economic rate
of return is estimated at 32 percent.
18.       Risks. Although the IPM program, to date, is a success story, it
has been of a pilot nature, trainin' some 140,000 farmers.  The proposed
project would replicate and scale-up the program, whereby about 800,000
farmers would be trained. This expansion of the program could constitute a
risk if the management capacity is strained. Another risk stems from the
aggressive marketing tactics of the pesticide companies which can be expected
to continue to exert strong pressure on Government to modify policies
supportive of IPM. These risks will be minimized by continuing to use the
current organization and implementation arrangements until a decision is made
on the appropriateness of transferring the management of the program at the
national level to MOA, and by setting irreversible processes in place via
farmer training and education. The IPM program will help in gradually
extending the farmer participatory training approach beyond the rice eco-
system to other ecologies, and for other crops as well as other aspects of
crop protection and farm management, and thereby contribute to changing the
overall culture and approach of the extension setvices.
19.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
