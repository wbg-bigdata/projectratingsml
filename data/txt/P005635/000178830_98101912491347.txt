TUNISIA
I.  ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Context
1.01      The energy sector in Tunisia is dominated by use of hydrocarbons,
mainly oil which comprises 81% of the commercial energy market, and natural
gas a further 14%; the remainder is met by hydro (1%) and imported coal and
coke (4%). The opportunities for greater use of hydroelectricity and coal are
limited.
1.02      Tunisia is a net exporter of oil (exporting 5 million tons of
crude oil and products compared with imports of 2 million tons) 1/ and relies
on the income from petroleum for more than a quarter of its export earnings.
Consumption has been growing at 8% per annum through the 1970's and is now 1.8
million tons per year (33,000 barrels/day); domestic production in 1978 was 5
million tons. However, production from known reserves will decline through
the 1980's, and this, when taken with the expected growth in consumption, will
result in a dimunition in export earnings. While recent discoveries have been
promising in that they have indicated petroleum reserves and promising poten-
tial in rocks of a different geological age, the exploitation of these reserves
is unlikely before the mid-1980s.
1.03      The construction of the Algeria/Tunisia/Italy pipeline has opened
up a new opportunity for Tunisia. Natural gas could potentially meet 50% of
Tunisia's energy demand, particularly in electricity generation and heavy
industry. The availability of gas from the Algeria-Italy pipeline in the
early 1980s at an import cost less than imported fuel oil, could slow,
but not reverse, the expected reduction in exports. Further quantities are
expected to be available from Algeria in the longer term, and can be supple-
mented through development of the Miskar offshore gas field. Transfer of
Tunisia's heavy industry and electricity generation to a new energy source
(gas) is a major undertaking, requiring development of a national energy
strategy and careful appraisal of policy options and project economics.
Tunisia has recognized this need and is taking steps to organize itself
accordingly.
Energy Resources
1.04      Proven oil and gas reserves are concentrated almost entirely
in three fields. El Borma was discovered by AGIP in 1964 and is owned by
SITEP 2/, a 50/50 subsidiary of AGIP and the Government. Elf Aquitaine
I/   Tunisian oil is of good quality (low sulphur) and the majority is cur-
rently exported at a premium. For operation of the present refinery, the
country imports lower priced high sulphur crude, thus making a financial
gain.

discovered the two other major fields, Ashtart (1971) and Miskar (1974),
offshore in the Gulf of Gabes.  Ashtart oil is being produced under a 50/50
joint venture with ETAP, 1/ the state oil company, and Miskar is expected to
be majority owned by the Government with Elf Aquitaine having a minor share.
1.05      Indigenous proven reserves are estimated to be:

102           15            37           0.7
There is also one oil field in disputed territory near the Libyan border.
1.06      Oil production from the major fields is progressing satisfactorily.
Water is being injected at both El Borma and Ashtart to enhance recovery.
1979 output is expected to be 12% above that for 1978, at 5.6 million tons,
but with a fall to below pre 1978 production levels by 1986. Both fields
should produce substantial but declining quantities through the 1980's and
into the 1990's. The other proven oil fields will cease production between
the mid-1980's and mid-1990's.
1.07      Commercial gas production is from three fields, of which the signi-
ficant one is the El Borma oil field. Following a recommendation by the Bank,
STEG 2/ has agreed to purchase gas from the Algerian portion of El Borma.
Despite this, the El Borma gas supply is expected to cease by 1986. As
discussed subsequently in Chaper II, there are no firm plans to produce
Miskar gas in the 1980's. The Bank agrees with this position.

1.08      Other Resources.  Hydroelectricity is currently limited to one 25MW
plant, with a similar plant under construction. The lignite deposits on Cap
Bon have not been explored but are not believed to be large. Coal required
for the steel industry is imported.  Because of the climate, crops and farming
methods and location of population, the possibilities for non-commercial
energy are believed to be small, although possibly significant for isolated
areas.
Supply and Demand Patterns
1.09      Since 1971, commercial energy consumption has increased on average
by 9% per annum from 1.2 million tons oil equivalent (toe) to 2.3 million toe
in 1978.  GDP increased over this period at a similar rate, giving an energy/
GDP growth in line with the norm for middle-income countries. During the same
period Tunisia's crude oil and gas production has increased by 1.2 million
tons, permitting an increase in net exports.
1.10      The energy supply/demand situation is summarized below:

1.11      Gas oil demand has been growing at 13% annually, meeting 40% of
petroleum demand and Tunisia is now dependent on imports for more than 50%
of its requirements. Fuel oil, supplying 35% of total petroleum needs, is
imported to the extent of 30%, and all jet kerosene is imported. The main
supplying countries are Greece, Italy and Libya. The growth in gas oil
demand and the substitution possibilities for fuel oil are major factors in
considering future refinery options, and are the dominant factors in refinery
design.



- 4 -
1.12      For most of the 1970's, data on the use made of Tunisia's energy
is incomplete and is concentrated primarily on power and large scale industry.
An energy use analysis for Tunisia as a whole is available for 1977 and 1978.
The power and industrial sectors use all of the hydro, gas and coal, 94% of
the fuel oil and 28% of the gas oil, in total 56% of total energy, a propor-
tion which has been growing during the 1970's. Their share of the total is
expected to grow further in the 1980's. Apart from power, the major users
of energy are the construction, chemical and extractive industries.  Details
are in Annex 1.01.
1.13      The refinery (at Bizerte) has a nominal capacity of 1 million
tons/year and has limited catalytic reforming facilities. It has operated
above the nominal rating throughout the 1970's (see Annex 1.03 for an analysis
of output). The refinery was designed for and operates on imported high
sulphur Iraqi crudes, allowing virtually the whole of Tunisia's own crudes to
be exported. Tunisia's (El Borma) Zarzaitine crude attracts a quality premium;
Ashtart crude is conveniently located for export. Given that the refinery now
meets only 2/3 of Tunisia's needs, and that product exports are virtually nil,
there is no advantage in making modifications to the existing refinery confi-
guration. The solution is to design the refinery expansion to reflect future
needs. The expanded refinery (discussed below) will initially use Tunisian
crude.
Development Prospects
1.14      Despite the availability of a relatively large supply of energy
compared to current requirements, the energy sector in Tunisia is at a
turning point where decisions made now will affect the long term through
the end of the century.
For its industrial energy strategy Tunisia could:
(i) continue to base its strategy on oil.
(ii) rely on royalty gas 1/ and imports, both coming from the
Algeria-Italy gas pipeline.
(iii)  develop its natural gas resources.
The Government chose option (ii), the use of Algerian supplies.
1.15      The choice between the three above options, or a combination thereof,
involve complex technical, financial, economic and political considerations,
and projections on an international basis which must inevitably be speculative.
The Government gave lengthy consideration to the choice and decided in favor
of relying on Algerian gas for the 1980's, both on economic grounds and in
relation to the longer term energy policy options. Development of Miskar at
this time was seen to pose difficult energy supply problems for the later
1/   Royalties are payable by Italy for the right to transport gas by pipe-
line across Tunisia. They may be taken in the form of cash or as gas.

1980's when production would be declining, and to involve a particularly large
financial investment in a single resource. In the meantime, the Government
has agreed to undertake a study on ways of using offshore associated gas.
The study will emphasize the possibility of a floating power plant and will
include other possible ways of using the gas. The study will be commissioned
shortly and wnen completed will be discussed with the Bank.
1.16      The Government's intention is to use natural gas to the maximum
possible extent, and to contract accordingly for large quantities of gas,
leaving little safety margin. Consequently, to avoid excessive payments for
gas not taken, it is imperative for the energy forecasts to be sufficiently
accurate since the gas will be purchased on a take or pay basis.
1.17      Apart from STEG's power forecasts, Tunisia has no proven experience
of energy forecasting. This should be remedied through the energy planning
work with Gordian Associates discussed subsequently (paragraph 1.36). The
Bank has examined and accepted the forecasts for fuel for power generation.
In relation to industrial use, the Bank has examined and accepted forecasts
based on existing consumers (about 30) plus new plants under construction,
making no specific allowance for other new plants. This is a conservative
approach to supply and demand matching. Overall consumption is expected to
grow more slowly than in the 1970's, yet in relation to GDP, at a slightly
faster rate. The Tunisian current (5th) Development Plan is markedly differ-
ent from its predecessor in its emphasis on heavy industry. Supply and demand
is summarized below. Year by year forecasts of supply and demand are included
in Annex 1.02, together with a breakdown of the sources of supply.

it will be seen that, despite the tremendous increase in the use of gas, the
consumption of oil products is expected to stabilize only through the middle
1980's and pick up thereafter. The prospects for further substitution by 1990
are small, and are essentially limited to the hotel industry and domestic
supplies. The coal and coke and most of the gas will be imported. By 1985
almost all potential substitution of fuel oil and gas oil by natural gas will
have taken place. Less than 7% of potential substitution in power and industry
will remain.  Natural gas will then supply 79% of power and industrial demand,
coal and hydro together will supply 5%, and 9% will be away from the supply
pipelines or otherwise unsuitable for convenient substitution by gas. Gas oil
and heating oil, used for trucking, local shipping, agricultural pumps and
smaall scale heating, will form 54% of oil products demand, gasolines and
aviation fuel 16%, kerosene and LPG (used for heating, cooking and lighting
15% and fuel oil, used for shipping and for consumers away from the gas
pipelines, 15% (see Annex 1.02).
1.18      Detailed analysis product by product indicates a potential gas
surplus in the years 1986 to 1989, during which some royalty gas would have
to be taken as cash. Should the growth in energy demand for power and indus-
try average less than 6% against 10% and 7% used respectively in the forecast,
it would not be possible to avoid take or pay. The possibilities will be
examined in the Gordian Associates' studies. During discussion of the studies
the Bank will pay particular attention to the supply/demand match for the
later 1980's.
1.19      The forecasts take no account of the potential for substituting
cooking and heating fuels for small scale users with natural gas. There is
already a gas distribution system in Tunis supplying 20,000 households. The
quantities involved in domestic supplies are small. As part of the project,
the Bank will finance a feasibility study of supplying natural gas to house-
holds and small scale industry, to be completed by mid-1982. Agreement was
reached on this at negotiations.
1.20      Following a study by the Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation, the
Government has decided to proceed with the expansion of its Bizerte refinery
to an annual capacity of 4 million tons. The expanded refinery will initially
use Tunisian crude, both El Borma (Zarzaitine) and Ashtart blends in roughly
equal proportions, production of which will be sufficient for maximum refinery
output through 1985 only. Design based on domestic crudes will improve the
security of supply, and will result in low sulphur products. The refinery has
been planned so as to maximize the production of middle distillates and
minimize the quantity of fuel oil. Nevertheless, some imbalances are anti-
cipated including significant exports of fuel oil and naphtha. The precise
mix of products will depend on the crudes used in practice and, in turn,
depend on further discoveries in Tunisia.  Refinery product mixes are shown in
Annex 1.03.
Sector Organization and Structure
1.21      Initially the petroleum sector was in the hands of overseas oil
companies with the state controlling refining, power and gas distribution.
The Government has substantially increased its role through the establishment



- 7 -
of a state oil company, joint operating companies, and the agreed acquisition
of the largest distribution company.
Exploration and Production
1.22      In exploration and production the primary state company is ETAP
(Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petrolieres), which is 100% Government
owned. ETAP has wide coordinating powers for the whole sector. The other
state companies in this sector are SITEP, SEREPT 1/ and CFTP 2/, each 50%
Government owned.  SITEP operates the El Borma field and SEREPT the Ashtart
field. Apart from its earnings through royalties and taxes the Government
takes approximately 50% participation in Tunisia's oil and gas production. In
addition to the state companies there are fifteen external groups engaged in
exploration (including two major international oil companies, the remainder
being North American independents and European companies) and there are three
producers.
Refining
1.23      The provision of all refined products is controlled through two
state industries, STIR (Societe Tunisienne des Industries de Raffinage) and
ETAP. The Government through STIR owns and operates the country's only
refinery. Product imports are controlled by ETAP. The new refinery will
also be wholly-owned by STIR.
Transmission, Distribution and Marketing
1.24      STEG (Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz) is responsible
for hydroelectricity and for the generation and distribution of electricity.
In relation to gas, STEG has the responsibility for the transmission and
distribution of El Borma gas and Cap Bon gas, and the manufacture and dis-
tribution of town gas in Tunis. STEG's activities will be expanded to include
the transmission and distribution of Algerian gas from the intercontinental
pipeline.
1.25      The construction, ownership and operation of the Algeria-Italy
gas pipeline will not involve STEG and will result in the establishment of
three companies in Tunisia, whose roles are described in the next chapter.
1.26      Distribution of oil products from the refinery and the terminal
of the Bizerte/Tunis products pipeline is the responsibility of the oil
companies. The Government company, SNDP (Societe Nationale de Distribution de
Petrole) has 40% of the market. Together Esso, Shell and Mobil have 35% and
eight other companies share the balance.
Government Organization
1.27      The energy sector operates under the Energy Department of the
Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy 3/. The main functions of
1/   Societe de Recherche et d'Exploitation des Petroles de Tunisie.
2/   Compagnie Franco-Tunisienne des Petroles.
3/   Recently merged with the Ministry of Commerce.



- 8 -
the Energy Department have been to negotiate exploration and development
agreements, to set standards for the operation of the sector and to set fuel
prices and power tariffs. There was no obvious need during the late 1960's
and 1970's for Tunisia to undertake more than rudimentary energy planning and
coordination. The need for more formalized plan4ng was recognized in 1977
and the Government has reorganized accordingly to meet the challenge.
1.28      The Energy Department has recently been remodelled to handle long
term energy planning and the study and review of the economic, financial and
legal aspects of alternative energy development plans. The Department's
first priority is to complete the Gordian Associates study on energy pricing
and planning as required under the second power loan (IBRD 1355-TUN).
1.29      Apart from its longer term planning and its study of non-conventional
energy resources, the reorganized Energy Department operates through four
divisions: (1) exploration and production; (2) refining transmission and
distribution; (3) gas; and (4) power, to correspond with the sector structure.
Control
1.30      The Government controls the oil and gas industry in many ways.
For the state companies the Government appoints the president and the board,
it controls the provision of long-term finance and it controls prices.  The
long-term development plans of the state companies are an integral part of
Tunisia's national plan. Exploration is controlled through the issue of
exploration licenses, which carry with them minimum work obligations. Permits
are valid for three years and can be extended three times with a reduction
each time of 20% in permit area, together with commitment to further work
obligations. If a field is developed a production license concession is
granted for 50 years, a substantially longer period than is common in other
countries. The import of petroleum products is channelled through ETAP.
The Government controls the retail prices of all petroleum products and
transport charges, but within these limits distribution is handled by the
various distribution companies.
Sector Investments and Financial Sources
1.31      At the time of adoption of the current national plan, the energy
sector was expected to absorb 17% of Tunisia's total capital investments over
the five years 1977-81, which is high compared with other countries at a
similar stage of development. The Fifth Plan provided for $1,330 million of
investment in primary energy and $500 million for secondary energy.  Because
of the deferral of the Miskar project, actual expenditure will be $500 million
less. Further information is in Annex 1.04.
Sector Policies
Resource Development
1.32      The main energy source so far found in Tunisia is oil and gas.
Other resources play a minimal role. The Government's policy in energy
development is to increase Tunisia's production of crude oil and oil products,



and to maximize the export of oil products through substituting gas for fuel
oil in the domestic market. While taxation, licensing and participation
policies are broadly comparable to those in other countries, there exists
in Tunisia a particularly favorable attitude to foreign participation which
encourages a satisfactory level of exploration. Further detail is in Annex
1.05.
Pricing
1.33      Retail prices of petroleum products are broadly characterized by
two distinct pricing tiers: retail prices of lighter products, such as motor
fuels, are relatively high, and generally higher than is common in the oil
exporting countries; retail prices of middle distillates and fuel oil, on the
other hand, have been kept low for many years through subsidies, both in order
to keep down the general price level and to assist Tunisian industry. Over-
all, the "reconstituted barrel" for Tunisia realises $32 which is approxi-
mately world prices. A comparison of retail prices of principal petroleum
products in Tunisia with those in other countries is shown in the following
table:
Regular
gasoline         Gas oil        Fuel oil
$/gallon         $/gallon       $/tonne
Tunisia                    1.94            0.71             60
Brazil                     1.86             1.13            83
Egypt                     0.35             0.12             11
Syria                     0.78             0.25            90
Thailand                   1.41             1.15           153
United Kingdom            2.24              1.06           234
United States              1.28             1.10           152
1.34      Revenue needed to finance refinery operations and the cost of
imports comes from three sources. Firstly, Tunisia receives oil as royalties
on production; secondly, part of the production of each field has to be
offered to the local market at a discount, and thirdly, revenue is generated
on the sale of LPG, gasolines (part of the profit on gasolines is in the form
of taxes earmarked for other needs) and aviation kerosene and the export of
naphtha. The first two of these are heavily dependent on future production
levels. The rising proportion of imports has made it impossible for Tunisia
to maintain the subsidies and prices of products have increased in recent
years. Nevertheless, domestic prices for the heavier products were somewhat
below world prices prior to the 1979 price explosion; price adjustments in
December 1979 were also relatively small. (Annex 1.06 lists the current
retail prices in Tunisia and bulk prices in Italy).
1.35      The Bank has undertaken a preliminary study of the effect of energy
prices on Tunisian industrial energy demand, both of power and of oil and gas.
Energy was found to form only a small proportion (6%) of the end costs of
products, such that adjustment to economic prices would have little effect



- 10 -
on product prices, and hence demand. In any case, most of the products
exported by Tunisia have little energy input. It was noticed that there had
been no discernible impact on demand as a result of major price increases in
previous years.
1.36      As discussed in Chapter IV, on project grounds, it is essential to
increase fuel oil prices in the short and medium term, so as to ensure that
gas prices do not exceed fuel oil prices. An increase in fuel oil prices
will be achieved in steps over the next few years, and discussed more fully in
Chapter IV. In respect of the other energy prices, parity with international
prices (or above) is the most appropriate long-term solution, but may take a
decade to achieve for low volume socially sensitive products such as kerosene
and gas oil (to the extent it is used for fishing and agriculture). The
Gordian Associates study, which will pay particular attention to pricing, will
be available during 1980. The Bank will discuss the whole report with the
Government as part of its supervision of the second power loan and will seek
agreement on pricing strategy at that time.
1.37      In the short and medium term, it is important to ensure a suitable
relationship between the prices of industrial fuel substitutes, and to main-
tain the financial viability of the institutions concerned, both suppliers of
primary energy (such as STEG gas) and consumers of primary energy, principally
STEG power. The principal aim for energy pricing within the present project
is to focus on the domestic price of fuel oil and natural gas.
Role of the Bank
1.38      The Bank has had a long standing involvement with STEG both in
the power sector and in the financing of the El Borma to Gabes gas pipeline,
and has made three loans totalling $34 million. All three projects have been
succiessful, although the most recent currently has problems in respect of
spare parts for gas turbines. In that time STEG has developed into one of
the most important companies in Tunisia, setting an example in efficiency and
management.
1.39      The need for a study on tariffs was identified as a result of the
second power loan. As a result of further discussion with the Bank the study
has been widened and is now an energy master plan study including pricing
policy and is being undertaken by Gordian Associates. The Bank will review
the findings with the Government. To the extent necessary to ensure the
financial viability of the gas entity within STEG, fuel and gas prices will
be increased in association with this project.
1.40      The Bank has been actively involved in the Tunisian gas sector
for the last four years, initially with the Miskar project (see Chapter II)
and the general strategy in relation to the provision of gas for Tunisian
industry. The strategy led to the present project. In relation to the
project, the Bank has assisted in the choice of pipeline routes, their sizing
and timing. The Bank will assist with a number of related studies which will
concentrate on supplies to households and small scale users.

II. THE PROJECT
Background: Developments in Algeria and Italy
2.01      The possibility of importing gas from Algeria has been an issue
since the signature of the Algeria/Italy gas supply contract in 1973 and
the corresponding transit agreement for a pipeline from Algeria across
Tunisia to Italy. The steep increase in oil prices in late 1973 and the
trend towards national control of resources led to renegotiation of the
contract to an LNG-based operation. In 1977 the terms of a transit agree-
ment were agreed between Tunisia and ENI, the Italian state oil company, and
the gas supply was switched back to the original pipeline proposal.
2.02      In 1974 the Miskar structure was discovered, and was delineated
steadily between then and 1978. During the appraisal of the Miskar project
in 1977 the Bank suggested investigation of purchasing gas from Algeria as
an alternative to investing $600 million in a single gas field. Negotia-
tions for Algerian gas and delineation of Miskar proceeded simultaneously,
providing Tunisia with two real alternatives. Provisional agreement on
purchase terms at the same time as determination of the overall Miskar
reserves (at a lower level than that hoped for), when taken together with
risk and strategic considerations, led to a Government decision to proceed
with the gas purchase.
2.03      A Bank appraisal mission in October 1979 found that, although
planning for the onshore gas pipeline project was well advanced, it was
suitable for Bank financing and was a project into which the Bank could make
a worthwhile input. During and since that mission the project changed substan-
tially, the capital expenditure planned for the 1980's has been reduced, and
the gas purchase contract was clarified. Construction of the project is
scheduled from the summer of 1980, and contracts for most of the materials and
equipment had to be let between the dates of appraisal and Board presentation.
Institutional Framework
2.04      The institutional framework for the intercontinental pipeline is
complex, the arrangements differing in Algeria, Tunisia, the Sicily Channel
and Italy. The Algerian state company Sonatrach will construct, own and
operate the pipeline from Hassi R'Mel (Algeria) up to its frontier. In
relation to Tunisia, there will be three companies established in Tunisia,
whose roles in relation to the pipeline in Tunisian territory will be:
(1) to construct the intercontinental pipeline; (2) to own the pipeline from
commissioning; and (3) to operate the pipeline. A fourth company will own the
offshore portion including that part in Tunisian waters and a fifth will own
the onshore pipeline prior to commissioning. The first of these will be
a subsidiary of ENI, the second Tunisian, and the third joint Italo-Tunisian
with Tunisia having the majority share after five years. The fourth and fifth
companies are not Tunisian. Tunisia will pay 1% of the pipeline cost to take
possession, but Italy will retain ownership of the carrying capacity. In
respect of the operations, responsibility will transfer to Tunisia after five



- 12 -
years. Algerian interest in the overall venture takes the form of ownership
of the pipeline within Algeria, and of a share in the cost of the Sicily
Channel crossing. As already noted, distribution within Tunisia is the
responsibility of STEG.
Gas Availability
2.05      The Hassi R'Mel gas field in Algeria (discovered in 1956), which is
one of the largest gas fields in the world, is the source of gas for a number
of on-going major gas supply contracts and will supply Italy through the
intercontinental pipeline with at least 12 billion cubic meters of gas a
year for 25 years, plus about 2 billion cubic meters for Tunisia. There is
a possibility of increasing the pipeline throughput to a total of 20 billion
cubic meters. Supplies to Italy are expected to commence in October 1981.
Discussion has already begun on the possibility of a second gas pipeline for
supplying France, Switzerland and Germany. Algeria has vast gas reserves
and is actively seeking to promote sales by pipeline.
2.06      The Tunisian Government is entitled to royalties on gas transitting
to Italy, either in cash or in kind at the discretion of the Tunisian govern-
ment.  The arrangement allows maximum flexibility in Tunisia's gas supplies.
In addition to the royalties, STEG will purchase from SONATRACH 700 million
cubic meters a year of gas from 1982 rising to 1,200 million cubic meters on a
20 year contract. STEG has requested a further 800 million cubic meters a
year (starting with 400 million in 1986) in association with Algerian plans to
increase overall capacity of the pipeline to 20 billion cubic meters but has
so far had no response. Purchased gas is subject to take or pay. Total gas
available to Tunisia from the pipeline is below, expressed in tons of oil
equivalent (one thousand cubic meters of Algerian gas are equivalent to a ton
of oil).
Thousands Tons
oil equivalent          1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987

Gas contract             635     490       620    1175    1200    1200
Purchase Request          -        -       _        -       400      800
835     860      1145    1795    2400    2800
These figures exclude royalty gas on a second gas pipeline, tentatively
planned for the mid-1980s.
2.07      The gas is purchased at the Algerian frontier.  Its cost (because of
lags in price adjustments)      fluctuates in the range 60-70% of the present
international price for fuel oil. It has to be taken at approximately an
equal hourly rate throughout the year, which optimizes the intercontinental
pipeline system but causes some extra distribution costs in Tunisia and, in
the absence of gas storage, limits the extent to which the gas can substitute
for oil. STEG will use its power plants, particularly that at Sousse, to
equalize the hourly take.



- 13 -
The Intercontinental Pipeline
2.08      The gas pipeline from Algeria to Italy (Hassi R'Mel to Bologna)
will be 2500 km in length, of which 920 km are in North Africa, 160 km in
the Sicily Che-'nel and 1420 km in Italy. The pipeline will be 48" in diameter
in Algeria, Tunisia, Sicily and the greater part of its route through Italy,
while decreasing gradually on the last section connecting it to the Northern
Italian Network. The Sicily Channel has three 20" lines plus a 20" spare,
the Messina Straits have three 20" lines and a 10" spare. Over the whole
length of the pipeline there will be 11 compressor stations totalling
500,000 horsepower.
2.09      Tunisia has the right to use the intercontinental pipeline to
transmit gas from the Algerian border through to various places in Tunisia,
for which it will pay a charge of $1 to $4 per toe based on estimated total
throughput and distance. It also has the right to add additional offtakes.
Construction of the intercontinental pipeline is ahead of schedule and no
difficulty is expected in achieving the October 1981 commissioning date.
Tunisia will endeavor to take royalty gas from this date. The area of
greatest risk--the Sicily Channel crossing--is progressing satisfactorily.
Regardless of the progress offshore, the Algerian and Tunisian portions of
the pipeline can operate independently.
Project Description - Tunisia's Pipeline
2.10      Tunisia's own pipeline system will be built in stages, the first
two being within the next four years. The final stage, which is essentially
for security and flexibility and/or to transmit Miskar gas onshore, is not
expected before 1990. The project financed by the proposed loan, namely
Stage I, constitutes the initial phase in distributing gas from the Algeria-
Italy pipeline to consumers in Tunisia. This stage is for pipelines to
Tunis, Sousse, Gafsa and Tadjerouine (Map No. 14849). Stage II for which
the Bank will finance the optimization studies, will extend the system from
Gafsa to Gabes and from Tunis to Bizerte. Pipe diameters have been deter-
mined on the basis of potential 1990 demand, on the avoidance of the need
for installing compressors in the first two stages, and on the basis of an
eventual loop connecting Sousse southwards to Gabes. Operating pressure
will be about 70 atmospheres. Should the additional gas purchase (paragraph
2.06) not be obtained, it will be necessary to reassess the need and timing
for the extension to Bizerte.
2.11      The first stage of the project includes the items listed below:
(a)  a 20" buried pipeline running from the intercontinental
pipeline in the coastal region 70 km north to Tunis and
70 km south to Sousse. There will be provision for
compressors to be added at a later stage.
(b) an 18" buried pipeline running from a point near the
Algerian border 60 km south to Gafsa.



- 14 -
(c) a 90 km 8" buried pipeline from the intercontinental
pipeline to Kasserine and Tadjerouine.
(d) 170 km of laterals connecting the transmission lines to
customers. 80% of the laterals are for the Gafsa area.
(e) a cathodic protection system to prevent chemical or
electro-chemical corrosion.
(f) three injection terminals, including filtration and metering,
at the connections with the intercontinental pipeline; block
valves approximately every 20 km and at the branching point
for each consumer's delivery pipe; scraper trap assemblies
at both ends of each section of the network; and about 18
(stage 1) delivery terminals for pressure reduction, straining
and metering.
(g) Conversion of customers oil-using plant and equipment
to dual firing (oil and gas).
(h) consultancy services for right of way, engineering, procurement,
project management, construction supervision, start-up and com-
missioning.
(i) other consultancy services for studies on supplies to households
and small-scale industrial users and optimization of the stage
II system.
I(j) training of STEG employees both in Tunisia and abroad.
2.12      STEG has recommended to the Government that Stage I should also
include an extension from Sousse to Djemmal. The extension would not be
economic and has been omitted from the project description and cost estimates
and from the proposed Bank loan. At $5 million, its construction by STEG
would make little difference to the aggregate economic and financial forecasts.
It is expected that the two stage II pipelines will be built in 1984. Final
decisions have not yet been taken on the routing of the Gabes pipeline or on
the sizing of the Bizerte pipeline. Present plans are for an 18" pipeline
connecting Gafsa to Gabes, and for an 18" pipeline from Tunis to Bizerte.
Status of Project Preparation
2.13      The major part of the project preparation activities has been
completed. SOFREGAZ (engineering consultants, France) have undertaken route
surveys, market studies and optimization studies. In association with a
Tunisian company, TESA, they have completed most of the detailed design.
The results of the SOFREGAZ studies are contained in a series of 14 reports
issued between 1974 and 1979. Contracts have been signed with SOFREGAZ/TESA
and OTC for the consultancy services. Copies of all SOFREGAZ reports will be
forwarded to the Bank. STEG has agreed to forward quarterly progress reports
on the pipeline construction.



- 15 -
2.14      ETAP will arrange the rights of way.  As a national project land
can be acquired compulsorily to meet requirements, subject to compensation in
accordance with a national formula.  All land should be acquired by September
30, 1980.
Project Implementation
.
2.15      STEG has overall responsibility and control of the project and
will carry out the physical works and studies through the gas directorate.
SOFREGAZ/TESA have been engaged to supervise the project and to assist STEG
staff in training and in all project aspects. SOFREGAZ is an experienced
consulting organization with a proven track record in managing gas pipeline
construction. In conjunction with STEG, SOFREGAZ has prepared a detailed
PERT analysis of the project, which is summarized in Annex 2.01.
2.16      The start-up date for supplies to Tunisia has not been finalized but
is expected to be 1st November 1981 for the main part of the system. It is
expected that there will be a six month period before take or pay applies.
There is sufficient time to achieve completion on the scheduled date. The
cost of gas, which is subject to take or pay, will be equivalent to about
$200,000 per day.
Project Costs
2.17      The Project is estimated to cost $88 million, of which $55 million
or 63Z represents the foreign exchange component. A physical contingency of
6% was applied to all costs and reflects the thoroughness of the preparatory
work. The basic project cost estimate is in 1980 prices. Price escalation
has been allowed at lOZ for 1980 and 9% for 1981, except for linepipe already
contracted for at a fixed price. Project engineering, management and construc-
tion supervision are expected to require 420 man months, and are expected to
cost $12,000 per month for expatriates and $6,000 per man month for Tunisians,
Including all costs. Interest during construction is estimated at $4 million.
The following table gives a breakdown of the cost.

2.18      A firm estimate cannot be made for the next stage of development
until decisions are made on the outstanding items, i.e. the routing of the
Gabes pipeline and the sizing of the Bizerte pipeline. (The Bank will finance
the studies on these options, which will be completed in 1982.) For the
present, it is estimated that the cost will be approximately US$61 million at
current prices based on the assumptions outlined in paragraph 2.17. The cost
of compressors, storage and a central dispatch system will form part of a
subsiequent stage and are scheduled for the later 1980's.
Project Financing Plan
2.19      The total financing required is $92 million, including $4 million
of interest during construction. Financing proposed is:
IBRD                   $37 million
Export credits         $12 million
Equity                 $25 million
Other borrowings       $18 million
Details of the allocation of the proposed Bank loan are in paragraph 2.23
below. The proposed Bank loan of US$37 million would be made to STEG with the
Government guarantee at the current lending rate for 17 years including 4 years
of grace. Including payments to the Government, the effective interest rate
on the Bank loan will be 10%. The loan would be equal to 40% of the total
cost of stage 1 and to 63% of its foreign exchange component. Export credits
have been arranged for $5 million and no difficulty is expected in arranging a
further $7 million for the second contract for linepipe by October 31, 1980.
The initial $5 million is a condition of effectiveness. The terms expected
are 5 years including grace and an interest rate of 8.5 to 10%.
2.20      The balance of the financing is to be $25 million in equity from
the Government, provided as $10 million in 1980 and $15 million in 1981, and
$18 million in commercial loans, to be drawn in amounts of $10 million and
$8 million in 1981 and 1982 respectively. Loan terms available in Tunisia
are currently 8% interest and a minimum repayment period of 7 years, which
are compatible with the needs of the project. No funds are to be provided
by STEG.
Procurement and Disbursement
2.21      The borrower has decided that all goods and services will be procured
through international competitive bidding. This practice has been followed in
all procurement activities so far. To avoid delay in completion of the
project, orders will be placed during the first five months of 1980 for pur-
chases of linepipe, valves and fittings. Including the Stage I engineering,
orders placed total US$24 million (27% of project costs).
2.22      Potential bidders for the pipelaying are subject to prequalification
and the selection will be agreed by the Bank. The bid documents will permit
the work to be let as four contracts or in combination. Bidders could win



- 17 -
part or all of the work. Bids will be obtained from contractors in accordance
with Bank guidelines. It is expected that some bidders will seek local firms
to participate in undertaking the work. Contract award for pipelaying (US$39
million including contingencies) is expected in June, shortly after Board
presentation. Retroactive financing will be required only for valves and
fittings ($600,000).
2.23      The proposed Bank loan would meet the foreign exchange cost of
pipelaying, cathodic protection and the acquisition and installation of
valves and pipe fittings, supervision of conversion, power plant conversion,
metering, studies and the optimization for Stage II, as below, including the
foreign cost element of local contracts.
Amount Allocated
US$ million
(1)  Pipelaying and cathodic protection                       17.3
(2)  Valves and fittings                                       3.8
(3)  Conversion (supervision and for power)                    2.2
(4)  Metering                                                  8.1
(5)  Studies (urban supplies)                                  0.5
(6)  Optimization for Stage II                                 0.1
(7)  Unallocated                                               5.0
37.0
The loan should be fully disbursed by the second quarter of 1983. The closing
date would be December 31, 1983. Annex 2.02 gives the estimated disbursement
schedule.
Ecology and Safety
2.24      The proposed gas project does not pose serious ecological problems.
The route survey took care to avoid, where possible, damage to the country-
side, and once the pipelines are constructed the ecological disturbance will
be virtually nil. The project will improve the air quality in Tunisia's
major cities by making available a clean burning sulphur free fuel. The
expanded refinery is planned to produce low sulphur fuel oil. The gas project
will lead to elimination of the sulphur content and the sooting effects asso-
ciated with fuel oil. It will also lead to reduction in the transportation of
oil products by road.
2.25      Gas pipelines have a good safety record, and STEG's experience in
more than 20 years of operating a high pressure system has been good. The
Tunisian pipelines will be buried to a depth of about three feet to minimize
accidental damage, and they will be located for the most part away from
centers of population. STEG is arranging for a satisfactory maintenance
system and proper operator training both to ensure efficiency and safety.



- 18 -
Full efficiency and control will be achieved through a central dispatch and
communtications system, scheduled for the late 1980's, and will be necessary
once a compressor is installed.
Project Risks
2.26      The Tunisian pipeline project faces no special project risks.  There
is suifficient lead time to construct the pipeline, an experienced consultant
has been engaged, and the pipeline should be ready in good time.
2.27      The physical risk associated with the project is downstream on the
intercontinental pipeline, for which the Sicily Channel crossing requires new
technology. However, delays offshore should have no effect on supplies to
Tunisia. There is also the risk resulting from 50% of Tunisia's energy supply
coming through a single pipeline. This is not a significant factor as the
major energy consumers will have dual-fired installations and will retain
present oil storage tanks. Fuel oil is usually easy to obtain even when other
oil products are in short supply.
2.28      There is a financial risk in that part of the gas to be delivered
through the system is subject to take or pay provisions. No difficulty is
expected in being ready before take or pay applies. The excess of demand
over supply in the later eighties is adequate but is not large and a major
downturn in the economy could present some difficulty in absorbing the minimum
quantities of gas. The plans of the Government to ensure its ability to use
additional gas will require careful review in the light of the growth in
demand and actual progress with energy-using projects.
2.29      There is an economic risk in that the whole economic advantage of
the project relies on the differential between the cost of gas and the price
realizable by Tunisia when selling large quantities of fuel oil. The best
advice available is that, on the basis of the present contract, the margin
should be adequate at all times and there should be no prolonged difficulty in
sellinlg the fuel oil.
2.30      The final risk is political in that a major portion of Tunisia's
energy would be supplied by a single foreign country. It is worth noting
that Tunisian territory and ports are used for transporting Algerian oil,
and that in respect of this project, Tunisia is a minority partner in what
is essentially a major gas supply to Italy.

III. BENEFICIARY
Organization and Management
3.01      STEG was created by a decree law in 1962 to take over the operation
of seven private utility companies upon their nationalization. During its
early years, STEG's efforts were concentrated on physically integrating the
seven separate systems. After 1970, STEG was able to start on a systematic
expansion of the integrated national power system and turn its attention to
matters of organization, management and finance.
3.02      In most respects, STEG operates as an autonomous company, and has
become one of the most competent and effective in Tunisia, employing more
than 4,000 people. It enjoys operational freedom in the conduct of its day
to day business. The limitations on its freedom are in respect of its annual
capital and operating budgets, its rate schedules, and its salary scales.
The latter have not proved a major problem in practice but are now less
attractive than they were a few years ago.
3.03      STEG is governed by a board of eight members headed by a President
Director General (PDG) all appointed by the President of the Republic. The
top management consists of the PDG, his deputy, a Manager of Development
and Coordination and a Manager of Administration and a number of functional
directors, including one for gas. The PDG assumed his appointment on February
1st, 1980 and is reviewing the need for a simpler organization with clearer
responsibilities. STEG has agreed to discuss any necessary restructuring with
the Bank before implementation.
3.04      The gas directorate will have four departments covering studies,
equipment, transportation and distribution. The operations will be orga-
nized geographically, a Northern Division covering the Sousse/Tunis area,
a Southern Division for the pipelines in the interior and the south. When
introduced, the central despatch center and the compressors will both be
centralized operations.
Recruitment and Training
3.05      A recruitment and training program for operational personnel is
now being studied. The plan is for the gas directorate to absorb existing
staff employed at the Tunis gas works and their Borma pipeline and those
working on the supervision and control of the construction of the pipelines.
It is expected to have 130 staff, of whom almost 90% would be operators.
The Bank has discussed the staffing program with STEG and has agreed on a
suitable program.
3.06      The training of personnel will cover a broad spectrum of the gas
industry and will be undertaken both in Tunisia and in Algeria, France and
Italy. Gaz de France facilities will be used both for preliminary training
in respect of construction work and for maintenance, operations and commercial
aspects. Suppliers of equipment will be expected to arrange specialized



- 20 -
training. Complementary to the above, STEG staff will receive training
during work supervision and in the commissioning of the first phase of the
network. The arrangements are satisfactory and training outside Tunisia will
be completed before the pipeline becomes operational.
Accotnting, Auditing and Insurance
3.07      STEG has an accounting and management information system which in
most respects is efficient. The majority of its records are computerized.
Its clefects are in relation to the separation between its gas operations and
its power operations. Assets are not revalued. The financial accounts for
the Tunis town gas system and natural gas system are integrated with the
power accounts. Under Loan IBRD 724 TUN, STEG agreed to maintain separate
(non-statutory) accounts for El Borma, and has done so although the accounts
are not fully separate in items such as cash and are not always produced
promptly. Commensurate with STEG providing no funds toward the proposed
project it is recommended (1) that the annual accounts for Algerian gas be
separated from the other activities (including separate cash accounts) on a
non-statutory basis, (2) that the local Tunis gas activities be separated from
the power accounts when Tunis is supplied with Algerian gas and at that
stage! should be included with the Algerian gas accounts, and (3) that, in view
of its short-term nature (to 1986) there be no basic change in respect of El
Borma, although it is hoped that the accounts can be produced more quickly.
The present financial covenants under loan IBRD 1355-TUN would continue to
apply for STEG's power operations (including, as at present, El Borma gas, Cap
Bon gas and the Tunis town gas supplies). STEG has agreed to this basis.
STEG will be asked to provide detailed plans for the accounting arrangements
by 1 July 1981.
3.08      STEG's accounts are audited by Nawar & Co., an Egyptian firm of
Chartered Accountants, who are satisfactory to the Bank. STEG will be re-
quired at negotiations to continue to have its accounts audited independently,
and to submit the audited accounts for STEG as a whole to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. In respect of its Algerian gas accounts,
STEG will arrange a similar (but non-statutory) audit and submit such accounts
to the Bank within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
3.09      Injuries to third parties and accidents to personnel will be insured
internationally. STEG will provide other insurance coverage through a nation-
alized company. In line with normal practice in the industry, damage to
pipelines as a result of explosion will not be insured. STEG has a number of
years experience of arranging insurance and its general practice is acceptable.
The arrangements will be kept under review during supervision.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Future Pricing of Natural Gas
4.01      The major energy pricing problem in Tunisia is the pricing of fuel
oil. Its current price at $60/ton is one-third of the price prevailing on the
Italian spot market. By contrast, in 1980 prices the delivered cost of gas to
be purchased from Algeria is $120/toe. Fuel oil represents 44% of oil products
used in Tunisia and it receives 68% of subsidies on oil products. Both from
the point of view of the national budget and also the need for the price of
gas to be competitive with fuel oil, major increases are necessary in fuel
oil prices and/or substantial subsidies are needed for natural gas. It is
essential for the success of the project that industry and power have some
encouragement to use natural gas. Gas has advantages over fuel oil, its
immediate competitor, in its lack of sulphur compared with the fuel oil
available in Tunisia, and in a number of other respects. It also has some
disadvantages when used in equipment initially designed to burn oil.
Current practice has been to charge for natural gas and fuel oil at the
same price per Btu. The Government accepts the need to maintain the
competitiveness of natural gas into the future.
4.02      The Government is also concerned to preserve the commercial nature
of STEG and for it to operate as an efficient business guided by financial
as well as other criteria. The uncertainties of international energy prices
are such that, whilst the Government does not, in principle, wish to make any
subsidies to STEG, it may have to provide such subsities, both in the form
of cash and/or royalty gas, during the first two years of operation. From
1982 onwards, the Government will gradually increase the price of royalty gas
charged to STEG, so that by the end of 1986, full import prices will be
charged for all Algerian gas sold in Tunisia.
4.03      The price of gas under the purchase contract will be reviewed twice
yearly in the light of changes in cost, and adjustments will be made if neces-
sary. Apart from wider considerations, limitations on the funds available
for subsidies make it desirable to review and adjust gas prices in Tunisia
each time prices are adjusted under the purchase contract.
4.04      The result of these factors is that the price of natural gas in
Tunisia will progressively increase such that, by the beginning of 1987, at
the latest, the gas will be sold at not less than import parity (including all
transportation costs). Fuel oil, currently selling at one-third of its
international price, will at least double in price in real terms and keep pace
with future increases, by the same date. Achievement of the above will be a
major step toward international prices and will be important factors toward
ensuring the economic and financial viability of the project.

Future Performance: The Natural Gas Accounts (Algerian Gas)
4.05      The finances of STEG's gas division reflect problems commonly
encountered with a new entity. As discussed in Chapter [II, power finances
will be separate. Salient features of the financial projections for Algerian
gas based on an average inflation rate of 8%, and a rate of return on revalued
assets also of 8% from 1982 are summarized below. Detailed projections for
gas finances are in Annex 4.03. The forecasts are based on use of the inter-
continental pipeline at a fee of about $3 per t.o.e., and the project cost,
financing plan, and contract quantities and costs as outlined in Chapter II.

Debt/equity ratio              63/37    62/38    47/53    22/78
4.06      The purchase cost of gas (including the equivalent for royalty gas)
forms over 90% of the total STEG costs for its gas activities, and is exempli-
fied by an operating ratio in the range 96-98%. STEG's financial condition is
therefore dictated by its day to day operations, in particular the need to
ensure that: (i) all gas purchased is sold; (ii) that the average selling
price for gas exceeds its average purchase cost by an adequate margin and
(iii) the need to match its receipts and payments throughout the year. This
will be achieved through the strategy of using power plants for balancing the
demand of the natural gas network, through half yearly reviews of gas prices
in the light of the latest information on gas purchase costs, and through
instituting a billing system in which the terms for receivables parallel the
terms for payables. Funds generated will be used in priority for gas expendi-
tures. In addition to the above STEG will establish tariffs sufficient to
earn a rate of return of 8% on revalued assets (revalued annually) including
subsidies for 1982 and 1983, and will ensure that its internally generated
funds are at all times sufficient for debt service needs, to provide adequate
working capital, to meet reasonable contingencies, and to finance renewals and
replacements and, as necessary, a proportion of capital expenditures. Forecasts
of STEG's finances will be sent to the Bank on a regular basis.



- 23 -
4.07      The gas division's debt/equity ratio over the period 1982-90 is
expected to be high initially but will become satisfactory by 1987. The debt
service coverage is tight in the years up to 1987 and requires careful supervi-
sion. Debt service coverage is expected to be satisfactory from 1988 and in
the absence of further major investments, would rise to 1.75 times by 1990. A
stage III investment program will bring down the debt service coverage substan-
tially, and STEG will be asked to restrict its borrowings for its gas operations
so that not in any year after 1986 will the debt service for gas fall below
1.2 times. Agreement on the main features of paragraphs 4.06 and 4.07 was
reached at negotiations.
Past Performance: STEG Electricity
4.08      STEG's revenue accounts, balance sheets and cash flow statements
for the fiscal years ending December 31, 1977 and 1978 are as shown in Annex
4.02. During these two fiscal years, STEG has almost but not fully met the
earnings covenant associated with the Bank loan 1355-TUN; 50% of the profits
result from the El Borma gas operations. The results for 1979 are expected to
be less satisfactory but are not yet to hand.
4.09      STEG's accounts receivable for electricity supply were still at
a high level (174 days' revenues) in 1978, principally as a result of slow
payment by local authorities and Government departments. Accounts payable
are also high and reflect a deliberate policy of not making payments to
municipalities unless first they pay their power bills.  The current ratio
is unsatisfactory and continues to receive attention.
4.10      Gas recovered from STEG's El Borma gas operations is charged to
electricity operations at the same price as fuel oil. The income statement,
however, is consolidated. Consequently, gas "profits" subsidize power opera-
tions. This will not apply to, and will not be affected by, the new supplies
from Algeria. No action is proposed as El Borma supplies will cease in 1986.
Future Performance: STEG Electricity
4.11      STEG has agreed to separate its new gas activities from its power
operations. However, forecast income statements, balance sheets and cash
flow statements have been prepared for power to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposals for the gas project (see Annex 4.03). STEG expects to spend
$1100 million during 1979-86 on new power plants and expansion of its system.
Thirty nine percent of STEG's requirements are expected to be met from in-
ternally generated funds, including customer contributions, 1% from increases
in capital and 60% from borrowing; 80% from new borrowing and 20% from the
drawdown of existing loans. The Bank is currently considering a loan of about
US$20 million (FY82) to STEG.
4.12      Based on the expected load growth and the level of future expenses,
STEG is expected to meet the rate of return covenant (8% on average net fixed
assets) by increasing yearly its electricity tariffs in line with the rate of
inflation.

V. ECONOMIC ASPECTS
Background
5.01      The alternative sources of industrial energy available to Tunisia
are the Algerian natural gas, fuel oil and Tunisia's own gas reserves. Devel-
opment of the latter has been rejected by the Government for the time being
(at least to meet short-term needs) on the grounds of their relatively small
size, the high capital cost, the risks involved and the difficulty of blending
domestic gas production at this time into a longer term gas supply strategy.
The economic analysis concentrates on the remaining choice, between importing
Algerian gas and using fuel oil.
5.02      Algeria will be responsible for all costs associated with the fur-
ther development of the Hassi R'Mel field and the pipeline up to the Algeria/
Tunisia frontier, and Italy will be responsible for the construction costs
of the intercontinental pipeline within Tunisia. Tunisia's responsibility
is therefore limited to paying for the gas at the frontier, paying 1% of the
capital cost to purchase the pipeline, and paying its share of the capital
charges and operating costs for that part of the trans-Tunisia pipeline it
uses.,
5.03      The royalties Tunisia will receive on the transit of gas to Italy
are in substitution for import duties, transit fees and taxes on the con-
struction and operation of the pipeline and are payable in cash or in kind
at the option of the Tunisian Government. As these royalties are receivable
by Tunisia regardless of whether or not Tunisia has a gas system of its own,
when taken as gas they are treated in the economic analysis as having a cost
equivalent to the cash which could be taken in lieu.
5.04      The gas purchase contract and royalties were discussed in Chapter
II. Where royalties are taken in cash, Italy pays for the royalties at the
same Algerian border price as is payable by Italy for its purchased gas. The
Italians would then be fully responsible for transport costs.
The Market
5.05      Between 1986 and 1989 the industrial energy market is unlikely to
be able to absorb the whole of the purchased gas and the royalty gas, and up
to half of the royalty gas is expected to be taken as cash. On present plans
all the purchased gas and the remainder of the royalty gas will be sold in
the Tunisian market (see Annex 1.02).
Development and Operating Costs
5.06      The capital cost of the project is US$68 million (excluding taxes
and duties), Stage II is expected to cost a further US$40 million, both at
constant prices. Annual operating costs are US$500,000 rising to US$1.8
milliLon with Stage II. Transportation costs for the intercontinental pipeline
will be US$1 to 4 per T.o.e. according to distance.



- 25 -
Value of Sales
5.07      Gas sales within Tunisia are valued at US$180 per tonne (US$4.50
per million BTU) which is the January 1980 price of (high sulphur) fuel oil
on the international markets. Initially the gas availability will reduce fuel
oil (high sulphur) and gas oil imports; after the expansion of the refinery
the use of gas will promote gas oil exports and will result in large fuel oil
exports (low sulphur) even in the 1986-89 period when a temporary surplus of
gas is expected. No attempt has been made in the economic analysis to quantify
the proportion of higher-value fuels which will also be displaced. Despite
the large increase in prices during 1979, no permanent reduction is foreseen
in the international fuel oil prices and a value of US$180 is felt to be
conservative.
Project Profitability
(a) Economic Rate of Return
5.08      Based on the considerations outlined above the economic rate of
return on Stages I and II of the project are comparable at about 50% (Annex
5.01 and 5.02). The rate of return reflects the high added value from
replacing use of fuel oil with gas which is available at advantageous terms,
and acknowledges the low capital intensivity of the project. Should the
contract be renegotiated such that the only saving was the differential in
transmission costs to Italy and Tunisia, (which is seen as the minimum benefit
in the long term), the rate of return would be 28%.
(b) Pay-Back Period
5.09      On a discounted basis at 10% the pay-back period after start-up is
3 years which is unusually good for a pipeline project.
(c) Net Present Value
5.10      Using a 10% discount rate and the 20 year life of the contract,
the net present value of the project is US$700 million. Approximately 80%
is from Stage I and 20% from Stage II.
(d) Unit Cost Comparison
5.11      Taking the expected transit charge for the intercontinental pipeline,
the cost of transportation through STEG's system and the gas purchase price
for first half 1980, the delivered cost of gas is US$120 per t.o.e. The
second half is expected to be US$140.  The equivalent fuel oil price (January
1980) is US$180 per tonne.
Benefits to the Economy
5.12      Apart from the project profitability the main benefit from the
project is the foreign exchange saving. Taking account of an annual foreign
exchange cost for debt charges of US$10 million, the substitution of gas



- 26 -
for fuel oil will give a net annual benefit at full throughput of not less
than US$120 million (1979 price levels) which is equal to 7% of Tunisia's
exports.
5.13      The training under the project will lead to a significant transfer
of technology for STEG staff. The pipeline system will be operated by
Tunisians. A total staff complement of 130 is planned. In addition, the
pipelaying will provide temporary employment for local labor.
5.14      The natural gas is free of sulphur and consequently will have a
favorable impact on the atmospheric pollution in Tunis and other cities.
The lack of sulphur will reduce STEG's operating costs for its power plants,
by about $2 per tonne.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations assurance was obtained from the Borrowers on
the following:
(i) consultants will be retained for supervision of the project.
Copies of their reports and quarterly progress reports will
be sent to the Bank (paragraphs 2.13 and 2.15);
(ii) consultants will be engaged to undertake a feasibility
study of supplying gas to households and small scale
industry in Tunisia's major cities, on terms of reference
to be agreed with the Bank (paragraph 1.19);
(iLi) export credits of $7 million approximately will be
arranged by October 31, 1980 (in addition to those required
for loan effectiveness (paragraph 2.19);
(iv) commercial loans of $18 million will be arranged (paragraph
2.20);
(v) that any restructuring substantially affecting the organization
for STEG will be discussed with the Bank before implementation
(paragraphs 3.03/3.04);
(vi) STEG will maintain separate accounts and balance
sheets (including separation of funds) for its Algerian
gas activities on a non-statutory basis, and will incorporate
Tunis gas activities when supplied with Algerian gas.
Detailed plans will be provided to the Bank by July 1st,
1981 (paragraph 3.07);



- 27 -
(vii)  the financial covenants under loan IBRD 1355-TUN will
continue to apply to STEG's power activities (including
El Borma gas and, temporarily, Cap Bon gas and local
Tunis supplies) (paragraph 3.07);
(viii)  STEG will continue to have its statutory accounts audited
by independent auditors and will submit the accounts to
the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal
year;  STEG will have its Algerian gas accounts audited by
independent auditors on a non-statutory basis, and will submit
such accounts to the Bank within nine months of the end of each
fiscal year (paragraph 3.08);
(ix)  the system of accounts receivable from STEG's customers that
use imported gas will be compatible with STEG's overall payment
obligations to all suppliers (paragraph 4.06);
(x) funds generated from gas operations will not be used for
other purposes without first ensuring that requirements
for maintenance, debt service and capital expenditures,
have been met (paragraph 4.06);
(xi)  the selling price of gas will cover cost, (generating an
8% rate of return on revalued assets), will be sufficient
for cash and other needs, and prices will be reviewed on
a semi-annual basis. Subsidies will be restricted as
discussed in the report (paragraph 4.06);
(xii)  borrowings will be restricted so that, beginning 1988, in
no year will the debt service ratio fall below 1.3
(paragraph 4.07);
(xiii)  the staffing and training programs (paragraphs 3.05, 3.06);
and
(xiv)  the timing of land acquisition (paragraph 2.14).
6.02      Assurances from the Government were obtained during negotiations
on the following:
(i) the provision by the Government of $25 million equity over the
years 1980 and 1981 (paragraph 2.20); and
(ii)  the pricing policy for fuel oil and natural gas and the
related finances of STEG (paragraphs 4.01 to 4.04).
6.03      Firm arrangement of export credits of not less than $5 million on
awarded contracts will be a condition of effectiveness (paragraph 2.19), as
well as a legal opinion certifying the effectiveness and a enforceability of
the royalty and gas purchase contracts (paragraph 2.06 and 2.07).
6.04      Subject to satisfactory agreement on the above, the proposed project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$37 million.

ANNEX 1.04
SECTOR INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL SOURCES
1.        The basic investment and financial forecasts are in Tunisia's
Fifth Plan, and totalled US$1330 million. Provision for exploration, which of
necessity must be tentative, was budgeted at $260 million, to be financed
almost entirely by the foreign oil companies. US$125 million has been spent
in the first two years and the expenditure over the five years is more likely
to reach $400 million. The Plan provided for $290 million for a program of
water injection at El Borma (in which the State has a 50% share) and the
development of the small Isis offshore oil field, mainly to be financed from
profits. SITEP, the operator at El Borma, has recently raised two $20 million
loans towards its development.
2.        The Fifth plan included provision for a $160 million (1977) expan-
sion of the state refinery at Bizerte, to be financed 65% from foreign sources.
The prime purpose of the refinery is to reduce the rapidly growing burden of
imported petroleum products, particularly light and middle distillates. No
revised cost estimate is available but no major change is anticipated.
3.        The largest investment included in the Fifth Plan was the develop-
ment of the Miskar offshore gas field together with an onshore distribution
system. The Miskar development ($500 million) has been deferred indefinitely.
The gas distribution system now estimated at $140 million, is the subject of
this report.
4.        The electricity industry is planned to absorb $500 million, being
financed from three main sources: foreign loans, customer contributions
and internal cash generation. STEG plans to maintain the growth rate of
recent years. At the same time a substantial part of the investment will be
for the self-generation of electricity.

ANNEX 1.05
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
1.        The Government seeks to encourage foreign oil companies to explore
for oil and gas and over 85% of the prospective area is licensed to overseas
companies. Overall the level of exploration activity has been satisfactory
although rather uneven. The Energy Directorate is aware of the situation,
which is being carefully watched. The Government's policy is to negotiate
each concession on an ad hoc basis to allow for different techno-economic
factors. In recent agreements 20% of the crude has to be offered to Tunisia
at 10% below international prices and the Government has taken the right to
acquire through ETAP a 50% share in any field. Discoveries have been brought
onstream quickly to help the country's growth and there is as yet no explicit
conservation policy for oil or gas, although the production plateau can be
maintained only for a further 6 years.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
I.   General
1.01      The Tunisian accounting system has developed from the French.
STEG's accounts show two further special features:
-    STEG has a system for interest capitalization which almost
has a net nil effect. The system is complicated and is
under review with a view to its abolition. Accordingly
it has been ignored in the projections.
-    Income taxes are recorded as charges and liabilities
until formal exemption is given, usually the following
year.
In the financial projections income taxes have been eliminated since they are
invariably waived and interest during construction has not been capitalized.
The statements are presented according to American formats.
1.02      For financial purposes, STEG is assumed to be separated into two
divisions: the electricity division and the gas division. However, since
the El Borma and Cap Bon fields are expected to be depleted shortly their
related income and expenses will continue to be consolidated with those of
the electricity division.
1.03      In accordance with STEG's experience and Tunisian conditions,
general inflation has been taken at 8% for all aspects (other than capital
costs).
II. Gas Division
2.01      Income Statements
(a) The Algerian gas purchase quantities are those in the Algerian-
Tunisian contract and contract request. Quantities of royalties are derived
from the Algeria/Italy contract and Tunisia/Italy accord. Royalty gas is
assumed to be bought and sold by STEG at the same prices as purchased gas from
1987, and subsidized in earlier years. The purchase price is assumed to
increase by 8% per annum.
(b) Annual operating costs were provided by STEG as well as the esti-
mate of the transportation cost through the intercontinental pipeline.
(c) Depreciation was computed on the basis of net revalued fixed
assets used during the period. Replacement cost is based on 8% inflation.



- 38 -
ANNEX 4.01
Page 2 of 2 pages
(d) The selling price of Algerian gas is equal to the price of fuel oil.
i(e) It was assumed that royalty gas would be subsidized in all year
to 19986 in a way which would result in a progressive increase in natural gas
prices.  Forecasts for 1982 are indeterminate and sales income figures include
direct subsidy. It was assumed that no direct subsidy was needed in 1983.
2.02      Balance Sheets
(a) Gross assets were revalued at 8% per annum.
(b) Operating inventory is estimated to be 1% of the investment
in linepipes and valves, fittings, etc.
(c) The minimum cash balance is equivalent to two months of
operating expenses and transportation cost.
(d) Accounts payable represent three months on capital works.
(e) Accounts receivable equal two months sales.
(f) The other liabilities and the capital reflect the project
financing plan as outlined in paras 2.19/2.20)
(g) Interest has been based on 10% for the $37 million IBRD loan,
9.5% on export credits, and 8% on commercial loans.
III. Electricity Division
3.01      The projections are based on STEG's 1978 audited statements and
STEG's own projections for 1980-1986. Fuel costs were assumed to be as
explained above and electricity tariffs to be set so that STEG's power
division earns 8% on the average net fixed assets (minus customers contri-
butions) used during the period in accordance with present practice.
