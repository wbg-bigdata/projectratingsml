INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF nIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMFNT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL MINIMUM PACKAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$21.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a program, entitled "Minimum
Package Program" (MPP), for the systematic provision of farm inputs together
with instruction in their use to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report "Current Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian Economy"
(AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971 (R71-257). The report of a
recent economic mission is nearing completion. A Country Data Sheet is
attached as Annex I.
3.        Virtually isolated from modern science and technology until the
middle of the twentieth century, Ethiopia is recognized to be one of the
twenty-five least developed countries. The per capita income is $76 a year
and some 85 percent of the population of 25 million are peasant farmers.
Agriculture accounts for about 90 percent of employment, 58 percent of GDP,
and almost all exports. Manufacture contributes only around 5 percent of
GDP.
4.        During the last two decades thie Government has made notable efforts
to accelerate the pace of development. Ethiopia is now in its Third Five-Year
Plan. The first two plans gave priority to the development of infrastructure,
and the establishement of manufacturing industries (mainly government-financed)
based on import substitution. The Third Plan emphasizes the development of
agriculture and of activities such as feeder road construction which directly
support agricultural development. However, progress has been below Plan
targets. Institutions are changing only gradually, and this slow pace of
institutional change has inhibited rapid growth. Additional constraining
factors have been the low and somewhat uneven capital inflow and fluctuations
in the world price of coffee (which accounts for about 60 percent of Ethiopia's
exports), leading to large fluctuations in investment. Wtih respect to aid,
Ethiopia, unlike many other African countries which were formerly dependent,
has no traditional source of technical and financial help.



- 2 -
5.        Over the past decade, per capita GDP has grown at about 2 percent
a year.  Growth would have been even lower but for a 16 percent annual rate
of growth of the manufacturing sector based on import substitution.      The
economy was particularly sluggish during the late 1960's, although there was
a sharp upturn in the economy for about a year beginning in mid-1969,
attributable to a rise in coffee prices. Unfortunately, coffee prices de-
clined in late 1970 and although they have risen again since mid-July 1972,
future prices are uncertain. Partly because the opportunities for further
import substitution were more limited, the growth of manufacturing during
the past several years was less rapid than before and the economy as a whole
has grown at or below the 4.5 percent average for the 1960's, and below the 6
percent growth target of the Third Five-Year Plan which expires in 1974.      With
population growing at 2.5 percent, per capita GD)P has risen at about 2 percent
rather than the 3.5 percent envisaged in the Plan. As a result of these
developments, the investment and growth targets for the remainder of the Plan
are not expected to be realized. Also, while total population grew at 2.5
percent a year, the urban population rose at 7 percent a year and the problem
of urban unemployment is becoming more significant.
6.         Turning to the futture, unless the inflow of external capital in-
creases substantially, and unless the rate of growth of non-coffee exports
and of total export earnings is significantly raised, the economic growth
rate may decline to beJow the population growth rate during the next fifteen
years. Export possibilities other than coffee include livestock, fresh fruit
and vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds.    Increasing exports, however, depends
on providing the appropriate incentives to producers and marketing inter-
mediaries. Experience in other countries suggests that the pattern of agri-
cultural output is responsivet to changes in the relative prices of agricultural
commodities. Furthermore, some preliminary work undertaken in Ethiopia concludes
that the supply of a number of export commodities has responded positively to
changyes in prices.  It appears, therefore, that if the foreign exchange con-
straint is to be confronted in an effective manner, nolicy measures should be
taken which affect relative prices in a way which discourages imports and en-
courages exports.
7.        With respect to capital inflows, Ethiopia has attracted only modest
amounts of private capital, and thus depends mainlv on public capital inflow.
Annual gross capital inflows have been onlv about $1.24 per capita in the past
five years (see page 3 of Annex I). Civen Ethiopia's low GDP and the resultant
low availability of domestic resources, this level is not adequate to support
a rate of investment necessary for the achievement of a resonable growth rate.
With regard to public savings, performance has improved in recent years, but
is below taxable capacity.
S.         The Bank is Dursuing a number of activities to support the Govern-
ment's development strategy. A mission visited Ethiopia to make a comprehensive
study of the agricultutral sector and the resulting report was recently circu-
latedi to the Executive Directors (R73-37). The Ethiopian Government, with



-3-
IDA assistance, has undertaken a review of the education sector to enable it
to design a strategy, policies, and curricula which will produce the trained
manpower needed for Ethiopia's development. The Bank is executing agency for
a UNDP-financed study of internal air transport with special regard to tourism
development, and for a UNDP project which is providing a team of experts to
help the Government in improving its planning.
9.        The Agrricultural Sector Yission has concluded that the problem of
Ethiopian agriculture is one of supply, marketing, and processing, rather
than demand. Livestock has the best export growth potential. The country's
production potential and the international markets for its non-coffee exports
are favorable. However, the development of this productive potential is
constrained by inadequate infrastructure, shortage of credit facilities,
shortage of skilled manpower, and existing T-and tenure systems. The Govern-
ment is aware of these constraints and is taking some steps to deal with them.
For example, the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) has been
established, and legislation for tenancy reform has been submitted to Parliament.
10.       Three main difficulties confront Ethiopia - inadequate domestic
resources, a foreign exchange constraint, and an absorptive capacity problem.
A large part of Ethiopia's investment, public and private, will need to be
financed externally; since public savings are likely to fall short of needs,
some part of the domestic cost of public investment will have to be financed
from external resources. The present debt service ratio is about 11.5 percent.
However, assuming that the external capital necessary to support a modest growth
rate of only 4.5 Dercent is obtained on normal Bank terms and that exports
continue to grow at the present low rate (3 percent a year or less), the debt
service ratio will likely exceed 20 percent before 1980. Thus, needed capital
should be provided to the greatest extent possible on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
11.       From 1950 to the present, Bank Group lending in Ethiopia has
totalled $196.2 million, comprised of ten IDA credits totalling $88.2 million
and twelve Bank loans totalling $108.6 million. Four loans have been fully
repaid, and four others are fully disbursed. Two credits have also been
fully disbursed. IFC has made four commitments in Ethiopia totalling $14.1
million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
TFC investments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
12.       Until 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on assisting
the construction of Ethiopia's infrastructure of roads, power and telecommuni-
cations. Aside from some small amounts for agriculture provided under loans
to the Development Bank of Ethiopia, the Bank Group's first lending for
agriculture in Ethiopia was the credit for the Wolamo Project (169-ET) in 1969.



-4-
Since that time four additional credits have been made for agricultural
projects - one to support mechanized commercial farming at Humera in North-
west Ethiopia, one for dairy development in the Addis Ababa area, a second
livestock project, and one for coffee processing. Additionally, the credit
for the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was partly for
ag-: icultural credit and partly for credit for industrial development. Credits
have also been made for an education project and a highway project with emphasis
on feeder roads, and a loan has been made for a water supply and sewerage project.
This shift in the lending program reflects the Bank Group's emphasis on agri-
culture, the increased opportunity for agriculttural lendin, brought about in
part by improved sectoral knowledge, and the heavier emphasis on agriculture
in the Government's own priorities. This shift has been greatly assisted by the
Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa (PMEA), which has played a major
role in project identification and preparation in the agriculture sector.
13.       W4ith respect to Bank Group lending, a basic constraint is the
Ethiojian capacity to prepare and implement projects, especially in the
agricultural sector.   Hence, we intend to provide assistance in project
preparation, and, through technical assistance, to help strengthen the adminis-
trative capacity in the beneficiary institutions so that they may be able to
utilize larger inflows of assistance. At the same time we plan to continue
lending to such institutions as the Imperial Highway Authority (IHA), the
Imperial Board of Teleconununications of Ethiopia (IBTE), and the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA), insitutions with which the Bank
has worked for some years and which now have substantial capacity for
channeling resources into development programs.
14.       Since the economy is essentially agricultural and because agri-
culture offers the greatest opportunities for development and for achieving
imnproved income distribution and employment, the m!1ain thrust of our lending
program will be in this sector. Within the sector, the Government is support-
ing three types of development - smallholcier peasant farming, medium-scale
commercial farming and larger-scale irrigated plantations - all of which are
essential to meet the gyoal of expanding and diversifying agricultural pro-
duction as rapidly as possible. Our credits for the Wolano, Coffee Processing
and the Second Livestock projects assistedl smallholder farming while the
Hunnera and Dairy projects assisted medium-scale farming. The proposed project
for providing a variety of essential inputs for peasant agriculture - the
so-called Agricultural Minimum Package Project - would provide further
assistance to smallholders. The proposed Amibara Irrigation Project would
combine assistance to smallholder settlers and larger-scale irrigated farms.
15.      '}e have a sizeable pipeline of projects at various stages of prepar-
ationi.  Several of these will be follow-ups to on-oing projects and others will
he breaking new ground. Included in the first category will be a third livestock
project, and follow-up credits for the Wolamo, Humera, Coffee and AIDB projects.
Included in the second category are proposals for a land settlement project
in the Shire Lowlands, a Grain Storage and Marketing Project, and several
regional agricultural projects which will provide a base for eventual expansion



- 5 -
of the M4inimum Package Program into other areas. The education sector is
another priority for Bank lending and we plan to present a third education
project soon, and hope to present a fourth education project for your consid-
eration in the next 12 to 18 months; the latter will be based on a major Education
Sector Review recently completed by the Government. In addition, we plan to
present projects in telecommunications and transport, and one in aviation which
is linked to the promotion of tourism.
16.       A summnary of recent external assistance to Ethiopia by source and
by sector can be seen on p. 3 of Annex I. During 1967-71 the Bank and IDA
contributed 36 percent of gross inflows of official loans. This share is
expected to increase substantially durinr the next few years as amounts dis-
bursed under Bank loans and IDA credits rise. Given the poverty of Ethiopia,
the need for capital and at best moderate export prospects, most of the Bank
Group's future lending will be in the form of IDA credits.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN HTHIOPIA
17.       About 90 percent of Ethiopia's population of 25 million lives in
rural areas and derives its livelihood directly from agriculture. Subsis-
tence and commerical agriculture account for approximately 60 percent of
the gross domestic product and nearly all of Ethiopia's exports. Cereals
account for about 35 percent of agricultural production, coffee for about 15
percent and livestock and livestock products for 29 percent. Only about 25
percent of agricultural production is marketed. While there appears to be a
rough balance between food production and internal consumption requirements,
there has been long-term stagnation in overall agricultural productivity, and
production is tending to fall behind the needs of the country. There is no
assurance that with the present levels of farm management and technology
production will grow as rapidly as population.
18.       Despite handicaps, Ethiopian agriculture has favorable prospects.
Fortunatelv there are fertile lands, favorable climates and, importantly,
an apparent readiness on the part of the large farm population to accept
innovations in production and marketing. Unfortunately, lack of transport,
inadequate land tenure, low levels of investment, plus external factors, such
as wide variations in coffee prices and the closure of the Suez Canal, have
prevented the underlying potential fromi being realized. Given, however, the
characteristics of the economy, development strategy must be based on the
development of the capacity of the agricultural sector to feed the nation,
earn and save foreign exchange, and produce the raw materials for industrial
development.
19.       Ethiopia has a total land area of about 1.2 million km      (about twice
the size of Kenya) composed of a central highland mass surrounded by lowlands.
T'here are six basic ecological regions among which topography, climate, soils,
and natural vegetation vary sharply with consequent variations in agricultural



-- 6 -
potential.  While there is no detailed map coverag,e nor land classification
information, it is estimated that approximately 9 percent of the land is
cultivated, approximately one--half is in permanent pasture, 21 percent is
barren desert or swamps, 10 percent is rivers and lakes, and 7 percent of the
;.and is forest.  Agricultural land (the 9 percent tuder cultivation) averages
!-out 3 Liectares per family., but manv holdings are much smaller.
90.       Although large commercial Larms exist, nost farms are small.    With
the exception of the relatively few larger plantations producing such crops
as sugar and cotton, traditional production methods and low yields dominate
thil agricultural scene.  Nearly 85 percent of the population is concentrated
on small farms in the highlandl region which produce the bulk of the national
cron output and maintain iTore than 50 nercent of the cattle population.
While little agricultural research has been completed, it appears that the
highlands have the potential for good yields for a wide variety of crops such
as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruit, vegetables, and livestock and dairy products.
Presently, however, yields are very low hy international standards.
21.       For the most part, t1he highlands are densely populated and farm sizes
are small with average cultivated areas per holding varying from 1.2 to 2
hectares.  Thus, farming is characterized by intensive cultivation of small-
scale holdinos whiich in many cases do not absorb t-he labor of the farm family.
About 70 percent of the -ropped area is in cereal.s with the rest mainly in
nilseeds and pulses.   A large cattle herd is maintained in the highlands and
m    0uch of the land is suited to livestock; however !-roduetion and marketing
methods are -enerally inefficient and offtake is low, wi th cattle kept as
draught animals, for dairving, and as insurance or store of wealth.    North of
Addis Ababa, communal oumershiD with individual cultivation rights dominates;
soouth o; the capital are the areas of indi.vidual. ownership.  'tore than half
the tornl cultivated area, both individually and communally owned, is farmed by
tenants whoo, as a group, comprise more than nhalf of thie rural population.
Communal aniid share-croppina svstems of land tenure aggravate the problem of
soil conservation.   Additionlally, the increasing intensity of farmiing over many
centuries has resultecl in the progressive shortenlng of fallow, periods, t'ne
clearine! and cultivation of al.l but the most precipitous slopes, almost total
removal of tree cover, and the resultant de,gradation of soil structure.
':'.      in g~eneral, thiere is little unutilized land in the highlands and
the potential lies mainly in improving yiel(l. hIowever, even these densely
settled areas are isolated and it is estimated that as many as three-quarters
of Lhe holdings are more than a half-day's walking distance from a road.     In
aucition to isolation, increased crop yields on these farms are constrained by
tLe fol lowing:
(i)  cultural practice is very inefficient si.nce plowing is done
by oxen andl a wooden plow, threshing is done by treading
with oxen; and nlanting, weeding and harvesting are done by
hand;



- 7 -
(ii) aside from the government-sponsored projects, fertilizers and
improved seeds are practically unknown;
(iii)  except for cereals wiere good research results are available,
most plant varieties are poor performers;
(iv) holdings are small and in many cases fragmented;
(v) more than half of Ethiopian farm families do not have title
to the land they work and a large proportion of these do not
have a leasehold on terms which provide the necessary
incentives to invest in land improvements and undertake
innovative practices;
(vi) levels of public investment in agriculture are low and the
level of public service for the agricultural sector is in-
adequate; and
(vii) the marketing infrastructure is undeveloped and fragmented
and reduces returns to the farmer and increases the cost to
the consumer.
23.       The lowlands surround the highlands, with the largest area in the
east, which is also the driest. At present the lowlands are used by nomadic
pastoralists on an extensive basis, dictated by the availability of water
and keep for livestock. Livestock mortality is high, productivity is low,
and off-take rates of 4-6 percent reflect the subsistence nature of the
activity. Where rainfall is adequate for cultivation, endemic malaria
generally discourages highland farmers. While there is potential for develop-
ment in the west and southwest lowlands, where spontaneous development is
taking place as malaria is brought under control, the problems of communica-
tions and transport inhibit development.
24.       The observations above need to be seen in historical perspective.
Progress has been made in recent years in laying the groundwork for growth
in agriculture. Twenty years ago there were only five Ethiopians working in
Ethiopia who had college degrees in agriculture. At that time there were
no facilities for agricultural research or extension, practically no organized
farm credit, few roads, very limited markets for farm products and no dis-
tribution facilities for modern inputs. In contrast, today an agricultural
college and three sub-professional agricultural institutes are in full operation.
There are some 8,000 km of all-weather roads, of which about one-third is
paved.  The first public effort to provide irrigation is about to be undertaken
through the Amibara project. The experience of the ongoing comprehensive
development projects, CADU (Chilalo Agricultural Development Unit) supported
by Sweden and WADU (WJolamo Agricultural Development Unit) financed by IDA,
has already been used to design the program of minimum agricultural inputs
supported by this project, which seeks to capitalize on farmers' aspirations
and their willingness and capacity to improve their farming methods. During



- 8 -
the first two plan periods a start was also miade on institutional development
in a-riculture.  The Awash Valley Authority (AVA) was set up, as was an animal
health school; various undertakin-s were begun in research, extension, coop-
eratives and community development.   A Grain Corporation was established, and
the Ministry of Land Reform and Administration was created.
PATRT TV - "I}E PRES'ENT
2).       A report entitled "Appraisal of A.gricultural `Minimum Package Project,
Ethiopia" (No. 84-ET) is bein- circulated separately.   A Credit and Project
Summary is provided in Annex ITl.
20.       The project was appraised in the field in July/August 1972.
Negotiations for the proposed IDA Credit were he:Ld in Washington in April
1973.  The Ethiopian Government was represented bVy H.E. Dejazmatch Kassa
.Nloldemarian, Minister of Agriculture- A.E. Ato Tesfa lushen, Minister of
State, M'inistry of Agrictulture; and H.E. Ato Assefa Demissie, General Mlanager,
A,;ricuiltural and Industrial IDevelonment Bank.
:?7.      The oh4ective of the DprOject is to increase the productivity and
the incomes of small farmers in Ethiopia, and through thlis means to increase
agricultural production.   The proposed IDA credi-t would assist in financing
the inputs, technical services, and other costs essential to implement the
project duringc the three years from m.id--1973 tl-roug_h mid-1976.
2X.       Essentially, the Agricultural Minimum Package Project is rart of a
prozram started in 1971 to systematically provi-de to Fthioeian farmers ex-
tension services tied to modern, labor-intensive inputs, such as fertilizer
and improved seeds.   Tea-ms of extension workers backed vith supplies of
fertilizer, seeds and credit provide assistance to a networlk of ''model
farmers7  each of whom, in turn, assists the extension teams in providing
assistance to neighboring farmers.   Making use of the model farmers, the
(Government hopes that 65 percent of the farm families in an extension zone
will be narticipati.ng in the program within ten years of starting in each
arean.  By 1980, some 400,000 farm families are expected to be taking part.
Tnitially, ass.istance will be limited to fertilizer and seeds for grains
pn,  uls es, for which there is an adeqnate research base, and to marketing
-issistance, hut as the extension services and the model farmer chain become
cstablish ed in an area, assistance on storage, erosion control, livestock
(leve3lopmen t, and homr. economics wi].l. be providedl.
29.       To implement the project, the executing agency, the Extension and
Project ':h;iplementation Division (EPID) of the Ministry of Agriculture, is
selecting y'inimum Package areas predominantly in the highlands. A typical
MP i-ea wouldl include about 75,000 hectares covering five krn on both sides



-9-
of a 75 km stretch of an all-weather road.    Typically, each area contains
approximately 10,000 farm families. This area is divided into five sub-areas,
each with a market center and a one hectare trial and demonstration plot.
The development of the MP areas has three phases. After a preliminary sur-
vey, an observation phase is established for a two-year period, during which
a partial staff is assigned to carry out field tests of fertilizers and
seeds, to identify possible model farmers, and to conduct a sample survey
of the characteristics of the farm families in the area. If judged suitable,
the area moves to a one year demonstration phase, and fertilizer and seeds
are distributed to the better cultivators who thus become model farmers.      If,
at the end of the demonstration phase, other farmers have shown sufficient
interest, the area becomes a Minimum Package area and is staffed with one
supervisor who directs the activities of five extension agents and five
marketing agents with one of each assigned to each of the five sub-areas.
There are now 28 NP areas, 12 demonstration areas and 42 observation areas.
During the project period 30 new MP areas would be opened and the foundations
would be laid, by observation and demonstration, for another 30 to be opened
between 1977 and 1979.
30.       The project covers the period mid-1973 through mid-1976 and would
include the following components:
(i) the provision to farmers of incremental farm inputs together
with associated credit and extension services;
(ii)  the construction of (a) 550 km of farm-to-highway roads
(10 km per year in each fP area), to allow for extension
of services within MP areas and (b) the construction of
600 km of penetration roads into new areas which will be
added to the Minimum Package Program,
(iii)  the full extension and support services required, i.e.,
those needed not only to support the 30 new MP areas to be
established over the project period but also to give con-
tinued assistance to the 1AP areas already in operation and
to identify and prepare areas for future IT development;
(iv)  the construction of a headquarters building for EPID and
the construction of market centers, offices and storage
facilities in the M-P areas;
(v)  credit to enable market centers and cooperatives to make
advances to farmers against grain delivery pending final
sale; and
(vi)  the provision of consultant and tectnical services for
project preparation and planning for future agricultural
projects.

Credit Terms
31.        Loans will be made in kind for seeds, fertilizers, pesticides,
tools and implerments. The loans will be secured by the personal guarantees
of two persons of good repute in the region, one of whom will normally be
t>e landlord if the borrower is a tenant.    Credit for inputs will be extended
at a monthly interest rate of one percent for 9 months. Credit in the first
year is restricted to Eth$200, but may be increased to Eth$400 in subsequent
years for farmers with good repayment records. The down-payment required
will be 25 percent. Credit for inputs will be extended only to farmers with
tloldings of less than 20 ha; it is expected that most of the credit will be
extended to farmers who cultivate much less.
Marketing and Pricing
32.        Incremental production from the project is unlikely to exeed 25
percent of incremental market requirements, and should not have significant
effect on prices to the farmer. The marketing infrastructure however, is
fragmented and inefficient with the result that prices to the farmer are
lower than they would be under a more efficient system. Further, farmers
are extremely vulnerable to a variety of market pressures and events, and
the progress of the Mlinimum Package Program must, if its benefits are to be
fully realized, be matched by the early development of the infrastructure and
organizations needed for an efficient national, grain market. Cooperative
development is included in the program and will, over the medium to long run,
improve the farmers' posicion in the market. At the request of the Government,
the Bank is assisting in the preparation of a grain marketing and storage
project to improve the marketing system. Preparation of this project is
expected to be completed in the first half of FY74. In the interim, this
project includes a component under which marketing centers and cooperatives
in selected MP areas will make advances to farmers against grain deposits,
pending final sale.   This program is essentially experimental and in addition
to providing credit for advances to farmers, comprises technical assistance
plus clean-ing, grading, and weighing equipment.
Land Tenure
33.       A problem of major concern is that more than half of Ethiopia's
farmers ale tenants and many others share land under communal tenure arrange-
ments.   The lack of tenure to a specific plot for communal owners tends to
lessen their incentive to invest in improvements. With regard to tenants,
rer,ts are usually paid in kind and are high, amounting to one-third to one-
half of the crop. Further, tenants are seldom compensated for permanent im-
provements such as erosion control or improved storage, and security of tenure
is inadequate. Landlords can, and apparently do, evict without justification
and at short notice. These conditions lessen tenant incentives for innovation
and. inve-'-;ent.  While the Government recognizes the need for tenure change,
land refon-i measures have proved difficult to get through Parliament. Parlia-
ment has twice rejected tenancy legislation but is now considering a third bill,
the nassage of which is uncertain.



- 11 -
34.       While the land tenure situation lessens the incentives for tenant
farmers to participate in the project, substantial incentives remain, and the
MPP is a program which will increase the incomes of tenant farmers and small-
holders. There is significant participation by tenant farmers in the MP areas
already started, and judging from experience in CADU, such participation is
likely to increase as the program progresses.
35.       In order to assure maximum participation of tenants under the
project, the Government would provide us with information on land tenure
arrangements and an assessment on the prospects for tenant participation
before a decision is taken to add a new MP area to the project.

36.       To allow the addition of new areas, to facilitate expansion for
extension services in existing areas, and to reduce transport costs, the
project would include the construction of 550 km of farm-to-highway roads
and 600 km of penetration roads. The farm-to-highway roads would be built
to simple standards and would essentially provide dry-season transportation;
the penetration roads would be gravelled to provide all-weather transporta-
tion. These roads will be built by construction units to be organized and
equipped under the project. At this stage, the roads to be built have yet
to be specifically identified, and a national organization for the planning,
construction and maintenance of such roads has yet to be established. Mean-
while, these construction units would be placed under the direction of the
Imperial Highway Authority (IHA). These units would eventually be absorbed
into whatever rural road organization or program is established by the Govern-
ment.
Benefits and Rate of Return
37.       The main benefits of the program would result from improved yields
on nearly 600,000 small farms by the mid-1980's and from reduced storage
losses on about 150,000 such farms. By adopting all the available inputs
and at present grain prices, an owner-farmer cultivating one hectare could
raise his net cash income from a subsistence level by some Eth$80 within two
or three years. An owner-farmer cultivating three hectares could double his
present cash income of Eth$150. This does not include improvements in the
diet of farm families, a benefit which should be substantial. In the case
of tenant farmers, up to one-half of the benefits would go to landlords if
they share the cost of inputs.   The economic return of the program is con-
servatively estimated at 15 percent.
P-rnOynm MKnaeement
38.       The Minimum Package Program is administered by EPID of the
Ministry of Agriculture with the assistance of technicians provided by the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). EPID presently employs
250 supervisors and extension agents in MP areas. Each MP areas has an



- 12 -
area supervisor, and each of the MP area's five sub-areas has one extension
agent and one marketing assistant.    Model farmers will assist the extension
agent in organizing for extension activities and help the smallholders to
prepare loan applications.
39.        The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) through its
subsidiary, Agricultural and Industrial Marketing Service (AIMS) would pur-
chase and deliver agricultural inputs and act as a channel for credit to the
'armers.  EPID extension agents will be responsible for approving credit,
keeping the accounts, and collecting repayments.
40.        Tn addition, EPID will receiv,e supporting services from other
,overnment agencies such as the Institute of Agricultural Research, the
Cooperative D)evelopment Department of the Ministry of Community Development,
the Livestock and '.'Teat Board, and the Dairy Development Agency. Their
activitios will be coordinatedi by an existing interministerial committee.
rPID as supported by technical assistance under the project and by other
government agencies would iiave the capacity to administer the project satis-
factorily.
41.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$28.9 million with
a foreign exchangc comiponent of about US$12.3 million or 43 percent.     The
financing of the project would be shared as follows:
Amount
Source        (US$ millions)            %
Government         5.70*                19.9
SIDA               2.17                  7.5
IDA               21.00                 72.6
28.87                100.0
* 'nis includes approximately US$600 ,000 to be
financed by participating farmers.
The IDA credit of USS21 mlillion would be on standard terms to the Government
and would finance about 73 percent of total project costs.
42.        Credit proceeds to be utilized for agricultural inputs would be
relent by the Government to the AIDB for a period of 15 years, including a
grnce neriod of six years, at an interest rate of 7 - 1/4 percent per annumi.
These proceeds and the Government contributions to this activity would be
utilized by the AIDB to purchase farm inputs which would be delivered to
the 'fl) areas, and ultinatelv distributed to the farmers by the extension
agents, who will ilso act as agents for the AIDB for approving and collecting
credits. The proceeds of tho credit plus Government funds destined for road
construction wolildl he passed as a grant to the IIIA, and would be utilized
to finance construction equipment, materials, and personnel costs of five
construction units which will construct penetration and feeder roads.      The



- 13 -
remainder of the credit proceeds together with the Government contribution
will be passed as a grant to EPID and will be used to cover technical as-
sistance, material, equipment, and personnel costs of the extension and re-
lated support programs.
43.       While the percentage of external financing is large, it is con-
sidered justified. The project is designed for an impact on a large number
of small farmers. To reach a large number of farmers, the project must be
a large one, and thus, in absolute terms, requires a level of investment
which in the context of budget availabilities is beyond the Government's
capacity to finance without a high proportion of external assistance. More-
over, Ethiopia is one of the twenty-five least developed countries, and
domestic resources fall far short of the investment requirements to support
a reasonable rate of growth (see paragraphs 8 and 16 above). Thus, the Bank
Group and interested bilateral donors will have to finance a high proportion
of total costs if investment goals are to be met, and if high priority pro-
jects are to be carried out.
44.       The contribution of SIDA (US$2.17 million equivalent) represents
about 7.5 percent of total project costs, and assumes that SIDA's technical
assistance to EPID would continue throughout the project period. The present
agreement between the Government and SIDA expires in July 1975, approximately
one year prior to project completion. SIDA is unable to state now whether
its assistance will be continued beyond 1975. If is is not, it will be
necessary to obtain assistance elsewhere or to adjust the program to release
funds to cover the unfinanced technical assistance. The farmers' contribution
to project cost, about US$0.6 million,represents the down-payment from farmers
purchasing agricultural inputs on credit, and assumes that some participating
farmers would pay cash.
Procurement
45.       Procurement of imported fertilizers, equipment, and motor vehicles
would be by international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines; orders of less than US$30,000 would follow Government procure-
ment procedures which are satisfactory. Construction of EPID headquarters
would be by competitive bidding on the basis of local advertisement, other
small buildings, offices and stores would be constructed by local contract
or force account because they are remote and scattered. Roads would be con-
structed by special units set up in IHA for this purpose until establishment
of an organization in Government with responsibility for rural roads. Pro-
curement of all other items required by the project would follow EPID pro-
curement procedures.
Disbursement
46.       The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of
local expenditures for imported farm inputs, road
construction equipment, and vehicles and equipment
for the extension program;



- 14 
(b) 75 percent of total expenditures for locally
procured farm inputs, road construction and
building construction materials and services;
equipment and vehicles, and program support costs;
and
(c)  100 percent of foreign expenditures or 75 percent of
total expenditures for Consultants on project preparation
and planning.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The drafts of a Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ehticpia and the Association and of a Project Agreement between the Associ-
atiorn and Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB), the Report
of the Committee provided for under Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for agricul-
ture projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.        PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - ETHIOPIA /
Ln No. 523   Fourth Highway Project; US$1365 million Loan and US$7.7
Cr No. 111   million Credit of January 15, 1968; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
Project comprises: (a) primary road construction - 303 km
of road between Awash and Tendaho, 118 km between Bedelle and Metu; (b)
bituminous surfacing of primary roads - 125 km between Nazareth and Awash,
45 km between Jimma and Agaro; (c) consulting services for construction,
supervision and preparation of feasibility studies and review of design
for 500 km of high priority roads; (d) advisory services and training.
The project was late in starting because initial bids were high requiring
changes in specifications and new bid invitations. Subsequent progress
has, however, been good. Of the three civil works contracts, two have
been completed - one a year ahead of schedule and the other about fifteen
months ahead of schedule:  the third contract is expected to be completed
at the end of 1973, about three months behind schedule.
Ln No. 596   Power II, Finchaa Hydroelectric Project; US$23.1 million
Loan of May 9, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project is to assist in financing the construction of
an earth-filled dam on the Finchaa River, a tributary of the Blue Nile,
the purchase of three 33 MW generators, the construction of an associated
220 KV transmission line and terminal substations, and a feasibility study
for the next major generation development project. The project is nearing
completion and the power station commenced commercial operations with two
of the three sets commissioned in early January 1973; about six months
behind schedule.  The third unit was damaged in transit and commissioning
may be delayed by up to six months pending completion of repairs. Some
minor works are still outstanding but all of these should be completed
and the loan fully disbursed by the closing date; December 31, 1973. The
cost of the project has escalated by about 20% over the original estimate,
mainly in local costs which will be met by the Borrower.
Ln No. 605   Telecommunications IV Project; US$4.5 million Loan of
June 3, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
A loan with Joint financing from SIDA of $4.5 million equiva-
lent to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of IBTE's 1968-73 Invest-
ment Program for modernization and expansion of telecommunications services
in Ethiopia. The plan provides for an increase of about 31,000 subscribers
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

lines, and for an adequate and reliable long distance network with
subscriber trunk dialing facilities between the five principal cities.
Overall progress has been reasonably on target. However, installation
of five microwave routes has been delayed about one year.   This is due
to the long delay in obtaining suitable consultants to work on the
survey of three routes and the need to review the capacity, feasibility
and other requirements of the other two routes to conform to the Pan-
African Regional Telecommunications Recommendations, the study of which
was not available until late 1972.
Cr No. 196   Wolamo Agriculture Develo2ment Project;   US$3.5 million
Credit of November 16, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
A credit to assist in financing, (i) an integrated agricul-
t.ural program comprising rural roads, markets, water supplies and agricul-
tural credit for 6,000 farm families in the southern highlands (the Wolamo
subprovince), and (ii) resettlement of 1,750 farm families in the Savanna
zone of the subprovince. Overall progress is good and the project is in
advance of the schedule projected in the appraisal report.
Cr No. 188   H-unera Agriculture Project; US$3.1 million Credit of
jz 28, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project to assist the first phase development of Humera
area consisting of 320,300 ha. Project would consist of infrastructure
development, constrnction of bridges and fords and all-weather surfacing
or road (120 km) into project area plus construction of water supply for
the to;~nship of Humera, and development of a demonstration and applied
research farm, and study in preparation of the overall development plan of
the region. The project is progressing well but behind appraisal schedule
by about one year, due mainly to delays in procurement of heavy road
construction equipment and delays in installation of the Humera water
system which had to be taken up for force account construction due to non-
availability of contractors.   Construction of infrastructural facilities
in the project farm is satisfactory. Progress on consultant's study on
the second phase project is generally satisfactory.
Cr No. 243   Education !I PrDject    US$9.5 million Credit of May 6, 1971;
Closing Date:_June 30, 1976.
The credit is to assist in (i) the construction, expansion,

- irs-titutes, 12 new and extension to 42 secondary schools, extension to
ts;o agricultural institutes, three new agricultural training institutes,
three newi rural education institutes; and (ii) technical assistance for an
Educatitn Sector Survey, manpower studies and strengthening of teacher
training. Project implementation is six to twelve months behind appraisal
schedul:- in certain project items. However, implementation is accelerating
and tne project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1975, as originally
scheduled. Tne Education Sector Survey has already been completed.

Credit of August 30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
A credit to assist (i) on-farm development including import-
ation and breeding of cattle, (ii) technical services to farmers, (iii)
investment in additional facilities for collection, processing and mar-
keting of milk, and (iv) hiring of consultants for carrying out feasi-
bility studies. Credit was slow in becoming effective due to recruitment
problems, but has now made a good start under competent Ethiopian and ex-
patriate staff.
Cr No. 290   Coffee Processing Project;  US$6.3 million C-redit of
March 20, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
A credit for the construction of about 100 coffee washing
stations, improvement of 100 existing stations and investment in the
oonstruction of 400 km of access roads, and provision of funds for techni-
cal assistance, project preparation, and research. The project areas are
in the Sidamo and Kaffa provinces. There were delays in obtaining
Parliamentary approval (now obtained) and recruiting key staff, and the
credit could be declared effective only on December 15, 1972.
Ln No. 818   Addis Ababa Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$10.8
million Loan of May 1, 1972; Closing Date: September 30,1977.
A loan to assist (i) water supply - 100 km of primary and
360 km of secondary distribution lines plus three reservoirs and seven
pumping stations, (ii) sewerage - 150 km of major and minor sewers, and a
sewage treatment plant, (iii) technical assistance and training. Necessary
land for water supply part of the project has been acquired and work on the
preparation of detailed designs and contract documents are proceeding
reasonably well.  However, due to delay in deciding on the site of the
sewage treatment works (now finalized), there has been serious delay in pre-
paratory work for the sewerage system. The loan became effective on
September 18, 1972.
Cr No. 304   Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank Project;   US$11.0
million Credit of May 10, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The credit to support a $13.6 million credit and investment
program of AIDB for agriculture and industry plus a technical assistance
component for an agricultural credit study. The credit became effective on
October 25, 1972. Five industrial projects for a total of $1.6 million have
been authorized so far. Authorizations for agricultural projects are pro-
ceeding more slowly with less than $1.0 million committed to date.
Cr No. 332   Fifth Highway Project;  US$17.0 million Credit of September 29,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
A credit to assist in financing (i) the construction and super-

contractors, (iv) technical assistance for a study on the development
of a rural roads program and. for implementing study findings. USAID
is providing parallel financing for construction, supervision and
purchase of maintenance equipment. Pending Senate ratification of the
Credit Agreement (Lower House of Parliament has already ratified), at
the request of the Government, effectiveness deadline of the Credit has
been extended to May 30, 1973. Prequalification of contractors will be
carried out in the near futtLre and tendering for civil works is expected
to commence in July 1973. Selection of consultants for supervisory
services is under way. Road. construction is expected to start in mid-
November 1973, about seven months behind appraisal report schedule. This
is due to delay in credit effectiveness and consequent delay in selection
of consultants, as well as requirement of additional site investigations
to eliminate the use of expensive crushed stone material, which could
only be carried out during October to December 1972, after the rainy
season.
Cr No. 365   Second Livestock Project;  uS$5.0 million Credit of
April 2, 1973;  Closing Date: July 15, 1977.
The project comprises construction of stockroutes, markets
and slaughter facilities with associated hide sheds and for purchase of
cattle transporters and technical assistance. The Livestock and Meat
Board will be the implementing agency. The credit is not yet effective.

equipment (US$2.7 million) and extension equipment and
motor vehicles (US$0.9 million) would be procured by
international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank/IDA Guidelines. Orders for fertilizer, equipment
and vehicles would be grouped whenever possible to allow
for international competition. Orders of less than
t1S$30,000 would follow Government procurement procedures
which are satisfactory. Construction of EPID's head-
quarters building (US$0.2 million) would be by
competitive bidding on the basis of local advertisement;
construction of other buildings and of roads, which in
view of their small size, remoteness and scattered
nature would not attract foreign contractors, would be
by local contract or force account. Farm implements
(US$100,000) would be locally advertised and procured
over a period of three years in accordance with Govern-
ment procedures, which are satisfactory. Improved seeds
not obtainable locally (US$90,000) would, in view of the
special nature of seed required, be imported directly
from Kenya. Draft tender documents for all contracts
exceeding US$30,000 would be submitted to IDA for
approval before invitations are issued, and bid analysis
and recommendations for award would be sent to IDA for
comment before award.
