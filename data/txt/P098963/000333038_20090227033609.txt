F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The First and Second Rural and Social Policy Credit/Grant series (RSRC-1 and RSRC-2)
were designed as part of a series of Development Policy Lending operations (DPL) to
support the Government of Niger in improving service delivery to the poor and in
implementing reforms in public sector management to secure adequate financing in
critical sectors of the economy. Within a medium-term framework, these two budget
support operations (RSRC-1 and RSRC-2) as well as ongoing investment projects in
agriculture, education, health, and population, focused on overcoming policy constraints
and institutional bottlenecks in: (i) public sector management; (ii) agricultural growth and
rural development; and (iii) human development, including demographic growth and
gender issues. Both DPL operations supported a strategic subset of the Government
PRSP policy and reform agenda.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


1.      Niger is a vast landlocked country with an estimated population of 12.1 million in
2004 (14.7 million in mid-2008), the majority of whom live along a narrow band of
arable land on the country's southern border. The economy is dominated by agriculture,
including rearing livestock, mining (uranium and gold), and informal trading activities.
The primary sector accounted for about 40 percent of GDP in 2004. Rain-fed agriculture
using low-productivity and traditional techniques is dominant. Livestock production
accounts for about one third of the value added in the sector. Irrigation would increase
yields and reduce uncertainty, but is still little developed Agriculture production
increased at an average rate of two percent over the past four decades, well below
population growth (3.1 percent in 2008).

2.      Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has consistently ranked the country as the lowest in the
world in the Human Development Index. Over past decades, economic development has
been constrained by poor endowment in natural resources, harsh climatic conditions, a
degrading natural environment, high population growth, high vulnerability to external
shocks, and low institutional capacity. In the nineties Niger suffered from political
instability and a deterioration in the living conditions of its population. In 1999 a military
junta took power in a coup. Eight months later, it handed power over to a civilian
government, following orderly presidential and legislative elections. The new
government successfully implemented a reform program supported by the IMF and three
Bank-financed policy based operations. Local and general elections took place in 2004.

3.      For the first time ever, Niger had been able to complete an IMF's Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program without interruption. Economic
performance was strong during the period 2002-05, with an average annual growth rate of
4.4 percent, which was achieved despite a severe drought and locust attacks in 2004. As a
result of prudent monetary and fiscal policies, and good agricultural production, inflation
averaged 1.6 percent during the period 2000-2004. However, it rose sharply to 7.8
percent in 2005 as a consequence of the 2004 drought. Good progress was achieved in
improving social indicators, but they remained at a very low level, and Niger is not
expected to reach most of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015.

4.      At 15 percent in 2002, Niger's literacy rate was one of the lowest in the world.
After years of stagnation, education coverage improved significantly. Primary gross
enrollment increased from 41.7 percent in 2001/02 to 52 percent in 2004/05 and
completion rate increased from 25.6 percent to 36.4 percent during the same period. This
progress was due in part to the decentralized hiring of contractual teachers at a cost of
about one half of regular teachers' pay. Quality of education remains low, however, and
disparities between gender and geographical areas are important. Progress has been



                                               1

limited in the health sector and outcomes remain extremely modest. Major issues in the
sector are the limited supply of basic health services - due to inadequate financing and the
concentration of a small pool of human resources in urban centers - and the high cost of
services to patients.

5.      As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
Niger agreed to meet 10 convergence criteria, including five primary and five secondary.
In 2000 it met two criteria only. In 2004 it met five criteria. With support from the three
budget support operations, fiscal performance improved. The share of government
revenue to GDP increased from a low 8.2 percent in 2000 to 10.4 percent in 2005. It is
still far below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 17 percent, however. Current
expenditure declined from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2005.
The share of the wage bill in fiscal revenue declined from over 50 percent in 1999 to
slightly above the convergence criterion of 35 percent in 2004. Despite this achievement,
the basic fiscal balance at 2.1 percent of GDP in 2004 remained above the zero percent
criterion.

6.      Poverty is widespread. The share of the population living in poverty was
estimated at 64 percent in 2004, about the same level as in the early 1990s. Poverty and
extreme poverty are severe in rural areas, where about 85 percent of the population lives.
Following broad-based consultations with stakeholders, the Government of Niger
approved its 2002-2005 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2002. The PRSP
emphasized strong and sustainable economic growth, the development of productive
sectors, especially in rural areas, the improvement of access of the poor to quality social
services, and the strengthening of institutional and individual capacity for good
governance. The Permanent Secretariat responsible for overseeing PRSP implementation
issued two progress reports in 2003 and 2005. Assessment of progress towards PRSP
targets was hampered by lack of information, however. Little analytical work on poverty
had been carried out. No comprehensive household budget survey was available to
evaluate the PRSP's impact.

7.      Niger reached the Highly Indebted and Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point in
December 2000 and the completion point in April 2004. The proceeds of debt relief were
used to finance an ambitious investment program, known as the Special Program of the
President, mainly consisting of classrooms, health facilities and small dams in rural areas.
Despite debt relief, Niger remained at high risk of debt distress.

8.      The rapid demographic growth of Niger (triggered by declining mortality rates
combined with persistently high levels of fertility) compounds the challenge of the
poverty reduction efforts. Bringing fertility rates to lower levels will be critical to ensure
the formation of human capital (education and health). A lower rate of demographic
growth would also alleviate pressure on fragile ecosystems. Finally, wider access to
family planning services, for which there is a strong but unmet demand, would also
greatly improve health outcomes of women and children.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators


9.      The First and Second Rural and Social Policy Reform Operations (RSRCs) were
designed to help Niger improve service delivery to the poor, while continuing reforms in
public sector management to secure adequate financing in critical sectors of the economy.
Building on the previous three budget support operations, as well as ongoing investment
projects in agriculture, education, and health, the two RSRCs focused on overcoming
policy constraints and institutional bottlenecks in: (i) public sector management; (ii)
growth and agricultural development; and (iii) human development, including
demographic growth and gender issues.

10.     In the first policy area, public sector management, the two operations aimed at (i)
ensuring that budget allocations were better aligned to PRSP priorities; (ii) strengthening
involvement of the line ministries in budget preparation and implementation; and (iii)
modernizing the Treasury, strengthening budget controls and improving the structure and
functioning of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). In addition, the two
operations aimed at enhancing the national statistical information system through
adoption of a statistical development plan and preparation of national surveys on a
regular basis. The second operation aimed at improving the transparency and efficiency
of the public procurement process through the establishment of an appropriate
institutional framework.


11.     In the second policy area, agriculture and rural development, the two operations
sought to enhance the sector's potential as the engine of pro-poor growth by (i) focussing
on effective implementation of the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) adopted in 2003;
(ii) improving service delivery in rural areas; (iii) providing enhanced access to factors of
production, including land tenure security; (iv) reducing the vulnerability of household to
food insecurity and enhancing the country's capacity to prevent and manage food crises;
(iv) promoting local governance of local resources (land and water); and (vi) improving
the predictability of public resources to the sector through adoption of a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the four rural ministries (including Ministry for
Agricultural Development; Ministry for Livestock; Ministry of Water, Environment and
Fight against Desertification; and Ministry for Community Development).

12.     In the third policy area, human development, the two operations aimed at
improving service delivery in social sectors by: (i) enhancing human resource
management; (ii) improving budget preparation and execution; (iii) enhancing
accountability and governance at the school level; (iv) providing publicly financed basic
health services to the poor and vulnerable groups; and (v) addressing demographic and
gender dimensions.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification


13.     As indicated above, the PDO was not revised. The second operation (RSRC-2)
was built on the first one (RSRC-1) and the main goals remained unchanged. The key
outcome indicators mentioned in the two program documents are in Table 6 below. The
table also includes intermediate outcome indicators, as some of them are more
appropriate to gauge progress in achieving development objectives than those in the first
category. The baseline date was December 31, 2005 for all indicators, except for an
additional one defined in the second operation concerning public procurement, for which
the baseline date was January 1, 2007. All results were set for December 31, 2008, but
actual results reflect the situation at end 2007, when the series was discontinued.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

Policy Area 1: Public sector management

14.     In close collaboration with the Government and the European Union, the Bank
prepared a comprehensive assessment of Niger's public expenditure management
systems and capacities (Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review - PEMFAR) in 2004. The two operations supported implementation of the action
plan agreed in the PEMFAR.

15.     The two operations emphasized increased involvement of line ministries in budget
preparation and better tracking of poverty-related expenditures. They supported
enhancing budget execution through (i) improvement in the cash management system to
allow effective involvement of priority ministries in the quarterly regulation process, (ii)
protecting critical spending items; (iii) limiting use of exceptional procedures; (iv)
controlling fiscal deficits in line with macroeconomic targets and (v) modernizing the
Treasury. They supported an action plan to improve internal and external controls,
including: (i) preparation and adoption of an operational manual and guidelines on audit
techniques to reduce the risk of rejection of spending proposals at the payment order
stage (Budget Directorate) or at the payment stage (Treasury), and improve the quality of
external controls; and (ii) capacity building for the financial controllers and staff of the
Chamber of Accounts. The two operations aimed at improving the performance and
operational efficiency of MEF, including taking steps to modernize its organization by
2008.

16.     The strengthening of the Statistical Office (INS), to ensure that a comprehensive
information base would be in place for monitoring poverty and assessing progress in
PRSP implementation, included: (i) adoption of a 2007-2011 development plan; (ii)
introduction of a new personnel status; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) the launching of a
household survey in 2006.

17.     To improve the transparency and efficiency of the public procurement process,
the second operation sought to reinforce the institutions in charge of it, including the


                                               4

Procurement Directorate and the Procurement Regulation Agency. Procurement units
were to be set up in line ministries.

Policy Area 2: Agriculture and Rural Development

18.     Implementation of the RDS was seen as key to poverty reduction and agricultural
growth. The RDS was approved before the 2004/05 food crisis, however, and needed to
be updated to take account of the lessons from that experience. One of them was the
critical importance of rapidly improving the efficiency of irrigation, particularly as
concerns the President's program funded from HIPC resources. Expanding the acreage
under irrigation and improving the productivity of irrigated land was an essential element
of the RDS. Enhancing land tenure security and preventing conflicts was also considered
a priority. This was to be achieved through the decentralization of the land administration
and preparation of land management schemes. The program sought also to improve the
national capacity to prevent and mitigate food crises through strengthening the Food
Crisis Unit.

Policy Area 3: Human Development

Basic education

19.     Within the framework of the ten-year development plan for the education sector
(2003-2013), the two operations supported improved efficiency of spending and
effectiveness of service delivery, including eliminating structural delays in the processing
and payment of contractual teacher (CT) salaries, and enhancing governance and
accountability through information sharing and community empowerment, via school
management committees (COGES). These reforms were designed in close coordination
with the ongoing Bank-financed Basic Education project approved in 2003.

Health

20.     In line with the ten-year health policy strategy (2002-2011), the two operations
supported policy reforms to (i) strengthen human resource management, including
enhancing the incentives for serving in remote areas; (ii) improve budget execution,
including timely purchase of medical supplies; and (iii) reform the cost recovery scheme
to improve health care accessibility. The Health Sector Investment and Maintenance
Project, approved in 2006, was fully aligned with the two budget support operations.

Population growth

21.     A population project was being prepared for Bank financing to address the high
population growth issue. The two policy-based operations would address the demand side
of the issue, and support regulatory and legal reforms, particularly as concerns the
promotion and protection of women's rights. In February 2007, the Government issued a
Declaration of National Population Policy. In that context, the second operation would
support (i) the preparation and adoption of an action plan to improve women status and re



                                             5

launch family planning; and (ii) the organization of a national forum to build consensus
on demographic growth, and gender issues. The Multi-Sector Demographic Project was
approved in June 2007.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (not revised)

22.     Policy areas supported under RSRC-1 and RSRC-2 remained relevant throughout
the duration of the program and were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes (no changes)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance


23.     Both operations were to be disbursed in two equal tranches of US$25 million each
(for a total of US$50 million each). The first operation included six prior actions for
Board presentation and nine prior actions for second tranche release. Six prior actions
were also required for Board presentation of the second operation and 11 for the release
of its second tranche. These prior actions are detailed in Tables 2 and 3 below.

24.     The two operations were designed to provide annual budget support, the first one
for the 2006 budget and the second for the following year. The first operation was
approved in June 2006 and the credit became effective in July 2006. The release of the
second tranche was approved in February 2007, later than initially envisaged. A partial
waiver was granted, as the number of qualified staff that Government was able to recruit
in the health sector was much lower than initially envisaged (454 instead of 715 ­ see
condition 8 in Table 2 below).

25.     The second operation was approved in June 2007 and the grant became effective
in August 2007. The release of the second tranche was approved on May 30, 2008. All 11
conditions were fully met. The Ministry of Economy and Finance was late in
implementing the reforms, however, which delayed overall implementation of the
program. Supervision missions consistently rated overall implementation progress as
moderately satisfactory and development objective as satisfactory.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

26.       Adequacy of government's commitment. Overall, the Government was committed
to reform and had a good track record. The first project document acknowledged,
however, that the Ministry of Economic and Finance (MEF) had been slow in introducing
reforms in budget preparation, execution and controls. The reforms agreed upon in that
area under the first and second operations were implemented, but with delay. MEF has
been consistently reluctant to decentralize budget preparation and implementation to line
ministries, and little progress was achieved there. The performance of the steering
committee in charge of monitoring the policy reforms was not up to expectations, which
delayed program implementation.

27.       Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis was overall adequate.
The proposed reforms in public finance management were in keeping with the action plan
agreed to, following preparation of the PEMFAR in 2004. The need to strengthen the


                                                                  8

Statistics Office to better monitor the results of PRSP implementation was important.
Focusing on the rural sector as the country's engine of pro-poor growth was fully
appropriate. The Rural Development Strategy (RDS) adopted in 2003, following a
participatory and iterative approach, was a key instrument for creating a policy and
institutional environment conducive to sustainable growth, including ensuring food
security. The strategy was amended to incorporate the lessons from the severe drought of
2004/05. The focus on increasing allocations and improving the budget execution rate in
the rural sector was not well supported, however, in the absence of an up-to-date Public
Expenditure Review in the sector. Issues in the irrigation sector were not discussed. In the
social sectors, key issues were adequately analyzed and synergies were sought between
ongoing investment projects and the two budget support operations.

28.     The two budget supports were undertaken in the context of lessons learned form
previous operations. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reviewed the completion
reports for the three public expenditure adjustment credits approved in 2001, 2003 and
2005. The first and third operations were rated as moderately satisfactory and the second
one as satisfactory. Lessons from experience were that (i) the reform agenda should not
be overloaded in countries with particularly weak institutional capacity; (ii) clear and
simple Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) mechanisms should be designed and agreed
upon; (iii) the reforms should be adequately sequenced; (iv) donors should closely work
together; (v) the Government should be strongly committed to the reforms, including
protection of key expenditure categories; and (vi) public communication should be a
integral component of the program.

29.     The lessons learned mentioned in the first program document had to do with
government ownership, weak institutional capacity, the medium-term nature of a reform
process involving public expenditure management and social service delivery, the risks of
failure when operations include more than two tranches and the need to align budget
support to the budget cycle. In the second program document, the same lessons were
mentioned. Raising awareness of ministries on the need to link the budget to the long-
term vision was also emphasized. Close coordination with ongoing investment projects
was seen as a means to address weak institutional capacity.

30.     The first operation went through a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) process.
The reviewers emphasized the need to put the operation into a longer term framework
and to be realistic in designing the triggers in view of a particularly fragile country
context. They suggested that single tranche operations should be considered.

31.     The 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supported Niger's four strategic
pillars articulated in its 2002 PRSP. A CAS completion report, which was under
preparation when the first operation was being formulated, estimated that Bank support
has helped Niger implement its broad objectives by selectively providing assistance to
reforms and expenditure programs in key sectors. Based on lessons learned from CAS
implementation, the new strategy would address Niger's constraints and human
vulnerabilities. It would allocate 40 percent of IDA's lending resources to budget support.
It would set the stage for consolidated programmatic assistance once fiduciary systems



                                              9

were strengthened. The proposed series of RSRCs would help the Government
implement its reform agenda within a medium-term framework through annual budget
support over the following two to three years. The new CAS was not available when the
second operation was presented to the Board.

32.     Assessment of the operation's design. Both operations were intended to be closely
aligned with the annual budget cycle. They were both approved in mid-year, with the
expectation that the second tranche would be disbursed within the same year. This
expectation was unrealistic, however, and it did not materialize, because the two
operations were overly complex, in particular in view of limited government capacity.
This defeated the notion of providing support to the annual budget. Overall, the prior
actions in both operations were appropriately defined for achieving their objectives,
though they should have been better prioritized. Of the twelve triggers set out in the first
operation for moving ahead with the second one, four became prior actions for RSRC-2
Board presentation. Others became policy actions to be taken during program
implementation.

33.     Effective implementation of the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) was
considered as essential for achieving the objectives in that sector, yet establishment of the
entities responsible for its implementation and supervision was not considered in the
initial policy matrix. It became a prior action for RSRC 2. Preparation of a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the four ministries in charge of rural development
was a prior action for the second tranche release of RSRC 1. The MTEF was prepared,
but, without the benefit of an overall MTEF, and no real commitment by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) to use it for resource allocation, its credibility as an
instrument to guide budget decisions has suffered.

34.     Both operations involved a number of institutions and sought to help the
ministries in charge of rural and human development extend their reach through increased
resource allocations for their key programs, including improved deployment of human
resources. Line ministries had the capacity to implement the reforms in their respective
sectors, but were dependent on the goodwill of the MEF to obtain the funds required for
their expenditure programs.

35.     In 2004, the Bank prepared a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which concluded that
several deficiencies needed to be addressed in these areas. An IDF grant was extended in
2004 to help with procurement reform and institution building. It contributed to the
formulation and dissemination of a new procurement law, establishment of a new body
for reform implementation, installation of an information system, and the formulation and
delivery of a training program for trainers in procurement. Overall, implementation of
reforms related to procurement has been slow. Under the first operation, there was no
attempt to address deficiencies in procurement. The second operation sought to address
key issues in that area, including ensuring that the institutional framework for public
procurement became fully operational and reducing inefficiencies in the procurement
process for bid evaluation and contract award. Addressing deficiencies in public



                                              10

expenditure management was at the core of both operations, in keeping with the
PEMFAR action plan and CFAA recommendations.

36.     Four risks were identified in both operations: political risks, exogenous factors,
weak institutional capacity and fiduciary risks. Policy reversals and/or slippages, as well
as lack of strong commitment to bring necessary reforms (in particular in the sensitive
area of population), could derail the reform process. The risk was to be mitigated through
policy dialogue to strengthen government ownership, and flexibility in the timing of the
follow-up operation. Niger's high vulnerability to external factors, such as adverse
climatic conditions, upheavals in neighboring countries or shortfalls in donor support was
acknowledged. It was felt that measures to strengthen the budget process would protect
priority sectors against the adverse effects of potential shortfalls in revenue mobilization.
To overcome weak institutional capacity, the reform program was tailored to existing
constraints and technical assistance was provided in a coordinated way among donors
through ongoing projects and grants. The slow implementation of reforms to reinforce
financial management and procurement systems entailed substantial fiduciary risks. Both
operations sought to address these issues through a realistic agenda for reform and
capacity building. Both operations focused on increasing allocations to priority sectors in
line with PRSP priorities. The risk that these allocations would not reach the intended
beneficiaries was not discussed, however. In the PAD for the second operation, a table
mentioned that Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys were under way in the social sectors
(education and health). Nevertheless, the preliminary results of these surveys, which have
just become available, do not provide information that could help increase the efficiency
of spending in social sectors. The risk assessment and mitigation section of the program
documents could have been strengthened. Exogenous factors and weak institutional
capacities persisted during implementation of the two operations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

37.     The five indicators selected to assess progress towards development objectives
focused on inputs, or/and processes, not outcomes (see Table 6 below). Monitoring these
indicators is relatively simple, but they may not give information on whether service
delivery to the poor has been actually improved during program implementation. The
main reasons for their selection were their regular availability through existing
investment operations; and since in Niger, most rural areas are very poor, the selected
indicators (increasing the percentages of health workers in rural areas or of budget
allocated to regions and districts) were considered acceptable proxies.

38.     The distinction between the development objectives indicators and the
intermediate outcomes indicators as proposed in the program documents is unconvincing.
In the second category, the share of pro-poor spending or share of health budget allocated
to regions and districts would better inform on attainment of program objectives than
those in the first category for instance. There was no indicator to gauge progress in key
policy areas, such as reducing the use of exceptional budget procedures, improving the
efficiency of irrigation systems, or reducing delays in paying contractual teachers. On the
other hand, an indicator on modern contraception usage was selected, though no action



                                             11

was included in the two operations in that respect. The ongoing health project and the
policy adopted by the Government to provide contraceptives free of charge were
expected to bring about changes, however. Supervision reports indicated that the usage
rate increased from four percent in late 2005 to 10 percent two years later. This estimate,
based on services statistics, may be too optimistic, however, and needs to be confirmed
with hard survey data (such as a Demographic and Health Survey).

39.    The source of information for verifying indicators was clearly defined for each of
them. For some of them, the baseline value was redefined during program
implementation. Supervision missions updated the indicators table regularly, but did not
provide any information on actual or expected results on the ground from changes in the
indicators. For instance, it was expected that the number of programs implemented under
the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) would increase from zero to 23 during program
implementation. By end-2007, missions reported that four programs were being
implemented, but they did not give any indication on whether these programs were
relevant or what they were expected to achieve. Actually, the number of programs
included in the RDS (23) is much larger than those agreed upon in the action plan, which
served as a basis for RSRC 1 and 2. The PAD for RSRC1 mentioned 10 so called
structural programs and four priority sector programs (see Box 1, page 15 of the PAD).
The four priority sector programs were being implemented during RSRC 1 and 2.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

40.    Initially, the two operations were to be followed by a third one in the rural and
human development sectors. In the program document for the second operation, it was
announced that in the subsequent operation the human and rural development agenda
would be gradually phased out, while policy reforms to promote private sector
development would be emphasized. Eventually, after two operations, the three-operation
cycle was abandoned in favor of moving with a new budget support operation - a one-
tranche operation, focusing on overcoming policy constraints and institutional
bottlenecks on business environment, infrastructure development and public finance
management. Two projects are being prepared to support rural development, an agro-
pastoral export promotion project to expand Niger's ability to bring products to external
markets and a water sector project to help the country improve its irrigation infrastructure.
In the human development sector, the reform agenda will be supported through existing
investment projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

41.    A second PRSP was approved by the Government in October 2007 for the period
2008-2012. The strategy is built around seven pillars to spur growth and reduce poverty,
namely (i) promoting strong, diversified, sustainable and job-creating growth; (ii)
ensuring equitable access to quality social services; (iii) slowing down population
growth; (iv) reducing inequalities and strengthening social security for vulnerable groups;



                                            12

(v) developing infrastructure; (vi) promoting good governance; and (vii) ensuring an
effective implementation of the strategy. Three new pillars have been added in this
second PRSP, including reducing population growth, protecting vulnerable groups and
ensuring an effective PRSP implementation. A new CAS for the period 2008-2011 was
endorsed by the Board in May 2008. The CAS's objectives are to accelerate an equitably
shared growth around rural "growth clusters" and develop human capital through equal
access to quality services.

42.      Both operations were fully aligned with the first and second PRSP, and fully
consistent with the 2003 CAS as well as the 2008 CAS, which was under preparation
when these two operations (RSRC-1 and RSRC-2) were designed. Both were essential
for achieving Bank objectives. The operations were designed to improve public finance
management and ensure that budget allocations would better reflect PRSP priorities in the
rural and human development sectors. Their design was highly relevant to the
development priorities in the PRSP and the CAS at the time of their approval.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

43.      The two operations have by and large achieved their objectives, despite the fact
that originally the program was designed based on a series of three operations. In the
absence of adequate indicators, however, it is difficult to assess whether service delivery
to the poor has been improved. But, as additional human and financial resources have
been allocated to underserved rural areas, one would expect that some improvement has
been achieved on the ground.

44.      Reforms implemented by the Government of Niger have contributed to spur
growth, maintain macroeconomic stability, improve revenue mobilization and allocate
increased resources to the rural and human development sectors. As indicated in Table 4
below, annual growth averaged 5.3 percent in 2005-07, compared to 4.1 percent in 2002-
04. In 2007 poor rainfall reduced estimated growth at 3.2 percent. Inflation has declined
during the period 2005-07. Fiscal space increased substantially by about five percent of
GDP from 2003, because of higher government revenue and debt relief from the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in 2004 and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) in 2006. This made it possible to spend more on priority sectors and
still keep the basic budget deficit (which excludes foreign-financed expenditure)
moderate, at 1.1 percent of GDP on average in 2005-07. Performance under the IMF-

supported 2005-08 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was satisfactory and
a new three-year PRGF arrangement was approved by the IMF Board for an amount of
US$23 million in June 2008. Debt indicators have considerably improved. The debt to
GDP ratio, which stood at 72.5 percent in 2002-04 declined to 16.3 percent in 2007.

45.      Expenditure for human and rural development increased from CFAF billion 153.5
in 2005 to CFAF billion 179.9 in 2007. The share of these sectors in total expenditure
remained relatively stable, however. The percentage of actual expenditure to budget
allocations in the three sectors has not improved during the period 2005-07, which is
mainly due to the dependency of these sectors on highly volatile external assistance flows.
Table 5 below shows the evolution of total expenditures and expenditures in the three
sectors in 2005-07. Table 1 in Annex 6 shows actual expenditures in these sectors in
greater detail.

46.      As shown in Table 6 below, actual results for outcome indicators, as defined in
the program documents, are all less than expected, except for the education and health
sectors' share in budget allocations. As already mentioned, however, these indicators
focus on inputs and processes, not on outcomes. As such they fail to convey progress
made in improving the living conditions of Nigeriens and delivering results on the ground.
Some intermediate outcome indicators give a better sense on whether the objectives have
been achieved. This is the case of the share of pro-poor spending, which is close to target,
and the number of contractual teachers, as well as the share of health budget allocated to
regions and districts, which are both above targets. It should be noted, however, that the
actual end values are for 2007, while indicators were set for end-2008, when the three
operations were expected to be completed.

Progress made under the two operations

47.       Public Finance Management and Procurement. A new cash management plan
has been introduced in 2004-05, which has enabled the Government to avoid shortages of
cash to meet recurrent expenditures, and the accumulation of domestic arrears.
Identification of pro-poor expenditure has greatly improved through adoption of a unified
coding list. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has been restructured. A new General
Directorate is in charge of financial controls and the Treasury has been restructured and
modernized. In the public procurement area, the National Agency for the Regulation of
Public markets (ARMP) is operational, the three principal directors, the National
Regulatory Boards members have been appointed, the Dispute Resolution Committee
(CRD) has been established for handling complaints from bidders, and is now functional.
Other actions to improve the procurement process have been delayed, however.
Transactions by contracting authorities are not audited by the Procurement Agency; the

new Procurement Directorate is in place but not fully operational; and the ordinance
related to the creation of Procurement Agency (DGCMP) is still under examination by
the parliament. The regulatory texts for control of public procurement are overall
acceptable and many implementing decrees have been adopted, but few clauses are
partially or entirely inconsistent with World Bank guidelines and need to be revised.

48.     Statistics. The Statistical Office has been established as an autonomous agency,
which has enabled it to attract qualified staff. It has prepared a medium-term plan for the
development of statistics in close coordination with external partners. It has completed a
Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey in May 2006, a Participatory
Survey on Poverty, which gives qualitative data on people's perceptions of poverty, and a
full-fledged household budget survey in 2008.

49.     Rural Development. Good progress has been made under the two operations in
this sector. The action plan of the rural development strategy (RDS) has been revised to
include food security through the irrigation development program (PLIADI). Costing for
all RDS programs was completed, which provided the basis for the finalization of the
rural MTEF (covering all 4 line ministries). A bill was adopted on land tenure, security
and local governance of natural resources to gradually install regional land administration
offices (SPR-CR). Finally, following successive workshops, a Presidential decree
approved the study of the national system for food crisis management and prevention and
validated it as a National Emergency Plan for the Management of Food Crises.

50.     Education. In 2007 more than 3,000 contractual teachers have been recruited to
respond to growing schooling demand. An action plan to improve spending efficiency
and budgets for new recruits has been developed. To respond to the growing pressure on
post basic education from students completing primary education, the low levels of
achievement at the primary level, and the poor quality of primary school teachers, the
Government has adopted a coherent strategic framework (2009-2011) for the
development of post-primary education. Finally, to improve the accountability by
communities' involvement in resource management, the Ministry of Education has
prepared a plan for transferring grants to 500 randomly selected School Management
Committees (COGES) on an experimental basis in two regions. The evaluation of the
impact of this initiative is underway

51.     Health. Implementation of policy measures supported under the two operations
has been satisfactory. To improve the effectiveness of health services and management of
human resources, the Ministry of Health (MSP) has: (i) launched the preparation of the
National Health Map and health workforce census; and (ii) begun implementation of an
organization chart at the decentralized levels to better monitor human resources and
strengthen accountability at all levels. To improve access and ensure availability of
appropriate financing for basic health care services, based on the results of the study on
health services costs, the Government has included the costs of fully subsidized services
and products (contraceptives, delivery by cesarean section, pre-natal consultations, health
care for children under five) in the 2008 Budget. A plan was prepared to ensure that these
services would be adequately financed.

52.     Population. A sound Government Declaration on National Population Policy
(DGPP) was issued in February 2007. A population project was approved in FY07 to
help implement the DGPP policy. A national forum on population was organized in
January 2008 to sensitize key leaders in Niger to the urgency of implementing the new
policy.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

53.     Niger made good progress in sustaining growth and maintaining macroeconomic
stability despite a high vulnerability to harsh and highly variable climatic conditions. It
has successfully completed its three-year PRGF program supported by the IMF. It has
increased domestic revenues and allocations to priority sectors. It has improved its cash
management system to ensure that the executed budget in these sectors would better
reflect initial allocations. It has taken steps to reduce the vulnerability of its population to
food crises, improve the coverage of its education system, and increase the availability
and affordability of basic health services to the rural poor. It has eventually
acknowledged that it should forcefully address the issue of fast population growth, in
spite of strong opposition from religious groups. It has strengthened its Statistics Office
and initiated a much needed program of poverty data collection and analysis.

54.     A fully satisfactory rating is not justified, however, because the Government was
slow in moving the reform agenda. This is the case for instance in the public finance,
procurement and rural development policy areas. Most result indicators are lower than
expected as shown in Table 6 above, with the caveat noted above that the targets were set
for end 2008 while the actual values are for end 2007. In this less than fully satisfactory
picture, the bright spots are the increase of pro-poor expenditure, the education budget,
the number of contractual teachers and the share of health allocated to regions and
districts. On the basis of available information, it is impossible to give an individual
rating to each of the two operations.

55.     Niger is unlikely to reach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015,
but in recent years, progress has been made to move some of them in the right direction.
This is the case for instance of the primary completion rate, the literacy rate and the under
five mortality rate. Sustained efforts are required to consolidate progress made. In its
Human Development Reports, UNDP had consistently classified Niger at the lowest end
of the scale. In the 2007 report, however, this has changed. Niger has moved up three
positions in the human development indicators table. This is a modest change, however,
reflecting data collected in 2005.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.     The RSRCs provided incremental resources to finance PRSP priorities. The focus
on rural and human development targeted the priority sectors that are the most crucial
ones for poverty reduction in Niger. Moreover, emphasis on decentralization responded
to the need to strengthen the delivery of public services in rural regions and local
communities where most of the poor live. Finally, most vulnerable groups such as
women and children were affected by providing them with fully subsidized health
services as pre-natal consultations and health care for children under five, contraceptives
and caesarean services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

57.     Budget management systems have been strengthened. Through the preparation
and updating of Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF), the ministries in
charge of education, health and rural development have improved their capacity to
translate broad objectives into multi-year programs and annual budgets. To consolidate
this progress, however, it is important that an overall MTEF be prepared and adopted to
give line ministries a better understanding of global constraints. The dialogue between
the Ministry of Finance and line ministries has improved thanks to the coordination
mechanisms put in place for the two operations. Cash management has much improved.
On the other hand, little progress has been accomplished in procurement reform and
institutional development. The Statistics Office has made substantial progress in building
up a modern data collection and analysis apparatus.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts:
NA

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops: NA

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

58.     Several factors may derail the reform process. A low intensity insurgency in the
North over the sharing of resources generated by uranium mining might result in
increasing expenditure allocated to security. A rapid increase in revenues from uranium
(its production is expected to double by 2012) might loosen fiscal discipline and
undermine macroeconomic stability. Delays in effective implementation of the new
population policy would make the task of improving social indicators more difficult.
Over past years, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to growth, poverty
reduction and prudent fiscal policies, however. With adequate support from the
international community, Niger should continue to manage these risks and make progress



                                            18

on its development path. Another risk relates to discontinuation of series of budget
supports, which may negatively impact government pursuing the policy reforms in
human development sectors.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

59.     After a piecemeal approach to economic policy reform under the first three budget
support operations, Bank management decided to focus on three priority sectors for
poverty alleviation through a series of three policy-based operations, which would be
closely coordinated with ongoing investment projects in the relevant sectors. By doing so,
it provided a medium-term perspective to the reform efforts in the education, health and
rural sectors. The initial idea was to phase in policy reforms to improve the environment
for private sector and infrastructure development in the third operation in the series. The
new approach was sound and aligned with the CAS.

60.     Macroeconomic constraints and perspectives were well assessed. Issues in the
three sectors were adequately analyzed, with the exception of the irrigation sub-sector.
Poverty, gender and social development analysis suffered from the lack of up-to-date data,
which was to be corrected with Bank support during the implementation phase of the
operations. The Bank provided strong support to the Government in preparing the
operations. A quality enhancement review in March 2006 provided good advice to the
team. Most lessons from experience were taken into account. It was unrealistic, however,
to expect the Government to implement a long series of prior actions for second tranche
release within a few months, in view of weak institutional capacity. The risk analysis was
adequate. The weaknesses in fiduciary management were noted and addressed. Outcome
indicators were not appropriate.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

60.     Supervision missions visited Niger regularly and provided excellent support to the
Government to move the reform agenda and implement the agreed upon prior actions.
Indicators were adequately monitored. Management followed through on the
recommendations of the supervision missions. Particularly continuous dialogue, close
supervision and technical support helped the Government to implement reform measures
in key sectors (i.e., education and health).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory



                                             19

61.    Based on the quality of lending and supervision, overall Bank performance is
rated satisfactory. During preparation and implementation of RSRCs series the Bank
team worked closely with the Government over the course of the program to facilitate
reforms implementation as well as provide technical support.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory
62.     Macroeconomic management was strong during the implementation period of the
two operations. On the other hand, the Government was slow in taking the steps agreed
upon to move the public finance management reform agenda. The Government prepared
progress reports regularly. The quality of these reports has improved over time. The
performance of the line ministries is rated as satisfactory. On the other hand, the
performance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) was less than fully
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Not relevant
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

63.    MEF was responsible for coordinating the Government overall effort. Its
performance was less than fully satisfactory, mainly due to weak human resource
capacity.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

64.     Based on Government overall performance the rating for borrower performance is
moderately satisfactory. Although there were delays in implementation of policy reforms,
particularly those linked to public finance management, there was Government
commitment to reforms particularly at the line ministries level (Education, Health and
Rural Development).

6. Lessons Learned

65.     It is important to provide a medium-term perspective, particularly when
addressing policy constraints in sectors, where results are not achieved in the short-
term. In that respect, the decision to discontinue the series of three rural and social policy
reform operations and move to other sectors before gains in the initial sectors are fully
consolidated is perplexing. This decision may give the Government the wrong signal that
pursuing the reforms in the human development area is no longer needed.

66.     Positive outcomes in education, health and rural development require policy
changes and investment. They take time to materialize. Two annual budget support
operations cannot be expected to make a big difference in these sectors' outcomes. On
the other hand, they should bring about changes in processes and inputs, i.e. intermediate



                                             20

outcome indicators. There are synergies between policy-based and investment operations
in a sector. In the human development sectors the synergies were positive. In the rural
development area, there were less so, as implementation of the investment operations was
less than satisfactory.

67.     A two-tranche operation defeats the purpose of annual budget support. This is
even more the case when the operations are approved in June. The decision to move with
two tranche operations was not in keeping with the QER recommendation to continue
with single tranche operations based on completed actions and embedded in a medium-
term framework. The decision was actually the result of management's concern that the
boldness of moving ahead with a series of operations within a medium-term framework
in a country with mediocre Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings
should be mitigated by maintaining a short leash on the reform agenda. This decision was
not helpful, and it defeated the purpose of providing annual budget support in a
predictable way.

68.     Design of the budget supports needs to be adapted to the institutional
environment. In a weak institutional environment such as Niger, it is better to avoid a
long list of prior actions, and focus instead on a short list of key actions and their cross-
sectoral linkages and synergies.

69.     Strong Stakeholder Commitment is Critical. The DPLs series demonstrated that
satisfactory outcomes can be achieved with strong commitment on the part of
government and with Bank support designed to develop the needed capacity for
implementation. This is particularly evident in the education, health, and to a lesser extent
in agriculture sectors, where authorities are committed to improve capacities and increase
efficiency of service delivery. On the other hand, implementation of reforms in public
finance management has been remarkably slow. Major deficiencies persist in public
finance management, even after five policy-based operations. Before embarking on a new
course of action, it is important to complete the reform agenda in this key area.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Government did not provide comments on the draft ICR prepared by the Bank. The
Government Completion Report is attached in Annex 4. Following are some of the
messages:

Political stability in the 2000s created a favorable context for economic reforms.
Economic growth accelerated while inflation declined. Budget revenues increased, which
enabled the Government to improve social services. IMF-supported programs were
successfully implemented.

The RSRCs series was intended to improve public finance management and support
reforms in rural and human development, including population and gender.




                                              21

Public finance reforms were delayed due to weak capacity and ownership.

Results: Treasury operations have been improved and regulations have been adopted to
enhance the efficiency of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The regulatory
apparatus for public procurement has been established. The legal framework for statistics
has been established and a status for personnel adopted.

The action plan for rural development has been revised to take into account food security
issues. The cost of rural development programs has been estimated and a MTEF prepared.
A decree has been issued for the creation of regional rural code agencies. Three of them
have been established.

More than 3000 contractual teachers have been recruited and assigned to underserved
areas. The Teacher Training School has been upgraded. An action plan has been adopted
to improve the management of contractual teachers. COGES are associated to the
management of contractual teachers.

The Government has recruited 454 health specialists. The cost of services for maternal
and infant health has been fully subsidized.

A steering committee has been established with a secretariat to monitor program
implementation.

Overall, the Government asserted that its performance during the implementation of both
operations was satisfactory mainly because it implemented reform programs despite their
limited institutional capacities. The Government also appreciated the World Bank's
technical support during implementation of the program and they stressed that
institutional capacity building is a prerequisite for successful implementation of policy
reforms.

1. Description et démarrage du projet

Historique

Contexte politique

A la fin des années 90 marquées par une forte instabilité politique et sociale, le Niger a
réussi à mettre en place de nouvelles institutions politiques sur une base démocratique à
partir d'un processus électoral dont la réussite a été reconnue par la communauté
internationale.

En 2004 de nouvelles élections générales (locales, législatives et présidentielles) ont été
organisées dans la transparence, le respect des lois en vigueur et des principes
démocratiques.
Elles ont confirmé le retour à la stabilité politique à travers la réélection non contestée du
Président de la République SEM Tandja Mamadou avec une majorité confortable.
La stabilité politique ainsi retrouvée a créé un contexte favorable à la poursuite des
réformes économiques et financières engagées depuis le début de la décennie 2000.
Les progrès qui en ont résulté sont présentés ci-dessus.

Situation économique et sociale

Au cours de la période 2005-2007, plusieurs faits majeurs ont marqué la gestion
macroéconomique du Niger. Au nombre de ceux ­ci, on peut citer :

       -       la réalisation d'un taux de croissance moyen annuel de 5,3 % qui améliore
       les conditions de vie de la population avec un PIB par tête d'habitant qui s'accroît
       d'environ 2 points de pourcentage ;

       -       la maîtrise des tensions inflationnistes jusqu'au milieu de l'année 2007 à
       la faveur notamment d'une succession de bonnes campagnes de productions
       agricoles ;

       -       l'augmentation importante des recettes budgétaires liées à la fois à
       l'accroissement continu des performances des régies financières en matière de
       recouvrement d'impôts et taxes et à l'encaissement de ressources exceptionnelles
       issues de la vente d'actifs miniers et d'une licence globale de télécommunication ;

       -       la maîtrise des dépenses publiques et le renforcement de la qualité de
       celles-ci en vue de fournir à la population des services publics de bonne qualité et
       d'en élargir l'accès ;




                                             28

        -       l'amélioration du solde courant de la balance des paiements favorisé
        notamment par la revalorisation du prix de l'uranium ;

        -       l'amélioration de la position nette du gouvernement (PNG) et
        l'augmentation des crédits accordés au secteur privé par le système bancaire.

Plusieurs facteurs se sont conjugués pour favoriser l'amélioration de la situation
macroéconomique comme indiquée ci-dessus.

Il s'agit principalement (i) de la stabilité politique, (ii) de la rigueur de la gestion
économique et financière attestée par la validation systématique de toutes les revues des
programmes conclus avec le FMI depuis 2000 et la mise en oeuvre ininterrompue de ceux
­ci depuis lors et (iii) de la bonne pluviométrie enregistrée tout au long de la période
considérée.

Objectifs du projet

La série RSRC vise à apporter un appui budgétaire au Gouvernement pour surmonter les
contraintes aux réformes de politique et institutionnelles de la gestion des dépenses
publiques, du développement rural, de la santé, de l'éducation et de la problématique de
croissance démographique et du genre. Dans ce contexte, le RSRC 1 et le RSRC 2
continueront dans un cadre à moyen terme, et par le biais d'opérations annuelles d'appui
au budget au cours de 2 années (2006 et 2007). Ces opérations se concentreront, sur les
secteurs prioritaires susmentionnés, et introduiront progressivement d'autres secteurs,
selon les besoins, en fonction des résultats des études analytiques en cours et à venir.

Les RSRC ont été structurés autour d'un cadre de résultats à moyen terme ayant identifié
les réformes proposées dans les domaines du développement rural et humain et autour
des étapes subséquentes requises à l'appui du programme de croissance.

Cette approche est conforme à la stratégie du Gouvernement, traduite dans le DSRP II,
qui identifie l'agriculture comme étant le moteur de la croissance économique dans le
court et moyen termes. Plus précisément, la lettre de politique de développement du
RSRC 2 qui s'appuie sur les grandes lignes de la SRP, présente l'évolution récente de la
mise en oeuvre des réformes dans les secteurs clés ainsi que les perspectives à moyen
terme.

En effet, elle fait le point sur les réformes des secteurs prioritaires de la SRP(gestion du
secteur public, secteurs sociaux et développement rural), les défis qui restent à surmonter,
les résultats atteints notamment dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre du 1er programme
(RSRC 1 ) , les réformes en cours dans le cadre du RSRC 2 et les déclencheurs potentiels
identifiés pour le RSRC3 .

                                              29

Gestion des dépenses publiques :

Sur la base des progrès réalisés dans la mise en oeuvre du plan d'action PEMFAR, le
Gouvernement envisage d'approfondir les réformes, principalement au niveau de la
préparation, de l'exécution , et du contrôle du budget, avec le soutien continu de la
Banque et de la communauté des bailleurs de fonds.

Les principaux défis à relever dans le cadre de ce partenariat sont notamment : (i) la
modernisation du Trésor pour se conformer aux directives de l'UEMOA, (ii)
l'amélioration de l'exécution du budget grâce à un système fiable de gestion de la
trésorerie, (iii) l'achèvement de la restructuration du Ministère de l'Economie et des
Finances, (iv) une présence accrue des ministères techniques dans la préparation du
budget et le processus d'exécution ainsi qu'une responsabilité plus poussée des ministère
techniques, et (v) le renforcement des entités de supervision internes (contrôles
financiers) et externes (chambre des comptes) de l'exécution du budget pour améliorer la
qualité des dépenses publiques et établir dans le délais prescrits les rapports             sur
l'exécution du budget pour le parlement.

Passation des marchés :

La vision à moyen et longs termes adoptés dans le contexte de la réforme des passations
des marchés publics contribuera à améliorer la transparence dans la gestion des finances
publiques et de développer un marché commun de l'UEMOA. L'objectif de la réforme
est d'améliorer la transparence et l'efficacité du système de passation des marchés
publics, conformément au DSRP et au Code de transparence de l'UEMOA pour la
gestion des finances publiques. La réalisation de cet objectif contribuera à une mise en
oeuvre effective de la Déclaration de Paris sur l'efficacité de l'aide eu égard à l'utilisation
des systèmes nationaux pour les projets financés par des bailleurs de fonds.

Système national de données statistiques et d'information :

Le Gouvernement s'est engagé à renforcer l'INS. Le Gouvernement a indiqué son
engagement à mettre en oeuvre les réformes institutionnelles requises pour doter l'INS
d'une autonomie adéquate en matière de budget, de personnel, et des aspects stratégiques.
Avec l'appui technique de la Banque, l'INS a lancé l'enquête nationale sur le budget des
ménages en avril 2007 et envisage aussi de lancer en 2008 (i) une enquête
communautaire sur la prestation des services de santé et d'éducation ; et (ii) une enquête
nationale sur l'emploi.

En outre, tel que planifié et avec l'appui du Fonds fiduciaire pour le renforcement de la
capacité statistique de la Banque mondiale, l'INS est en train de développer une stratégie
à moyen terme pour définir le financement pour les enquêtes programmées. Il est
anticipé que ces initiatives : (i) fourniront une bonne base d'information pour la révision
du DSRP et le suivi des progrès dans la voie de la réduction de la pauvreté, (ii)
renforceront les capacités techniques du personnel de l'INS en matière de conception,



                                              30

préparation, et exécution des enquêtes en attirant un personnel hautement qualifié ; et (iii)
fourniront une stratégie cohérente à moyen terme qui définisse le programme de travail
de l'INS et veille à ce qu'un financement suffisant soit alloué aux diverses activités.

Agriculture et développement rural :

A la suite d'une approche participative et itérative qui a regroupé toutes les parties
concernées, le Niger a adopté une stratégie exhaustive de développement rural (SDR) en
2003. La SDR est directement interconnectée à un des piliers clés du DSRP II du pays ­
«Promouvoir la croissance et relever le niveau des revenus ». L'ultime objectif de la
(SDR) est de réduire l'incidence de la pauvreté rurale de 63 pour cent à 52 pour cent d'ici
2015, dans le contexte d'un environnement de politique et institutionnel favorable à un
développement économique et social durable dans lequel la sécurité alimentaire et la
gestion durable des ressources naturelles seront garantis.

Education de base

Le Gouvernement a avalisé un programme décennal de développement de l'éducation
(PDDE 2003-2013). Les objectifs clés du programme sont les suivants : l'éducation (i)
développer l'accès à l'éducation de base formelle et non formelle, en particulier pour les
enfants du milieu rural, les filles et les pauvres ; (ii) améliorer la qualité et la pertinence
de l'éducation ; et (iii) développer les capacités pour la gestion stratégique et
opérationnelle du secteur à la fois au niveau central et régional et accroître les
responsabilités prises au niveau des communautés.

Santé

Le Gouvernement a adopté un cadre décennal stratégique de développement du secteur
de la santé (2002-2011) actuellement en phase de mise en oeuvre dans le contexte d'un
Plan national quinquennal de développement sanitaire (PNDS -2005-2010). Les
objectives du PNDS pour le secteur de la santé sont : (i) réduction de la mortalité
maternelle et infantile, (ii) réduction des inégalités grâce à une meilleure gestion des
ressources (humaines et financières), et (iii) amélioration de la qualité et de la
disponibilité des services de santé. Pour créer la capacité de mise en oeuvre du PNDS, le
Gouvernement envisage (i) introduire des mutations institutionnelles (organisation
structurelle des coûts ; (iii) renforcer la disponibilité des médicaments génériques
essentiels à un coût abordable ; et (iv) promouvoir la décentralisation.

Croissance démographique

Le Gouvernement s'engage à mieux gérer la dynamique démographique. Outre
création d'un nouveau Ministère de la Population et de l'Action sociale (MP/AS) en
2004(devenu le Ministère de la Population et des Réformes Sociales (MP/SR) en mars
2007), le (MP/RS a préparé une Déclaration du Gouvernement en matière de Politique de
Population (DGPP). Ladite déclaration est basée sur la Déclaration de Politique Générale
(DPG), document tourné vers l'action, a été adopté par le Gouvernement en février 2007.



                                             31

Actuellement, des Plans annuels de travail (PAT) sont en préparation avec l'aide du
FNUAP pour la mise la DGPP en oeuvre

    2. Conception, exécution, réalisation et impact du projet

2.1. Evaluation de la conception du projet

Le programme a été harmonisé avec le plan d'action prioritaire issu de la revue des
finances publiques et de la responsabilité financière réalisée entre fin 2003 et début 2005.
Toutefois, il apparaît clairement ex-post que le contenu « volontariste » du plan d'action
prioritaire ci-dessus évoqué (PAP PEMFAR) n'a pas été suffisamment pris en compte.
En effet, plusieurs mesures et actions retenues dans le programme ont été réalisées avec
retard au terme de deux opérations en raison des faibles capacités de mise en oeuvre de
l'administration.
A titre illustratif, la réforme du trésor a été décidée par le gouvernement ; ce qui marque
sa volonté politique d'engager des réformes mais compte tenu des faibles capacités de
mise en oeuvre cette réforme demeure en chantier.
Par ailleurs le programme a retenu certaines actions et mesures épuisantes dans leur mise
en oeuvre mais dont les effets sont négligeables dans la restructuration de l'économie.
C'est le cas des mesures nominatives.
En définitive, au cours de la phase de conception le principe d'appropriation n'a pas été
observé dans le cas de certaines mesures et actions ; ce qui explique dans une large
mesure des retards et des lenteurs observés ça et là.

2.2. Principaux résultats obtenus dans chacune des composantes du projet

    Le RSRC 1 :

    Dans le cadre du RSRC 1, les résultats atteints sont les suivants :

        · Gestion des dépenses publiques :
            o Le système de gestion de la trésorerie à été renforcé ;
            o Les textes juridiques pour améliorer la structure et le fonctionnement du
                 Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances ont été adoptés.

        · Passation des marchés : la fonction de régulation des marchés publics en
            vue d'améliorer la transparence et l'équité dans la passation des marchés
            publics, est opérationnelle par la création de l'agence de Régulation de
            Marchés Publics.

        · Système national de données statistiques et d'information : en décembre
            2006, le cadre juridique pour le fonctionnement de l'INS a été renforcé par
            l'adoption d'un statut pour le personnel.

        · Développement rural :




                                               32

 o Le plan d'action pour la SDR a été révisé pour inclure le programme de lutte
   contre l'Insécurité Alimentaire par le Développement de l'Irrigation ;

 o Les coûts pour l'ensemble des programmes SDR ont été arrêtés, ce qui a
   fourni la base pour la finalisation du CDMT rural. A la fois, le CDMT et le
   plan d'actions ont été adoptés par le décret en octobre 2006 ;

 o Un arrêté a été adopté pour la création et l'installation progressive de
   Secrétariats Permanents Régionaux du code rural (SPR-CR). Pue après,
   trois des huit SPR-CR sont devenus opérationnels ;
 o Le Gouvernement a organisé un atelier à Maradi au cours duquel l'étude
   d'évaluation du système national pour la gestion des crises alimentaires et la
   prévention, a été validée.

· Education de base : l'exécution du budget programme (PDDE) s'est déroulée
  comme prévu :

  o Plus de 3000 enseignants contractuels ont été recrutés pour faire face aux
     demandes additionnelles de scolarisation ;

  o Un arrêté a été pris pour doter l'Ecole Nationale des Instituteurs (ENI)
     d'un nouveau statut et le personnel requis a été nommé afin d'assurer le
     bon fonctionnement des ENI, étape importante          dans la réforme des
     programmes de formation initiale des enseignants ;

  o Sur la base des résultats du rapport de l'audit technique, un plan d'action a
     été adopté pour améliorer l'allocation et la gestion des enseignants
     contractuels. La mise en oeuvre du plan d'action a donné lieu à (i) la
     participation du COGES dans la gestion des enseignants contractuels ; (ii)
     l'adoption de normes en termes du nombre des directions administratives
     et des effectifs des structures nombre décentralisées (iii) l'amélioration de
     l'allocation géographique des nouveaux enseignants contractuels (tenant
     compte des sureffectifs dans 25 départements).

· Santé :

o Pour remédier au déficit des ressources humaines et à leur distribution inégale
  sur le territoire, le Gouvernement a adopté des réglementations pour recruter
  au niveau régional 454 spécialistes de la santé (339 spécialistes de la santé et
  115 contractuels en 2006/2007) ;

o Afin d'améliorer l'accès aux services de santés de base, le Gouvernement a
  adopté un décret instituant le subventionnement intégral des contraceptifs,
  césariennes, consultations prénatales, et soins de santé pour les enfants de
  moins de cinq ans. La loi de Finances a alloué le financement requis pour
  couvrir les coûts de ces services.



                                   33

        Le RSRC2

Dans le cadre du RSRC 2 (1ère tranche), les résultats atteints sont les suivants :

        -        gestion des dépenses publiques : l'alignement des allocations de la Loi de
        Finances sur les objectifs prioritaires de la SRP et les CDMT des secteurs
        éducation, santé et développement rural ainsi que le suivi rigoureux des dépenses
        de réduction de la pauvreté dont la liste a été révisée et codifiée en 2007.

        -        système national de données statistiques et d'information : le PCA et les
        membres du Conseil d'Administration de l'INS ont été nommés.

        -        développement rural : en vue de rendre opérationnelle la SDR, un certain
        nombre d'actions ont été réalisées parmi lesquelles on peut citer la nomination des
        organes responsables de maîtrise d'oeuvre et maîtrise d'ouvrage par arrêté n°
        0001/CIP/SDR du 27/02/07 ;

        -        éducation de base : en vue d'améliorer la gestion et les affectations du
        personnel, un plan d'actions a été adopté en 2006. La mise en oeuvre de ce plan
        qui a démarré au cours de la même année, a fait l'objet d'un rapport axé sur la
        gestion et le déploiement des enseignants (incluant des résultats tangibles sur la
        gestion des enseignants contractuels, leur recensement achevé, l'implication
        effective des COGES dans le paiement de leurs salaires).

        -        Santé : pour améliorer l'efficience de l'offre des services de santé de base
        à travers un financement approprié du secteur, l'allocation interne du budget a été
        réalisée afin d'augmenter la part destinée aux services de santé de base des
        régions et districts sanitaires. En effet, en 2007, sur le budget annuel total de
        fonctionnement (hors salaire), 55% ont été transférés aux régions et aux districts
        sanitaires.

  Le programme de réforme dans le cadre de cette opération sera mené par le Ministre de
  l'Economie et des Finances, travaillant étroitement avec les ministères d'exécution et
  les parties permanentes ;

2.3. Responsabilités du comité de suivi.

Le Gouvernement dans un souci de mener à bien le programme de réformes qu'il a lui-
même initié, a crée un comité de suivi qui veille à la mise en oeuvre effective de ces -
celles. Dans ce cadre le comité a eu à organiser plusieurs réunions aux cours desquelles
il a identifié les mesures retenues dans le RSRC1 et le RSRC2. En plus le comité a assuré
le suivi de la mise en oeuvre des mesures à travers des réunions organisées au sein du
comité lui-même et à travers les vidéo conférence qu'il a eu avec la Banque Mondiale.
Au cours de ces réunions le comité demande aux structures de faire le point relativement
à la mise en oeuvre des mesures au niveau de leurs structures respectives. Ces notes sont

centralisées au niveau de la Direction Générale de l'Epargne, du Crédit et                des
Assurances qui fait la note de synthèse.

Il faut noter que c'est à travers ces réunions que le comité arrive à trouver des solutions à
certains problèmes et attirer l'attention des structures pour que des dispositions soient
prises afin d'éviter des retards.

Le comité bénéficie d'un soutien des autorités politiques à titre illustratif au niveau du
Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances organe chargé de l'exécution du projet les
réunions sont organisées par les responsables techniques, le Commissaire Chargé de
l'Economie, le Secrétaire Général et le Ministre de l'Economie et des Finances avec
leurs homologues des autres Ministères concernés.

2.4. Coordination et Gestion du Projet :

Le programme de réforme dans le cadre de cette opération sera mené par le Ministère de
l'Economie et des Finances, travaillant étroitement avec les Ministères d'exécution et les
parties prenantes ; il sera supervisé par un Comité de direction interministériel établi en
2006 pour la série de RSRC. Le comité est chargé de suivre les résultats et les réalisations
et de veiller à ce que les actions correctives soient adoptées à temps pour éviter les retards.
L'expérience du RSRC-1 a montré que le comité n'a pas rempli son mandat comme
anticipé. Pour renforcer le suivi de la mise en oeuvre de la réforme, le Gouvernement a
nommé un Secrétariat pour comité de direction ainsi que les membres clés des ministères
sectoriels. Pour faciliter la supervision des activités au titre du RSRC-2 proposé et du
RSRC-3 membres sectoriels clés suivent sur une base régulière les progrès réalisés afin
d'identifier les domaines de forces et de faiblesses et l'assistance éventuelle requise.
Plus spécifiquement, le Secrétariat sera responsable de la préparation des rapports
trimestriels de progrès, avec les apports des équipes clés des ministères sectoriels. Ceci
aidera à maintenir la dynamique en faveur des résultats projetés pour le moyen terme par
le Gouvernement et permettra de remédier à tous risques éventuels de rendements
indésirables.


     Impact du projet dans la mise en oeuvre de la politique nationale sur la protection
    sociale

Le suivi du programme et des mesures de réformes structurelles sera assuré par le
Gouvernement qui s'appuiera à cette fin sur le Comité Interministériel de Suivi des
RSRC qui sera renforcé, par la création d'un Secrétariat et la désignation de points
focaux. Ce comité regroupe l'ensemble des structures appuyées par le programme. Le
Commissariat Chargé de l'Economie en assure le secrétariat.

Le Secrétariat aura pour activités principales, le suivi de la mise en oeuvre des mesures
de réformes en s'appuyant        sur les points    focaux (DEP et DAAF des ministères
concernés, Direction du Budget, Direction Générale du Contrôle Financier, Secrétariat
Exécutif de la SDR, Service des Etudes de la Direction Générale du Trésor et de la

travaux liés aux RSRC et aux autres appuis budgétaires (Union Européenne, BAD,

    3. Analyse critique de l'action de la banque mondiale, du gouvernement et de
        l'assistance technique

    3.1.Appréciation de l'action de la banque mondiale au cours d'exécution du
           Projet

L'exécution du projet a été facilitée au niveau de tous les secteurs bénéficiant d'une
assistance technique de la Banque Mondiale et/ou d'autres PTF.                  Le secteur du
développement rural illustre parfaitement cette affirmation, car dans la plupart des cas le
contenu et le délai de mise en oeuvre ont été satisfaisants. La principale leçon qu'il
convient de tirer est qu'en l'état actuel de la situation institutionnelle le renforcement des
capacités est un passage obligé pour réussir une politique ambitieuse de réformes au
Niger.

    3.2. Appréciation de l'action du Gouvernement au cours d'exécution du Projet

Le gouvernement a créé à travers le fonctionnement du Comité de suivi les conditions
favorables à la prise en charge effective des réformes par les Secrétaires Généraux des
départements ministériels concernés. Ainsi dans la plupart des cas la préparation
technique des dossiers a pu bénéficier d'un mécanisme de coordination de haut niveau et
d'une prise de décision politique rapide. Le Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances,
organe chargé de l'exécution du projet a inlassablement oeuvré pour qu'il en soit ainsi.

A cet effet, plusieurs rencontres ont été organisées par les responsables techniques du
Ministère, le Commissaire Chargé de l'Economie, le Secrétaire Général et le Ministre,
avec leurs homologues des départements ministériels concernés. Il est indispensable à
l'avenir d'envisager de renforcer ce schéma pour créer les conditions de succès de
l'exécution des programmes de réformes.

    3.2.Evaluation d'efficacité et de la qualité des relations entre la Banque Mondiale et
        le Gouvernement durant l'exécution du projet

Globalement la qualité des relations a été bonne. En effet, la réalisation des mesures de
réformes et les tirages se sont déroulés suivant des délais raisonnables d'une manière
générale. Toutefois, le rythme imposé par la Banque ne conduit pas dans tous les cas à la
réalisation d'un travail rationnel. D'où la nécessité d'agir à l'avenir sur le nombre de
missions de suivi et l'organisation matérielle de celles-ci. Il pourrait être également utile
d'envisager un rééquilibrage de la relation en faisant en sorte que quelques échanges sur
la mise en oeuvre des programmes soient organisés au siège de la Banque Mondiale.
