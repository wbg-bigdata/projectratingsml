                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to: (a) finance specific
investments over two year period in three selected oil producers'
associations, and (b) support the Borrower's reform programs in the
oil sector in the areas of pricing, taxation, legislation,
restructuring and promotion of private sector investment.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     Kogalymneftegas
1.    The carrying out of workovers, of about 700 production oil
wells including the introduction of new technology to increase well
productivity.
2.    The replacement of about 864 km of oil gathering lines and
production flow lines (including fittings) which would reduce oil
leakages and thus address an important environmental concern as well
as recover oil currently wasted.
3.    Technical assistance, data processing and training.
Part B:     Purneftegas
1.    The carrying out of workovers of about 300 production oil
wells including the introduction of new technology to increase well
productivity.
2.    The in-fill drilling of about 84 wells in existing fields.
3.    The replacement of about 95 km of oil gathering lines and
production flow lines (including fittings) which would reduce oil
leakages and thus address important environmental concern as well as
recover oil currently wasted.
4.    Technical assistance, data processing facilities and training.
Part C:    Varyeganneftegas
1.    The carrying out of workovers of about 156 production oil
wells including the introduction of new technology to increase well
productivity.
2.    The completion of about 144 wells already drilled but not
completed and connection of these to the surface infrastructure.
3.    The replacement of about 58 km of oil gathering lines and
production flow lines (including fittings) which would reduce oil
leakages and thus address environmental concern as well as recover
oil currently wasted.
4.    The provision of the following processing equipment: (a) a
2,000 bpd topping plant to produce refined products for oil field
operations; and (b) natural gas liquid extraction units with a
throughput of 175 MMSCFD of natural gas which would recover 875 tons
per day (6,400 bpd) of hydrocarbon liquids. The extraction units
would reduce the amount of gas and liquids being flared, and thereby
provide the environmental benefits of reduced carbon dioxide and
particulate emissions.
5.    Technical assistance, data processing facilities and training.
Part D:     The Borrower's Ministry of Fuel and Energy
      Technical assistance in support of the Borrower's oil sector
development and oil sector reform programs including, inter alia,
the following areas:  petroleum project preparation; management
training; enterprise restructuring and privatization; petroleum
pricing; taxation; legislation; project tendering; and oil sector

                            SCHEDULE 4
                Single Currency LIBOR Determination
1.    Single Currency LIBOR for any Interest Period shall be the
offered rate for deposits in dollars for a period of six months
which appears on the display designated as page "3750" on the
Telerate monitor (or such other page or service as may replace it
for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of
major banks for dollar deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
the second day on which banks and foreign exchange markets are open
for business in London prior to the commencement of such Interest
Period (the Interest Determination Date).
2.    If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on
such service as may replace it, the Bank shall request the London
offices of four major banks to provide the Bank with the rate at
which deposits in dollars are offered by such banks on the Interest
Determination Date to leading banks in the London interbank market
for a period of six months commencing on the Interest Payment Date
in question. Single Currency LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be
the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth
decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by the Bank.
3.    If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such
quotations under paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be
arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal
place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at least two
major banks in London selected by the Bank on the Interest
Determination Date for loans in dollars to leading European banks
for a period of six months commencing on the Interest Payment Date
in question. If fewer than two of the banks so selected are quoting
such rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the Single Currency in
effect for the last preceding Interest Period.
