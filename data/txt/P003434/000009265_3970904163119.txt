CHANGCUN (LUAN) COAL MINING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             The People's Republic of China.
Beneficiary:          The Luan Coal Industrial Company (Luan CIC).
Amount:                US$126.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at standard
variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:       The proceeds of the loan will be onlent from the
Government to Luan CIC, with a term of 20 years
including five years of grace and an interest rate of
8% p.a. The Luan CIC will bear the foreign exchange
risk (between the dollar and the borrower's
currency).,
Project Description:  The project is an important element in the
Government's policy to double coal output to 1,200
million tonnes per year Cmtpy) by the year 2000. The
project is the first of a series of large-scale,
fully mechanized coal mining operations in the
country. It will contribute to: (a) increasing coal
production by about 4.5 mtpy by the early 1990s; (b)
transferring technology in mine design, engineering
and construction (especially the highly productive,
mechanized longwall exploitation technology); (c)
introducing modern coal washing technology; and (d)
fostering improved management techniques for project
scheduling, monitoring and cost control.
The project will finance construction of the Changcun
mine, including vertical shafts, underground
roadways, and longwall faces; construction of a coal
preparation plant; equipment for coal extraction,
washery and loadout operations; and surface
infrastructure including a railway spur line, an
electrical substation, water supply lines, workshops,
and warehouses. Risks are normal for a major coal
mining project of this type. The project's technical
assistance and training program will assure adequate
support for project implementation and facilitate
development of technical and managerial skills of
local staff. The Government is planning to raise
coal prices to approach the long run marginal cost of
production within the Seventh Five-year Plan (1986-
90) and maintain that level in real terms thereafter.

CHINA - CHANGCUN (LUAN) COAL MINING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of China has requested a Bank loan of US$126.0
million equivalent to help finance the Changcun (Luan) Coal Mining
Project. Located in Shanxi province which commands 40% of China's
economically recoverable coal reserves, the Changcun project will
contribute to the opening phase of the Government's program to double
China's coal output between 1980 and the year 2000 to 1,200 million tonnes
per year (mtpy). The project is the first one of a series of large-scale,
fully-mechanized coal mining operations in the country. It will both
contribute to increased production of semi-anthracitic coal and serve as a
model of modern, mechanized coal mining that might be extended in the
future throughout the industry. The project will finance mine
construction, including vertical shafts, underground roadways, and longwall
faces; construction of a coal preparation plant; and equipment for coal
extraction, washery and loadout operations. It will provide surface
infrastructure including a railway spur line, an electrical substation,
water supply lines, workshops, warehouses, offices, a hospital and
schools. A project-financed technical assistance and training program will
assure adequate resources for project implementation as well as
facilitating the technical and managerial skills development of local
staff. Cofinancing (grant aid) has been secured from the Federal Republic
of Germany (US$1.9 million) and UNDP (US$384,000) for project preparation
and technical assistance.
1.02      The project was submitted to the Bank for consideration in
November, 1981, and was appraised in September 1983 and August/September
1984 by missions comprising Messrs. Kotschwar, Bentjerodt, Chattopadhya,
Fukuda, Iskarpatyoti and Ms. Hadjitarkhani of the Industry Department.
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Resource Endowment
2.01      China is well endowed with primary energy resources, particularly
coal, hydrocarbons, oil shale and hydropower. At 640 billion tonnes,
China's proven coal reserves surpass those of any other nation in the
world. The economically recoverable portion of this total is estimated to
be sufficient to sustain production at current levels for well over 100
years. Proven recoverable oil reserves are estimated at about 1.8 to 2.5
billion tonnes in the onshore regions and 4-8 billion tonnes offshore.
Recoverable gas reserves are about 130 billion cubic meters. Reserves of
oil shale are estimated unofficially at 400 billion tonnes against current
shale oil production of 300,000 tonnes p.a. China's exploitable hydropower
potential, among the largest in the world, is estimated at 1.9 million GWh
per year; present hydro generation is about 86,450 GWh. While geothermal
phenomena are abundant in the mountainous southwestern part of the country,
geothermal energy has not been developed to a significant extent and its
role is likely to remain limited.   As in other developing economies,
noncommercial fuels such as crop residue and animal waste are used



-2-
extensively; they constitute about one third of total energy consumed. Use
of wood for fuel plays a smaller role in China than ir most other countries
with similar per capita income levels because of the scarcity of forest
resources. China has pioneered and is now the leading producer of biogas.
2.02      China's energy resources are unevenly distributed.  As much as
75% of known commercial energy resources are in the north and northeast
which account for about 30% of China's population and 45% of gross
industrial output. The east, with one-fifth of the total population and
30% of industrial output, is almost devoid of energy resources. In the
southwest, there is considerable hydropower and coal potential, but in the
central south, except for minimal hydropower, energy resources are
virtually nonexistent. Northwest China has considerable coal and oil
resources and major hydropower potential in Xizang. However, the latter
resources are for the most part in such remote and sparsely populated areas
that development would be extremely difficult and slow. It is for this
reason that the Government has given increasing attention to (a)
development of coal in Shanxi province which is strategically located
vis-a-vis the large southern and eastern consumption centers and (b)
development of offshore oil, particularly in the southeastern continental
shelf.
B. Production and Consumption
2.03      China's achievements in developing energy resources over the past
three decades have been impressive. From 1952 to 1983, coal production
increased from about 60 million tonnes to 715 million tonnes and power
generating capacity from about 2,000 MW to 76,440 MW.l/ Oil production
increased from about 0.1 million tonnes in 1950 to 10 million tonnes in
1983. On average, commercial energy production grew at 10% p.a. from
1952-75, at less than 8% p.a. from 1979-81, and at nearly 12% p.a.
beginning in 1982. Currently China is the fourth largest producer of
commercial energy in the world with coal accounting for about 70% of total
production, oil 22%, and natural gas, hydroelectric power, and small
quantities of shale oil and geothermal power constituting the balance.
About 20% of oil production and 1% of coal production are current'ly
exported. Noncommercial energy sources supply energy equivalent to about
40% of commercial production.
2.04      In commercial energy consumption, China ranks third in the world,
after the USA and USSR. Annex-1 gives a brief summary of the World Coal
Market with special emphasis on anthracite. China's total energy
consumption per capita is about 650 kilograms of coal equivalent (kgce),
which is slightly above the average for developing countries (620 kgce).
In terms of efficiency, global comparisons of commercial energy consumption
per unit of Gross Domestic Product show China with a high energy intensity
level and with substantial potential for improvement in industrial energy
efficiency. For example, in the steel and in nitrogenous fertilizer
industries, energy consumption per unit of output, even in large integrated
1/ Preliminary figure for 1984 coal production is reported at 760 million
tonnes.



-3-
plants, is approximately double the level achieved in best international
practice. Indiscriminate development of small plants at the expense of
economies of scale has often led to dissipation of resources and energy
inefficiency. However, energy inefficiency in China is not only related to
the scale of industrial plants, but also to the use of old-fashioned
technology, inadequate facilities, inappropriate types of raw materials,
and artificially low fuel prices. Many of these problems will take a long
time to solve and will require substantial capital investment and some
industrial restructuring.
2.05      Prospects for continued growth of energy supply are uncertain.
The major oil fields, which together account for about 90% of China's oil
production, have peaked and entered a declining phase. Few new discoveries
have been made. Rapid expansion of the coal industry Is constrained by
complex problems of investment, location and transportation. The
remoteness of large hydro sites from load centers and the relatively large
capital requirements and long gestation period of major hydro projects
preclude sizeable increases in hydropower's share of energy production in
the near term.

2.06      The likelihood of slow-growing energy supplies represents a
serious constraint to economic growth at least through the 1980s. To ease
this critical problem, the Government has emphasized programs to (a)
increase energy production through investment in new energy development
projects and (b) restrain demand for energy through energy conservation
measures. On the production side, although several coal and hydropower
projects were postponed in 1981 because of overall investment reductions,
energy investment has since been restored to the previously planned level.
Operations are underway to build a number of hydroelectric and thermal
power stations, develop open pit and underground coal mines, and increase
the capacity of transport facilities for coal handling. To accelerate
petroleum development, the Government has invited foreign oil companies to
help develop both offshore and selected onshore areas with difficult
drilling conditions. However, because of the long gestation period
required for energy projects, it is unlikely that the 1980s will replicate
the previous decades in energy supply increases.
2.07      The Government's energy conservation measures comprise a mix of
administrative and price incentives. Cutbacks in planned allocations of
energy to major industrial users appear to have been the most frequently
applied measure thus far. Energy consumption norms have been reduced and
more strictly applied. Some very inefficient plants have been closed
down. Oil-fired units are being converted to coal-firing to the extent
possible. Fifty-five energy conservation centers have been established to
provide enterprises with technical assistance in improving energy
efficiency. These programs are credited with energy savings estimated at
35 million tonnes of coal equivalent in 1980 and 26.5 million tonnes in
1981. About half of these savings, however, might have been due to the



-4-
shift in the industrial structure from heavy to light industry. There is
still much potential for further energy-saving efficiency improvements in
such industries as iron and steel, cement, non-ferrous metals, chemical
products, fertilizer and thermal power generation. The Government has also
introduced some price increases. In 1979, the prices of coal and natural
gas were raised. More recently, special subsidies on diesel fuel for
certain users were eliminated, an excise tax of Yuan 70 per tonne of crude
and heavy oil (burned as fuel) was introduced and marginal coal prices to
industrial users have increased. However, the present price structure is
not fully conducive to energy conservation; further large increases in the
price of coal combined with increases in the price of petroleum products
for industrial users are necessary (para. 3.17). High industrial
electricity rates would also encourage conservation and provide resources
for capacity expansion, thereby helping to eliminate the chronic
electricity shortage, which accounts for about 20% of losses in industrial
production.
III. THE COAL SUBSECTOR
A.   Organization of the Industry
3.01      Institutions.  There are three principal ministries responsible
for the energy sector: the Ministry of Coal Industry (MOCI), the Ministry
of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP), and the Mini3try of
Petroleum Induatry (MOPI). MOCI oversees all aspects of coal industry
development including policy making, system planning, geological
exploration, project design and construction, manufacturing of mining
equipment, scientific research and workers' health, education and
training. The MOCI also seeks foreign funds for joint coal ventures
through two affiliated institutions, the China National Coal Development
Corporation (CNCDC) and the China National Coal Export and Import
Corporation (CNCEIC).
3.02      Under the MOCI are 84 Coal Mine Administrations (CMAs) and Coal
Industrial Companies (CICs) which operate 580 MOCI mines. These mines
produced 53% of total production in 1982. CMAs and CICs are responsible to
Provincial Coal Industry Boards (PCBs) which in turn report to both the
provincial governments and the MOCI. An additional 19,500 mines are run by
prefectural or county governments or by collective enterprises belonging to
communes and brigades. These local mines are generaly small and many
collective mines operate only on a part time basis.
3.03      Planning and Allocation.  The State Planning Commission (SPC)
determines annual coal production targets together with MOCI, the Ministry
of Railways (MOR) and coal user ministries. The MOCI then allocates to
each PCB targets for volume of production, operating costs and profits
based on factors such as past overall performance, local averages and
national requirements. Annual budgets are also prepared and consolidated
at local levels and submitted through the IMOCI to SPC for approval and
subsequent submission to the various State agencies responsible for
allocation of materials (Annex 2).  The State Economic Commission (SEC)



-5-
has the overall responsibility for supervision of materials allocation and
implementation of the production plan. The delivery arrangements of
allocated commodities or inputs are made through direct contractual
agreement between the consuming, producing and transporting ministries in
accordance with the annual production plan (Annex 2).  Construction of new
MOCI mines or major expansion of an existing mine needs SPC approval.  The
approval stages, funding and implementation arrangements for new coal
projects are illustrated in Annexes 3 and 4.
3.04      About 85Z of all coal produced is distributed under standard
central or local allocation procedures. The remaining 152 is either
self-consumed or marketed by producers outside the allocation system.
Centrally-allocated coal, about two-thirds of the total allocated, is
covered by contracts between consumers and producers, with the railways
guaranteeing, where necessary, the provision of transportation. For
planning and coordi-nation purposes, there are quarterly meetings between
consumers and the MOCI, but there are also more frequent contacts between
these parties and the railways to deal with shipments, coal quality or
other day-to-day problems. A major planning problem is to match the
quality requirements of consumers with the availability of coal, and to do
so in a fashion that minimizes transport costs (para. 7.11).
B. Manpower and Training
3.05      The coal industry in China is a major employer.  In 1982, about
4.7 million workers or about 0.5% of the population and 1% of the labor
force were involved, about a third in mining activities and two-thirds in
related services such as schooling, housing, and health. The MOCI mines
employ 2.6 million workers. Because of the low level of mine
mechanization, the average productivity per employee is low: in 1982,
overall productivity for MOCI mines was only about 0.92 tonnes per manshift
(tIMS).
3.06      To supply the personnel requ'.rb.ments of the coal industry, the
MOCI operates a system of 102 secondary vocational schools, 36 senior
secondary technical schools, 12 universities and colleges, and 29 schools
for cadre training. Total enrollment in these programs in 1982 was about
80,000. An additional 15,000 students are enrolled in MOCI-sponsored
television university and correspondence courses. There is a need to
increase the number of trainees at all levels and improve the quality of
programs to meet the new requirements of an increasingly mechanized coal
industry (para. 5.23).
C.  Reserves and Production
3.07      With more than 500,000 square kilometers of coal-bearing area
spread over 29 provinces (Map IBRD 17642R), China ranks first in the world
in terms of proven coal reserves. About 86% of these reserves are hard
coal and only 14% lignite. In quality and grade, the hard coal reserves
are cemparable to those of the USA and USSR: an ash content generally in
the 10-25% range, sulphur less than 1%, and the calorific value over 6,000



-6-
kcal/kg. Coal production in China reached about 715 million tonnes in
1983; most is bituminous coal. Detailed data on coal production by region,
province, type of mine and quality of coal are provided in Annexes 5 and
6. Plans are to expand production to at least 1,200 mtpy by the year 2000
(para. 3.22). There is a need to expand anthracite production to
adequately meet requirements of residential, commercial and some industrial
users. In the case of coking coal, about 40 million tonnes is consumed by
domestic coke plants with about two million toanes exported and the rest
consumed indiscriminately as thermal coal.  Since coking coal commands a
premium internationally, efforts need to be made to reserve for export an
increasing amount of coal of this quality.  On the whole, however, China's
coal exports are expected to be modest over the rest of the century,
primarily because the domestic market is likely to remain undersupplied.
D. Costs of Production
3.08      China is a low-cost coal producer. Worldwide, only South Africa,
India and Western US mines are competitive on a cost basis. At an exchange
rate of Yuan 2.8 per USS, operating costs are typically under USS7 per
tonne, while capital costs average about USS40-45 per tonne capacity
including mine-related infrastructure and welfare facilities, but excluding
other infrastructure such as trunk rail lines. Geological and mining
conditions are very favorable and wages are low, averaging less than US$40
per month; this compensates for low labor productivity. By region, the
north and northwest show the lowest costs, as reserves lie in thick,
gently-dipping coal seams about 300 meters deep. Average operating costs
in Shanxi in 1983 varied between US$3.5 per tonne for small mines working
on outcrops to about USS7 per tonne for large mechanized mines. Average
investment costs including related infrastructure and social services
varied between US$25 per tonne for small mines to USS50 per tonne for large
mechanized underground miines. Costs in other parts of China are normally
higher as mining conditions are less favorable.
3.09      Based on average cost data for mines in Shanxi province and
information on geological and mining conditions for ten new mine
development projects, long-run marginal costs (LRMC) have been developed
for incremental production of about 500 mtpy (Annex 7). This would cover
mines coming on-stream by about the year 2000. LRMC for the north and
northwest are calculated at between USS14-18 per tonne (in 1984 terms and
at an exchange rate of Yuan 2.8 per USS1.00) and are -ot expected to
increase much over time. About two-thirds of the incremental production by
the year 2000 is planned to be provided by the north and northwest; other
(higher cost) regions will also expand production because of their
locational advantage as planners seek to minimize production plus transport
costs. In the case of the northeast, LRMC adjusted for quality differences
with Shanxi coal are believed to be over US$22 per tonne. Costs in the
south could be twice as high as those in Shanxi.
E. Consumption
3.10      With coal exports at no more than 1% of total production, and
imports (mostly from North Korea) negligible, domestic consumption of coal



-7-
has developed in line with rising production. By 1980, coal met about 70%
of total commercial primary energy consumption in China. Coal has been
persistently in short supply since the 1970s. The following table shows
the trend of consumption (net of losses and inventory changes) by sector
over the last decade:

Source: Ministry of Coal Industry.
3.11      Industrial demand for coal predominates, accounting for about 50%
of total consumption.  In the chemical industry, coal meets 45% of total
energy requirements (fuel and feedstock), as compared to about 5-6% in the
FR of Germany and about 1% in Japan, Canada and Italy. The share of the
power sector, which worldwide uses almost two-thirds of coal produced, is
only about 20% in China.  The power sector's consumption of coal in China
has, however, grown at almost 7% per annum on average from 1970 to 1982.
Noteworthy is the rapid growth of residential and commercial consumption of
coal over the last two years. Coal is losing ground in transportation, as
railway modernization favors diesel and electric locomotives. The
Government's plans are for coal to continue to meet more than 70% of the
country's total commercial energy requirements with demand growing less
rapidly than in the past due to the anticipated impact of active energy
conservation policies and the introduction of modern, energy-saving
technology. Consumption in the power sector would grow the fastest,
followed closely by residential consumption, while industry's consumption
would grow more slowly. On the basis of an annual growth rate of 7% for
the economy as a whole, domestic demand for coal is expected to rise to at
least 1,400 mtpy by the year 2000 or at over 4% per year.
F. Mining Methods
3.12      Modern technology and the most rudimentary methods of production
coexist in China. The choice of technology is tied to the scale of the
mine, and the scale in turn is determined by the size, depth, and
mineability of coal deposits. For an economy with a large, under-utilized



-8-
labor force and scarce capital, the issue of mechanization deserves careful
attention. In general, in the case of small deposits or in marginal areas
of larger deposits lying close to the surface such as small outcrops,
labor-intensive, small-scale mining using traditional technology is the
most cost effective. In the case of deeper deposits, requiring costly
shafts, small mines are not viable; medium- or large-scale mechanized mines
are competitive. Mine mechanization is expected to play an increasing role
in China as: (i) mining equipment in general becomes more efficient with
technological advance; (ii) the Chinese produce such equipment themselves
at lower cost than imported equipment; (iii) transfer of technology results
in more balanced and efficient mine development and operation; and (iv)
concern for safety and environmental protection increases. Most of the
deposits suited to open pit mining, a generally low-cost, mechanized
method, are located in remote areas of western Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.
As a result, open pit mines, which now represent less than 5% of total
production, are likely to be developed very selectively in China.
G. Mining Equipment Manufacture
3.13      There are 84 major plants under the MOCI engaged in manufacturing
coal mining plant and machinery (Annex 8). Another 81 plants are under the
control of the Ministry of First Machine Building (MOFMB), and provincial
and local authorities. In 1981, MOCI plants employed about 69,000 persons
and produced machinery worth about US$300 million. The Chinese are trying
to improve the quality and performance of the existing products. To the
coal industry, quality and reliability of the equipment are more important
than cost alone. The prices of Chinese equipment appear to be lower than
international prices although it is not certain that pricing mechanisms
reflect true production costs. Consideration needs to be given to the
manufacture of equipment in collaboration with foreign suppliers.
H. Regional Coal Development and Transport
3.14      Responsible for developing China's major coal deposits, MOCI
mines serve as principal suppliers of both local and, more importantly,
national coal requirements. About a third of MOCI-controlled coal is
traded iaterprovincially, going from coal-surplus to coal-deficient
provinces (Annex 9). The movement of coal throughout China is a massive
effort, exerting great pressure on various transport modes. In 1980, the
total volume of coal transported was 770 million tonnes (including double
counting due to use of more than one transport mode) which amounted to
about a third of the country's total transport capacity. The railway
system, with over 50,000 km of track, moves about 54% of total coal volume,
or 400 mtpy, representing about 40% of total railway traffic. Highways,
mainly used for short hauls, handle about 33% with river and coastal
shipping concentrated on the ports of Shanghai, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao and
Dalian, carrying 13%. In recent years transport capacity has not kept pace
with coal transport demand. The north in particular has experienced
serious transport bottlenecks. As a result, in Shanxi alone coal
production has lagged behind mining capacity by about 10 mtpy.



-9-
3.15      To increase transport capacity and to provide for planned
expansion of coal production particularly in the north where such
production will grow the fastest (Annex 7), the Goverament is currently
supporting large investment programs in railways and ports development.
Planned railways include seven routes linking Shanxi to the ports of
Qinhuangdao, Qingdao and Lianyungang, to the cities of Beijing and Tianjin,
and to the main north-south Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai rail
lines (Map IBRD 17642R). The Bank's first railway project provided a
US$220 million loan (Loan 2394-CHA) for the expansion of two of these
lines. Japan has also provided financial assistance for construction and
expansion of coal carrying lines. In ports the Bank is financing projects
in Shanghai, Huangpu and Tianjin (Loan 2207-CHA) while the Japanese are
financing port expansion in Qinhuangdao and Shijiusuo. Shijiusuo, designed
to accommodate 100,000 DWT vessels, is planned as a major port for coal
exports and coastal coal shipping. Also under consideration are projects
to build pipelines for coal slurry transport, principally from Nei Monggol
and Shanxi to eastern China.
I. Coal Prices
3.16      Historically, coal prices in China have been very low.  The 1983
national average mine-mouth price was only about US$10 per tonne (at an
average calorific value of 5,400 kcal/kg), or only about 60% of LRMC (Annex
7) and about 50X of the current quality-adjusted international prices (FOB
basis). Prices are quoted at the mine on free on rail basis, with
transport costs borne by the consumer. Rail is the predominant transport
mode and rates are about USt0.5/tonne-km which is low by international
standards. Few consumers pay more than US$10/tonne in transport charges,
but there is great variation in delivered cost to consumers in any one
region depending on the origin of the coal. Although overall price levels
are fixed by the Government and MOCI coal is priced at virtually the same
level throughout ChiLna, local authorities have some flexibility to set
prices for coal produced locally. Local prices vary from US$5 to over
US$30 per tonne. Annexes 10 and 11 provide 1982 prices for a variety of
coal types in selected CMAs and the current formula for coal price
calculation.
3.17      Due to low prices, coal mines are in a weak financial position;
subsidies from the central or local governments are frequently required.
Some CMAs or CICs show profits, but usually prices co-ver only operating
costs including maintenance; in China depreciation rates are very low and
there are hardly any interest charges, since the Government made available
free investment funds to mines. Low prices generate economic costs by
encouraging waste among consumers and adversely affect production. Lack of
funds at the mine level affect replacement of equipment and development
work. Local mines and, particularly, collective mines suffer more given
their limited access to Government investment funds. These matters have
been discussed extensively by the Government and the Bank. Recently, in a
major departure from past policies, the Government adopted a policy, Which
has been confirmed to the Bank, to gradually increase coal prices towards



-10-
LRMC within the next five years or so and then maintain them at that level
in real terms. The policy objectives are to promote energy conservation,
mobilize resources for the coal industry and to provide incentives for
production increases, particularly at a time when economic reform stress
enterprises self-reliance. Pricing coal at LRMC is in the Chinese context
consistent with efficiency pricing principles. In line with this policy,
the Government took in 1983 and 1984 a series of measures including a
virtual freeing of prices for coal produced by collectives (about 25% of
total production), 25-50% price increases for above-quota production of
about a third of CMAs and CICs, and 5-10% increases for coal produced in
high-cost regions. Although average coal prices have so far increased less
than 1OX as a result of these measures, further price adjustments are
planned for 1985 (para. 6.04). Moreover, the price structure is also being
revised (para. 3.19).
3.18      In addition to an inadequate coal price level, the current price
structure does not reflect the relative value of coal to consumers.
Noteworthy is the fact that the coal price formula does not discriminate by
calorific value, although it does by ash content. As a result, lignite is
sometirmes priced only marginally below export-quality coal. Coal from high
cost, coal deficient provinces is allowed a 10% mine-mouth price surcharge
in Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan and a 5% surcharge in Henan. But this does not
cover differential mining costs nor do surcharges apply to many other high
costs provinces.
3.19      To deal with these issues, the MOCI established in early 1984 a
Coal Price Study Group headed by a vice-minister. Several studies seeking
to identify a more rational price structure are being carried out, with
main results expected within the next two to three years. The objective of
the change in the price structure is to make differential prices more
responsive to the cost of producing the various grades and to consumers
willingness to pay for one coal grade relative to others. The studies
therefore focus not only on production costs by region and coal grade, but
also on the value of coal grades to consumers. Some of the Study Group's
recommendations, which are based on early results of the above studies, are
already being put into effect, as discussed above. Additional price
adjustments stressing increases for high-quality coal are being considered
by the State Council. By the time the level of prices approaches LRMC
(i.e., later this decade) the price structure is expected to be largely
rationalized. However, later adjustments will be necessary as the Chinese
economy undergoes technological and structural changes which have a bearing
on the relative value of coal characteristics to industry and other users.
In line with MOCI requests, the Ba-k is planning to continue providing
assistance to the Study Group, particularly in the area of coal price
structuring in other countries. MOCI has agreed to discuss with the Bank
the above studies from time to time.
J. Mine Development Policy
3.20      Traditionally, the MOCI gave priority to development of
centrally-controlled mines rather than local mines as the means to boost



-ll-
coal production. Smaller local mines were at times regarded as
inefficient, short-lived operations which often preempted large-scale
development of deposits capable of yielding high production rates. Funds
made available to local governments for mine development were therefore
reduced by 70X in 1979-81 from a previous annual average of Yuan 900
million. As a result, local government mines suffered at a time when
production in MOCI mines, themselves adversely affected by reduced
investments of the late 1970s, fell by more than 20 mtpy:

3.21      The realization that smaller mines under local control had such
advantages as lower investment costs, shorter construction time, the
ability to serve local markets with minimum transport cost and to mobilize
local financial and management resources, led to the formulation of a plan
for more balanced development of larger mines under MOCI control and
smaller mines under local control. In the case of MOCI-controlled mines,
the current emphasis is on rapid development of large-scale, highly
mechanized mining units and on modernization of existing mines capable of
making a sizeable contribution to production goals. The regional focus of
this development is in the north, particularly Shanxi, where the country's
largest and lowest-cost extractable coal deposits are found. To foster
parallel development of locally-controlled mines, the Government has (i)
allocated larger investment and maintenance resources to local mining
development; (ii) offered production incentives to local governments such
as lower sales taxes on local coal, liberalization of prices, and special
grants for increasing 'exports" to other provinces or for surpassing
certain production quotas; (iii) issued regulations allowing coal-deficient
local governments to invest in other localities that have coal but lack
development resources; and (iv) encouraged tighter mine safety controls in
local mines. Plans are to concentrate development of small, local mines on
deposits not suited to large-scale mining while avoiding unsystematic
excavation for coal by communes and brigades.

K. Subsector Constraints
3.22      Despite an energy savings trend as a result of conservation
measures and a shift in industrial structure from heavy to light industry,
demand for coal over the next two decades is expected to remain strong due
to growth of the economy generally. The official coal production target of
1,200 mtpy by the year 2000 is attainable given capacity under construction
and projects in preparation. This target would allow coal to maintain its
share of total commercial energy production, but would not be sufficient to
satisfy requirements which are projected to be no less than 1,400 mtpy by
that year (para. 3.11). The official target might be surpassed, in view of
the fact that it entails no expansion of collective mines. In fact,
collective mines should continue to expand rapidly as a result of recent
Government measures (para. 3.21) and expected price increases (para. 3.16)
and could contribute well over 100 mtpy to the expansion of production by
the year 2000. While not unrealistic given past performance of the
subsector, and the pre-investment work being carried out attaining the
larger production target of 1400 million tonnes by the year 2000 depends on
overcoming certain critical constraints: shortages of investment funds for
development of new mines, non-remunerative coal prices, inadequate project
planning, design and management and insufficient intersectoral
coordination.
3.23      Financial Constraints.  Although the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1986-90) has not yet been finalized, preliminary programs call for
increases in mine capacity at a rate of about 3.0-3.5% per year throughout
the 1980s. Since about 1% of mine capacity closes down every year, this
requires new capacity at the rate of over 4% or 35-40 mtpy. At an average
investment cost of about US$40-45 per tonne of annual capacity and
investments of about US$0.4 billion per year in related non-mine activities
such as research and training, an annual investment on the order of US$2.1
billion (in 1984 prices) would be required. While the US$1.8 billion
investment budget for 1982 and again for 1983 represents a significant
increase over the US$1.2 billion allocated for 1981, it falls short of
requirements. To supplement domestic funding for coal industry
development, efforts are now being made to mobilize foreign investment
resources in the form of foreign loans as well as direct foreign
investment. The latter is oriented to open pit mine development. Already
one agreement in principle has been signed with Occidental Petroleum (USA)
to develop jointly with the HOCI a large ooen pit mine, partially for
export purposes. However, a much deteric- ced international coal market
conspires against foreign investments making a substantial contribution, as
foreign investors would basically be interested in the coal for exports.
Therefore, higher Government outlays for investment in coal appear
necessary.
3.24      Non-remunerative Coal Prices.  The consequences of low coal
prices have been discussed above. Since there is widespread recognition
that without system-wide price adjustments the current Chinese efforts
to revitalize enterprise planning and management through economic reforms
(linked to new tax/profit distribution and retention/loan financing
schemes) cannot succeed in coal or elsewhere, the Government is committed
to coal price increases (para. 3.18).

3.25      Need for Improved Project Design and Management.  Though the
impressive growth of the coal industry over the past three decades is
testimony to the overall effectiveness of China's mine development
approach, there is, nonetheless, potential for improvement in mine design,
construction efficiency and organization of project implementation that
could lead to future cost savings. New mines in China at present are
developed in accordance with detailed MOCI design standards which take
little account of variations in local geological and mining conditions. In
some cases, this has resulted in unnecessary costs and failure to introduce
the type of equipment needed for optimum productivity. The large number of
government entities involved in mine development and often inadequate
coordination among them have also led to inefficiencies during project
execution. To minimize such problems in the case of the proposed project,
the Bank, with the assistance of the UNDP and FR Germany, has provided
technical assistance during the design phase of the project. Further
technical assistance will be financed under the project in areas dealing
with project execution.
3.26      Inadequate Intersectoral Coordination.  Weak coordination among
the Ministries dealing with coal, transportation, and power has led to
significant economic cost. Specific improvements required include: (i)
better coordination between transport authorities on the one hand and coal
producers and consumers on the other so as to avoid cross-hauling and other
unnecessary transportation arrangements; (ii) more rational location of
energy intensive industries and power plants relative to coal mines taking
into account such factors as the comparative costs of electricity
transmission and railway transport of coal; and (iii) reduction in the
transportation of coal waste by improving processing and washing facilities
at the mine site. There has been some evidence of improved coordination in
recent years, notably in Shanxi province, the site of the proposed project.
L. Project Rationale
3.27      To ease the problem of energy shortages, a severe constraint to
China's future economic growth, the Government has placed high priority on
boosting production of primary energy resources, particularly oil and gas,
power, and coal. Major Bank support has so far been given to development
of the oil and power subsectors. To help the coal industry achieve its
long term objectives, including doubling of output by the year 2000, a
series of coal projects has been included in the Bank lending program, of
which the proposed project is the first. Among the various actions needed
to achieve what is a massive expansion of the coal subsector, the rapid
development of large mines using modern technology is critical. The major
rationale for Bank involvement in the proposed Changcun project is to
provide a model for such development as well as to contribute to overall
coal production (4.5 mtpy run-of-mine (ROM) coal). The project would
utilize modern mining systems which, although individually not unknown to
the Chinese, will be fully integrated for the first time in a single mine
of this size in China. Changcun's geological and mining conditions and
measured coal reserves are ideal for the establishment of such a mining
operation. The Bank's involvement will enable MOCI staff to gain access to
international experience in mine technology, design, planning and



-14-
management. It is expected that the project will have an important
demonstration effect and that the benefits derived from improved project
design and execution would eventually spread throughout the industry. The
project has also allowed the Bank to undertake fruitful discussions with
MOCI and the Government on sector issues, such as coal pricing policies,
coal sector development strategies and investment planning in coal as it
relates to developments in power and transport sectors.
IV. THE ENTERPRISE: LUAN COAL INDUSTRIAL COMPANY (LUAN CIC)
A. Organization
4.01      Development of Luan CIC's sizeable coal deposits started in 1958
and production began in the mid-sixties. As part of the economic reform of
state enterprises in 1981, Luan CIC was issued a business license by the
Shanxi Administrative Management Bureau making it accountable for its
profits and losses. In addition, in November 1984 a Company Charter was
issued which established Luan CIC's legal autonomy and ability to enter
into agreements with foreign entities (such as project agreements with the
Bank), and established a Board of Directors. In addition to coal mines at
Wuyang, Zhangshu, Shigejie and Wangzhuang, Luan CIC owns ancillary
installations such as cement and explosives factories, and a power station;
it also supports a complete social infrastructure including township,
schools and hospitals.
4.02      Luan CIC managerial staff consists of a director, fcur deputy
directors, a chief engineer and a chief accountaLt. Luan CIC is divided
into management, production, capital construction, engineering/safety,
accounting and general administration departments which are further
organized into 24 technical and non-technical divisions. Planning is
handled by the director working with staff of the general administration
department. Luan CIC has annual and five-year production and investment
plans which are integrated with national plans and must be approved by the
SPC (para. 3.03).
B. Staffing and Training
4.03      Luan CIC employs about 17,000 people, nearly 14,000 in mining
operations, 800 in management positions and 2,500 as service personnel and
teachers. About 15% of the total workforce are graduates of polytechnic or
technical trade schools and 50% of management personnel have received
college degrees. Luan CIC management positions are filled with experienced
administrators, engineers and geologists trained at MOCI-operated
educational institutions, on-the-job at other 140CI mines and in periodic
refresher courses. Cost control and planning skills are rudimentary among
management staff and will be strengthened through project technical
assistance.
4.04      Primary through secondary school education is provided in Luan
CIC-run schools. A technical school and training center provides up to 24
months of trade training to secondary school graduates before they are



-15-
employed as junior technicians in the operation. In addition, it runs
an apprentice program and a technical evening training program for career
development. The present training system is effectively geared to the
requirements of a mining operation with a low level of mechanization. To
adapt it to the requirements of the highly mechanized Changcun mine, Luan
CIC's training center will be expanded and upgraded with foreign technical
assistance under the project (para. 5.23).
C. Operations
4.05      Luan CIC is located 20 km north of Changzhi city in southeast
Shanxi Province (Map IBRD 17500R). The four operating mines are undergoing
expansion with Wangzhuang scheduled to produce 3.0 mtpy in 1988. Coal
production has been increased from 3.6 million tonnes in 1978 to 5.7
million tonnes in 1983. 2/ Coal from Luan CIC mines is semi-anthracite of
very low sulphur content7(0.3Z), with a raw or ROM coal ash content of 13%
and 6,000 kcal/kg calorific value (Annex 12). Reserves at 6.7 billion
tonnes are more than adequate and offer excellent possibilities for
expansion.
4.06      The mining method is retreating longwall (described in Annex 13)
in descending slices in a seam up to 6 m thick. There are 22 longwall
faces, of which only 6 are fully mechanized with mainly imported
equipment. The average production of these mechanized faces is 40,000
tonnes per month which is comparable to that of similar faces in Western
industrial countries.
4.07      Overall productivity (output per man-shift) has increased from
1.93 tonnes per manshift (t/MS) in 1982 to 2.01 ttMS during 1983. These
figures, although low compared with industrialized Western countries using
comparable mining methods (UK average 1983: 3.90 t/MS; FR Germany: 3.95
t/MS) are not surprising due to the overall lower level of mechanization,
but are more than twice as high as the Chinese average for MOCI mines of
0.92 t/MS.
4.08      In 1982 under the national allocation system (para. 3.03), Luan
CIC marketed 5.2 million tonnes of coal, of which 5.0 million tonnes were
supplied to consumers outside Shanxi province and the rest to local
industries and utilities. Steel industries (in Henan and Hubei) and power
utilities (in Henan and Guangdong) were supplied with about one million
tonnes each, and the railways (in Henan, Jiangsu, and Hubei) with about 0.8
million tonnes. In addition, Luan CIC supplied coal to miscellaneous
industries in seven provinces and to the city of Beijing. In terms of
geographical distribution, the Southern provinces accounted for 77% of the
market, the Southeast 18%, and Shanxi province less than 5%.
D. Accounting Arrangements
4.09      Chinese fi-nancial statements have special features.  Under Luan
CIC's (and CMA's) current financial and accounting practices are:
2/ Preliminary figure for 1984 production is reported at 6.05 million
tonnes.



-16-
a.   Luan CIC maintains two sets of financial statements for its
activities--one set for capital construction and the other for
production. Since these two sets of accounts are not
consolidated, Luan CIC's balance sheet for production does not
include work-in-progress on capital construction.
b.   Funds are earmarked for particular purposes and are not fungible
at the discretion of Luan CIC; in the past all funds required for
investments and working capital were provided through state
allocations on a grant basis.
c.   Luan CIC remits most of its profit to GOC, retaining only a
portion in the range of 10-15% depending on its performance.
Until recently, Luan CIC could retain approximately 10% of
realized profits plus some 40% of excess profit over a target.
d.   What is termed a replacement fee, a fund retained by Luan CIC and
PCB and used for reinvestment, is low, about half of the standard
depreciation fee used in international Dractice. Any shortfall
in replacement funds is provided by MOCI through budgetary
allocations.
4.10      Major changes have been introduced to encourage the economic use
of funds. Funds for major new investments are now expected to be provided
in the form of loans from the People's Construction Bank of China. Such
loans are to be made only after projects have been extensively reviewed and
the cost estimates approved. In addition, starting in 1983, funds for
incremental working capital have been provided by the People's Bank at a
7.2% interest per annum in the form of short-term loans. Another major
change introduced in 1983 was in the retention formula. Since it is almost
impossible to set fair rates for CHAs and CICs operating under very
difficult conditions, the GOC was inclined to allow less profitable CMAs
and CICs to retain a higher percentage of their profit than the more
profitable ones, This resulted in lack of incentives to be more
efficient. Also, the formula was cumbersome as it required the GOC to
review target performance annually, which made it difficult for the GOC to
predict fiscal revenue and for the CMAs and CICs to set up long-term
plans. Hence, the financial reform enacted on June 1, 1983 reintroduced
fixed retention rates of 15% through an 85% corporate tax consisting of a
55% fixed tax plus 30% adjustment tax.
E. Audit
4.11      Until recently, financial statements of Chinese enterprises were
not subject to comprehensive audit. The concept of an independent audit
and an auditor's report thereon to the owners/managers was not applied; no
professional body of auditors existed nor was there an accepted set of
auditing standards. This situation changed in 1983 with the establishment
of the State Audit Administration (SAA) in accordance with the new
constitution ratified by the People's Congress in December 1982. Audit
bureaus at provincial and county levels are in the process of formation.
The SAA has the status of a ministry and reports directly to the State
Council. SAA has drafted national auditing regulations which are awaiting



-17-
approval; trial audits are being carried out to test the procedures and
familiarize staff with their application. As a temporary measure, audits
of entities which are beneficiaries of World Bank loans will be carried out
by the SAA's Capital Construction Bureau. Eventually it is planned that a
new Foreign Loan and Joint Venture Bureau will be established and staffed
with specialists capable of preparing audits in accordance with both
international auditing standards and Chinese regulations, and that this
Bureau will assume responsibility for World Bank audits. Until such time
as this Bureau is established, the Bank will continue to rely on the
independent auditing mechanism applied in previous projects. Assurances
were cbtained that Luan CIC will submit its annual financial statements,
audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, within six months
of the end of each financial year.
F. Financial Performance of Luan CIC
4.12      Luan CIC's historical financial statements for 1979-83, shown in

-18-
4.13      Luan CIC's financial performance is good by Chinese coal industry
standards. Since the last price increase in 1979, Luan CIC has been
generating operating profits on the order of US$20 million equivalent per
annum. On the basis of this performance, in 1983 Luan CIC's retention rate
was raised to over 15%, one of the highest in the coal subsector. Since
1979, Luan CIC has earned rates of return on net fixed assets in service of
between 21% and 30%. Fixed assets have been valued at historical cost less
depreciation (on a straight line basis), and there has been no revaluation.
Given China's low level of inflation over the last 30 years (averaging
about 1-2%), revaluation of net fixed assets would hardly affect this
rate. This profit reflects use of the replacement fee (para. 4.09) rather
than a depreciation charge calculated in Western systems. However, even if
the replacement fee were doubled, the rate of return would still hare been
about 15% in 1983.
4.14      The GOC's contribution to fixed assets and working capital
totalled Yuan 250 million up to 1983. Remittances by Luan CIC to the GOC
(commercial tax plus profit remittances) totalled Yuan 230 million in
1979-83. This indicates that the GOC's funds provided to Luan CIC was paid
back in little more than five years and that Luan CIC's investments were
profitable to the State.
4.15      Luan CIC's balance sheet is divided into three funding
categories: (i) fixed funds, (ii) current funds, and (iii) special funds.
The first two traditionalLy have been provided by GOC equity contributions
with special funds coming from replacement fee, repairs fund, retained
earnings, reserve funds and borrowing. These special funds have specific
applications like replacement, renovation, transformation, and minor
repairs. Depreciation rates have been about 4% annually. Since the CMA's
and CICs are not allowed to retain depreciation, funds for major repairs
and investments are provided by GOC (para. 4.09). When CMA's and CIC's
requirement for funds is less than yearly depreciation, the difference is
transferred to the Government and appears as a negative Government
contribution on CMA's and CIC's books.
4.16      Luan CIC's assets are presently about USS114 million equivalent.
The long-term debt is almost non-existent, reflecting the traditional
financing arrangement. The long-term debt equity ratio was 3:97 in 1983.
From the analysis of financial results, no major weaknesses have been
identified. Luan CIC's present financial performance and position are
sound.
V. THE PROJECT - CHANGCUN COAL MINE
A.   Project Objectives
5.01      The project is an important element in the Government's plan
(para. 2.06) to exploit China's abundant coal reserves through rapid
development of large-scale mines equipped with advanced mining technology.
The project will provide a model for such development as well as contribute
to overall production. Specific objectives of the project are:



-19-
(a)  to iacrease coal production by about 4.5 mtpy by the early 1990s,
thereby helping to meet China's demand for coal;
(b) to transfer technology in mine design, engineering, and
construction, specifically the highly productive mechanized
longwall exploitation technology;
(c) to introduce modern coal processing technology which would
facilitate improvements in the quality of coal provided to
quality discriminating consumers and encourage economic use of
middling and fine coal in nearby power plants;
(d) to foster improved management techniques for project scheduling,
monitoring and cost control thereby reducing construction time
and costs.
B.   Summary Description
5.02      Principal features of the proposed project are:
(a) construction and provision of equipment for an undergroui-d mine
with a design capacity of 4 mtpy (actual capacity of 4.5 mtpy.
para. 5.06) consisting of three vertical shafts, 48 km
underground roadways, and six longwall faces;
Cb) construction and provision of equipment for a surface plant and
coal washery with a throughput capacity of 2 mtpy of sized coal;
Cc) provision of surface infrastructure including a railway spur
line, electrical substation, water supply lines, workshops,
warehouses, offices, a hospital, and schools;
(d) technical assistance in project management, design engineering
and procurement;
(e) training both abroad and by foreign experts in China in modern
mining techniques, management and procurement, and the
establishment of mine training centers.
C.   Detailed Features
1.   Mine Development
5.03      Location.  The project is located immediately west of the
existing Wangzhuang and Zhangcun coal mines of Luan CIC (Map IBRD 17500R).
The terrain is flat, averaging 930-950 m above sea level. The temperature
varies from 36.60C in June to -19.6°C in February. The annual rainfall is
a low 600 mm. The area is close to a seismic zone with recorded earthquake
activities.  The adjacent mines are connected to Changzhi 'North station.  A
network of paved roads connects the mine area with the towns of Tunliu and
Changzhi. Since most of Changcun's potential consumers are located within
a radius of 100 km of the proposed mine site, transport is not expected to
pose a problem.



-20-
5.04      Geology and Reserves.  The Changcun mine area covers 83.7 km2.
The area has been explored with 83 boreholes. There are only minor
geological disturbances and the coal seams dip gently at 2-6°. Completed
geological exploration is considered satisfactory for the purpose of
underground mine design and reserve estimation. The entire mine area is
covered by a thick clay (loess) formation. It contains several coal seams,
of which only two are workable. The most consistent and important mineable
coal seam, at a depth of 400 m, is seam No. 3, which is 6 m thick and has
competent roof and floor strata. This seam is being worked successfully in
neighboring mines, one of which has already attained a production level of
2.3 mtpy and is being expanded to 3.0 mtpy (para. 4.05).
5.05      The geological reserves of Changcun are estimated at 881 million
tonnes of which 489 million tonnes are classified as economically
mineable. The No. 3 seam alone has a mineable reserve of 413 million
tonnes. The mineable reserves have been estimated in a reliable manner and
are considered adequate for a service life in excess of 80 years. The
in situ coal has a low volatile matter content and is semi-anthracitic in
character. It is very low in sulphur (0.3%) and has a 15% ash content at
7,100 kcalfkg (Annex 12). The coal is suitable for use in chemical,
metallurgical and cement industries, as well as for power generation and
domestic use (para. 4.08).
5.06      Development.  Given its very large reserves and excellent mining
conditions, Changcun has the potential to produce more than the 4.0 mtpy
based on the Chinese design parameter of 300 mine operating days a year,
or, more realistically, 4.5 mtpy since 350 mine operating days are the
actual industry standard. In preparing the project design, every effort
has been made to mechanize mine development in order to increase safety and
reduce the implementation time. Selection of performance targets
consistent with modern equipment has resulted in a reduction of the
preparation time from 24 to 18 months and the mine development time from 85
to 72 months.
5.07      According to the feasibility study prepared by the China Coal
Mine Design and Consulting Company (CCDCC) and Montan Consulting (MC;
FR Germany), miae access will be through three 450 m vertical shafts.
Initial pilot drilling has indicated that the aquifers in the overlying
clay (para. 5.04) will not interfere unduly with sinking. About 6 km of
roadway in rock and 42 km in coal will be ultimately required. For the
first 42 years of the mine life, only No. 3 seam will be worked. The seam
will be worked in descending slices by a fully mechanized longwall retreat
system (Annex 13). The mechanized faces will be 185 m long and equipped
with locally-produced heavy duty hydraulic shield supports and imported
shearers, armoured face conveyors, and stage loaders to ensure high
production rates. After laying out the mechanized panels there will be
small areas left in the mine which will be worked by conventional longwall
faces with local equipment. There will be five fully mechanized (4.5
working, 0.5 on standby) and three conventional faces (two working). The
first mechanized longwall face is expected to be commissioned in April 1990
and the last one 21 months thereafter (Annex 15). Coal production is
expected to start in 1988 and reach full capacity in 1994. Usually it
takes 3 to 4 years or even longer to reach the design production capacity



-21-
in such a large mine in China. Judging by Luan CIC's past performance,
high production rates comparable to Western industrialized countries can be
expected from these mechanized faces (para. 4.07), resulting in overall
productivity of 4.8 t/MS, since the whole mine and its ancillaries are
designed around these highly productive units. If the length of longwall
faces were increased by 15-20%, comparable to the standards in West
European countries, it could reduce the number of longwall faces from eight
to six (five mechanized and one conventional) and result in savings in
equipment cost and construction time. On the basis of careful analysis,
the MOCI has agreed to this revision, which would be incorporated into the
project design at the detailed engineering stage.
2.   Surface Plant and Coal Washery
5.08      The surface plant layout is designed to accommodate coal flow to
the washery and to the coal loadout systems.  The seismic nature of the
area (para. 5.03) dictated floor-mounted friction hoists for the shafts
instead of the usual tower-mounted machines.
5.09      Although the in situ coal contains only 15% ash, past experience
has shown that ROM production will have closer to 23% ash (Annex 12), and
washing of about 50% of total output is required to satisfy consumer
needs. Washability and screening tests (Annex 12) indicate that the lump
coal is easily washable, whereas fine coals are only moderately so. Since
fine coals already contain low ash, it has been decided to separate these
by screening and supply them raw to the power stations. Only the lump
fraction containing much higher ash (28.5%) will be washed. There will be
three washed products, clean, middling and reject. The process water will
be deslimed in outdoor gravity settling tanks and the clarified water will
be recycled. The fines will be dried and mixed with middling for supply to
power stations. The clean coal will be screened into different sized
products according to market demand. The plant will have a design
throughput capacity of 2 mtpy of sized coal or 500 tonnes per hour.
3.   Infrastructure Development
5.10      Railways.  The Vangzhuang mine located immediately east of
Changcun is already connected to Changzhi North railway station by a 14 km
long mine-owned railway line. This station lies on the Taiyuan-Jiaozuo
trunk line. Another 8 km long spur line to be constructed under this
project will connect it to Changcun.
5.11      Power.  The coal mines in the area are served by a 220 KV power
grid from a regional substation at Changzhi which receives the power from a
400 MW power station at Huo Xian (distance 120 km). The project will
provide at Changcun a new 2x50 MVA substation to meet the full demand of
all Luan mines. Transmission lines have already been completed and an
agreement signed with the power supply authorities. In addition, two new
100 MW generating units (out of 800 MW) are expected to be commissioned at
Zhangzhe (13 km) during 1984. However, despite this favorable power supply
picture, because of psst coordination problems between the Ministry of



-22-
Power and MOCI (para. 3.26), assurances were obtained from the Government
that the project will be provided with sufficient electric power for its
operation.
5.12      Water Suppl. The total water requirement of Changcun is
estimated at 10,600 m per day, of which 30% will be required for the coal
washing plant and the balance for consumption at the mine and township.
The area suffers from low rainfall and there is a general scarcity of
water. During the initial period of project construction, the main source
of water supply will be the nearby Jianghe river and ground water
boreholes. The project will provide additional water supply lines to meet
the increased demands of the mine under full production. Underground
drainage water will be suitably treated and made potable for domestic use.
5.13      Ancillary Facilities.  The project will have other regular
infrastructure facilities like workshops, stores, offices, canteens,
pithead bath, housing, education and recreational centers.
D. Manpower and Productivity
5.14      Most workers will be recruited locally, or transferred from other
Luan CIC mines, and some of the skilled personnel will be available from
neighboring CMAs and CICs.  Administrative, managerial and technical staff
are to be assigned by MOCI and the PCB on Luan CIC's request and
recommendation. New recruits will be trained in phases (para. 4.04) to
match with operational requirements. The manpower requirement at design
capacity is estimated below.
Changcun Project - Manpower Requirements
Preparation
Mine       Plant
Managerial and Supervisory Staff        303        16
Service Personnel                      434         31
Surface Workers                        917        196
Underground Workers                  2,150         -
Total                             3,804 -    243
5.15      Overall underground productivity is expected to be 4.8 t/MS,
commensurate with the high level of mechanization and the high degree of
productivity the Chinese have already demonstrated in similar individual
longwall faces elsewhere in China (e.g., Datong and Kailuan CMAs) and, more
importantly, at Luan CIC itself.  Although this figure is twice as high as
the productivity presently achieved at Luan CIC, and four times as high as
the Chinese average (para. 4.07), it should be stressed that this is the
first large mine completely engineered around the requirements of the very
efficient mechanized longwall system, with which, as a unit, the Chinese
are familiar. Similar mines in the UK or FR Germany are designed for
productivities between 8-10 t/MS, which makes the Changcun figure look



-23-
rather conservative. Though the manpower planning has been done carefully,
allowance has been made for the deployment of some additional workers, as
per Chinese practice. Therefore, it would be more realistic to expect an
overall productivity of 4.0 t/MS.
5.16      Since the productivity figures serve as a iteasuring stick and
proxy for the efficient utilization of manpower, equipment and, therefore,
the capital investment, assurances were obtained that Luan CIC would
operate the Changcun mine with a target production level of not less than
4.0 mtpy and at an overall target productivity of 4.0 t/MS after the 9th
year from the beginning of mine development.
E.   Marketing
5.17      Since MOCI coal is allocated to consumers on the basis of yearly
plans, it is not possible for Luan CIC to define with precision what
markets the coal project will be serving. However, based on long-range
planning and coordination with user sectors and taking into account the
project's impact on washed coal availability (Annex 16), the central and
provincial authorities have provided a profile of potential clients.
According to this profile, the principal consumers will be power stations
located in the vicinity of the mine (providing also an outlet for middlings
produced during washing), household consumers in nearby provinces (with
coal being distributed by fuel companies), and a large local fertilizer
plant. Given current coal shortages and anticipated increases in demand,
absorption of the project's output is not expected to be a problem.
F.   Safety and Environment
5.18      "Safety Regulations for Coal Mines- issued by MOCI, provides
controls on mine safety.  In accordaace with these regulations, the Luan
CIC over the last decade has implemented an extensive safety organization
and training program. Though the results are impressive-e.g., the fatal
accident rate was reduced by 75% between 1978 and 1982-present figures are
still relatively high when compared with selected industrial countries
(Annex 17). This is mainly attributable to Luan CIC's relatively low
degree of mechanization and also to weakness in modern safety management
techniques. Because of its high degree of mechanization, the project will
lead naturally to improved safety conditions, but, in order to reinforce
Luan CIC's efforts, the proposed technical assistance and training program
gives strong emphasis to mine safety from both design and management
standpoints. In terms of sanitation and industrial hygiene, Luan CIC
standards are good. Although workers' living conditions are spartan by
Western standards, drinking water supply, sanitary facilities, sewage and
industrial effluent disposal are adequate. Health services are good and
all workers are given bi-annual medical check-ups. In order to satisfy the
Bank of the adequacy of safety measures and measures to control the
incidence of silicosis and other occupational diseases, assurances were
obtained that Luan CIC will make available to the Bank for comments
beginning January 1, 1986, reports a) every six months, on mine-related
accidents statistics, and b) annually, on all occupationally-related
diseases statistcs.



-24-
5.19      Changcun has preliminarily been classified by the Shanxi Design
Institute as a highly gassy mine, although the adjacent mines do not have
such a record. The overlying clay beds are known to contain some aquifers
but they are separated from the coal seams by impervious strata. The
strata underlying the coal seams also contain some aquifers but they have
so far posed no hazard to the existing mines. Assurances were obtained
that as soon as the mine workings first encounter the coal seam, gas
emission will be measured in accordance with standard procedure and all
steps taken to prevent any ignition or explosion of gas. Assurances were
also obtained that further hydrogeological investigations will be conducted
during mine development and steps taken to prevent any accidental inrush of
water.
5.20      Environmental hazards associated with the development of the
Changcun mine are (i) mine and washing plant water effluents, (ii) rock
waste disposal, and (iii) land subsidence. It has been proposed that the
mine water will be suitably treated and used for domestic and industrial
purposes (para. 5.12). The washing plant design provides for settling
tank, clarifier and recycling of water. The waste dumps and land affected
by mining subsidence will be reclaimed and revegetated. Compensation will
be paid for all damage to land users. Assurances were obtained that all
effluents will be monitored in accordance with standards acceptable to the
Bank for water quality and corrective actions taken to ensure that such
effluents meet these standards. Assurances were also obtained that Luan
CIC will present the Bank for comments, not later than December 31, 1986, a
comprehensive reclamation plan for waste dumps and subsidence areas and
take steps for its implementation.
G. Technical Assistance and Training
5.21      Although Luan CIC has had previous experience in project
implementation and there is a nucleus of good and experienced engineers and
planners, their expertise in project management aspects, such as cost
control, scheduling and monitoring, is weak. It has therefore been agreed
to strengthen these skills and train Chinese managers with the assistance
of foreign management consultants. Managers from the nearby Chengzhuang
mine will participate in this training program for greater cost-
effectiveness.
5.22      The Shanxi Design Institute is being provided with design and
technical control assistance during the ongoing detailed engineering phase,
which is funded by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ-FR
Germany), and follow-up assistance by the Bank. In order to strengthen the
technical capabilities of construction personnel, foreign technical
assistance will be provided during the construction phase in technology and
organization of rapid underground excavations, including operator training.
5.23      In order to provide Luan CIC with trained personnel to operate
the Changcun mine, a training center will be established, geared to the
application of modern techniques, both from a technical and managerial



-25-
aspects, to be integrated in Luan CIC's existing training facilities
(para. 4.04). For this purpose, it is envisaged to make use of an
established training center overseas, which specializes in mechanized
longwall mining. Chinese instructors will be trained abroad, and foreign
trainers will assist in setting up the center in China. Mine safety
components will be emphasized during training both in the managerial as
well as the operational and training aspects. This is considered necessary
to assist Luan CIC to further improve its safety record. A similar program
will be implemented at Chengzhuang.
5.24      Altogether, the project will provide about 281 man-months (of
which 221 is for Changcun and the balance for Chengzhuang) of short-term
foreign consultant services to assist the CIC staff in these two projects.
About 463 man-months of overseas training and study tours for mine
personnel of both Luan CIC and Jincheng CMA will supplement the training
provided by foreign consultants in China. Assurances were obtained that
overseas training and technical assistance will be carried out according to
a program acceptable to the Bank.
5.25      The cost of technical assistance program, including preparation
of feasibility studies of US$1 million, has been estimated at US$5.2
million for Changcun and US$2.3 million for Chengzhuang. A detailed
description of the future program is given in Annex 18. This program has
been agreed in principle with the Government. The project management
assistance is considered the most far reaching, for which the terms of
reference and a short list of consultants have been agreed upon, and
invitation for proposals have been issued on November 1984. Assurances
were obtained that these consultants are hired prior to May 31, 1985.
Project preparation has been partly financed by a grant from UNDP (US$0.4
million) and from the FR Germany (US$0.6 million equivalent). Funding for
assistance during project implementation (US$1.3 million equivalent) is
being provided by the latter source (para. 5.29).
H.   Project Costs
5.26      The estimated cost of the project is summarized in the table
overleaf. The base cost estimates are in January 1985 prices. Physical
contingencies are calculated at 10% for foreign costs and at 15% for local
costs. For the calculation of price contingencies, it is assumed that
exchange rate adjustments will, on average, be made to maintain -purchasing
power parity". On this basis, price escalations for both foreign and local
costs are calculated on the basis of the following assumptions: (a) when
expressed in US dollars, they are based on expected international inflation
rate of 8% in 1985, 9% in 1986-1988, 7.5% in 1989 and 6% in 1990 and
thereafter; (b) when expressed in Yuan, they are based on expected domestic
inflation rate of 3% per annum.

a/  Base cost and physical contingency (in January 1985 prices) have been
calculated usiag an exchange rate of Yuan 2.80 = US$1.0C.
Note: 1. The Project is exempted from import taxes and duties.
2. Base cost component of foreign cost: direct 81%, indirect 19%.
5.27      Capital cost estimates were prepared by CCDCC and MC.  For local
costs, the estimates were prepared on the basis of prevailing rules and
regulations, and, for foreign costs, on basis of the CIF cost of imported
equipment as quoted by MC. The estimates were reviewed by the Bank in
February/March 1984 and updated in January 1985, and are considered to be
reliable. Preoperating costs, including purchase of land, project design
cost, and welfare expenditures for construction workers, have been set
according to MOCI's estimates. The estimated working capital is based on
financial projection and pricing assumptions discussed in Annex 23.



-27-
5.28      The total capital cost for the project, including physical
contingencies but excluding price escalation, working capital, and interest
charges during construction, is about US$53 per tonne actual capacity.
This compares with average Chinese investment costs of about US$40-45 per
tonne (para. 3.08). The project's per tonne cost looks more favorable when
account is taken of the fact that the project's washing facilities are much
larger than average in the country with the difference representing
somewhat in excess of US$5 per tonne. The national average also includes a
number of smaller mines which have significantly lower investment costs (as
low as US$20 per tonne), but also, in general, a much shorter life (in most
cases only about 5 years). Also included are mine developments in coal
deficient regions of the country where investment costs can be over US$100
per tonne. The capital cost for Changcun is also low by international
standards, for the most part because of superior geological conditions and
low wages. In developing countries, the cost of new underground mines
generally averages over US$100 per tonne of capacity.3/ Similar high
costs are observed in the case of European coal producers.  In the case of
low cost producers with export capacities such as the USA, Australia, and
South Africa, the capital costs for -greenfield' projects are rarely lower
than Changcun's.
I.   Financing Plan

Total financing required is US$357.0 million of which US$191.5 million or
54% constitutes the direct and indirect foreign exchange component.
US$128.3 million of this amount (proposed for Bank financing plus grants
from UNDP and FR Germany) constitutes the total direct foreign installed
cost and covers 67% of total foreign exchange or 36% of total project cost.
3/ According to the Bank staff estimates. New underground mines would
cost on the order of USS120 per tonne in Brazil and Argentina, US$100
per tonne in Mexico, and US$150 per tonne in Pakistan.



-28-
The proposed Bank loan would be made to China at the standard IBRD variable
interest rate for a 20-year term including a 5-year grace period, and a
commitment fee of 0.75%. GOC would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to
Luan CIC under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term including 5
years of grace and an interest rate of 8% p.a. Luan CIC would bear the
foreign exchange risk (between the dollar and the Borrower's currency). A
project agreement will be signed between the Bank and Luan CIC for carrying
out the project except for the Jincheng technical assistance and training
components (paras. 5.21 and 5.23) which will be MOCI's responsibility.
Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between GOC and Luan CIC and
approval of the loan agreement by the State Council will be a condition of
loan effectiveness.
5.30      The GOC would cover all local costs together with indirect
foreign costs in the form of equity contribution. Although SPC has
recently decided to pass GOC funds as loans in the future, the MOCI would
most likely continue obtaining investment funds as contribution until coal
prices are substantially raised. The People's Bank will provide working
capital in the form of a short-term loan at the interest rate of 7.2% per
annum. The GOC would finance interest on the subsidiary loan during the
construction period but Luan CIC would repay the corresponding amount to
the GOC after the project goes into operation. During negotiations,
agreement has been reached with the Government on the financing plan and on
provision of timely and sufficient funds to cover all expenditures required
for the project including any cost overruns.
J.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.31      Procurement.  In accordance with the Chinese allocation system
(para. 3.03), key or strategic materials, mainly steel, cement and timber,
are allocated centrally, whereas stone, aggregates, brick etc. are
allocated on the provincial level. For major equipment and fabricated
materials the same allocation system applies and annual requirement
applications have to be made to the SPC and the State Allocation Bureau in
advance. Mining equipment produced in plants owned by MOCI (para. 3.13)
is, in general, also allocated to the CMAs and CICs. However, in line with
the recently introduced policy of economic responsibility, the equipment
plants and CICs have been given some leeway to negotiate as to type of
equipment, deliveries and price. The procurement of imported equipment is
handled centrally through CNCDC and The China National Technical Import
Corporation (CNTIC), normally through an extensive negotiating process with
suppliers and only recently through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
for Bank projects. Strategic bulk materials (e.g., steel, timber, cement)
are procured centrally and then allocated. Civil and mine development
works are executed by various construction companies directly operating
under MOCI.



-29-
5.32      Procurement of Bank-financed goods will be by ICB in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Out of a total estimate of 22 packages (16 ICB and 6
Limited International Bidding (LIB)) there are 5 exceeding US$5.0 million
each in value, requiring special Bank review (list of main items are given
in Annex 19). Packages not exceeding US$350,000 and up to an aggregate
value of US$6.7 million will be procured by LIB from at least 4 suppliers
and at least 3 different countries. The first 5 ICB and 2 LIB packages to
be issued, regardless of value, and thereafter only packages exceeding an
estimated value of US$2.0 million will be pre-reviewed by the Bank. This
constitutes over 94% of the value of all goods financed out of the loan,
the balance being subject to post-review. All Bank financed consulting and
training services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines. It
is anticipated that some construction equipment and consulting services
will need to be procured prior to loan effectiveness (the first bids were
issued in October 1984). It is recommended to retroactively finance
procurement of such goods and services up to an aggregate amount of US$6.0
million committed between December 1, 1984 and the loan signature date.
5.33      Details of procurement of goods and services are shown in the
table below:

foreign cost of directly imported goods or 100% of ex-factory items and (b)
100% of technical assistance and training costs. A special account will be
established under the project with an authorized allocation of US$2
million. Disbursement would be against full documentation except for
overseas training or any other contracts not exceeding US$50,000 which
would be against Statement of Expenditures. The disbursement schedule has



-30-
been prepared on the basis of the following payment schedule: (a) 15% of
total costs at the time of placement of orders; (b) 75% at delivery; and
(c) 10% after installation and satisfactory test. Comparisons were made
with disbursement profiles of industrial projects completed (a) in the
Region; and (b) Bankwide (Annex 20). The estimated disbursement figures
are slightly lower than those profiles because of the long gestation
period. The Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 1991; the
loan closing date shall be June 30, 1992.
K.   Project Management and Implementation
5.35      Project Organization.  The MOCI will have primary responsibility
for the proposed project. Interagency coordination within the ministry is
provided by a newly established Priority Project Coordination Committee
(PPCC) with representatives drawn from the directors level of all relevant
departments. The committee is responsible for dealing directly with the
CIC and all the provincial and central government entities involved in the
project. The committee will continuously review the work in progress and
take timely action to remove any constraints affecting project
implementation. It has been agreed that a director of CNCDC will be
included among the committee members and that he will be responsible for
liaison between the Bank and PPCC.
5.36      Project implementation is ti.e responsibility of Luan CIC.  This
together with arrangements above sharply departs from past practices where
responsibility was defused among several agencies. For purposes of the
project, Luan CIC has created a Capital Construction Department (CCD). It
is supported by a committee with representatives from Luan CIC,
construction companies and the design institute. CCD is headed by a Deputy
Director (para. 4.02) reporting directly to Luan CIC's Director, and
comprising an initial staff of 56, including 15 engineers and 9 financial
and material procurement personnel. The staffing will increase as the
project progresses. The PCB, acting on behalf of the MOCI, will supervise
project construction. The MOCI Capital Construction and Planning Bureaus
are mainly involved with providing equipment, material and financial
input. The CCD directs and coordinates the construction and erection
contractors and the activities of the Shanxi Design Institute for
engineering work. These contractors are subsidiary organizations of MOCI
and will enter into contractual agreements with Luan CIC, which in turn
will enter into a contract with the PCB for supply of local materials and
funds. Foreign procurement is carried out by CNTIC, an agency under the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) in close
collaboration with CNCDC. Details of the interrelationship of governmental
entities involved in project execution are given in Annex 21.
5.37      Project Status.  Formal SPC approval of the Project was given in
November 1983. In the meantime, CNTIC was reorganized and a new department
created to deal exclusively and more efficiently with World Bank
procurement. A general procurement notice for this project was published
early in 1984, and the first invitations to bid for initial equipment
packages were issued in October 1984. The basic engineering carried out by



-31-
the CCDCC's Shanxi Design Institute with the assistance of Montan
Consulting, is complete and the detailed design engineering for bid
specifications is underway.
5.38      Implementation Schedule.  The preparatory work for shaft sinking,
including shaft pilot hole drilling, site preparation and levelling started
in January, 1984. These preparatory activities, originally estimated to
last 12 months up to the start of shaft sinking, have suffered a slippage
of nine months due to insufficient allocation of funds in 1984, because of
the uncertainty surrounding the coal pricing issue and the Bank financing
of the project. The above uncertainty was also the major contributing
factor in the delay in preparation of bidding documents. The new envisaged
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 15. Shaft sinking, to be started
by mid-1985, will be completed by late 1988. Underground development will
start in 1987 and be sufficiently advanced to permit coal production from
the first mechanized longwall face by 1990, aud the last longwall face by
late 1991. The physical project completion is expected by December 1991.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govermment and Luan
CIC that they will furnish to the Bank at regular intervals project
progress reports and, within six months after the project completion date,
a project completion report.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Luan CIC
.  Changcun
6.01      Financial projections for Luan CIC have been made in current yuan
based on (i) capital and operating cost estimates prepared by MOCI and
reviewed and updated by the Bank in September 1984 and January 1985; (ii)
an increase in the price of project coal of about 86% in real terms by the
year 1990; and (iii) actual production capacity of 4.5 mtpy. The
projections assume the inflation rate discussed in para. 5.26.
6.02      Production and Sales Volume.  Production at Changcun is expected
to start on July 1, 1990, with 0.3 million tonnes and to reach full actual
capacity of 4.5 mtpy by 1994. During the construction period itself
production is expected to total about 0.4 million tonnes. Sales, which
account for washery losses, are forecast to reach 4.16 mtpy in 1994.
Projected production and sales are summarized in the table below:

6.03       Production and Sales Mix.  Output from the project is expected to
be sold exclusively in the domestic market. The fine coal will be
delivered to power plants, and the lump coal will be used mainly by the
chemical industry. Projected product mix at design capacity and applicable
1983 prices (Annex 11) are presented in the following table:

6.04       Coal Price Adjustment.  The weighted average price for Luan CIC
is about Yuan 26.3 per tonne. It was assumed that by 1990 average coal
prices would have risen to the level of LRMC (para. 3.17). The price
projection in table below reflects for the first few years the price
measures taken recently (or to be taken in 1985) by the GOC, and later an
approximation to LRMC in line with the GOC's coal price policies. The more
immediate price measures include:  (a) a 50% premium for above-quota
production for all CMAs and CICs; (b) price adjustments for type, grade,
and quality of coal; and (c) allowance for freely negotiated prices for
above-plan production. In particular, Changcun's prices, which on the
basis of the present price structure would be about 10% lower than the
average for Luan CIC as a whole, are assumed to increase to that level on
account of adjustments to the price structure.

6.05       Operating Costs.  Operating costs for Changcun were developed by
CCDCC on the basis of the production technology employed, cakiog Into
account regulations prevailing in Luan CIC. The estimate was made in
mid-1983 real terms and reviewed by the Bank in February, 1984 and updated
in September 1984 and January 1985. The table below gives estimated
operating costs in 1983 real terms on the basis of actual capacity of 4.5
mtpy for the project until 1993.

Total                 17.03  16.07  17.58  16.65
Variable costs are estimated at Yuan 12.0 per tonne or about 70% of total
operating costs at full production. Considering the learning c-urve during
start-up, which will result in lower productivity and larger consumption of
material, labor, and electricity, the variable unit costs (excluding
replacement fee) were increased during the first three years of production
by 30%, 20% and 10% respectively.
6.06      Material costs were estimated taking into account consumption
figures at the Wangzhuang mine, where the geological conditions and
mechanization level are basically similar to those at Changcun. Wages were
estimated using the prevailing regulation and requirements for each
operation. Maintenance costs were calculated at 2.5Z of the total capital
costs, as determined by the MOCI. Administrative costs were based on Luan
CIC's experience while replacement fees were determined following
nationwide experience. These constitute a sound base for projecting
operating costs.
2.   Existing Operations
6.07      Investment Plan.  Luan CIC's investments have been derived from
the current Five-Year Plan. On-going investments, mainly for expansion of
existing mines and washery and for development of related infrastructure,
will increase fixed assets by about Yuan 237 million (1983 terms) and
production capacity to about 7 million tonnes ROM coal by 1988. Major
expansion programs (at the Wuyang, Zhangshu and Wangzhuang mines) have been
approved by the SPC; funds will be provided through budgetary allocations.
Considering past experience of expansion and the level of technology
introduced, these investments are expected to be managed effectively by
Luan CIC in parallel with the Changcun ;-roject. Yearly allocations of
investmeat funds (outside the Changcun project) for the period 1984 through
1988 are summarized below. Wangzhuang accounts for 63% of total investment
for expansion followed by Zhangshu 22%, Wuyang 15% and Shigejie 2%.

6.08      Production Volume.  Production from Luan CIC's existing
operations is projected to increase from 5.8 mtpy in 1984 to 7.2 mtpy in
1988. This increase of 1.4 million tonnes is the expected result of Luan
CIC's current expansion programs, particularly the development of two
additional, fully-mechanized longwall faces at the Wangzhuang mine. The
proposed production plan is considered attainable. Projected production by
each mine from 1984-88 is given below.

6.09      Coal Price.  The average price of Luan CIC coal (all qualities
included) was Yuan 26.3 per tonne in 1983.  Type, specification, and price
of coal produced by each mine are given in Annex 22. As the coal mix is
not estimated to change, the 1983 unit price has been escalated by the same
percentage as Changcun coal (para. 6.04).
6.10      Operating Cost.  The weighted average unit cost of production for
the four mines was Yuan 16.1/tonne in 1983. Operating costs are not
expected to change in real terms after expansion.
B.   Financial Projections
6.11      Detailed financial projections have bee.x prepared for (i) Luan
CIC consolidated with the Changcun Project; and (ii) the Changcun Project
alone, based on assumptions given in Annex 23. Major assumptions were
that:



-35-
(a)  Government funds for the project and existing operations will be
provided as equity contributions until the year 1989, and
thereafter as loans to reflect economic reforms;
(b)  replacement fees will be used exclusively for replacement, with
shortfall of replacement funds being covered by MOCI;
(c)  taxes paid to GOC by Luan CIC will be 85% of consolidated income
before tax less loan repayment; and
(d)  interest during construction financed by GOC would be repaid by
Luan CIC after the project goes into production (para 5.30).
The US$1.7 million of the Bank loan to cover technical assistance for
Chengzhiang has been excluded from the financial analysis.
6.12       The financial projections for Luan CIC (as a whole) and Changcun
alone up to the year 1994 (the first year at full production) are
summarized below (details in Annexes 24 and 25):

6.13      Luau CIC Consolidated.  The financial projections indicate that
Luan may be expected to maintain its present sound financial position
throughout the Changcun construction and start-up period. The main factors
contributing to Luan CIC's satisfactory financial prospects through 1989
are:
(a)  substantial price increases (para. 6.04);
(b) an increase in sales from 5.8 to 7.4 mtpy between 1984 and 1989;
(c)  absence of significant long-term debt at present (para. 4.16);
and
(d) availability of local funds through GOC's equity contributions
(para. 5.30).
From 1990 on, with Changeun coming on-stream, Luan CIC's production volume
will be more than doubled compared to 1983. Sales revenue in 1994 is
projected at Yuan 710 million as compared to Yuan 165 million in 1983. The
rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in service is calculated at
21%, which is identical with the return in 1983. This indicates that the
assumed price adjustment is necessary for Luan CIC to maintain present
financial profitability.
6.14      Luan CIC's financial ratios remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period. The debt/equity ratio is not projected to become greater
than 28:72, nor the current ratio to drop below 1.3. On the basis of the
prevailing taxation system, Luan CIC is expected to generate a sufficient
cash flow to meet repayment of the Bank loan. The debt service coverage is
expected to be 2.2 or higher.
6.15      The profit retention system by which 85% of all cash generated by
Luan CIC was remitted to the State while the State financed almost all
investments, has proven highly profitable to the State through 1983 (para.
4.14). As indicated below, this situation is expected to continue; despite
the heavy construction program and Changcun's long gestation period
undertaken by Luan CIC, the net flow of funds to the State becomes positive
in 1989 on an annual basis and in 1990 on a cumulative basis.

6.16      Changcun.  Separate financial projections have been established
for the Changcun Project (Annex 25). The projections show net profit after
taxes of Yuan 26.1 million, Yuan 45.4 million, Yuan 53.6 million, and
Yuan 56.5 million for 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 respectively. This is the
result of a steady buildup of production and again, substantial coal price
adjustments. The financial projections indicate that the Project would
face a small shortfall of cash in the year 1990 due to commencement of
repayment for the subsidiary loan. But this cash deficit is projected to
be covered by cash generated by Luan CIC's existing operations. The
internal cash generation from 1991 onward will be sufficient to cover debt
service.
C.   Financial and Efficiency Covenants
6.17      While it is reasonable to project a satisfactory financial
performance for Luan CIC, there are several uncertainties that could have
an adverse effect on performance. Among them operating efficiency stands
out. Therefore, in order to establish physical efficiency targets
applicable in the Chinese context, assurances were obtained relating to the
scale of production and manpower productivity (para. 5.16). Also, in the
course of current economic reforms, the COC could conceivably change
relative prices of outputs and inputs, change financing terms for
investment and replacement funds, or raise taxes. Therefore, the Bank
obtained assurances from Luan CIC relating to its financial performance,
debt and investment outlays as set out below:
(a) By October 31 each year, Luan CIC will submit to the Bank for
comments its financial targets. It will take all such measures
as will be required to produce gross revenues from all sources
equivalent to not less than its total operating expenses.  The
"total operating expenses' have been defined as the sum of all
expenses related to Luan CIC's operations, including maintenance,
administration, replacement fee, interest and other charges on
debt, repayment of loans, taxes, allocations to special funds and
other cash distributions and outflows;
(b) By October 31 of each year, Luan CIC will furnish to the Bank for
review its five year rolling investment plan;
(c) Luan CIC may not incur any long-term debt if the projected
internal cash generation for each year during the term of the
debt to be incurred will be less than 1.2 times the projected
debt service requirement in such years. For this purpose, the
term -internal cash generation- means gross revenues of Luan CIC
from all sources less all operating expenses, including expenses
accountable to administration, maintenance and taxes, but before
interest and other charges on debt, repayment of loans, and
allocation to special funds. The term 'debt service requirement'
means the aggregate amount of amortization (including sinking
fund payments, if any) of, and interest and other charges, on
debt.

D. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
6.18      Financial Rate of Return.  The financial rate of return for the
project has been calculated in real terms. The financial streams include
(i) "benefit" defined as sales revenue net of conmercial tax, and (ii)
.cost' defined as investment costs, recurrent costs (operating costs,
non-business expenditure and increase in working capital), and replacement
costs. The replacement fee was not included to avoid double counting of
replacement costs. Cost and benefit streams are given in Annex 26. Based
on these assumptions, the financial rate of return of the Project is about
9%.
6.19      Sensitivity Tests.  The tests below show that the rate of return
is most sensitive to changes in sales revenue and coal prices, but also to

1.  Base Case                                          8.7
2. Production down 10%                                 7.3
3.  Price increase variations
(a)  10% up in real terms                         10.3
(b) 20% up in real terms                          11.8
(c)  10% down in real terms                        6.8
(d)  20% down in real terms                        4.8
(e)  No increase in current terms
from 1991 onwards                             4.8
4.  Capital costs up 10%                                7.6
5.  Capital costs down 10%                             9.7
6.  Operating costs up 10%                             8.0
7.  Operating costs down IO                            9.2
8.  Project delay of 1 year                             6.8
9.  Project delay of 2 years                           5.4
6.20      Of the various factors used in the sensitivity tests, the project
is most sensitive to coal pricing and project delav.  The tests indicate
that the project would not render a sufficient rate of return unless the
coal price is raised to the level of LRMC (Case 3(c) and 3(d)). The tests
also indicate that the coal price should at least remain constant in real
terms from 1991 onwards. With no coal price increase (in current terms)
from 1991 onwards, the rate substantially drops to 4.8% (Case 3(e)). The
project delay is as sensitive as coal price. Should the project be delayed
by 2 years, the rate of return drops to 5.4% (Case 9). Increase in capital
and operating costs are less likely, given the Chinese extensive experience
in existing operations. Also, the estimates were carefully prepared by
CCDCC and MC and reviewed by the Bank.

E.   Project Risks
6.21      The project faces no higher technical risks than those normally
associated with underground coal mining, including safety and environmental
aspects.  All project activities involve proven technology that has been in
regular use in the industrialized world and, in part, also in China. On
the other hand, although the country has developed many large mines,
construction has generally been slow. The main risks lie in the
possibility of time and cost overruns and shortfall in overall
productivity. These risks are being minimized by the training and
technical assistance schemes to strengthen project management, including
scheduling and monitoring and cost control capabilities (paras. 5.21 and
5.22). Another major risk lies in coal price increases. Since coal prices
are the least in Luan CIC's domain of control, the Bank should closely
monitor the GOC's action to move towards LRMC by the year 1990 and to
maintain that level in real terms thereafter (para. 3.17).
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      The project is an important element in the Government's policy to
increase output to 1,200 mtpy by the year 2000. Major benefits resulting
from development of the Changcun mine are: (i) increased availability of
high quality coal, presently in short supply, (ii) transfer of technology
to and managerial/financial strengthening of Luan CIC and other agencies
responsible for mine development, and (iii) increased employment
opportunities and other social welfare improvements in southeast Shanxi.
A.   Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
7.02      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project has been
calculated in real terms on the basis of the streams given in Annex 27.
The economic cost and benefit streams have been based on the same
assumptions used for the financial rate of return, except for (i) exclusion
of all identifiable taxes; and (ii) the use of shadow prices for output and
inputs to reflect the opportunity costs to the economy.
7.03      For the purpose of the economic evaluation, project revenues have
been calculated on the basis of projected mine-mouth FOB export prices of
Changcun coal. This accourts for the fact that Chinese coal is a traded
commodity and that the Changcun coal is on the margin exportable. This is
a conservative assumption. Indeed, although China is likely to remain a
small net exporter of coal, in the future, intermittent net imports are not
ruled out, so that the economic value of coal for China during the life of
the project might at times be represented by the higher cost of importing
coal. Mine-mouth export prices (i.e. FOB prices minus transport to port
and loading costs) are projected on basis of the latest Bank estimate
(Annex 28). No premium for anthracite over steam coal have been projected
for this purpose because; given the small size of the international
anthracite coal market (Annex 1), exporting the project's output would tend



-40-
to drive international anthracite prices down to those of steam coal.
Other shadow prices are calculated on the basis of a series of conversion
factors which are in line with those used in the evaluation of other
projects in China (Annex 28). The full cost of housing and social services
financed under the project have been included in the ERR calculations;
these are an integral part of workers' remuneration. The economic rate of
return is about 21%.
7.04      Sensitivity Tests.  These tests are summarized below.
Changcun Project - Sensitivity Tests on Economic Rate of Return
1.  Base Case                        21.0
2.  Sales Revenue up 10%             22.7
3.  Sales Revenue down 10%           19.1
4.  Sales Revenue up 20%             24.5
5.  Sales Revenue down 20%           17.0
6.  Capital Cost up 10%              19.6
7.  Capital Cost down 10%            22.6
8.  Operating Cost up 10%            20.6
9.  Operating Cost down 10%          21.3
10.  Project Delay of 1 year          17.7
11.  Project Delay of 2 years         15.0
12. Sales Revenue down 10%
Capital Cost up 10%
Operating Cost up 10% and        14.5
Project Delay of 1 year
7.05      The ERR is most sensitive to sales revenue and project delay.  A
reduction of sales revenue by 10% and 20% results in a fall in the rate of
return of 1.9 and 4.0 percentage points respectively.  In the case of a
one-year delay in project execution, the return would drop by 3.3
percentage points. If the project were to be delayed by two years, which
would place it at about average in terms of construction time for coal
projects in China over the last decade, the ERR would be 15%. These tests
show the importance of maintaining the project on schedule.  However, the
project's justification is quite robust overall; even when affected by a
combination of significant cost increases, delays and reduction in revenue
(see Test 12 above), the ERR remains at about 15%. Still, in order to
minimize risks of delays and cost overruns, project management
arrangements, cost estimates and cost control systems have been given
careful attention (para. 5.30). Also, China has had extensive experience
in coal operations for over 40 years. Therefore, the above combination of
negative circumstances is considered unlikely to occur.
B. Project Benefits
7.06      Coal Supply.  The project is well located vis-a-vis China's major
consumption centers. As described in Section III, the country's largest
and lowest-cost extractable coal deposits lie in the north, while the
largest consumption centers lie in the east, with south being particularly
deficient in coal. While transport costs from Shanxi to the coal deficient



-41-
regions to the east and south are high, this disadvantage is more than
offset by Shanxi's very favorable mining conditions and superior coal
quality, factors which have made that province the major focus of current
mine development plans. By the year 2000 Shanxi is expected to supply
one-third of the nation's production or 400 mtpy.
7.07      In the context of Shanxi's coal expansion plans, the project is
of key importance because Luan is close to the southeast edge of Shanxi,
thus relatively well located in relation to the most coal deficient regions
of the country (see Map IBRD 17500R). The project's coal quality is well
above average in the country and of a type (low volatile, smokeless fuel)
which is in short supply nationally (para. 3.07 and 5.05). In particular,
the project's washed coal output will help relieve the pressing needs of
the chemical industries which require low-ash coal and would contribute to
greater efficiency in energy transportation and in energy use.
7.08      Development Model.  The project will help develop a model of the
modern, high output, high productivity, large-scale mining unit which might
eventually be replicated throughout the industry. Specifically, the
project would effect transfer of the highly mechanized longwall
exploitation technology. The project would also introduce new investment
programing and financial control techniques which are expected to lead to
greater efficiency in both mine development and operation.
7.09      Employment and Other Social Benefits.  The project will provide
direct employment for about 3,600 employees and 450 service workers and
will lead to additional employment opportunities thereafter as basic
workers are drawn to the region by a variety of expected mining
developments and other economic opportunities. Urban development in the
region will be accelerated by the project through the development of the
new town of Changcun as well as expansion of existing nearby towns.
C.  Least Cost Development Programs
7.10      The above ERR calculations, by focusing on coal's potential to
generate export revenues focus on coal's potential to generate export
revenues, which represents a lower limit for the estimated value of the
project output to the Chinese economy. The argument is that if China
decides on the margin not to export coal, while there is a market for it at
a certain price, it is because China derives from its consumption a benefit
at least as large as that reflected by the foreign exchange earnings
exports would otherwise generate. ERR so calculated allow for comparisons
with investments in other sectors, but are not sufficient to rank projects
within the coal industry according to their relative economic merits.
Given the small size of exports and the large size of the country, the
focus here has to shift to domestic demand. Since domestic transport costs
are high compared to mining costs (they can even be higher than mining
costs in extreme cases), the merits of a project location in meeting
domestic demand could be quite different from its advantages vis-a-v's
export markets.



-42-
7.11      It is therefore indispensable to relate coal projects to other
investment possibilities in the coal industry, with consideration given
both to mining costs and to transport costs to the main domestic demand
centers. Although precise cialculations are not possible at present,4/ the
project is deemed to be part uf a least cost development program due to:
(a) favorable mining costs (its total economic production costs are
estimated at US$14 per tonne, as compared to LRMC of about US$14-18 per
tonne); (b) favorable location; and (c) favorable coal quality (see Annex
12). In addition, the project will play an important role in introducing
advanced technology in a balanced manner in the exploitation of deposits
where large scale mines are the most economic alternative.
VIII. AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Prior to negotiations the following documents were obtained from
the Government:
(i)   a coal pricing policy statement as agreed between MOF and
the Bank in September 1984, indicating GOC's intention to
move towards LRMC by 1990 and to maintain that level
thereafter in real terms, and confirming that steps in that
direction would be taken in 1985 (paras. 3.17, 6.04);
(ii)   letters of invitation to consultants for submission of
proposals for the project management components of the
technical assistance program, in accordance with Bank
guidelines (para. 5.25) and
8.02      During negotiations the following assurances were obtained:
a.   From the Governament that it will:
Ci)  ensure a sufficient supply of electric power for the
operation of the project (para. 5.11);
(ii)  enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with Luan CIC on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.29);
(iii)  ensure that the financing plan for local and indirect
foreign costs will provide timely and sufficient funds to
cover the expenditures required for the project, including
the necessary local and foreign funds to complete the
project, and to cover any possible cost overruns (para.
5.30);
4/ Even if information on all possible coal investments and consumption
centers were available, a large and complex transport model, seeking to
minimize production and transportation costs in meeting set regional
demands, would be necessary for this purpose.



-43-
(iv)  limit retroactive financing of expenditures incurred between
December 1, 1984 and the loan signing date to an aggregate
amount of US$6.0 million equivalent (para. 5.32); and
(v)  carry out a technical assistance and training program and
establish a mine training center satisfactory to the Bank
for the Chengzhuang (Jincheng) coal mining project (paras.
5.21-5.25).
b.   From Luan CIC that it will:
(i)  furnish to the Bank not later than six months after
the end of each fiscal year annual financial statements for
Luan CIC and the project audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.11);
(ii)  carry out, during the detailed engineering phase, a
geotechnical study with the objective of increasing the
length of the longwall faces to more than 185 m, and to
optimize the mine layout accordingly (para. 5.07);
(iii) set performance targets for the project to be attained
annually in areas of production and productivity, to be not
less than 4.0 mtpy and an overall productivity of 4.0 tonnes
per manshift from the ninth year after the beginning of mine
development (para. 5.16);
(iv)  make available to the Bank a) once every six months,
current accident statistics, and b) annually a report on the
occurrence of silicosis and occupational diseases (para.
5.18);
Cv)  carry out measurements of methane gas emission in a reliable
manner, as soon as mine workings first encounter the coal
seam during development, and take all steps to prevent any
ignition or explosion of gas; conduct further hydrological
investigations during mine development and take all steps to
prevent any accidental inrush of water (para. 5.19);
(vi)  monitor all effluents in accordance with standards
acceptable to the Bank for water quality and take corrective
actions to ensure effluents meet these standards. In
addition, the Luan CIC will present to the Bank, no later
than December 1986, a comprehensive reclamation plan for
waste dumps and subsidence areas (para. 5.20);
(vii) employ consultants satisfactory to the Bank for technical
assistance and training, including hiring of consultants for
the project management program prior to May 31, 1985. Also,
it will carry out a technical assistance and training
program and establish a mine training center satisfactory to
the Bank (paras. 5.21-5.25);



-44-
(viii) furnish and review with the Bank, by October 31, of each
year, documented financial targets for the following year
and that it will take all measures as will be required to
produce gross revenue from all sources to cover its
operating expenditures (para. 6.17(a));
(ix) furnish to the Bank by October 31 of each year for its
review a five year rolling investment plan for Luan CIC and
the project (para. 6.17(b)); and
(x) not incur any long-term debt if the debt service coverage is
projected to be less than 1.2 times (para. 6.17(c)).
8.03      Conditions for effectiveness are:
a)   approval by China's State Council of loan agreement, and
b)   the execution of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and Luau CIC.
8.04      Given the preceding commitments and agreements, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan to the People's Republic of China of US$126.0
million, for a period of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.

CHINA -THE INTERNATIONAL COAL MARKET
A. Bituminous Coal
1.        World production and consumption of coal grew from 1,475 million
toe in 1970 to 1,825 million toe in 1980 - an annual average growth rate of
2.2% as shown below. During this period the overall contribution of coal
to primary energy supply fell from 29% to 27%. For the future, coal has
become more competitive with oil following the large oil price increases of
the 1970s and latest projections indicate that coal will provide 36% of
incremental energy production and consumption from 1980-1995 and will
account for 30% of world energy requirements by 1995 (Table below).

a/  Energy consumption includes bunkers.
b/  Primary electricity comprises electricity generated from hydropower,
nuclear energy or geothermal resources. Primary electricity is
converted into tonnes of oil equivalent at thermal replacement value,
assuming an average conversion efficiency of about 34 percent.
2.        Bituminous coal represents the bulk of the market.  Of total coal
consumption about 65% is thermal coal for power generation, 20% is thermal
coal for industry and commercial/household use (with minor contribution
from anthracite and semi-anthracite and the remaining 15% is metallurgical
coal used for steel making. Coal will continue to be the most important
source of energy for major coal producers with coal based economies, such
as India, USA, USSR, China, South Africa and Australia. It will also
become an important fuel for countries with substantial reserver but
presently low to moderate production, such as Yugoslavia, Turkey and
Colombia.
3.        In 1980, total coal trade was only 8% of total world production.
About three-quarters of the coal traded (180 million tonnes) was coking
coal for steel making purposes and one-quarter (about 60 million tonnes)
was thermal coal for heat or steam generation and cement making. Major
coal importers are industrialized countries such as FR Germany, France,
Italy and Japan. Major exporting countries are Australia, South Africa,
Canada and the USA. It is expected that there will be a significant growth



-46-
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3
in thermal coal trade in the next one to two decades and imported thermal
coal could become an important source of energy for countries which only
have limited or high cost indigenous coal reserves (for example, Brazil and
the Republic of Korea).
4.        International thermal coal prices increased strongly in the mid
to late 1970s and early 1980s when consumers shifted to coal following the
1973 and 1979 oil price hikes. More recently, coal prices have dropped
sharply due to oversupply and depressed demand. There are plentiful
reserves and good long-run supply prospects for coal in Australia, South
Africa, Canada and the United States. The long run marginal cost curve is
considered to be fairly flat and thermal coal prices are not expected to
increase significantly in real terms in the long run. Latest Bank thermal
coal price projections indicate stagnant or falling real prices in the
1980s reflecting excess coal export capacity and an increase of about 1%
per year in real terms over the 1990s; no attempt has been made to project
the timing and amplitude of market cycles.
B.   Anthracite and Semi-Anthracite
5.        Anthracite is a hard, high fixed carbon, low volatile,
low sulphur coal with a relatively high ignition temperature. When
properly burned, anthracite is virtually smokeless and odorless. It is the
highest ranking coal in terms of fixed-carbon content, with less than 10%
volatile matter and a heating value ranging from 6,500-8,500 kcal/kg.
Semi-anthracite (lean coal) possesses either lower calorific value and high
ash or higher volatile matter (10-15%) or higher impurities than "standard'
anthracite.
6.        Anthracite is used primarily for space heating.  The second
largest use is the power sector, comprising anthracite fines or
semi-anthracite not suitable for direct household consumption, where
specially designed boilers are needed since anthracite or semi-anthracite
can rarely be burned in the same combustion facilities as those designed to
burn bituminous coal. Anthracite is also used in the iron and steel
industry in a blend with other coals. Other industrial and commercial uses
include chemical industries, cement and lime burning, brick and tiles,
curing of agricultural products and other applications where clean,
continuous heat is essential. Anthracite is a source of industrial carbon
for the manufacture of carbides, electrodes, water and chemical filters and
purifiers and electrical and electronic equipment.
7.        Anthracite and semi-anthracite mining faces generally difficult
mining conditioas and therefore high cost in the USA, Europe (including the
USSR), Republic of Korea, DPR of Korea, Vietnam and up to some extent in
South Africa. China and Canada, on the other hand, face rather favorable
mining conditions, with anthracite mining costs believed to be similar to
thermal coal mining costs in these two countries. Crude estimates of
typical mining cost for various countries in 1983 are provided below:



-47-
ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 3
Comparison of Cost Estimates of Anthracite Mining
Country or Region                   Mining Costs
(in 1984 US$ per tonre)
China                                    16-20
South Africa                             25-40
Canada                                   30-40
USA                                      40-60
Republic of Korea                        65-75
Western Europe                           60-120
Source: Bank staff estimates.
The above costs do not include transportation charges to domestic consumer
centers or export outlets. These charges are estimated to be low to
moderate (in the US$5-10/tonne range) in China, the Republic of Korea and
South Africa, and moderate to high (US$10-20/tonne) in the USA and Canada.
8.        World Production and Demand.  The USA was traditionally the
largest producer and consumer of anthracite but the availability of cheap
oil and gas for household use since the 1930s and 1940s sharply reduced
consumption of anthracite. In the USA, it fell from 90 million tonnes in
1920 to less than 10 million tonnes in the 1970s. In contrast, production
and consumption of anthracite grew rapidly in the USSR over the 1930-60
period and later in China and the DPR of Korea. The latter three countries
together now represent over 80X of the world anthracite market.
9.        Trade.  Anthracite trade remained at around five million tonnes
per year (including about 1.5 million tonnes of semi-anthracite) during the
first half of the seventies. Although it increased to 12 mtpy in 1979-81
due to a number of singular factors, trade is projected to remain modest
ranging between 7 and 9 mtpy in the mid-1980s and between 6 and 12 mtpy in
the 1990s. China is believed to be in a position to capture about a third
of this market. Given higher production costs, anthracite has enjoyed a
premium over thermal coal of about US$30 in Western Europe and US$10-20 in
Japan. Anthracite is likely to remain a premium material, but semi-
anthracite could gain an additional non-premium market as a substitute for
thermal coal. This market is several times larger, with China also being
in a strong competitive position.

CHINA - CHANGCUN COAL MINING PROJECT
LONG-RUN MARGINAL PRODUCTION COSTS (LRMC)
1.        LRMC for China's coal industry have been calculated using the
average incremental cost (AIC) method. The basis of the calculations are
provided below, and the AIC method is explained in detail at the end of
this Annex.
2.        Coal mining costs vary significantly from mine to mine, except in
the north (particularly the Shanxi province), where regular geological and
mining conditions allow the definition of highly representative mining
models.1/ The bulk of incremental production is planned to be concentrated
in the north. This region possesses the largest reserves of economically
extractable coal in China, and could, from the resource endowment point of
view, in fact supply all of China's incremental coal requirements for at
least 50 years, including anthracite, coking and thermal coals. The table
below prevents the planned development by region of coal production to the
year 2000.

Northeast            99             181             14.1
Northwest            50              85              6.0
East                105             171             11.4
South-Central        96             131             6.4
Southwest            65              82             4.6
Total            620           1,200           100.0
Source: Ministry of Coal Industry and Bank estimates.
3.        The emphasis on the north is justified because of low mining
costs, even when transport cost from the north to other regions are
calculated at opportunity costs (LRMC are estimated at about US¢1/tonne-km
rather than at the lower current railway tariffs of less than US¢0.5/tonne-
km). Also, high production rates will allow for high density transporta-
tion at relatively low cost, which will make coal from the north
increasingly competitive on a delivered basis throughout China. However,
there are still a number of deposits in otber regions that, although
confronting higher mining costs, are still competitive on a delivered
basis.
1/ When all factors are considered, including life of investments, there
is not much difference in AIC between mechanized and non mechanized
mines in Shanxi.

ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2
4.        For the north, there is abundant information on average operating
and capital costs for various types and sizes of mines. Also available are
costs for a series of projects under construction or under design. On this
basis, model mines have been developed, for which LRMC have been
calculated. For incremental production of about 500 mtpy, results fall
between a rather narrow range of about US$14-18 per tonne of coal
produced (in 1984 terms and at an exchange rate of Yuan 2.8 per US$1.00).
This is explained mostly by the fact that smaller mines with lower capital
and operating costs have a significantly shorter life or need to be
reconstructed several times over their life, implying a higher rate of
reinvestment than in the case of larger mines. LRMC in the north are not
expected to increase much over time.
5.        Information for other regions is scarce, but crude LRMC estimates
point to costs being a few dollars per tonne higher in the northwest to as
much as US$5-15 higher in the northeast (on a quality-adjusted basis) and
US$10-20 higher in the south and east. This is why development in the
latter region is going to be very selective despite high transport cost
from, say, Shanxi which can reach US$20 per tonne for coal shipped to
southern China when calculated on the LRMC basis.
6.        The AIC method estimates LRMC by discounting all incremental cost
(capital and operating) which will be incurred in the future to provide the
estimated additional amounts of coal produced over a specified period, and
dividing that by the discounted value of incremental output over the
period, i.e.:
AIC =Present Value of Capital plus Operating Costs Streams
Present Value of Production Stream
7.        There are other methods for calculation of LRMC, but for discrete
investments such as those encountered in coal mining, the AIC method
provides a convenient way of ironing out the lumpyness of investment
projects. The AIC approach is particularly useful for comparison of
investment proposals characterized by widely diLferent conditions, such as
life of mines, construction time and learning curve. In these
circumstances, the comparison of capital cosrs per tonne of coal capacity
or of operating costs can be quite mislenaing.

CHINA - CHANGCUN COAL MINING PROJECT
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF LONGWALL COAL MINING METHOD
1.        The longwall method of mining was first introduced in the UK in
the early part of this century. its adaptabilicy to diverse geological
conditions, amenability to varying degree of mechanization, and the high
productivity and rate of recovery of in situ reserves has made the longwall
method of mining the most popular in the world. Today it is practiced in
most of the coal producing countries. The following paragraphs briefly
describe the essentials of longwall mining.
(a) Development
2.        A normal longwall panel is developed by driving a pair of
roadways 180 to 220 m apart in a coal block for a distance of 600 to
2,000 m. At the end of the drivage the two roadways are connected by a
straight road, which is called the longwall face. From here the longwall
face retreats toward the starting point of the drivage.
(b) Extraction of the Panel
3.        The face is equipped with coal winning and transportation and
roof support equipment. A steel plated conveyor is laid along the full
length of the face. A coal winning machine (shearer) rides on the conveyor
travelling back and forth cutting webs of coal and loading it into the
conveyor. A series of articulated steel canopies or beams held up by steel
props provide support at the workplace. As the extraction proceeds, the
conveyor and supports are moved forward close to the face and the void
behind is rilled by caving of the roof stone. Most of the coal (95Z)
between the two roadways are extracted. If the coal seam is more than 3 u
thick, the extraction is done in two or more slices. A continuous stream
of fresh air is coursed through the face to dilute the gases, ventilate the
machinery and to provide sufficient cool fresh air to the workmen.
(c) Longwall Mechanization
4.        The mechanized longwall equipment consists of three major
components: armored face conveyor, coal cutting and loading machine and
self-advancing hydraulic powered support.
5.        Armored face conveyors consist of wear resistant heavy steel
troughs (pans) 1.2 to 1.5 m long and 0.6 to 0.9 m wide, fastened together
in such a manner as to permit certain flexibility in the structure in both
horizontal and vertical planes. The coal loaded in the troughs is carried
forward by scraper bars fastened to steel chains. The number of chains and
their construction features are the distinguishing mark of different
manufacturers. The conveyors can transport 200 to 1,200 tonnes of coal per
hour and may be powered by one to four electric motor with an aggregate
horsepower of 200 to 300 kw.
6.        The most widely used coal cutting and loading equipment today is
the shearer.  It is a complicated piece o, mIlLing machine whnCEH rides on
the armored face conveyor, and is either self-propelled or hauled back and

forth by an endless round-link chain. As the shearer travels, it cuts a
web (600 mm) of coal and load it in the conveyor. The cutting mechanism
(drum) may work in one or both directions. The mechanism could also range
up and down permitting extraction of thick seams. The shearer may be
equipped with one or more electric motors with an aggregate capacity of 100
to 800 kw. A built-in mechanism provides for supply of water for cooling
the electric motor and for jetting a fine spray of water on the cutting
bits to suppress dust and to prevent sparks.
7.        The plough is another form of coal winning machine which is used
in soft coal of low to medium thickness (600 to 1,800 mm). The unit
consists of an articulated steel-tipped planing machine which is kept
pressed to the coal face by the armoured face conveyor and hauled back and
forth by an endless chain. The plough takes a 50 mm slice of coal during
each pass and loads it on the conveyor. The equipment is most popular in
the FR of Germany and its neighboring coal fields where the geological
conditions are most suited for its application.
8.        The remarkable progress in longwall productivity and the recent
decline in the coal face accident rates are mainly due to the application
of powered roof support. There are many types of powered support but their
basic design is same. Essentially it consists of a framework of roof
canopies supported by 2 to 6 adjustable hydraulic legs standing on a
footplate. The distance between the roof canopy and floor plate can be
varied by adjusting the height of the legs. Each frame provides support to
about 0.9 m x 4 m area of the face. The supports are erected side by side
along the whole face length. The thickness of the seam decides the
distance between roof and floor plates but the distance between the legs
are governed by design features as well as the convenience of personnel and
equipment movement. The armoured face conveyor is fastened to the foot
plate with a hydraulic ram. As the coal winning progresses, the ram pushes
the conveyor forward up to the coal face. The next step is to release the
hydraulic supports, lower the roof canopy and pull the support frame
forward with the ram anchored on the conveyor. The process is repeated
frame by frame until the entire conveyor length and all the supports assume
the new position.
Operation
9.        The degree of mechanization depends upon planning and design of
the face. The shearer may be replaced by blasting the coal off the solid
with explosive and hand loading. The powered support may be replaced by
individual hydraulic or friction props supporting steel bars.
10.       Coal seams thicker than 3 m are extracted in two or more slices.
The slices may be taken from bottom upward where the lower void is filled
up with sand and upper slices work on sand floor. When the seam is taken
in descending slices, a strong steel wire mesh is laid on the floor of the
first top slice and the roof stone allowed to cave in. The broken stones
held up by the wire mesh provides an artificial roof beneath which the
lower slices are extracted by the normal method.

CHINA - CHANGCUN COAL MINING PROJECT
SUMMARY OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING PROGRAM
Description
Technical assistance is required in the following field:
a.   Project Management, including cost control, planning, scheduling
monitoring and management information systems. Since this is the
first time that the Luan CIC is responsible for a project of this
size, its management has to be provided with the appropriate
systems and methodology by outside assistance.
b.   Design and Engineering Assistance, for
i.   key installations, including shafts, hoisting systems,
underground excavations and haulage systems. This is
required to achieve a satisfactory transfer of the employed
technologies, to ensure imported equipment is compatible
with local installations and to assist in the preparation of
bidding documents;
ii.  coal preparation plant design;
iii. electrical design, specially in view of high voltage
distribution systems underground required by modern mining
equipment; and
iv.  follow-up on design execution throughout the implementation
phase.
C.   Training, by foreign experts both abroad as well as in China, for
I.   construction phase, specially in the technology and
organization of rapid underground excavations, including
operators training;
ii.  the establishment of a training center, to be integrated in
the CIC's existing training facilities to be geared to the
application of modern mining techniques, both from technical
and managerial aspects; and
iii. procurement assistance, over and above that provided under
b. above, to enable Chinese Project Management to expedite
procurement and to ensure quality control.

ANNEX 23

CHINA - CHANGCUN COAL MINING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
The assumptions ueed in the financial projections are as follows:
A. Changcun
1.   Escalation
The annual inflation rates used are:
Year                   Local    Foreign
1985                   1.030     1.080
1986-1988              1.030     1.090
1989                   1.030     1.075
1990 and thereafter   1.030      1.060
2.   Coal Price
Domestic price projections for semi-anthracite coal was increased
by 13.8% in 1985, 2.2% in 1986, 1.0% in 1987, 13.6% In 1986, 17.3% in 1989,
and 19.1% in 1990 in real terms, and remained constant thereafter. Also,
the project's coal which is about IC% lower than average for CIC as a
whole, was assumed to reach the same level of Luan CIC on account of
adjustments to the price structure. Prices (Yuan/tonne) used in both
current and 1984 real terms are:
Year                 Current Term                 Real Term
1984                     26.4                       26.3
1985                     30.8                       29.9
1986                     32.5                       30.6
1987                     33.8                       30.9
1988                     39.5                       35.1
1989                     47.7                       41.1
1990 and thereafter      58.5 increasing 3% p.a.   48.9
3.   Operating Costs
Operating costs in 1984 terms on the basis of actual capacity are
estimated at Yuan 16.65/tonne of ROM coal increasing at 3% p.a. The
breakdown at full design capacity is (Yuan/tonne):

Page 2 of 5
Local   Foreign   Total
Cost    Cost      Cost
Wages and Social Charges    2.16       -        2.16
Materials and Supplies       5.14     0.43      5.57
Electricity                  2.40      -        2.40
Maintenance                  2.95      -        2.95
Administration               0.82       -       0.82
Replacement Fee              2.75      -       2.75
Total                     16.22     0.43    16.65
Variable costs have been defined as 100% of materials and supplies,
replacement fee, 83% of wages and social charges, and 70% of electricity.
Accordingly, variable costs account for 70% of total operating costs.
Other non-business expenditures covering auxiliary facilities and social
welfare activities are estimated at an additional Yuan 1.0/tonne ROM c.8l
increasing at 3% p.a.
4.   Working Capital
On the basis of Chinese regulations, working capital is estimated
as:
8% of wages, social charges and electricity for cash
4% of local sale revenues for accounts receivable
33% of material and supplies for inventory of materials
2% of total operating costs for inventory of coal
4% of material and supplies for accounts payable
Local and foreign portions of working capital, amounting to Yuan 21.9
million and Yuan 0.6 million respectively, for the period 1988-93 are
assumed to be financed by short-term loans from the People's Ba-* at 7.2%
interest rate p.a.
5.   Replacement Costs
Service life of capital costs are reviewed by the Bank and are
estimated to be:
Service     Portion of
Life       Base Cost
(years)         (Z)
5           15
10           15
15            4
20           11
40           21
Over 50           26
Thus, the weighted average of service life is estimated at 15 years.

Replacement investment are spread each time over three years as follows:
Service LIfe                Years
5-year items             1992-1994, 1987-1989, 2002,2004
10-year items             1997-1999
15-year items             2005-2007
Replacement investments are assumed to be financed by the maintenance fund
of Luan CIC accumulating at Yuan 2.5/tonne of output or Yuan 10.0 million
p.a. If funds are not sufficient, then the maintenance fund of the PCB
accumulating at Yuan 0.25/tonne of output or Yuan 1.0 million p.a. are
used. Any balance beyond the- above two funds is financed as a contribution
by MOCI.
6.   Corporate Tax
Corporate tax payable by the mine is 85% of net income after
long-term debt servicing.
7.   IBYfD Loan
The IBRD loan is assumed to finance 100% of initial direct
foreign costs. The total amounts to US$124.3 millionl/ financed at
9.29Z interest with 20 years maturity including 5 years grace. A
commitment fee of 0.75% is included in the calculations.
B. Luan CIC
t.   Escalation
The same local inflation as for Changcun is used. It has been
assumed that exchange rate adjustments will maintain "purchasing power
pariLy-, i.e., that the Yuan will appreciate to compensate for the
difference in domestic and international inflation rates. Currency
adjustment has been incorporated into Luan CIC's financial projections, but
not into Changcun alone.
2.   Production Plans
Luan CIC's production plans up to 1988 are summarized below. The
biggest increase is expected to arise from developing two additional long-
wall faces at the Wangzhuang Mine. All major expansion programs have
already been approved by SPC and therefore the production plans were
considered attainable.

5.   Replacement Costs
The investment plan for the existing operations consist of
expansion of production facilities (including washery plant) at 68% of
total costs and infrastructure at 32%. Using the same service life as the
Project, depreciation rate for Luan CIC is estimated at 7% p.a. Therefore,

ANNEX 23
Page 5 of 5
replacement costs for existing facilities are calculated at 7% of gross
fixed assets on an annual basis. New investments are assumed to be
depreciated according to the service life used for the project.
6.   Corporate Taxes
Corporate taxes are calculated on the consolidated net income
with the Project at a rate of 85% after long-term debt repayment.
