MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Belize
Power Development project (Loan 2749-BEL)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Belize: Power Development
project (Loan 2749-BEL. approved in FY87) prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office. The Borrower provided Part 11. It commends the Bank's performance but
highlights the need for more timelv information o01 loan disbursement procedures.
The project met the objectives of expanding power generation, improving primary and
secondary distribution, and strengthening the finances and staff of the Belize Electricity Board
(BEB) by: (i) adding 4.2MW in diesel plants; (ii) refurbishing and expanding power distribution
lines, substations, and customer connections: and (iii) by providing technical assistance and
training to managers and staff of BEB. However, the project fell short in providing all the power
supply needed by 1993 and BEB had to install 13.0 MW of additional capacity to meet a demand
much higher than the appraisal estimate.
The project was completed on time at a cost of US$17.6 million. Well justified additional
works explain the 24 percent cost overrun. The US$7.5 million Bank loan closed on time and was
fully disbursed. The co-financiers, the Caribbean Development Bank and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, contributed US$3.1 million and US$1.9 million respectively. BEB
financed the balance US$5.1 million from its own cash generation. The recalculated project
economic rate of return of 10.5 percent is lower than the 12.3 percent appraisal estimate on
account of less economic benefits from energy loss reduction, and lower electricity prices.
Coordination among the Bank and the co-financiers was satisfactorv. The Borrower and
BEB are commended for their highly satisfactory performance: they got close to their efficiency
targets (loss reduction, customers per employee, electricity sold per employee); improved their
management and technical skills; and implemented the project on schedule. The most important
covenants were complied with and BEB's contribution to project financing was substantial.
The project outcome is rated as highly satisfactory, its institutional development as
substantial, and its sustainability as likely.
The PCR presents a concise account of project implementation and results. No audit is
planned.

POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2749-BEL)
COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is for a Power Development Project in Belize
for which Loan 2749-BEL for US$7.5 million equivalent was approved on August 5, 1986 and made
effective June 4, 1987. The closing date of the project was December 31, 1993. The borrower was
the Government of Belize (GOB), who relent the proceeds to Belize Electricity Board (BEB),the
beneficiary, on the same terms and conditions. The power sector was reorganized in 1992, and BEB's
operations were transferred to a successor company, Belize Electricity Limited (BEL), a company
incorporated under the Belize Companies Act, and empowered to issue shares. BEB's assets and
liabilities were transferred to BEL in return for shares and debentures. The Loan and Project
Agreements were amended to the extent required to reflect the changes. Except where the matter
referred to in this completion report concerns BEL explicitly, the abbreviation BEB has been used
throughout. Final disbursement on Loan 2749-BEL took place on February 17, 1994. The Loan was
fully disbursed. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) approved co-financing for the Project of about US$3 million equivalent and US$2
million equivalent respectively.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of Department II, of
the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. It was based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR); the Loan and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the
Bank and the beneficiary; and internal bank memoranda. Part II of the PCR was prepared by BEL.
The draft PCR was sent to BEL on September 23, 1994, and comments received have
been incorporated into the report to the extent deemed appropriate. The letter containing BEL's
comments is attached to Part II of the report.

BELIZE POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2749-BEL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.           The Bank first became involved in the Belize power sector in 1982, when a project
identification mission was made. At that time, the Belize Electricity Board (BEB) had sole authority
for power generation and supply throughout Belize. Its operations faced severe management, staffing,
technical and financial problems. Electricity service was unreliable and expensive, and load shedding
and system outages were common. It was proposed to import electricity from Mexico to replace local
generation, and a project involving the construction of a transmission line was under discussion for
some time. However, in 1984, Government of Belize (GOB) decided that the project was too
expensive to undertake under current economic conditions, subsequently, BEB, with Bank assistance,
prepared a project to meet BEB's immediate needs. To meet these needs, GOB's strategy was focused
on improving electricity service, and improving BEB's finances. The Project consisted of BEB's entire
87-93 investment program.. Over the longer term, GOB's objective was to reduce dependence on
imported oil, by developing Belize's hydroelectric potential, as well as considering other renewable
resources for electricity generation.
Project Objectives
E.           The project objectives were to (i) meet the 1987-93 energy requirements by providing
generating units and spare parts (ii) expand and improve BEB's primary and secondary distribution
systems to meet 1987-93 power and energy requirements (iii) help BEB achieve financial viability
through greater emphasis on proper pricing, as well as improved operating efficiency through a
reduction of distribution losses and thefts and also through better maintenance of BEB's facilities (iv)
strengthen BEB's institutional performance by improving its organizational structure and management,
financial and technical capability (v) help ensure that investments are carried out on a rational and cost
effective basis and (vi) prepare feasibility studies for long term energy requirements.
Implementation Experience
ini.         The project was appraised in November and December 1984, but the Bank Loan did
not become effective until June 1987. There were long delays in meeting the Bank's conditions of
negotiations, which required GOB to confirm that BEB's indebtedness to GOB be converted into an
equity contribution, and that GOB reduce the amount owing to BEB in respect of electricity sales to 60
days. The date for meeting the conditions for Bank loan effectiveness had to be extended because of



GOB legal delays, and the loan became effective about seven months after the date specified in the
Loan Agreement. Notwithstanding, some delays in loan processing were inevitable, as CDB
postponed its planned appraisal until early 1986, after deciding that further engineering studies relating
to the distribution system were first required. The CDB loan was approved in October 1986. Project
implementation generally proceeded satisfactorily, following some initial delays, and all the project
components were completed by June 1993, which was within the appraisal estimate for full completion.
Results
iv.          The project components were completed as planned, except for some minor changes
agreed with the Bank. The project helped BEB meet its 1987 - 93 energy requirements. However,
demand growth substantially exceeded appraisal expectations, and BEB had to purchase additional
generating capacity. As a result of the project, and earlier efforts by BEB, BEB's system losses were
reduced from about 26.5% of net generation in 1984 to about 10.5% by December 1993. In FY 84,
BEB was insolvent and, with the exception of FY 81, had sustained operating losses (before interest
charges) since FY 77. By FY 94, mainly as a result of (i) financial restructuring measures encouraged
by the Bank, (ii) a FY84 tariff increase, (iii) significant improvements in operating efficiency especially
through loss reduction efforts, (iv) strong sales growth, and (v) reduced oil prices, BEL (BEB's
successor company)'s financial condition was sound and its operations profitable. The project training
component was helpful in enhancing and improving job performance.
Sustainability
v.           Significant improvements were made to BEB's institutional performance during project
implementation as a result of improved management, the recruitment of additional professional stafg
and the training of staff at all levels. It is expected that the operation of the facilities constructed under
the project will continue to be of the good standard already achieved.
Findings and Lessons Learned
vi.          The main lesson learned is that, with strong commitments to improvements by
Government and the project entity, an entity providing poor electricity service, and with weak finances,
can overcome these problems and significantly increase its efficiency.

B.    Background
1.           When the Bank first became involved in the Belize power sector in 1982, the Belize
Electricity Board (BEB) had sole authority for power generation and supply throughout Belize. At
that time, BEB's operations faced severe management, technical and financial problems. BEB lacked
staff with adequate training and experience, at both professional and technical levels. Electricity service
was unreliable and expensive, and load shedding and system outages were common. Government
(GOB) and BEB were considering importing electricity from Mexico to replace local generation as
BEB's system was largely unconnected, a project involving the construction of a 115kV transmission
line of about 100 miles was under consideration. Discussions between Comisi6n Federal de
Electricidad (Mexico), on the one hand, and GOB and BEB, on the other, regarding a long term
contract for the supply of electricity took place over an extended period of time. Progress towards
signing a contract was regarded by the Bank as important to the processing of a loan.
2.          In mid 1983, a Bank mission was informned that the project content may have to be
changed because consideration was being given to a proposal from private industry to supply BEB
with power from a proposed wood fired plant. However, it was later decided not to pursue this
proposal. In August 1984, GOB informed the Bank that it did not wish to proceed with the proposed
Mexican interconnection. Under then current economic conditions, GOB was concerned about the
perceived high cost of such a project. Later, GOB supported a project, prepared by BEB, with Bank



- 2 -
assistance, to meet BEB's immediate needs. GOB's strategy was focused on improving electricity
service, and improving BEB's finances. Over the longer term, GOB's objective was to reduce
dependence on imported oil, by developing Belize's hydroelectric potential as well as considering other
renewable resources for electricity generation. The project included a feasibility study for future energy
source development
C.    Project Objectives and Description
3.           Project Objectives The project objectives were to (i) meet the 1987-93 energy
requirements by providing generating units and spare parts, (ii) expand and improve BEB's primary and
secondary distribution systems to meet 1987-93 power and energy requirements, (iii) help BEB
achieve financial viability through greater emphasis on proper pricing and improved operating
efficiency through a reduction of distribution losses and thefts and better maintenance, (iv) strengthen.
BEB's institutional performance by improving its organizational structure and its management, financial
and technical capability, (v) help ensure that investments are carfied out on a rational and cost effective
basis, and (vi) prepare feasibility studies for long term energy requirements.
4.           Project Description The project components represented BEB's entire 1987-93
investment program and consisted of:
(a)    Generation
(i)   Installation of one 500 kW unit, one 650 kW unit, and one 3,200 kW
unit in San Pedro, Belmopan, and Belize City respectively, construction of a
small power station in Punta Gorda (approximately 4,000 sq.ft.), and
reallocation of one 260 kW unit and one 300 kW unit in Punta Gorda.
(ii)   Spare parts for the existing diesel generating sets.
(b)    Distribution
Installation and reconductoring of 22kV and 6.6kV three phase (approximately
22 kms) and I 10-220V three phase (approximately 14kms) distribution lines.
istallation of static capacitors (about 2,500 kVAR);distribution transformers
(about 3,000 kVA) complete with sectionalizing and protective equipment;
step-up station power transformers (3,750 kVA); customers meters (11,500
customers), service drops and street lighting. This component included 36
ground mounted metal clad switchgears, 3 circuit breaker reclosers, and 32
pole mounted isolating switchers.
(c)    Substations
Relocation of two 3 MVA 22/6.6 kV existing power transformers from the
Western and Northern substations to a new substation to be built close to the



-3 -
Belize power station including the associated 22 kV lines, switchgears,
switchboard and accessories.
(d)   Vehides and Equipment
Acquisition of equipment and tools for operation and maintenance of the
generating and distribution facilities, including 10 vehicles for project
construction.
(e)   Training and Technical Assistance
Training and technical assistance, including the identification of detailed
training needs, and implementation of a training program and a study on BEB's
organization.
(f)    Engineering and Consultant Services
(i) Consultant services for management, engineering and supervision of the
construction component of the project.
(ii) Consultant services for studies related to future energy source
development.
D.    Project Design and Organization
5.           The project was designed to meet BEB's immediate needs by providing additional
generating capacity, and reducing substantial distribution losses, as well as strengthening BEB
institutionally. Given GOB's decision not to opt for an interconnected system with Mexico at that time,
the Project was appropriate. The project was prepared by BEB with the assistance of Bank staff. The
distribution component was based on a report prepared by consultants.
E.    Project Implementation
6.           Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup The project was appraised in November
and December 1984, but did not become effective until June 1987. There were long delays in meeting
the Bank's conditions of negotiations, which required Government to confirm that BEB's indebtedness
to GOB be converted into an equity contribution, and that GOB reduce the amount owing to BEB in
respect of electricity sales to 60 days. Three post appraisal missions were necessary, mainly to update
information and monitor progress towards meeting the conditions for negotiations. The dates for
meeting the conditions for Bank loan effectiveness had to be extended, and the loan became effective
about seven months after the date specified in the Loan Agreement. The extensions were needed
because of GOB delays in providing legal opinions, and in executing the subsidiawy loan agreement.
Notwithstanding, some delays in loan processing were inevitable, as CDB postponed its planned
appraisal untl early 1986 after deciding that further engineering studies relating to the distribution
system were first required. The CDB loan was approved in October 1986.

7.          Implementation Schedule After some initial delays in preparing bidding documents
and terms of reference, caused by staff shortages, project implementation generally proceeded
satisfactorily, and al the project components were completed by June 1993, which was within the
appraisal estimate for ful completion. The three generating units were instaled at or before the May
1990 completion date estimated at appraisal. The relocation of the two generating units was delayed,
but this was because of a decision to change the location of the new Punta Gorda power station. The
transmission and distribution works initially included in the Project were completed by December 1990,
close to the appraisal estimate. To take into account increased demand growth, the Bank agreed to
extend the Project scope to include firther transmission works, including an extension of the transmis-
sion line with Mexico from Corrozal to Orange Walk and a loss reduction program.
8.           Project Costs The final project cost (excluding IDC) was US$15.7 million compared
to the SAR estimate of US$13.2 million (Part a, Table 5). The actual cost of the major physical
project components was close to the SAR estimates. The increase in project costs is mainly
attributable to additional works added to the Project. Actual costs of the project training component
were less than estimated as some of the training was financed by grants. The local costs of engineering
services, such as housing, were underestimated. BEB financed the excess of actual over estimated
project costs from its cash resources.
9.           Loan Allocation The original and actual disbursements by category are shown in Part
11 (Section 5 (c)). Funds were realocated from the Unallocated Funds category specified in the Loan
agreement to other Loan categories to meet the project needs, as determined folowing the revision of
Project costs following changes in the Project scope.
10.         Cofinanciers Two other institutions participated in project financing, the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC). Both
institutions coordinated their work with the Bank and BEB and participated in some joint supervision
missions. Overall, the project was implemented in a positive atmosphere and there was good
coordination among the institutions involved.
F.    Project Results
11.         Project Objectives The project helped BEB meet its 1987 - 93 energy requirements.
However, demand growth substantially exceeded appraisal expectations. From FY 86 to 94, average
annual electricity sales growth was about 12.7% compared to the SAR estimate of 5.6%. The
difference is mainly explained by the effect on electricity sales of a sharp increase in the rate of Belize's
GDP growth during this period compared with the 1979 to 84 period. To meet peak demand and
additional energy requirements, BEB purchased additional generating units with a total capacity of
about 13 MW to add to the 4.2 generating capacity provided under the project. As a result of the
project, and earlier efforts by BEB, BEB's system losses were reduced from about 26.5% of net
generation in 1984 to about 10.5% by December 1993. Most of the proposed training under the five
year training program prepared by a consultant financed by the Bank was carried out. Professional



engineers, supervisors at the technical level, as well as BEB's training officer received training under the
program.
12.         Two engineers obtained graduate degrees. The training program was helpful in
improving and enhancing job performance. Another of the project objectives was to restore BEB's
financial viability, and this was achieved.
13.         Physical Results The project components were completed, as planned, except for
some changes agreed with the Bank. (Part mI, Table 4).
14.         Financial Performance FY1986-1994 actual financial statements are compared to
the SAR projections in Part HI, Annex 1. In 1984, despite very high electricity rates, BEB was
insolvent and, with the exception of FY 81, sustained operating losses (before interest charges) since
FY77. BEB was unable to pay its debt service, or its major creditor, and accounts receivable for
electricity sales were at a very high level (including substantial overdue amounts from Government)
equal to about 84 days sales. About 40% of BEB's long-term debt was due to Government. In 1984,
BEB abolished the fuel surcharge payable by electricity consumers, and introduced a tariff which was
estimated to increase average revenues by about 13%. This proved to be a significant step in
improving BEB's financial condition, especially as oil prices declined in future years. Electricity rates
remained unchanged throughout project implementation, except for a reduction of about 5% in April
1986. After taking account of inflation, real tariffs dropped by an estimated 22% between 1988 and
1994. In 1985, with GOB's agreement, BEB offset GOB accounts receivable against its debt to GOB,
and the balance of BEB's debt was converted to a GOB equity contribution. The growth in kWh sales
between FY86 and FY94 was much stronger than estimated at appraisal. By FY 94, kWh sales had
reached a level about 55% above the SAR estimates. Operating costs per kWh sold, on the other
hand, declined by about 16% between FY85 and FY94. Efficiency improvements, especially loss
reductions, and reduced oil prices helped to make this possible. Between FY87 and FY84, BEB's rate
of return, on net fixed assets in operation, varied between 90/o in FY91 and 19.8% in FY89, and
consistently exceeded the Project Agreement requirements, which increased to a minimum of 7%/6 from
FY89 onwards. This enabled BEB to finance more than 500/o of its FY86-94 capital spending
(including non-project spending to meet high demand growth) and working capital needs from internal
cash generation. By the end of FY 94, BEUs financial position was satisfactory with a good
debt/equity ratio of 50:50 and a favorable current ratio of 1.6. Accounts receivable had been reduced
to 47 days sales at March 31, 1994.
15.         Internal Rate of Return The rate of return has been reestimated at 10.5% for the
1988-94 investment program compared to the SAR estimate of 12.3% for comparable investments in
the 1987-93 period. The lesser rate of return is due mainly to (i) the reduced value of distribution loss
reductions as a consequence of fuel prices lower than expected at the time of appraisal; and (ii) a
reduction in real tariffs.

G.   Project Sustainability
16.         With the institutional changes previously noted and BEL's emphasis on training, it is
expected that the operation of the facilities constructed under the project will continue to be of the
good standard already achieved.
H.    Bank Performance
17.         When the Bank first became involved in the power sector in 1982, BEB had serious
technical, institutional and financial problems which needed to be urgently addressed. However, at that
time, BEB's staff had only limited experience of international lending institutions and the methods used
in project appraisal. Furthermore, for some time, there was no coherent position within GOB and BEB
as to the desirability of a Bank financed project. The Bank persisted in its project preparation efforts,
however, and later played an important role by providing detailed assistance to BEB in selecting and
preparing the project components and estimating the project costs. In the early stages of loan
processing. the Bank also successfully encouraged Government and BEB to take measures to improve
BEB's finances.
L     Cofinanciers Performance
18.         As indicated in paragraph 11, the project was implemented in a cooperative effort of
BEB and the financial institutions. The Caribbean Development Bank and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation played an important role in the successful implementation of the project, not
only providing the necessary funding, but also with timely advice to BEB.
J.    Borrower Performance
19.         Before and during project appraisal, and in the early stages of project implementation,
BEB was short of qualified and experienced staff. However, BEB's management markedly improved,
and considerable importance was given to staffing improvements. A number of professionally qualified
engineers were recruited. Their effectiveness increased as a result of on-the-job experience and further
training. In 1994, several of BEB's eight senior officials had post graduate degrees in engineering
and/or business administration. Key staff members showed much dedication to the successful
completion of the project. Overall, BEB's institutional performance has considerably improved. Until
recently, however, the effectiveness of its financial and accounting functions has been handicapped by
staff turnover at the higher levels.
20.          Lessons Learned The main lesson from the project is that, with strong commitments
to improvements by Government and the project entity, an entity providing poor electricity service, and
with weak finances, can overcome these problems and make substantial efficiency improvements.

K     Bank-Borrower Relationship
21.         The early Bank missions made significant efforts to gain the confidence of GOB and
BEB. These efforts were rewarded, and fniendly and effective workdng relationships were established.
These continued throughout project implementation.
L     Consulting Services
22.         The consultant engineering and supervisory team provided in connection with the
project works was satisfactory, and played a useful role in project implementafion.
M..   Project Documentation and Data
23.         The Loan and Project Agreements were adequate for achieving the project objecives.
BEB provided important data for the report. Bank supervision reports were generally wel
documented.

POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2749-BEL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BELIZE ELECTRICITY LIMITED
(formerly Belize Electricity Board)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Bank's Performance
1.           The project design was appropriate and contributed to the overall improvement in the
performance of the BEB. Apart from some minor technical problems with equipment procured all the
objectives of the project were met and the project was completed within the schedule shown in the
SAR. The deviations in the project cost is explained in detail in a later section but these were primarily
due to the additional works.
2.           The Bank's support to BEB during project preparation, when resources were limnited,
is appreciated. The support received from the Bank during the project implementation was very
efficient. The Project Officers dealt with BEB's request in a timely manner and no delays were caused
by Bank's inaction. During the latter stages of the project there were some confusion on interpretation
of various loan amounts which uses a variable conversion rate tied to the CDA. This meant that
request for disbursement did not always match actual amounts paid. It is felt that more information
should be given to Borrowers to aid in the understanding of the disbursements.
3.           A special account was established locally and was useful in making payments in a
timely manner. There were no problems with this account.
4.           Once a decision is made by the Bank during appraisal and in the Loan Agreement it is
difficult to amend even though conditions in the Borrower's environment has changed drastically, as in
the case of BEB. The Bank must develop procedures to make amendments to its documents where
changes in the environment and performance of the Borrower warrants such a change.
5.           The Bank's view of the need for consultants should also be amended. In many cases
the use of part-time rather than full-time consultants would suffice, provided the Borrower has
adequate and competent staff. Furthermore, use of resident supervisory staff, should in general be
eliminated and be limited to only engineering staff unless supervisory staff were required for lengthy
periods.



-9 -
B.    Borrower's Performance
6.          In general, BEB met all of the objectives of the Power I Project and each component
was successfuDly implemented. Furthermore, during project implementation BEB met aDl the loan
covenants with the key indicators showing that BEB either met or exceeded the requirements for the
three main indicators: rate of return, current ratio and debt service ratio. It should be pointed out that
these requirements were met with no increase in tariff and in fact just before project implementation
there was a tariff reduction with another during the project implementation and due to inflation real
tariff fel by 22%.
7.           The following are comments on each of the project objectives:
(i)    Under the IBRD loan three diesel units of size 3,130 kW, 650 kW and 500 kW were
procured to meet the projected demand. It became evident during the early stages of
the project that more units would be required to meet the higher growth rates
encountered. In fact, the growth rates exceeded the high forecast contained in the
renewable energy study, funded to meet objective (vi). Apart from the high growth
rates there appears to be no other reason for this shortfall.
(ii)   The distribution expansion was based on a study conducted by Merz and McLeDan
(M&M) as part of the CDB component of the project. While the M&M
recommendations were acceptable there were numerous small items that were
inadvertently left out of the report. Also, since this component was fully funded by
CDB, there was a restriction on the eligible source countries and consequently some of
the materials procured, such as the domestic meters and reclosures, were not
acceptable. The only other major problem encountered in this component was the
purchase of underground cables which arrived damaged due to inadequate packing.
(iii)   During project implementation it was realized that the losses goal would not be
achieved at the end of the project so in an effort to correct the situation a revised loss
reduction, with both a technical and a non-technical programn, was submitted to the
IBRD on June 5, 1991. Using surplus and contingency funds the Bank agreed to fund
the additional loss reduction measures which in part aided reduction of the losses to
10.25 percent by December 1993. This reduction was achieved in part by using the
equipment procured in an exhaustive monitoring campaign by BEB to monitor the
consumption of large commercial customers. One of the main recommendation of the
M&M report to minimize thefts was the use of socket connected meters. This was
implemented during the project and BEB has adopted this as a standard.
(iv)   As part of the training and technical assistance the BEB undertook to train all
employees in accordance with the Training Advisor's recommendations. In addition
many of the senior employees pursued individual training which aided in strengthening



- 10-
the organization. The BEB is now managerially and technically stronger to deal with
the Power II Project.
(vi)   The renewable energy study identified hydro and Mexican purchase as possible long
term solutions to the demand for energy, although the latter was not investigated in
detail due to a lack of data from Comisi6n Federal de Electricidad (CFE). A 25 MW
hydro facility is under construction and is scheduled for completion April 1995. Under
the Power II Project a 115 kV transmission line will be built to interconnect with the
Mexican grid for the purchase of power from CFE on attractive terms.
(vii)  With no increase in tariff and in fact just before project implementation there was a
tariff reduction with another during the project implementation and due to inflation real
tariff fell by 22%.
(viii)  For the loss reduction program, losses were reduced from 19.3 percent in 1985 to
10.25 percent by December 1993; the latter figure compares with the SAR estimate of
8.7 percent. It is important to note that the forecasted reduction in losses was based on
an estimated growth rate of 6-7% as compared with an actual growth rate of 12% (ref
Merz and McLellan report dated April 1988 page 4.1) and only included domestic
customers.
C.    Lessons Learned
8.           The lessons learned from the above were as follows:
(i)    The need for new generators was identified early by BEB. However, a covenant of the
loan agreement, section 4.02 (b), stated that BEB could not undertake investments
which would exceed, when aggregate to other investment in the power sector, the
equivalent of US$250,000.00. There was some difficulty with the interpretation of this
clause and hence it posed a minor problem to BEB when the decision was made to
undertake the expenditure. However, justifications were submitted to the financing
institutions and it was agreed that the expenditure was warranted.
(ii)   While it is inevitable that conservative forecasting will always be done, for the sake of
caution, it is recommended that future projects be based on more detailed market
studies, such as the renewable energy study (objective (vi)). This may serve to
eliminate the need for major changes during project implementation.
(iii)   As noted before, the distribution project was based on the M&M report. This report
was prepared according to British standards (BS), which was the existing BEB
standard. Project management was brought in to deal with the standards problem.
These consultants were selected through international competitive bidding and Ontario



- 11 -
Hydro, Canada, won the bid. The problem encountered was Ontario Hydro used
Canadian standards whereas, as noted before, the M&M report was based on BS
standards. Therefore, where appropriate all design should be according to intemational
standards. In addition, it became apparent that the M&M report did not include an
allocation for the small tools and small materials. Since the loan amounts were fixed,
these items had to be funded under BEB's contribution to the project and partly
explains why the BEB contribution significantly exceeds the SAR estimates. Future
projects should be based on more detailed engineering.
(iv)   Experience has shown that the socket meter standard is one of the best deterrents to
preventing theft of electricity.
D.    Project Financing
9.           The SAR project estimate, excluding IDC, was US$13.19 million with an estimated
BEB contribution of US$0.97 million. The final project cost is US$15.768 million with a BEB
contribution of US$3.527 million. Two of the loan amounts were fixed in US$ dollars and one in
pounds sterling. Since the variations in the loan amounts were not possible BEB had to meet the
shortfall. There are three reasons why the actual exceeded the estimate: (1) the Bank's estimate
included contingencies which were not fully utilized, therefore components were added to the project
to better meet the project objectives; (2) the local components were underestimated for the project
management services; and (3) all materials were not identified during project preparation.
E.    Use of Consultants
10.         The consultants for the engineering aspects of the project were satisfactory and
provided useful guidance and expertise transfer to BEB in most cases. The consultants also aided in
the development of numerous distribution standards and implementation of various safety measures
that are now a key feature of our operations. There were some minor problems with the project
management services which were resolved by changing the personnel assigned.
F.    Current System
11.         The improvements completed under the project, with the exception of the domestic
meters, are all in good working conditions. The equipment were procured using the latest technical
standards and none have experienced major failures or are obsolete. Therefore, the project has
contributed to the ability of BEB to meet the demand for electricity.



-12-
G.    Suggested Improvements
12.          During appraisal missions a determination of the need for consultancy assistance is
made. However, as in the case of BEL, institutionaly an organization can improve and in fact be
capable of carrying out some of the components on their own. It is therefore recommended that some
provisions be made to either reduce (or for that matter increase) the need for consultants during
implementation to reflect existing organizational stengths (or weaknesses).

B.    Economic Impact
SAR          Estimated
Estimate     Actual
Internal Economic Rate of Retum
(LERR)             12.3%        10.5%
1.          The SAR estimate was based on BEB's FY87-93 investment program. However, there
were initial delays in implementing the program. In reestimating the IERR, a similar methodology to
that in the SAR was used for BEB's FY88-94 program. 1987 prices were used.
2.           The recalculated IERR is lower than the SAR estimate mainly because:
(i) the value of the benefits of the fuel savings obtained through lower
distribution losses was lower than anticipated as a result of the reduction in oil
prices that occuwed over the investment period.
(ii) the real price per kWh of electricity sold dropped by about 22 % between
FY88 and FY94, as a result of inflation and a 5% tariff reduction in 1986.
C.    Financial Impact
Annex 1 compares BEL's actual 1987-1994 financial performance with the SAR
forecast. Comments on BEL's financial performance are given in para. 6.03 of Part 1.
