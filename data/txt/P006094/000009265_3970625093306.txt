POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMKARY
Borrover:                Belize
Beneficiary:             Belize Electricity Board (BEB)
Amount:                  USS7.5 million equivalent
Terms:                   17 years, including 4 years of grace at the Bank' s
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:         17 years including 4 years of grace at the Bank*s
standard variable interest rate; BEB would
bear the interest and foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:     The proposed project would cover part of EBE's
1987-93 investment program. The project would
provide generating units, expansion and improvements
to distribution lines, equipment, tools and
vehicles, training and technical assistance,
engineering services for project implementation and
studies of alternative sources for future energy
development.
Benefits:                The project will (a) improve the reliability of
BEB' s distribution system, reduce power losses and
provide fuel savings; (b) permit BEB to mseet the
growth in electricity demand over the medium term;
(c) strengthen BEB's organization and managemant;
(d) improve BEB's finances; and (e) assist in
planning BEB's long-term investment needs.
Risks:                   The principal risks facing the project lie in BEB s
institutional deficiencies. To minimize this risk
BEB would be required to appoint a Project Manager
before loan effectiveness and to retain a Management
and Financial Advisor. The project also includes a
comprehensive training program to strengthen BEB's
management and technical capabilities.

I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal source of energy in Belize is petroleum.  Belize is
completely dependent on imported oil for its energy requirements. In 1983,
imports of petroleum products amounted to USS23 million and accounted for 22%
(second largest item after food) of total imports for domestic consumption.
The cost of petroleum imports equalled about one third of total export
earnings. In 1983, the use of petroleum for power generation accounted for
23% of Belize's total petroleum consumption, transportation 55%, industry
11%, domestic 9% and agriculture 2Z.
1.02      Geological studies indicate a good possibility that Belize has
significant deposits of oil and gas both onshore and offshore. Explorations
started in 1938; the first license was obtained by Shell who conducted
geological surveys and photogeological studies. The outbreak of World War II
in 1939 stopped explorations until 1949 when a subsidiary of Gulf was awarded
a license that covered the entire country and its territorial waters. Six
years later, In 1955, Gulf drilled the first well.  Since then, 40 wells
totalling 250,000 ft have been drilled in Belize and about 6.000 line miles
of seismic surveys have been conducted by several companies. Presently there
are nine companies carrying out oil exploration in the country. Various
findings have been reported, but so far there have been no reports of
discoveries of either oil or gas in commercial quantities.
1.03      The laws governing oil and gas exploration licenses are regarded as
among the most liberal in the world. Exploration licenses are awarded for a
renewable 3 to 5 year period. If oil is found, a mining lease would be
awarded for 20 years. The agreements with the oil companies are based on an
old -contract-modelV that may need to be updated to take into account changes
in the world situation experienced in the last decade.  UNDP is providing
technical assistance in this area by financing an expatriate petroleum
geologist working at the Ministry of Natural Resources The long-run success
of this assistance will depend on the ability of both the Government of
Belize (GOB) and UNDP to build up the local expertise to take care of these
responsibilities in the near future. GOB n<,>ds an overall strategy and a
contingent plan for dealing with the development problems that exploring and
finding oil and/or gas in commercial quantities would create (para. 1.05).
1.04      Hydropower is potentially an important indigenous source of energy
in Belize. To reduce its dependence on petroleum imports for electricity
generation, the Government wishes to explore the possibility of developing
hydro power generation. In 1975, a UNDP-financed preliminary survey of
hydro-electric resources identified several alternatives for development.
The study concluded that the most justifiable sites are located on the Belize
river and recommended considering constructing a 45 KW power plant at an
estimated cost of USS55 million. The UNDP study concluded that the following
supplementary studies are needed: (i) study of energy demand covering a



20 year program; and (ii) furtheL study concerning development on the Belize
river (topographical survey, hydraulic study of the river, geological study
of the envisaged project sites). Since 1975 no additional studies were
performed on the subject. The proposed project includes the financing of a
feasibility study for future hydro-generation or utilization of other
renewable energy source such as wood, sugar cane and bagasse (para. 4.06(f)).
Energy Sector Organization
1.05      The Ministry of Energy and Comminications has overall
responsibility for the formulation of energy policy in Belize. However,
at no point within GOB's structure is there any systematic collection and
appraisal of the country's total energy supply and demand needs. A joint
UNDP/World Bank mission co Belize to conduct an energy sector assessment will
be considered for FY87. The mission, among other things, would look into the
merits of establishing an energy unit within the Government and also assist
in identifying funding for establishing and staffing such a unit.
Power Sector
1.06      The Belize Electricity Board (BEB) is the sole authority to
generate, distribute, supply and sell energy for public and private
purposes (para. 2.01). Initially. BEB was primarily responsible for
supplying electricity to Belize City only, while supply to the districts
towns was provided by the respective town Councils from 6 pm to 10 pa.
Later, this was amended to place all the districts in the country under BEB's
responsibility.
1.07      Public-service electricity supply in Belize is unreliable and
expensive. The present price to the consumer averages about 0.21 US$/kWh; of
that high cost, fuel costs represent more than 50% of operating c3sts.
Electric power is generated by isolated diesel sets, which depend on imported
fuel.  Load centers are not interconnected, except for a 13 mile 22 kV
transmission line between Ladyville and Belize City and a 15 mile 22 kV line
between Belmopan and San Ignacio (see Map). The primary and secondary
distribution networks are weak and the quality of the service is poor. BEB's
management estimate that the capacity of small privacely-owned generator sets
and the sugar industries that generate their own requirements is about 8.0
.hi.
1.08      The country's short-term strategy is to improve reliability of
electricity supply by strengthening the distribution system and adding diesel
generating capacity to meet the requirements of energy supply for the next
7 years and to study the possibility of developing future projects as soon as
possible, using indigenous resources when economically feasible. Over the
long-term, the country's strategy is aimed at developing its hydroelectric
potential as well as the utilization of its domestic renewable energy
resources (para. 1.04), thus reducing its dependence on imported fuel for
power generation.



-3-
Tariffs
1.09      The Belize Electricity Board Ordinance empowers BEB to set
electricity rates with the approval of the Minister responsible for Energy
and Communications.
1.10      Up to June 1984 BEB's tariff consisted of separate declining block
tariffs for domestic and for commercial and industrial consumers together
with a fuel surcharge which was introduced on May 1, 1979. In June 1984 the
fuel surcharge was abolished and a fixed rate of 43 Bz cents (USSO.215) per
Kilowatt hour was introduced for all consumers together with a monthly
minimum charge of Bz$4. The June 1984 tariff revisions were estimated to
increase average revenues by 13%. In April 1986 electricity rates were
reduced by about 2   Bz cents, partially reflecting the recent reductions in
fuel costs caused by the decline in world oil prices. At present BEB's
tariff levels are already high and it is not expected that any real increase
will be necessary in ihe near term unless to compensate for possible
increases in oil prices.
1.11      A 1980 CDB loan (para. 1.15) required BEB to appoint consultants to
review BEB's tariff structure. A study, which included tariff structure
recommendations and financial forecasts, was completed in September 1982 by
Consultants, Stone and Webster. The study was based largely on an assessment
of the financial requirements to meet the CDB loan requirepents. The main
recommendations of the study were that tariffs for large industrial and
commrcial consumers should consist, inter alia, of a demand charge, and an
energy charge. These recommendations have not yet been implemented.
However, the new Management and Financial Advisor is now expected to examine
the feasibility of introducing a maximum demand and energy charge for large
consumers.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.12      The principal development constralnt faced by the power sector is
Lhe lack of sufficient skilled and experienced personnel in BEB to permit an
orderly and adequate development of the sector. Particularly, BEB lacks
experienced personnel in management, planning, accounting and engiaeering.
The proposed project includes technical assistance and training components
(para.4.06(e)), which should result in strengthening BEB and thus help
alleviate this constraint.
1.13      A second constraint relates to the ability of BEB to generate
sufficient financial resources internally to cover operating expenses and
debt service and to make a reasonable contribution to its investment needs.
The proposed project would help to improve BEB finances by: (i) reducing
distribution losses and operating expenses; (ii) improving operation and
maintenance of the system; (iii) improving and upgrading the distribution
system and thus increasing system reliability; (iv) establishing appropriate
financial objectives; and (v) securing funding commitments from Government.
1.14      Finally, as indicated above, 100% of electricity is presently
generated by the use of imported petroleum. The recent drop in world oil
prices has contributed to a significant improvement of BEB's finances but



-4-
if future oil prices should substantially increase. The proposed project
includes financing of studies for utilization of renewable energy resources
(para 4.06 (f)).
Bank Group Involvement in the Country
1.15      Belize became a member of the Bank and IDA in March 1982. The
first Bank loan to Belize, Loan 2273-BEL (Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Project), was approved on Mfay 3, 1983.
1.16      Prior to its attainment of independence and membership of the Bank
and IDA, Belize benefitted i:om the proceeds of Bank Group lending operations
made available to the Ca.ibbean Development Bank (CDB) (US$300,000 for an
agro-industry credit project).
1.17      In addition to the proposed project, the Bank has also financed
under Loan 2273-BEL (Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project) a study for
possible improvements in the country's port facilities. Future lending
operations are likely to include an agricultural credit project, a possible
second highway development project, and a possible second power project.

II.  THE BORROWER AND THE EXECUTING AGENCY
The Project Executing Agency and Legal Structure
2.01      The Borrower would be Belize who would relend the USS7.5 million
Bank loan to BEB, the project executing agency, on the same terms and
conditions   (para. 5.10).  BEB, a government owned corporation, was first
established by Ordinance in 1950 and its legal status is now governed by a
revised Ordinance, which came into force in September 1958, known as the
Belize Electricity Board Ordinance. BEB has sole authority for public
power generation and supply throughout Belize. The Board consists of seven
members, namely: (i) GOB's Financial Secretarv; (ii) a member of the Belize
City Council; and (iii) five other persons appointed by the Minister of
Energy and Communications. The Chairman of the Board is elected by the
Board, subject to the Minister's approval. Following the election of a new
Government in December 1984 new Board members were appointed. A local
businessman was elected as the new Chairman of the Board.
Management and Staffing
2.02      BEB's institutional performance has generally been weak and
characterized by inadequate planning and direction, diffusion of authority,
between GOB, BEB's Board and its management and insufficient delegation of
authority to BEB's management.
2.03      BEB's organization chart is shown in Annex 2.1.  At present the
duties, authority and responsibilities of BEB's Board, its General Manager,
other key staff members, and GOB's responsibilities as far as they relate to
BEB's activities, are not precisely defined and a review of the organization
is required. During negotiations it was agreed that consultants, whose
qualifications, terms of reference and terms and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Bank, would be employed by December 31, 1986 to carry out
a study of BEB's organization. It was also agreed that, after consultation
with the Bank, BEB would promptly implement such recommendations as are
agreed upon (para. 7.01 (b)(i)).
2.04      BEB employs about 320 people, including five engineers and an
accountant who are trained to the professional level. However. the
professional staff generally lack experience. Most of BEB's technicians lack
either formal qualifications or training. The number of staff was reduced by
about 20 to 320 in 1984 as a result of an effort to rid BEB of staff surplus
to its requirements. BEB staff levels compare favorably with utilities with
similar characteristics in the region. The number of customers and MWh sold
per employee are 60 and 145 respectively. BEB's salary levels compare
favorably with those of the civil service and are for the most part
competitive with the private sector. However, skilled Belizeans have been
attracted by higher salaries in developed countries and staff turnover and
morale have been problems.



- 6 -
2.05      In addition to organization studies the project would see.: to
strengthen BEB through a comprehensive training program for managerial and
technical staff. Because of BEB's management weaknesses, to ensure
satisfactory project implementation, it will be necessary to employ an
experienced and qualified engineer as project coordinator. The appointment
of such a person, whose qualifications would be reviewed with the Bank, would
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 7.02 (i)). The project
coordinator would also be responsible for monitoring and reporting upon the
progress of the project and processing disbursement applications.
2.06      BEB's General Manager, a Belizean national appointed in 1983, has
worked for BEB for many years. -He is a qualified engineer and technically
capable. However, there is a need to provide his office with some support to
help improve management, planning and staff coordination. For that purpose,
a Management and Financial Advisor, funded by USAID was appointed under a
two-year contract in September 1985. During negotiations it was agreed that
the position of Management and Financial Advisor will be retained until the
Bank and BEB agree that it is no longer necessary, and that such position
will continue to be filled by a person whose qualifications and terms and
conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.01 (b)(ii)).
2.07      To further help ensure the maintenance of an adequate management
capability, at negotiations it was agreed that BEB will only appoint to the
positions of General Manager and of Financial Controller persons having
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.01 (b)(iii)).
2.08      The position of Financial Controller is presently cccupied by a
local national with a university degree in business. Because of a lack of
adequate staff he has had to spend much of his time in day-to-day activities
and in addressing BEB's immediate financial and accounting problems. He has
had limited opportunity to develop skills in financial management. To
strengthen BEB's accounting staff at negotiations it was agreed that BEB
would appoint an Assistant Financial Controller with qualifications and
experience acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1986 (para. 7.01 (b)(iv)).
The Management and Financial Advisor would be responsible for developing the
Financial Controller's capabilities and for effecting improvements in BEB's
financial planning, reporting and record maintenance by working with BEB's
staff in carrying out their duties.
Manpower Development and Training
2.09      Apart from some isolated efforts, training has largely been
neglected in the past. Training administration has been handled by the
personnel officer as a secondary duty. In addition to providing a management
and financial advisor, the proposed project would seek to develop BEB's
manpower capability through a comprehensive five-year training program (Annex
2.2) aimed at improving the on-the-job performance of about 270 management,
technical and accounting staff at all staff levels. The program has been



-7-
worked out in preliminary form with Bank assistance and would include (a) the
training of instructors as well as teaching materials and equipment for
specific courses to be arranged for BEB personnel at local training
institutions and REB's ownfacilities; (b) short-term expert services for
local training in specific technical areas; and (c) short-term overseas
visits for employees to attend courses, seminars and visit other power
companies. During negotiations it was agreed that, not later than December
31, 1986, BEB would appoint a Training Advisor, whose qualifications and
terms and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank, to organize a
training unit within BEB and develop and organize a detailed training program
(para. 7.01 (b)(v)). It was also agreed that not later than March 31, 1987,
R1EB would submit to the Bank a detailed training program and, after taking
into account the Bank's comments, would promptly implement the program
(para. 7.01 (b)(vi)).
2.10      An important objective of the project training component will be to
create a permanent training capability within BEB. For that purpose, BEB has
already appointed a Training Officer directly responsible to the General
Manager who would initially be the counterpart to the training advisor and at
some time in the future would take over full responsibility for the training
function. The Training Officer recently attended a six week Bank/ILO I/
training seminar in Italy in May 1986. The cost of his participation in the
above seminar (about US$7,000) would be financed by the Bank loan on a
retroactive basis.
Accounting
2.11      BEB does not prepare long-term financial plans and annual budgeting
has been ineffective. This reflects both inadequate management and
insufficient accounting staff. BEB's accounting system was devised some
years ago with external assistance. BEB's billing and accounts receivable
system is computerized while accounting machines are used to prepare other
records such as the general ledger. Although in need of improvement the
maintenance of BEB's accounting records'has been reasonably satisfactory and
the staff generally conscientious. However, BEB's accounting system needs to
be modernized and BEB expects to computerize inventory, payroll, accounts
payable and general ledger functions witlhin the next year.
Billings and Collections
2.12      The 1981 CDB loan agreement required that receivables be maintained
at a 60 day level and that GOB pay BEB public sector receivables outstanding
for more than 60 days at the date of the Loan Agreement by March 31, 1981.
At March 31, 1984 accounts receivable equalled about 85 days sales. However,
because of the arrangement made to offset debt payments made by Government
against electricity sales to Government (para. 5.01), receivables were
reduced to a level equal to about 35 days sales at March 31, 1986. At
negotiations, Government agreed to ensure that public sector bills are paid
within 60 days (para. 5.06).

Auditing
2.13      BEB's audits have been satisfactorily carried out for some years by
the public accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Foster. However, the issuance of
audit reports has been late in receat years, varying from 9 to 14 months
after BEB's financial year end, mainly because BEB's records have not been
ready for audit . The BEB Ordinance requires audit reports to be issued
within four months of the end of BEB's fiscal year. With the strengthening
of BEB's accounting department it is expected that BEB'S accounts could be
gradually made available for audit in a more timely manner. At negotiations
it was agreed that BEB would continue to engage independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and that BEB's audited accounts would be submitted
to the Bank not later than six months after the end of FY87 and FY88 and not
later than four months after the fiscal year end thereafter (para. 7.01
(b)(vii)).
Insurance
2.14      BEB insures its assets mainly on a replacement cost basis, against
most common risks, such as fire and public liability. The adequacy of BEB's
insurance coverage is presently under review by BEB's Board.



III. THE POWER MARKET
Background
3.01      The power market in Belize is served by the Belize Electricity
Board and geographically it is distributed by districts as follows (1985
data):
District                 Population CZ)a/    Consumers (Z)    Consumption (Z)

a/ Source: Economic Memorandum on Belize IBRD report No. 5244-BEL.
The distribution of electricity sales by sectors in 1984 was: 37Z
residential, 57Z commercial and industrial, and 6X for street lighting.
3.02      Between 1979 and 1984 sales to final consumers (Annex 3.1) grew at
an average rate of 1.2% per year with a high of 17% in 1983 and a low of -22%
in 1982, while the real GDP average annual growth recorded for the period was
2.3%. This low and irreguLar pattern of energy sales was mainly due to
unreliable supply and insufficient capacity to meet the load requirements.
Between June 1984 and December 1984 2 x 3.3 MW units were commissioned in the
Belize station and the present installed cap:.city is sufficient to meet the
Belize - Ladyville power demand until 1989. Between 1979 and 1984 the
average consumption per customer decreased by about 1.5% and the number of
customers grew by about 2.7%, compared to a population growth of 7.1%. Annex
3.4 shows a breakdown of sales by districts for the year 1985 as well as the
generation and losses in BEB's system.
Load Forecast
3.03      To prepare load forecasts BEB and the Hinistry of Energy and
Communications have been using the simple traditional approach of
extrapolating past trends in energy consumption. The load forecast
(Annex 3.2) upon which the proposed project was developed has been based on
a 1982 study prepared by BEB consultants Burn and Roe, USA, adjusted to
reflect .actual growth for the last two years and taking into consideration



- 10 -
the expansion of che Belize station in 1984 rather than the Ladyville
station, which involved a considerable reduction of power flow from Ladyville
to Belize City and consequently a reduction of distribution losses in the
interconnecting lines. The load forecast results in an average electricity
sales growth of 5.6% per year between 1986 and 1993 which is reasonable. A
methodologY to develop long-range forecasting vill be developed through the
training and technical assistance component of the proposed project (para.
4.06 (e)).
Existing Power Facilities
3.04      BEB's installed generating facilities consist of 29 small diesel
(between 100 kW-1400 kW) and four larger diesel units (between 2860-3080 kW)
totalling 26.4 MW, of which 16 MW is the firm capacity. The total
above-mentioned capacity is split amng ten diesel stations, two of which are
on islands (San Pedro and Caye Caulker). Load centers are not
interconnected, except for two 13 mile 22 kV transmission lines between
Ladywille and Belize City and a 15 mile 22 kV line between Belmopan and San
Ignacio (see map). Details of BEB's power generating facilities including
nomdnal, effective and firm capacity are shown in Annex 4.2.   Besides the
generating capacity owned by BEB it is estimated that the capacity of small
privately-owned generator sets approximates to 1.5 Mw. In addition the two
sugar industries generate their own requirements which amount to about 6.4
MW.
3.05      The high proportion of power generated by private industries is
caused by a historic difference in frequency (most private industries
operate at 50 Hz while the public system operates at 60 Hz) as well as the
inability of the public supply system to provide a consistently reliable
service. The proposed project will improve system reliability and enable BEB
to meet the incremental needi of some industries that operate at 60 Hz, thus
reducing the need for the installation of costly captive generating plants in
the future.
3.06      BEB delivers electricity to its consumers through a distribution
system of 65 miles of 22 kV and 6.6 kV 3-phase lines, about 25 MVA capacity
installed on several substations, and about 90 miles of low voltage
distribution lines.
Energy Losses
3.07      Despite recent improvements, electricity supply in Belize is still
unreliable and expensive. Load shedding and system outages, particularly in
the Belize-Ladyville system, are very common. Generating facilities are
unreliable due to poor preventive maintenance, lack of adequate stock of
spare parts and lack of trained personnel. The existing distribution system
is poor and unreliable due to: heavily loaded feeders, small cross sectional
areas of conductors, lack of sufficient capacitor banks to improve the system
power factor, inadequate sectionalizing and procective equipment and lack of
isolating points of the 6.6 kV system. Energy losses have reached
unacceptable levels (22Z of total net generation in 1985), of which



- 11 -
Consultants (Herz and McLellan) estimate 14Z to be non-technical losses.  The
project will address this problem through the distribution loss reduction
plaz and improvements to the existing distribution system, based on the
consultants study, Karz and KcLellan, completed in January 1986 (consisting
mainly of Line reconductoring, installation of capacitor banks, installation
of new distribution lines, upgrading and installation of meters and
enforcement of procedures to reduce unauthorized use of electricity). At the
completion of the works related to the loss reduction plan, it is expected
that the current level of losses will be reduced to about 13 percent of the
total net energy generation.
Capacity and Energy Balance
3.08      Annex 3.7 gives historical and projected energy and capacity
balances for the years 1984-1993. Firs capacity has been defined in all
stations, with the exception of Belmopan and San Pedro as the total capacity
Less the largest unit. Because of the bad condition of the engines in
Belmopan and San Pedro, firm capacity has been defined as the total capacity
less two units (the largest unit and the smallest unit). The electricity
generation requirements bave been forecast under the assumption that
technical and non-technical distribution losses will be reduced from 22X in
1985 to 13Z in 1993, as a result of the improvements in the distribution
system and implenentation of recommendations to reduce non-technical losses.
Under these conditions and with the installation of one 650 kV unit at
Belmopan in 1989, one 500 kW unit at San Pedro in 1989 and one 3,200 kW unit
at Belize station in 1990, BEB will be capable of generating its energy
requirements through 1993, when an expansion of the generating capacity will
be needed. The precise nature and timing of this expansion is to be
determined by the study for future energy sources development to be financed
under the proposed project (para. 4.06 (f)).

IV. THE PROJECT
Background
6.01      As a result of meetings held in Washington in March and June 1982
at which GOB and BEB officials expressed interest in Bank Group financing of
a power project and also of a power sector mission to Belize in March 1982, a
project was identified consisting of a 115 kV transmission link with Mexico,
improvements to the existing facilities, technical assistance and training,
consultant services and pre-investment studies.
4.02      Subsequently, preparation missions visited Belize in May 1983, May
1984 and August 1984. During the August mission, it was agreed with GOB and
BEB that before any decisions were made regarding long-term energy supply, it
would be better to proceed now with a project to meet BEB's immediate needs,
especially to strengthen BEB institutionally and to reduce the substantial
level of distribution losses.
The Project
4.03      The proposed Power Project, which represents part of BEB's
1987-1993 investment program comprises five major components: (i)
distribution program for expansion and improvements; (ii) diesel generating
sets; (iii) technical assistance and training; (iv) pre-investment studies;
and (v) consultant services for engineering and construction management.
Project Objectives
4.04       The main project objectives are:
Ca) to meet the 1987-1993 energy requirements by providing small
generating sets in the isolated parts of the electric system, as
well as portable generating units and spare parts to improve
reliability and maintenance and operating efficiency;
(b) to expand and improve BEB's primary and secondary distribution
systems to meet the 1987-1993 forecasted power and energy
requirements (Annexes 3.5 and 3.6), improve distribution
reliability, and reduce losses in the distribution systems;
(c) to help BEB achieve financial viability through greater emphasis
on proper pricing, improved operating efficiency through a
reduction of distribution losses and thefts and alsc chrough
better maintenance of BEB's facilities;
(d) to strengthen BEB by improving its organizational structure, and
management, financial and technical capability and to develop an
efficient and capable organization to handle future increasing
needs of power supply;



- 13 -
(e) to ensure that investments to be made are carried out on a
rational and cost-effective basis; and
(f) to prepare feasibility studies for long-term energy requirements
which are expected to be provided by hydro generation or the
utilization of other renewable energy sources in Belize.
Status of Project Preparation
4.05      The project is well advanced.  For the generation component of the
project, bidding documents are being prepared by BEB, and shortly after Bank
approval, tendering would begin. For the distribution component of the
project, the study of the electricity distribution system in Belize prepared
by Merz and McLellan consultants under terms of reference agreed with the
Bank and CDB, was reviewed by the Bank and found adequate. Technical
specifications and bidding documents are being prepared by the consultants,
and a complete set of documents for review by CDB and the Bank is expected to
be ready by June 1986. Terms of reference for consultant services for future
energy sources development are being drafted by BEB and invitations for the
submission of proposals by consultants are expected to be issued in October
1986. Terms of reference for consultant services for construction management
and detailed engineering work are being vrepared.
Project Description
4.06      The proposed project would be spread over several districts of
Belize (see map, No. IBRD 18929) and would include the following components:
(a) Generation
(i) Installation of one 500 kW unit, one 650 kW unit, and one
3,200 kW unit in San Pedro, Belmopan. and Belize respectively,
construction of a small power station in Punta Gorda
(approxiamtely 4,000 sq. ft.). and rellocation of one 260 kW
unit and one 300 kW unit in Punta Gorda (presently installed
in San Pedro and Belmopan).
(ii) Spare parts for the existing diesel generating sets.
(b) Distribution
Installation and reconductoring of 22 kV and 6.6 kV three phase
(approximately 22 kIs) and 110-220 volts three phase (approximately
14 kms) distribution lines. Installation of static capacitors
(about 2,500 kVAR); distribution transformers (about 3,000 kVA)
complete with sectionalizing and protective equipment; step-up
station power transformers (3,750 kVA); customers meters (11,500
customers), service drops and street lighting. This component
includes 36 ground mounted metal clad switchgears, 3 circuit
breaker reclosers, and 32 pole mounted isolating switches.



- 14 -
(c) Substations
Relocation of two 3 XVA 22/6.6 kV existing power transformers from
the Western and Northern substation to a nev substation to be built
close to the Belize power station, including the associated 22 kV
lines, switchgears, switchboard, and accessories.
(d) Vehicles and Equipment
Acquisition of equipment and tools for operation and maintenance of
the generating and distribution facilities, including 10 vehicles for
construction of the project.
(e) Training and Technical Assistance
Training and technical assistance, including the identification of
detailed training needs and implementation of a training program
(para. 4.15), and a study on BEB's organization.
(f) Engineering and Consultant Services
Ci) Consultant services for management, engineering and supervision of
the construction of the distribution and generation component of the
proposed project.
(ii) Consultant services for studies related to future energy sources
development.
Project Cost Estimate
4.07    Annex 4.1 shows a detailed estimate of the expected annual
expenditures for the project. The total project cost, including physical and
price contingencies, is estimated at about US$13.2 million, of which about
US$10.7 million would be the foreiga exchange component. Total financing
requirements including US$1.0 million interest during construction would be
US$14.2 million. A project cost summry is given in the following table.

4.08    The project base costs were estimated at December 1985 Price levels.
Cost estimates for the distribution component for the Belize-Ladyville system
were based on a January 1986 report prepared by the consultants Merz and
McLellan. Cost estimates for the generation component of the proposed
project as well as for equipment, tools and vehicles were estimated by BE8
and the Bank mission, based on recent quotations received from
manufacturers. The cost estimates for consultant services were based on
average staff-month costs using Bank experience for similar services. These
costs include salary, overhead costs, fees, international travel and
subsistence.
4.09    Physical contingencies were calculated by the Bank at 1Z of the base
cost for all components except distribution. For this component 20% was
used. Price contingencies, for both foreign and local components, were
applied to the base cost plus physical contingencies, using the following
annual escalation factors: 7.2% for 1986, 6.8% for 1987-88, 72 for 1989, 7.1Z
for 1990 and 4% for 1991-93. Import taxes and other duties are not included
in the above estimates because BEB is exempt from these charges.
Project Financing Plan
4.10    The project financing plan is shown in the Table below and details of
the financing plan as well as the agreed project packages are given in
Annex 4.3. The terms under which finance would be made available to BEB are
described in para. 5.09.

Responsibility for engineering and construction is described in the following
paragraphs.
4.12    Given the type of work required for implementation of the
distribution component of the project, which involves mainly reconductoring
of existing distribution lines, construction would be carried out through
BEB's force account with the assistance of expatriate linemen financed by the
Bank. This is acceptable to the Bank. A detailed plan of action for
implementation of this component was agreed during negotiations.
It was agreed that training of BEB's personnel as well as the purchase of
special tools to work on energized lines would be required. BEB requested
retroactive financial assistance from the Bank for this purpose up to the
amount of US$350,000. Procurement of these services and equipment would be
carried out following Bank guidelines. In view of the above, the loan
includes retroactive financing of up to US$350,000. Erection of the diesel
generating sets would be carried out through BEB's force account with the
assistance of the manufacturers (para. 4.19). Construction of civil works
for the Punta Gorda power station would be done through local contractors
(para. 4.19).
4.13      The engineering (preparation of detailed engineering work,
preparation of bidding documents 2/, evaluation of bids and supervision of
the construction) required for the execation of the distribution and
generation component of the project would be performed with the assistance of
consultants. A condition of loan effectiveness should be the appointment of
consultants whose qualifications, and terms and conditions of employment are
acceptable to the Bank ((para.7.02(ii)).
Consultant Services
4.14    The proposed project includes consultant s services  to be engaged by
BEB following the Bank's guidelines and under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank for the following tasks:
2/   Except bidding documents for the diesel generating sets which would be
prepared by BEB with Bank staff assistance.



- 18 -
(i) the preparation of feJsibllity studies to develop future hydro-
generation or utilizatioc of other renewable energy resources in
Belize to meet medium and long-term energy requiremnts. Among
other electricity supply alternatives the interconnection with
Mexico would be considered. These services will be provided by a
firz of Consultants, for which 55 staff-monthe are estimated to be
required. The contract charges vill be of the staff-month type
with an overall tim Celing which could be exceeded only by mutual
agreement between UBD and the consultant with the Bank's approval;
and
(ii)  Managemnt, engineering and supervision of the construction of the
generation and distribution component of the proposed project, for
which a total of about 200 staff-months are estimated to be
required. The baslas and form of contract would be the same as the
one described in the paragraph above.
TrainiD
4.15      A coWprehensive five-year training and technical assistance program
would be included in the project to identify specific training needs of BEB.
A preliminary training progra has already been prepared (paras. 2.09 - 2.10)
with the assistance of Bank staff. The immediate thrust of training efforts
would be to strengthen BEB's capability in the maintenance and operation of
its distribution and generating facilities, engineering and planning and
administration and finance (par&. 2.09).

4.17      Contracts for the supply of equipment and materials for the
generation component of the project, tools, equipment and vehicles (to be
financed by the Bank) as well as equipment and materials for the distribution
component of the project (to be financed by CDB) will be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank and CDB
procurement guidelines respectively. Direct purchase of spare parts (abott
USS0.74 million) from original manufacturers of the diesel engines, to be
financed by the Bank will be appropriate.   Goods and services to be financed
by BEB would be procured under local competitive procedures, which have been
examined and found to be satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for tools and
other small miscellaneous equipment valued at less than USS100,000 will be
purchased through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) in which foreign suppliers
are eligible to participate.
4.18      Consultant's services (engineering, supervision of construction and
studies) will be secured, following Bank guidelines. Training equipment and
materials, which are part of the training and technical assistance program,
will be procured through limited international bidding (LIB).
4.19      The erection of the two small generating sets (500 kW and 650 kU)
for San Pedro and Belmopan and one 3.2 MW tnit in Belize station as well as
the small related civil works to be financed by BEB will be implemented
through BEB's force account with the assistance of the manufacturer.  This is
acceptable to the Bank since BEB has sufficient and capable personnel to
perform this work and has proven experiences in similar works recently
completed.  Construction of civil works for the Punta Gorda power station
(US$0.33 million to be financed by BEB) are dot likely to interest foreign
bidders.  These works will be provided by local contractors through LCB.
Machinery and equipment will be grouped whenever possible into contracts
valued at US5100,000 or more.  Preference for bid evaluation purposes for
local manufacturers and contractors has not been requested by the Government.
Disbursements
4.20      The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over
seven years (Annex 4.5). The disbursement schedule reflects IBRD standard
disbursement profiles which are based on the Bank's experience in similar
projects. Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be used to finance:
(i) 100% of foreign expenditures and 90Z of local expenditures for
training, studies, and engineering services;
(ii)  10OZ of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for
equipment and materials for the generation component of the
proposed project;
(iii) 100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures, up to
USS0.4 million, for the purchase of vehicles; and
(iv)  100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures, up to
USS0.1 million, for the purchase of tools.



- 21 -
Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for imported goods
whose value is less than US$20,000 equivalent.. Claims for expenditures of
these lesser amounts would be subject to presentation of a statement of
expenditures for which the supporting documeatation would not be sent to the
Bank but would be retained by BEB for periodic inspection by the Bank. A
special account would be established in the Central Bank of Belize With a
deposit of USS0.5 million. Periodic replenishment would be made to this
special account against withdrawal applications received from BEB and
supported by such documents as the Bank would require. The Borrower would be
required to have annual audits for the project accounts, special account and
withdrawals based on statement of expenditures. Retroactive financing for up
to US$350,000 is proposed for payment of training of linemen and training
officer (US$250,000), and of the purchase of special tools (up to US$100,000)
incurred by the Borrower after March 18, 1986. The closing date would be
December 31, 1993, six months after estimated completion of the project.
Environmental Effects
4.21      The proposed project would not have a detrimental impact on the
environment, as it comprises only: (i) extensions and conversions or
upgrading of low and medium voltage distribution lines and will, in most
cases, follow established rights-of-way with land clearing and visual impact
kept to a minim,m; and (ii) diesel generating sets that will be installed in
the existing power generation facilities where presently no er-vironmental
effect exist.
Project Risks
4.22      The project faces no major physical risks.  Th2 distribution works
and installation of small diesel sets are standard and :he implementation
schedule assumed for the project is reasonable and takes into consideration
normal engineering administrative and construction pr cedures.  Possible
hurricane damage presents a risk to projects in Belize. To minimize the
associated technical risks, the new distribution lines will be designed in
accordance with economic and technical considerations taking into account
that winds of about 130 miles per hour are relatively common in the region.
Delays in project execution could arise due to 3E5's Lack of experience with
Large projects as well as with Bank loans and procedures. To minimize this
risk, provision has been made to engage ergineering consultants (para.
4.06(f)) to assist BEB in the implementation of the proposed project. BEB's
technical staff will also be assisted by Bank's staff in matters related to
Bank procedures.

7. FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      Through FY84 BEB's financial performance was extremely weak.
Despite high rates for the sale of electricity (which increased from
US$0.12/kWh in FY79 to USS0.18/kWh in FY84) the company consistently incurred
operating losses. BEB had to obtain assistance from the GOB, which funded,
through loans, (of which SzS7.5 million were converted into equity in FY81),
BEE's debt service and investments. This inability to achieve a positive
internal cash generation, coupled with excessive reliaace on borrowings,
progressively weakened BEB's finances to the point that by March 31, 1984 the
utility had no equity base and current assets amounted to only 772 of current
liabilities.
5.02      Faced with this calamitous situation, the GOB took three important
measures: (a) it increased electricity-rates even further to USS0.21/kwh
(including the fuel charge, which was consolidated with the basic rate -
para. 1.10; when fuel prices started to decline in recent months this
decision resulted in a significant incr2ase in net revenues); (b) it offset
debts of BEB to GOB against receivables accrued from the sale of electricity,
which had built-up to a significant amount, and capitalized the net balance
of BEB's debts-to GOB, thereby creating a positive equity base and
significantly improving the utility's financial structure; and (c) it
undertook to service BEB 's non-Government existing debts, treating as an
equity contribution the difference between these payments and the value of
electricity sales by BEB to GOB. Thus, BEB is now in a position that should
enable it to be financially independent from GOB shortly and, to the extent
that it improves its efficiency, eventually allow it to start paying cash
dividends.
Past Financial Performance
5.03      Electricity production costs in Belize have been exceptionally
high, mainly because of the use of small generating units which use costly
diesel oil, the low fuel efficiency standards of BEB and costly and
ineffective maintenance. In the five fiscal years 1982-86 fuel costs
accounted for about 582 of revenues.
5.04      In the first three of the five fiscal years FY82-86 BEB's operating
revenues covered only 78 to 89 percent of operating expenses. Operating
losses reached a peak level in FY84, which was an exceptionally poor year
because of lost revenues caused by frequent load shedding. In FY85 and FY86
the past pattern of annual losses was reversed and BEB achieved a positive
net operating income. This was brought about by (a) an 182 increase in kWh
sales through substantially reduced power outages; (b) a 132 tariff increase
In June 1984 (para. 1.10); (c) improved plant performance; and (d) reductions
in personnel (para. 2.04) and administrative costs.
5.05      BEB's estimated balance sheet at March 31, 1986 (unaudited) which
is summarized below, indicates that its financial position is satisfactory



- 23 -
with current assets equalling 1.3 times current liabilities and a favorable
debt/equity ratio of 32:68.

5.06      Aboue 57% of BEB's medium- and long- term debt outstanding at March
31, 1986 is due for repayment in FY87 and FY88. These repayments are largely
on medium-term loans from equipment suppliers and banks.  It was agreed
during negotiations that, unless the Bank should otherwise agree, GOB will
make all debt payments on behalf of BEB on BEB's outstanding debt at March
31, 1986.  To the extent that such payments exceed GOB's electricity
billings, the excess will be treated as a long-term subordinated loan to BEB
to be formalized under contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 7.01(a)(i)). It is expected that, from FY89 onwards, aounts due from
GOB for electricity sales will exceed debt payments on debt outstanding at
March 31, 19d6. To ensure that BEl's cash flow is not jeopardized, GOB has
agreed that it wlll take all measures necessary to ensure that itself, its
agencies and its municipalities pay their electricity bills within sixty days
from their billing date (para. 7.01(a)(ii)).
Asset Valuation
5.07      As required uuder its loan agreement with COB, in 1981 revaluation
of BEB's fixed assets was carried out by independent consultants (Stone &
Webster Appraisal Corporation), and appears satisfactory. At that time it
was estimated that the net value of the fixed assats was 2.5 times the net
book value. To protect BEB's rate base from the erosion brought about by
inflation, it was agreed during negotiations that BEB's fixed assets will be
revalued from time to time in a sanner satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.01
(b)(viii)). We would expect BEB to revalue every time the accumlated



- 24 -
increase since the previous asset revaluation in the local prices of
electrical equipment, as measured by the product of the Randy-IJhitman index
(which would measure the foreign cost) and the exchange rate exceeds 10Z. In
accordance with normal accounting practice in Belize, the revaluation will
not be included in BEB's audited income statements and balance sheets, but it
was agreed during negotiations that the revaluation and restated net income
after revalued depreciation will be presented as suppleum"ntary information to
the audited accounts (para. 7.01(b)(viii)).
Financing Plan
5.08      BEB's capital spending requirements and financing plan during the
FY87-93 project implementation period are as follows:

5.09      In the financing plan it has been assumed that the Bank loan of
BZS14.85 million (US$7.5 million) would be made available by the Government
to BEB on the same terms and conditions: 17 years maturity, including a
4-year grace period, at an adjustable interest rate of presently 8.5Z.
During negotiations agreement was reached with GOB that it will relend the
proceeds of the loan to BEB under a subsidiary loan agreement for a term of
17 years including a 4 year grace period. Execution of the subsidiary loan
agreement would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para.7.02 (iii)). The
foreign exchange and interest rate risk on the Bank loan would be borne by
BEB. CDC and CDB loans have been assumed to be made available to BEB on the
same terms as the Bank loan. As in the case of the Bank loan it is expected
that the CDC and CDB loans would be to Belize with onlending to BEB.
5.10      CDC have indicated that it is unlikely that they would undertake a
field appraisal of the project. Instead they would use the Bank appraisal
report as the principal document for their evaluation of the project. CDC
expect that the project would be approved within three months of receipt of
the appraisal report.
5.11      CDB scheduled the appraisal of the project for May 1986 and loan
approval for September 1986. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan, CDB and CDC shouLd have notified the Bank that all conditions precedent
to the effectiveness or of the first disbursement of their finance have been
fulfilled subject only to the effectiveness of their loans (para. 7.02 (iv)).
Electricity Rates
5.12      Between FY79 and FY84 BEB's rates for the sale of electricity were
increased by about 502 as a result of a fuel surcharge introduced in May
1979. In June 1984 the fuel surcharge was abolished and a flat charge per
kWh was introduced which increased average revenues by about 13% to 22 US
cents per kWh. In March 1986 it was decided to reduce electricity rates by
2 Bz cents per kWh from April 1986 to partially reflect recent reductions in
oLl prices.
5.13      Under the 1980 CDB loan agreement (which was terminated in 1984 -
para. 1.11) BEB was to set electricity rates at a level sufficient to produce
rates of return on revalued net fixed assets of not less than 6% in 1982, 7%
in 1983 and 8% thereafter. Despite high rate levels, up to FY85 BEB had
negative rates of return. However, with the June 1984 rate increase and
with the reduction in power losses and outages, BEB's FY85 and FY86 revenues
covered operating expenses and resulted in a positive operating income. With
the reduction of distribution losses and improved maintenance as a result of
the project BEB should be able to improve its financial pe_formance without
real increases in its high electricity rates. Electricity prices may in fact
fall in real terms if oil prices behave as currently assumed.
5.14     To ensure that BEB's finances remain on a sound footing and the
project is executed in time, it was agreed during negotiations that BEB will
maintain its electricity rates at a level which will yield rates of return on
average net fixed assets in operation (revalued from time to time, see



- 26 -
para. 5.08) of not less than 4.52 ln FY87, 62 ln FY88 and 72 in each flscal
year thereafter. At negotiations lt was also agreed that before October 1 of
each year BEB vill furnish to the Bank a preliminary estimate of its rate of
return for the ongoing fiscal year and a forecast for the next fiscal year
(para. 7.01 (b)(ix)). It was also agreed that, If the estimates indicate
that BEB would not meet the rate of return requirements, it will promptly
take all necessary measures in order to meet such requirements (para. 7.01
(b)(x) and para. 7.01 (a)(ili)).
Financial Prospects
5.15      Forecast key financial Indicators are shown in Annex 5.4.
Historical (FY82-FY85) and projected (FY86-FY94) income, balance sheet and
cash flow statements together with notes and assumptLons, are shown in
Annexes 5.1-5.3.
5.16      The financial projections are based on the assumption that BEB
would increase its electricity rates on April 1 each year, as required to
meet the rate-of-return objectLves referred to in para. 5.14. This is
estimated to require modest nominal rate increases: FY88 1.52; FY89 3.82;
FY90 2.8%; FY91 2.5Z; FY92 6.32; FY93 7.4Z; FY94 7.62. These rate increases
are based on conservatlve assumptLons; to the extent that BER is able to
achieve larger than forecasted efficLency improvements, or if oll prices
remain at their present level longer than envisaged, it is conceivable that
no rate increases would be required. If the forecast rates of return are
met, BEB Is expected to achieve a strong level of financial viability. The
financial projections presented in Annexes 5.1 - 5.4 assume a prudent use of
borrowings from here on, which will be reflected in low indebtedness ratios.
BEB's cash position would be significantly strengthened, allowing BEB to
increase its revenues through interest income from short term placements.
Thus, once the project is completed, BEB should be in a condition to
self-finance a signlficant proportlon of its future investments. Debt
servLce coverage would be not less than 1.52 from FY88 onwards.
5.17      To protect BEB's financial vlability it was agreed during
negotiations that (a) BEB would not incur any new debts (other than those
envisaged in the financing plan for the project, para. 4.09) or pay cash
dividends, without the prior approval of the Bank, unless its debt service
coverage ratio is 1.5 or higher (para. 7.01 (b)(xi)); and (b) BEB would not
undertake any investments ln excess of S250,000 (other than those included
under the project) until project completion, unless it has furnished the Bank
with satisfactory evidence that such investments are technically, financially
and economically justified and that BEE will have adequate financial
resources to carry out the investments (para. 7.01 (b)(xii)). It was also
agreed that GOB would not undertake any power sector investments during the
same period without Bank consultation (para. 7.01 (a)(iv)).

Performance Indicators and USporting
5.18      Annex 4.4 shows BEB's expected perfocaance indicators, which would
be moitored during project execution. During negotiations it was agreed
that, within six oonths of project completion, 8EB will submit a completion
report to the Bank, based on an outline to be agreed with the Bank (para.
7.01 (b)(xiii)).

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
6.01      The size and characteristics of the new generating units to be
installed in Belmopan (650 kW) and San Pedro (500 kW) have been selected
taking into consideration space limitations in the existing power stations
where the new units will be installed, as well as taking into account the
need to increase the firm capacity in order to meet the power requirements
through 1993. The new unit in Belmopan will be installed to replace an old
300 kW unit and the new unit in San Pedro will replace two 250 kW units.
Therefore, the investment of USS 1.0 million (including physical and price
contingencies) is the least-cost solution and no other alternative exists.
In the case of the Belize-Ladyville system, the rehabilitation of one 2.2 MW
unit (purchase of prime mover and accesories USS 1.3 million) is the
least-cost solution to meet load requirements through 1993.
6.02      Given the reduced extension of the distribution networks and the
magnitude of the loads, the existing voltage levels (6.6 kV and 22 kV) are
considered adequate to handle the load through 1993. Therefore, improvements
and expansion of the distribution networks will be done using the existing
voltage levels. There are no alternatives for improvements or iDdifications
to the existing configuration of the distribution systems other than
optimizing conductor and capacitor sizing. Sizing of primary and secondary
lines and capacitor banks were duly optimized.
Economic Benef its
6.03      The economic benefits to be obtained from the proposed 1987-1993
investment program include: (i) allowing BEB to meet its incremental sales
for the period; and (ii) fuel savings resulting from reduction of the
distribution losses. The justification and the quantification procedure for
each of the above benefits are below:
(i) Incremental Sales: All incremental sales during the 1988-1993
period in the districts of Belize-Ladyville, Belmopan-San Ignacio
and San Pedro, are assumed to be met as a result of the proposed
project3/. In the other districts BEB has sufficient installed
capacity to meet -the projected loads. The incremental sales are
those over the 1988 level (i.e. incremental sales after
commissioning of the generating facilities). The project benefits
were measured using the tariff in effect as at April 1986 (about
0.3971 BzS/kWh) and the project is assumed to yield benefits for a
20-year period;
3/  This assumption is reasonable. The amount of incremental sales represents:
(i) in Belize-Ladyville the contribution of the new unit amounts to 18Z of
its generating capacity at 0.70 load factor in 1990 and increasing to 100% in
the sixth year; (ii) in Belmopan the contribution of the new unit is 15% in
1989 and 100Z in the sixth year at 0.6 load factor; and (iii) in San Pedro
the contribution is 5Z in 1989 and 40% in the sixth year at 0.5 load factor.



-29 -
(ii) Loss reduction: It is anticipated that by 1990 the
distribution facilities would be fully commissioned and the level
of distribution losses reduced from 22% (as a percentage of net
generation) to 13%. This would be the result of the upgrading and
improvement of the primary and secondary distribution lines as well
as improvements in metering facilities and enforcement of
procedures to reduce unauthorized use of electricity. These
procedures, which are not directly related to the project
investment, are estimated to account for about 20% of the projected
reduction in losses. The investment in the project will account
for the other 80%. Reduction of losses result in lower energy
requirements at the generating stations (Annex 2.5) at any level of
sales. The benefits were quantified as the associated cost of fuel
savings at March 1986 price levels 4/.
Economic Costs
6.04      The economic costs of the project are capital investments valued at
constant December 1985 prices and the fuel and other operating and
maintenance costs associar i with the incremental energy sales.
Return on the Investment
6.05      The rate of return has been calculated for the project which
represents the complete 1987-1993 investment program (Annex 4.1). The cost
and benefit streams associated with the investment program are shown in
Annex 6.1, and the underlying assumptions appear as footnotes to the Annex.
The rate of return of the corresponding investment was estimated as the
discount rate which equalizes the present values of the economic net cost and
benefit streams associated with the investment program. The rate of return
obtained for the base case was about 12.3% (See Annex 6.2), which compares
reasonably with the economic cost of capital in Belize which is estimated to
be between 10% and 12% and which suggests that the average electricity rate
levels are close to the average incremental cost. The 12.3% rate of return
probably understates the real economic rate of return of the project, as
revenues from the sales of electricity may not fully measure some of the
benefits to society, such as the social benefits of residential and public
uses, or the indirect benefits to industry and co-mmrce, whose production and
employment depend on reliable electricity supply. Furthermore, the social
impact of the project is difficult to measure because of inadequate data.
The inclusion of social benefits, would show higher internal rates of
return. Shadow pricing for local currency labor costs and foreign exchange
were not considered necessary because market values in Belize can be
considered reasonably close to the opportunity cost of labor and the rate of
exchange appears to be realistic and does not need adjustment.
4/   For incremental sales beyond 1988 the benefits from reduced losses were
incorporated into the computation in subparagraph Ci) above. Therefore, to
avoid double counting, the benefits in subparagraph (li) were computed at the
1986 sales level.



- 30 -
6.06      Tests were performed to determine the sensitivity of the internal
rate of return to variou%, key paraseters. The results were as follows:
Scenario                    Rate of Return (S)
1. Base Case                            12.3
2. Capital Costs up  10%                10.7
3. 0 & X Costs up 1O%                    9.9
4. Benefits down 102                      7.7
5. Benefits -up 1OZ                     16.3
6.07      The rate of return is not very sensitive to variations in cost but
is very sensitive to small variations in benefits as a result of the higb
proportion of benefits due to incremental sales compared with those derived
from fuel cost savings.

VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  with Government that:
(i) unless the Bank should otherwise agree, it will make all debt
payments on BEB's outstanding debt as of March 31, 1986 and
that in those fiscal years where such payments exceed the
amount due from the Government to BEB for electricity purchases
the excess will be treated as a long-term subordinated loan to
BEB and that if and when electricity purchases exceed such
debt payments the Government will pay BEB the difference
within 60 days (para. 5.06);
(ii) it would take all measures necessary to ensure that itself, its
agencies and its municipalities pay their electricity bills
within 60 days from their billing date (para. 5.06);
(iii) it would promptly take all such measures as may be required to
comply with BEB's rate of return undertakings (para. 5.14); and
(iv) until project completion, it would not undertake any
investments in the power sector without prior consultation with
the Bank (para. 5.17)
(b) with BEB that it:
(i) would, not later than December 31, 1986, ewploy consultants to
complete a study of BEB's organization and would promptly
Implement such recommendations as are agreed upon (para. 2.03);
(ii) would maintain the position of Management and Financial Advisor
until the Bank and BEB agree that it is no longer necessary
(para. 2.06);
(iii) would appoint to the positions of General Manager and of
Financial Controller only persons having qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.07);



- 32 -
(iv)  would appoint by December 31, 1986 an Assistant Financial
Controller, with qualifications and experience satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 2.08);
(v) would not later than December 31, 1986 appoint a Training
Advisor acceptable to the Bank (paras. 2.09 and 2.10);
(vi)  would not later than March 31, 1987 submit a detailed training
program to the Bank and, after taking into account the Bank's
comments, promptly implement such program (para. 2.09);
(vii) would engage independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
would furnish to the Bank audited financial statements not later
than six months after the end of FY87 and FY88, and not later
than four months after the end of the fiscal year thereafter
(para. 2.13);
(viii) would revalue its assets from time to time in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, and would cause its auditors to provide
an opinion on the revaluation calculations provided as
supplementary information to the audited accounts (para. 5.07);
(ix)  would maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to earn a rate
of return on its average revalued net fixed assets in operation
of not less than 4.5Z in FY87, 6Z in FY88 and 7Z in each fiscal
year thereafter (para. 5.14);
[x) would before October 1 of each year furnish to the Bank a
preliminary estimate of its rate of return for the ongoing fiscal
year and a forecast for the next fiscal year and, if needed,
promptly take all necessary measures to meet the agreed rate cf
return requirement (para. 5.14);
Cxi)  would not incur any new debt (other than those envisaged in the
financing plan for the project) or pay cash dividends, unless its
debt service coverage ratio is 1.5 or higher (para. 5.17);
(xii) would not undertake any investments in excess of US$250,000 until
project completion without furnishing the Bank with satisfactory
evidence that they are justified (para. 5.17); and
(xiii) would within six months of project completion submit a completion
report to the Bank (para. 5.18).
7.02        Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
Ci) BEB appoint a Project Coordinator acceptable to the Bank (para.
2.05);



- 33 -
(ii)  BEB employ consultants for the preparation of detailed engineering
work and supervision and manageenut of the project (para. 4.13)
(iii) a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement has been executed between
Government and BEB (para. 5.09); and
(iv) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of CDB and CDC finance
have been met (para. 5.11).
7.03      With the above agreements the proposed project would be sultable
for a Bank loan of US$7.5 million. The loan would include retroactive
financing up to US$350,000.
