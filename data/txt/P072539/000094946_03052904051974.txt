Kerala State Transport Project                 Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR
IWT PILOT PROJECT
1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
This report is concerned with the practical aspects of implementation of all major waterway
improvement components of the Inland Water Transport Pilot project. The entire programme
forms part of the Phase-I KSTP project. The report has been prepared to address all
uncertainties and missing links identified by the World Bank team after (1) the ESAMP report
submitted earlier in June 2002 and (2) subsequent WB mission in July-August 2002. In
addition to the World Bank team from Delhi, the Regional Safe Guard Coordinator, South
Asia, was also participated in the team as head of the mission. During the visit, the mission
team also visited the Alappuzha-Kottayam canal for understanding the ground situation. This
is a revised report of the IWT Implementation Plan incorporating all World Bank
observations on the draft document submitted to WB in September 2002.
2 NEED FOR AN IWT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The WB aide memoire dated August 21, 2002, clearly identified each item, which require
immediate attention to evolve a practical approach that can be implemented. The
implementation plan prepared will be a 'supplement' to the ESAMP report submitted earlier
in June 2002. Few activities have been dropped and some new items have been included. The
provision in the BOQ has been revised subsequent to these changes in the ESAMP. In this
way the ESAMP document remains as the base document with all subsequent changes
mentioned in this document. The ESAMP and the implementation plan documents will be
part of the contract documents.
3 FOLLOW UP ACTION
The GOK and the KSTP Project Management Team (PMT) and the Project Coordinating
Consultants (PCC) have taken a number of measures subsequent to the submission of this
document. The institutional aspects are separately discussed under a different heading.
1. A meeting with IWAI regarding a matching terminal arrangement with IWT proposals
have been conducted at Kochi on August 12, 2002. The draft minutes of meeting
carried out with IWAI official at Kochi is enclosed as annexure-1.
2. The involvement of the engineers from Water Resources Department (WRD) for the
dredge disposal arrangements including land identification for mass balance (dredging
versus disposal) of the dredge materials.
3. Reconstitution of the Task Force and a meeting convened immediately after the
preparation of an implementation plan on October 11, 2002. The annexure-2 is the
GO for Task Force reconstituted under vide G.O (Rt) No: 11/2002/CSIND TVM
dated 7-9-2002.
4. A technical session has been conducted on October 10, 2002 for the water hyacinth
management to control excessive growth of waterweeds during the operational period
of IWT pilot project. This has enabled the government to use various research input
in to the IWT pilot component. For this session very important resource persons in
the field have been invited and their ideas and concepts discussed with a select group
of experts.

Kerala State Transport Project                Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
3.1 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The intuitional aspect of the project implementation is provided in figure 1.0. The various
institutional arrangements are spread over to three layers of involvement. The parent
organisation i.e., the Water Resources Department (WRD) at the State level, the Project
Management Team (PMT) at Project Implementation Level at Thiruvananthapuram and the
IWT execution level at Kottayam are the three levels of involvement.
3.1.1 WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
The Secretary, Water Resource Department (WRD) is also a member of the KSTP project
level Steering committee, which will be taking all policy decisions. As a State level organisation
with the Chief Engineer (WRD) stationed at Thiruvananthapuram, the department will be
assisting PMT to address all institutional difficulties such as interagency linkages and to
resolve interdepartmental conflicts if any arising during pre-construction, construction and
operational level.
3.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM
The Superintending Engineer, Executive Engineer and Assistant Engineer forming part of the
IWT team in the PMT. They have been deputed from the WRD to coordinate the
implementation of the IWT component. They will be responsible for the implementation of
the ESAMP & IP. The Environmental Engineer and Sociologist of the Project Management
Team will provide support to the IWT team to ensure that the environmental and social
aspects of the IWT component are implemented.
3.1.3 IWT DIVISION AT KOTTAYAM.
The IWT division will be headed by an Executive Engineer at Kottayam. There would be one
Assistant Executive Engineer supported by nine assistant engineers. The division is exclusively
for the implementation of the Inland Water Transport Pilot Project. All the staff has been
identified. The institutional arrangements for IWT division at Kottayam are to be in place two
months before the commencement of the construction. As the construction is expected to
start in April 2003 the Kottayam division will be formed by first February 2003.
3.1.4 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
ASPECTS
The Contractor will be implementing the ESAMP & IP. These form a part of the contract
documents. The Waterways Specialist of the supervision consultants will be supervising the
implementation of the ESAMP & IP. From the Kottayam division, three assistant engineers
(one per canal) will be responsible for the supervision arrangements during the project
implementation stage. The three Assistant engineers will be reporting to the Assistant
Executive Engineer/Executive Engineer will be monitoring the over all progress of the
implementation of ESAMP & IP recommendations.
3.1.5 CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING.
The identified six engineers from the WRD from Alappuzha and Kottayam divisions
including an Executive Engineer of PMT and a Superintending Engineer (at present working
for the IWT component) have under gone training on environmental and social aspects
carried out by the KSTP project at Thiruvananthapuram.

Kerala State Transport Project                Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
Proposal for water hyacinth management based on the decisions of the last meeting
will also be discussed.
3.3 CITIZEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE
The Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) for the IWT will be formed in February 2003 with
support from NGO. The committee will meet once in six months and as and when required.
The committee will provide advice, support and guidance to the Kottayam IWT division and
the NGO. The Government order No GO (Rt) No.976/2002/PWD dated 23.10-2002 for
this has been issued as provided in annexure-5.
3.4 CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION CONSULTANTS (CSC)
The supervision consultants for the IWT work have been identified. Arrangements have been
made to include an additional position of Waterway Specialist proposed by the Bank mission
in July-August 2002. The Waterways specialist will supervise the implementation of the IWT
component including the ESAMP & IP recommendations.
3.5 CONTRACTORS
The appointment of contractors will be completed by March 2003. The contractor is also
required to have an environmental position in their team. The procedures for the
appointment of contractors will be started as soon as the implementation plan prepared by
the project has been approved and the BOQ and other contracting documents have been
finalised (expected in November 2002).
3.6 NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGAINISATION (NGO)
Although there are no land acquisition and no Resettlement Action Plan prepared for the
IWT component of the Project, the involvement of a Non Governmental Organisation has
been planned from the very beginning stage. The NGO will assist for all activities as and
when required especially for the Public Awareness Programme (Refer section 4.2 for more
details). The NGO selected for Alappuzha-Changanaserry highways component will address
all environmental and social work for the IWT pilot project. The NGO will assist in various
community consultation requirements regarding the water hyacinth disposal, dredge disposal
plan, bathing ghat arrangements etc. The Terms of Reference (ToR) for NGO have been
already part of the appointed NGO contract. The document has not defined the nature of
work related to IWT pilot component. Therefore, the Implementation plan prepared for
IWT, as a part of ESAMP defined the works related to IWT component. This is enclosed as
annexure-6. This will be part of the TOR prepared for the NGO's.
3.7 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Immediately after obtaining the World Bank approval on the Implementation Plan (lP) for
the IWT pilot project, the KSTP will disclose all documents in the Nedumudi and Kavalam
panchayath offices and also in the public information centre at Kottayam and Alappuzha
district collectorates. The executive summary prepared earlier in Malayalam (local language)
will be revised according to this document and disclosed at all selected places. The GOK will
send the documents for disclosure to simultaneously disclose the information in WB
Washington and New Delhi offices.

Kerala State Transport Project                   Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
4 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR EACH ACTIVITY
The entire project has been planned to execute with in a time frame of 24 months. The
construction activities are expected to start in April 2003. The activity schedule' described in
section 5.0 clearly defines which activity precedes which activity.
4.1 MOBILISATION
This includes mobilisation of equipment for geo-technical investigation and dredging,
construction of office, campsites and to establish laboratories for testing. Identification of
borrow areas and locating the material sources for construction. The dredge material and
water hyacinth disposal agreements with the landowner, etc. An estimated three months is
provided to mobilise all equipments and arrangements. A total of ninety days duration has
been considered for the mobilisation since the start of the construction contract. During the
same period the contractor will carry out sampling and testing of sediments as described in
section 4.7.
4.2 SITE CLEARANCE
The site clearance include pruning of trees that are hanging towards canal from the adjacent
land and properties especially along the narrow sections of the canal. The involvement of
NGOs will be required for pruning as there could be slight resistance from the landowners.
The site clearance must also include any other material that will hamper the construction
activities. For example, removal of tree (mainly coconut) stumps erected in the waterways at
few locations or any other obstructions. However under the name of site clearance, the
footbridges or any other structures used by the local people should not be demolished till the
preparation of a clear-cut reconstruction plan. During this period the Contractor will arrange
necessary alternatives.
4.3 WATER HYACINTH REMOVAL & DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS
Construction Phase - Weed control and Management: During construction period, the
contractor will have to clear the water hyacinth along the waterways after three months of
mobilisation till the handing over of the waterways. The occurrence of the water hyacinth
varies from season to season depending on many factors especially the water flow along the
canal and the monsoon season. The water hyacinth will be removed by manual process. The
contractors will remove the water hyacinth and this has been built in to the contract as a
payable item in the Contract documents. The gloves and foot wear will be given to labourers
to work safely as there could be presence of insects and snakes2. The contractor will deposit
the manually removed water hyacinth on the coconut plantations as a mulch3. Traditionally
these materials have been used as a 'mulching material' for coconut plantations. At present
there is nothing that will be against the continuing of this tradition. Apart from use as
mulching material other uses include paper pulp, fish feed, compost etc. Prior to deciding of
the application the contractor will seek the clearance of the CSC.
IContractor will prepare a work plan after considering the various environmental and social requirements
2 Some of the participants in the meeting at Kottayam stated that there is a sharp increase in the snakebite
cases In the Kuttanad area.
3A mass of leaves, bark, or compost spread around or over a plant for protection or to enrich the soil.

Kerala State Transport Project                Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
Operational Phase Weed Control and Management. The water hyacinth removal and
disposal arrangements during the operational stage will apply a multi pronged approach such
as mechanical and manual for removal and disposal applications such as mulching, compost
making, pulp making for paper, fish feed material for certain fishes etc. The annexure-7 is the
GOK expert panel 2002 recommendations regarding the opening of Thannermukkom bund
which till recently thought to the best solution for the water hyacinth management. The
minutes of meeting regarding the water hyacinth management held at Kottayam is enclosed
as in annexure-8.
4.3.1 BIOREMEDIATION MEASURES
The WB team has recommended to revisit the proposed experimentation of bioremediation
measures considered earlier, which is cost intensive and not successfully proved instead to
compose a forum for discussion with experts in the field to plan the future activities. The bio
remediation measures have been dropped from further consideration.
4.4 PRE-CONSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION AND SURVEYS
The contractor will carry out all necessary surveys including sounding for the determination
of depth. This is required as the original survey was carried out in early 2000 and there could
be considerable erosion, deposition and siltation. In addition to the complete inventory
surveys the surveys will also include hydro graphic surveys, surveys regarding jetties,
terminals, existing traffic, passenger movements, cargo handling etc.
4.5 BANK PROTECTION
The PMT and PCC team have carried out a number of discussions regarding the schedule of
the bank protection versus dredging. Since the depth of dredging is minimum of the order of
less than one metre only, the bank protection will be completed first followed by dredging.
The recommendations of the PCC engineering team during project preparations were in this
line. Under the present circumstances and as agreed with World Bank, the dredge material
will be used for embankment protection only. If the test results that will be taken up during
the construction period indicate less contamination, then the material could be of use for
other applications including permissible land filling.
4.6 DREDGING AND DREDGE DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS
The entire dredging activities will be undertaken by two proposed methods of dredging Viz,
hydraulic and mechanical dredging. The hydraulic dredging cannot be undertaken in narrow
canals. At these narrow locations mechanical dredging will be under taken. Out of the total

AK canal. Any section from chainage 0-17km, hydraulic dredging is the possibility. At these
locations, the canal is very wide and the padashekarams are available where the bunds will be
raised as per the design provided (Figure 2.0). In the remaining portion mechanical dredging
is the possibility. The exhibit 4.1A of ESAMP4 Volume-1 Oine diagram of project canal)
provides the three sections where dredging will take place along this canal. The annexure-9 is
the disposal arrangements for this canal.
KV canal. Mechanical dredging is the only possibility along this canal from 0-24.5 km. The
entire dredged material will be used for strengthening of the embankment height as per the
design provided (Figure 2.0) and annexure-10 is the disposal arrangements for the KV canal.
The exhibit 4. 1B of ESAMP Volume-1 Oine diagram of project canal) provides the section
where dredging will take place along this canal.
AC canal. Any sections from chainage 0-22km hydraulic dredging is the possibility. At these
locations the canal is very wide and the available bunds of padashekarams will be raised as per
the design provided (Figure 2.0). The exhibit 4.1C of ESAMP Volume-i (line diagram of
Project canal) provides the three sections where dredging will take place along this canal. The
annexure-1 1 provides the details of the dredge disposal arrangements for AC canal. From
chainage 22-28km where narrow canals are available mechanical dredging will be employed.
Transportation of dredge material. No hydraulic dredging is possible along the entire
Kottayam-Vaikom (KV) canal except at Chipunkal near Thannirmukkom. Therefore, the
transportation of the mechanical dredge material will be by country boats, barges or directly
to tipper lorries. The sediments taken from the canal bottom could be more of clayey
material than sandy. Nevertheless, there are a number of places were only sandy materials are
available (eg: adjacent to the Nehru trophy Jetty where the water sports arrangements by the
Sp'orts Authority of India exists). The clayey materials are of high demand for embankment
protection because of the very low permeability (and high porosity). The dredged sediments
need to be transported to the disposal arrangements where ever exists. The possible modes of
transportation include:
Country boats locally available in large numbers with a capacity of 2-3m' are of use for
transportation with manual unloading.

The designs for embankment filling provided earlier in section 4.6 (Figure 2.0). The
Contractor prior to construction should demonstrate the feasibility of the system proposed
for bank protection in the programme and methodology.
Three Sections. Along AK and AC canals the three sections are the sections at which the
canal will be deepened as shown in line diagrams provided in ESAMP volume-1 as stated
above. Dredging will be undertaken along these sections. Along KV canal, in fact only one
section exists from Kanjirarn (Okm) up to Chipunkal (24.5m). This is divided into three
sections conveniently as 0-3, 3-15 and 15-24.5.
4.6.1 SELECTION OF DISPOSAL SITES AND BENEFICIARIES
Transparent process applied for the selection of sites and beneficiaries / land owners and
their agreements to receive the dredge material.
The average depth of dredging is 0.5m, nevertheless there are very few locations where the
depth of dredging could be up to lm.

4.6.2 SELECTION ALONG AC CANAL
Chainage 0-22 km (I). The nearest available place to accept the sediment material dredged
from the canal bottom is the selection criteria applied here. In this section hydraulic dredging
is proposed. The quantity of dredge material is 5861 m3 for a length of 22 km hence this can
be disposed to the nearest place identified in table 2.0. For example if the volume of dredged
material is 100 m3 the project will see the nearest opportunity to dispose off the entire
material at one place. If this is not possible one or two more locations will be considered.
Too many locations cannot be considered as the cost increases with distance and other
environmental and social factors such as the practical difficulty to arrange the facility at many
locations.
Although there could be some complaints regarding the omission of small-scale farmers with
very small land area, this is the best option the project can take.
Chainage 22-28km (II). The entire canal length is built-up area and no padashekarams exists.
The disposal arrangements have been made on both the banks continuously through out the
length which will not allow for any conflicts. The Kottayam division of the WRD has
completed the entire survey and identification of sites for section II of AC canal. The survey
and identification for 0-22km section sites have been completed by the Alappuzha division
of the WRD.
4.6.3 SELECTION ALONG AK CANAL
Chainage 0-17km (I). The criteria applied here is the nearest available place to accept the
sediment material dredged from the canal bottom. For example if the volume of dredged
material is 100 m3 the project will see the nearest opportunity to dispose off the entire
material at one place. If this is not possible one or two more locations will be considered.
Too many locations cannot be considered as the cost increases with distance and other
environmental and social factors such as the practical difficulty to arrange the facility at many
locations.
Although there could be some complaints regarding the omission of small-scale farmers with
very small land area, this is the best option the project can take.
The Alappuzha division of the WRD has completed the entire survey and identification of
the sites.
Chainage 17-23 km (II). Along this canal, the disposal will be through out the left and right
bank leaving no scope for any complaints. The entire canal length is built-up area and no
padashekarams exists. The disposal arrangements have been made on both the banks
continuously through out the length which will not allow for any conflicts. The Kottayam
division of the WRD has completed the entire survey and identification of sites.
4.6.4 SELECTION ALONG KV CANAL
Along this canal, the disposal will be through out the left and right bank avoiding the actual
built up area. Along the entire canal length no padashekarams exists. The disposal
arrangements have been made on both the banks continuously through out the length which
will not allow for any conflicts. The Kottayam division of the WRD has completed the entire
survey and identification of sites.

Kerala State Transport Project                 Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
4.7 SEDIMENT TESTING AND ALL ALLIED ACTIVITIES
The sampling of sediments will be carried out under the close supervision of the
Construction Supervision Consultants (CSC) appointed for the project in consultation with
PMT and the identified laboratories. Sampling will be carried out immediately after the
mobilisation of the IWT Contractor and CSC prior to the dredging operations as shown in
activity schedule provided in section 6.0. Prior to sampling, the CSC and the PMT will
prepare a sampling strategy in consultation with the identified laboratories. The contractor
will arrange sampling and testing of the dredged material. The cost of sediment collection,
testing and analysis have been included in the BOQ bill no 10. The payment to the
Contractor will be based on the actual cost upon submission of invoices from the
laboratories. This payment shall be directly linked to the case-to-case instructions of the
Engineer (i.e., CSC) in consultation with the PMT.
The samples will be transported on the same day of collection to the identified laboratories.
The following aspects will be considered during sampling.
1. Sampling and testing of the dredged sediments will be only from the dredging areas.
2. Twenty (20) sampling locations have been planned for the three IWT project canals
during implementation stage for sampling and testing.
3.  There will be eight (8) sampling locations along KV canal (including the earlier two)
at equal intervals from Kanjiram to Chipunkal. (Total eight (8) stations)
4. Six (6) sampling stations along AC canal at three sections of dredging. (Total 6
stations)
5. Six (6) sampling stations along AK canal at three sections of dredging (Total 6
stations)
6. The CSC will review and modify the sampling and testing arrangements in
consultation with all concerned including contractor.
4.7.1 SAMPLING DEPTH
The sampling depth is based on the following factors.
1. The average depth of dredging is 0.5m. Only two representative samples are
recommended at this section i.e., surface sample and bottom sample.
2. The methods recommended by the laboratory will be used to collect the deeper
samples. Alternatively, the carefully collected dredge samples will be used for testing
from the required stations.
3. Wherever the depth of dredging is more than 0.5m, three samples will be taken at
different depths so that the collected samples represent the sediment column that will
be dredged.
4. The number of samples at each location will depend on the depth of the dredging at
that particular location. However for the purpose of budget estimation three samples
per location have been considered.
5. The contractor will assist the Construction Supervision Consultants (CSC) for
collecting the necessary samples from the canal bottom.
6. This will be reviewed after the advice from two recognised and certified laboratory
available in the nearest possible locations at Bangalore/Kochi.

Kerala State Transport Project                  Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
4.7.2 ESTIMATION OF THE SAMPLING AND TESTING COSTS
The cost estimates are shown in table 6.0, section 5. The Contractor (linked to the BOQ
related payments) will collect the sample and send to the identified laboratory. The laboratory
will carry out the testing and analysis.
4.7.3 IDENTIFIED LABORATORIES
For the sampling and testing purpose two laboratories have been identified. Since the rates of
these reputed laboratories are fixed, there is no need for procedural formalities of
government inviting quotations etc. The details of these laboratories are as follows.
1. M/s SGS limited- P.O Box 560, Subramaniam Road, Willington Island, Kochi,
India. The Laboratory head office is located at Switzerland. This laboratory has
branches in many countries spread all over the world (refer web site. www.sgs.com).
2. M/s Shriram Institute of Industrial Research (SIIR). The SIIR has the head
quarter at New Delhi and a regional lab at Bangalore. The SIIR is self-sustaining,
multi locational, multi disciplined, contract research organisation working since 1947.
This is an ISO 9000 certified company by DNV Netherlands and accredited by
Dutch Council for certification-RVA. The SIIR is also accredited by National
Accreditation Board of Laboratories (NABL-the Indian Body for accreditation of
laboratories in the filed of chemical, mechanical and biological analysis).
4.7.4 DESCRIPTION OF THE DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS
After the sediment test results are obtained CSC will decide and approve the method of
disposal of dredge materials. In no case the contractor dispose the material without the CSC
explicit approval.
In order to avoid spillage of dredged materials during bund formation, a temporary
arrangement is to be provided by the contractor. A typical design for the disposal of
sediments is provided in section 4.6 (Figure 2.0). The entire arrangements are proposed over
the existing embankment. This will strengthen the bunds preventing floods in the area with a
much better control over the water.
Locally available materials such as hard split coconut, bamboo-mats are used for this purpose.
Bracings are provided to avoid slippage. Horizontal and slanding stumps are provided at
regular intervals. The system can be kept in place for a period of 10 days, and after drying of
the bund it can be reused to another location. Since the sides are provided in the same angle
of repose of soil, the stability of the bund will not be affected during removal of form works.
This set up will allow water from the sediments to drain over a very short period of two to
three days. Sufficient quantity of bamboo mats and split coconut will be available from the
GOK controlled Bamboo Corporation and the coconut farmers. This will provide rural
employment generation also.
4.7.5 DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINATED MATERIAL
During the July/August 2002, WB mission, the KSPCB and the Agricultural department
officials stated that BHC has been officially banned for the past two years and therefore the
actual concentration is likely to be less than the reported values in ESAMP report. The
KSPCB has clarified that the dredge material will not be considered, as hazardous waste
under the existing rules as the reported BHC concentrations are low for land applications.
Under this circumstance, the material can be considered as 'slightly contaminated', which will
not allow room for any costly CDF preparations. Sediment sampling, testing and analysis will

Kerala State Transport Project                         Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
be carried out during dredging. If the results indicate any contamination, further testing for
CDF arrangements will be carried out for the required parameters only. The location of
identified CDF sites for KV, AK and AC canals are provided in the following table 3.0. The
same disposal arrangements could be considered for the CDF facilities along first reaches of
AC and AK canals. In case of identification of contaminated sediments along first reaches of
AC, AK canals the disposal arrangements will be shifted away from the bund/bank.

The test specification for the contaminated material if any detected during the initial testing
arrangements is as follows. Based on the first year testing results, all contaminated pesticide
and heavy metal constituents will be tested continuously for about two years. All required
parameters would be monitored continuously for four times during a period of two years. As
this cannot be estimated correctly, a lump sum amount of Rs. 2.0 lakhs per each of the four
sampling and testing procedure will require 8.0 lakhs rupees (4 x 2 Lakhs).

4.7.6 RESPONSIBILITIES.
Immediately after the mobilisation of the Contractor and the Construction Supervision
Consultants, the CSC will discuss the entire sediment collecting and testing plan. The entire
responsibility described here is in addition to those mentioned in section 9.1 Institutional
arrangements provided in ESAMP volume- 1.
CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION CONSULTANTS (CSC)
The Waterways specialist of CSC will be responsible for collection, testing and analysis of the
samples. The Waterways specialist, based on the test results will recommend the team leader
(Engineer) of the CSC, whether the material is contaminated or not. If contaminated, the
Engineer (CSC) will give necessary instructions to the contractor for CDF arrangements.
CONTRACTOR
The contractor in consultation with the CSC and PMT will arrange the sediment sampling,
testing and analysis of all dredge materials according to the written instructions and assistance
received from the Engineer (CSC). Although BOQ provided a lumpsum budget of twenty
lakhs, the contractor would be paid only on actual cost basis linked to the invoices from the
two accredited laboratories. The PMT and CSC will closely supervise and monitor all
activities related to sampling, testing and analysis.
LANDOWNERS
The landowners should obtain all information with respect to chemical qualities of sediment
material that will be deposited on their land. Further the landowners shall execute a lease
agreement with the contractor stating the actual proposed use of their land and the period of
lease agreement. Any conflict situation with regard to agreement or use of their property shall
be brought to the notice of the Engineer (CSC).
WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT (WRD)
The IWT division of the WRD at Kottayam will closely monitor the various activities
including dredging and dredge disposal arrangements. The IWT division will report to the
PMT for any assistance or action required.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM (PMT)
The Environmental Engineer will independently assess the dredging and dredge disposal
arrangements in order to verify the engineer's recommendations and reporting of samples.
The identified laboratories will carry out the sediment testing and analysis. On behalf of CSC
the contractor will execute the process of testing of samples according to the specifications
and requirements.
Depending on the concentrations of the contaminated material and the results of the
sampling, testing and analysis the use of confined disposal facility will be considered. The
proposed design for this facility is provided in the figure 3.0. The material used for the CDF
design is the Bamboo mat and split coconut.
In case of any reporting of contaminated material, the PMT through CSC will instruct the
contractor for the contaminated material to be placed in CDF for a minimum period of two
years duration. The CDF locations have been identified, and the consent letters obtained
from the landowners through a written agreement. The contractors will execute an actual
lease agreement with the landowners for any use of their land.

4.9 CONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGES AND FOOT BRIDGES
The construction of bridges, footbridges etc will spread over a period of 12 months as
provided in the activity schedule. Four bridges for AK and AC canals each and 14 bridges for
Kottayam-Vaikom (KV) canal will be either rebuild or repaired or raised.
4.10 NAVIGATIONAL AIDS
The navigational aides will be installed once all the activities mentioned above are more or
less complete. The anticipated period of this activity is from 18flh month up to the 23rd
month. This can be treated as one of the last activity to be taken up. The Waterways specialist
of CSC will arrange a meeting with the IWAI to agree a common, uniform pattern of
Navigational aids for both NW-III and IWT (Refer annexure-1).
4.11 E & S IMPACT, MITIGATION AND ENHANCEMENT WORKS
All mitigation measures proposed will be implemented throughout the period. For this, the
ESAMP & IP will be the binding document.
Land acquisition. No land acquisition has been planned for the IWT pilot project. In case,
land acquisition has been considered/ required for the IWT project for any of the proposed
facilities like terminals, jetties, access roads, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared for
the highways component and the GOK policy on the same applies for identification of PAPs
compensation, land acquisition and resettlement. Annexure-12 is a checklist prepared for land
acquisition.
Low Cost Sanitation arrangements. The sanitation arrangements included earlier in
ESAMP report have been completely deleted from the IWT Pilot component. The BOQ has
been revised accordingly. The proposed sanitation facilities in the ESAMP document would
be considered in other sanitation projects. The decisions have been discussed and endorsed
by the Task Force.
Terminal facilities at Changanaserry and Kottayam. The design for terminal facilities for
accepting and disposal of solid and liquid waste is shown in Appendix Yprovided in ESAMP.
The cost includes landscaping and visual integration of all terrminal facilities with suitable tree,
shrub planting and other facilities. The cost has been included in the BOQ. There will not
be any hazardous cargo handling at the two IWT terminals proposed at Kottayam and
Changanaserry.
Terminal facilities at Alappuzha. There is one terminal facility at Alappuzha for all
purposes including hazardous cargo. This facility is being built by the IWAI. No terminal
facilities are being built at Alappuzha under this project. The construction activities in the
project canals AC and AK are 3 km and 1 km distance from the proposed terminal
respectively. Hence no impacts pertaining to the hazardous cargo storage is envisaged under
this project. During the operational phase there will be no movement of hazardous
chemicals along the project canals as the national waterways will be used for this purpose.
However the terminals will be common to the project canals and NW-III. The terminal
facility has obtained GOI/MOEF clearance and has a Disaster Management Plan/Risk
analysis. These documents will be reviewed by the PMT and advice on additional mitigation
measures required if any. Further details of the Alappuzha terminal is included in annexure -
13.
Bathing ghats. New design for bathing ghats has been prepared in consultation with the
WRD engineers at Kottayam. This is provided in figure 4.0. Further the design has been

presented to a cross section of inhabitants along the canal sides. A report on the consultation
carried out on 17 September is provided as annexure-14. This is possible only at Public
bathing ghats where adequate government land availability is assured. The minimum land
requirement for the proposed bathing ghat could be 7.15 Sq.m (1.3 x 5.5m). The total
number of bathing ghats that can be considered for construction will be of the order of 25
numbers per canal (total 75 nos). All other bathing ghats will have to be retained or
maintained during the construction works. The cost for this item has been included in the
BOQ.

ESMP Volume-1).
Safe disposal of human waste. As in aircrafts, there would be suitable arrangements in the
vessels (passenger boats, motor boats etc,) to collect human defecation. The safe disposal of
this should be planned and disposal sites identified without affecting the waterways. A
provision of Rs 12 Lakhs (Rs. 1.2 million) has been included for three years initially as the
cost for making proper disposal arrangements (Refer ESAMP Volume-1). The cost included
in the BOQ.
In addition to this, there should be terminal arrangements in the form of septic tanks to
accept or dispose of the sewage from the vessels. This is required only because no sewerage
systems are available at Changanaserry and Kottayam. In all these locations a closed septic
tank of 40 cubic metres costing Rs. 1.5 million will be required. Open and closed septic tanks
are used in the area. This will necessitate an additional requirement of Rs 30 Lakhs (Rupees
three million). This is a permanent investment in this direction.

Waste Management Plan. The cost for the waste management plan during construction is
included in the BOQ (Refer ESAMP Volume-1).
Solid waste collection and disposal facilities at Jetties. There are 110 jetties altogether,
each one requiring a dust/garbage bin of standard design size. The cost includes visual
integration of the structure. A number of these may be required at jetties. The cost for this is
included (Refer ESMP Volume-1).
Dredge disposal cost. The cost for dredging and disposal is a part of the engineering cost.
Suitable designs have been provided for both embankment and confined disposal facility.
The cost included in the BOQ (Refer ESMP Volume-1).
Water hyacinth Collection and disposal. As identified and described by the Water
Hyacinth Management Plan in Appendix L of ESAMP and the Implementation Plan. As
recommended by the Task Force (Annexure-3) a multi pronged approach will be undertaken
for the collection and disposal of the waterweeds. The cost for this including the treatment of
disposed water hyacinth from the canal in private coconut plantation and other agricultural
areas for making compost etc, and utilizing it for various purposes will be part of the BOQ
bill no-2.
4.12 PERFORMANCE MONITORING INDICATORS
The table 5.0 itemises the performance monitoring indicators for the Environmental and
social aspects of the IWT project for the purpose of evaluation.
4.13 ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL MONITORING AND
ENHANCEMENT COSTS
All items except the cost for environmental awareness programme (Rs 20 lakhs) have been
dropped from the list of items included in exhibit 11.1 of ESAMP Volume-1 (page 86). The
awareness programme will be carried out with the same budget as described in the following
section 4.14. Further, it has been recommended to include a two-year maintenance cost for
the pilot project, as the project construction activities will be completed two years ahead of
the closing of the loan agreement in June 2007. Therefore, the maintenance cost of Rs 50
Lakhs per year (Five million) for three canals (Lumpsum) for two years have been considered
under the project. This will incur an additional cost of one Crore (Ten Million rupees).
4.14 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND AWARENESS PROGRAMME
The public participation programmes will focus on the PIA panchayats with in the Kuttanad
area. The awareness programme will consider the health, hygiene and sanitation aspects of
the Kuttanad region in addition to the management related issues of waterways during
operational stage. The responsibilities of the individuals, waterway users, inhabitants of
Kuttanad and tourists will be covered during the programmes. The identified NGO will
organise the activities with the involvement of PMT and PCC at Thiruvananthapuram,
Kottayam IWT division and the district and panchayat administration in the Kuttanad area.

Kerala State Transport Project                Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Pro)ect
ANNEXURE-1
MINUTES OF MEETING WITH THE INLAND WATER TRANSPORT AUTHORITY OF INDIA
(IWAI) FOR KSTP-IWT PILOT PROJECT
Venue: IWAI Office, 2347-N, Paramara Shopping Complex, Paramara Road, Kochi-18
Date, Time: 12 August 2002, 11.30 a.m.
Participants IWAI Kochi:
Mr. S. Dandapat, Director, Inland Water Authority of India (IWAI), Kochi
Mr. V. Murugesan, Technical Assistant, IWAI, Kochi
Mr. G.S. Mena, Technical Assistant, IWAI, Kochi
Participants KSTP PMT/PCC:
Mr. Ramakrishnan, Superintendent Engineer (SE), Water Resources Department
Mr. Yohannan, Executive Engineer, PMT/Water Resources Department
Mr. B.G.P. Reddy, Design Engineer, Project Coordinating Consultants (PCC)
Mr. Sundara Rajan C.V., Environmental Specialist, PCC
The purpose of the meeting with IWAI Officials was to ascertain whether the terminal
facilities proposed in the terminals at Kottayam and Changanaserry of the IWT Pilot Project
and that in the terminals at Alappuzha, Vaikom and Thannirmukkom of the NW-Il-IWAT
Project, that are in the project influence area of the pilot project, are of comparable standard.
Mr. Ramakrishnan, SE, Water Resources introduced the KSTP-IWT Project and the
objectives of the meeting. The PCC Environmental Specialist added some details on the
nature of the information required from IWAI. Having discussed all matters regarding the
NW-III Project (presently partly completed) and KSTP-IWT Project, the key elements
regarding the KSTP-IWT Project were defined as described below.
1. The terminal facilities proposed by IWAI for Alappuzha, Thannirmukkom (Shertalai)
and Vaikom are much bigger in area than the KSTP proposals for IWT. The area of
the NW-III terminals varies from 0.5 ha to 1.0 ha whereas the KSTP proposal is 0.1
ha only. This is due to the hazardous material cargo handling and storage requirement
for the NW-III Project. The land acquisition for the latter project is complete but at
Alappuzha terminal where some local conflicts have slowed down this process.
2. Apart from the area required, the NW-III terminal designs are comparable with the
KSTP proposals. However, certain items described in the engineering report of the
pilot project do not seem to be included in the Bill of Quantifies, particularly the
following matters:
Fence and gates
> Water supply arrangements and overhead tank
Surface drainage and pipe culvert
Fire fighting equipment and portable pump
Mechanical engineering equipment, eg. provision of tyred crane to load and
unload cargo etc.
3. It can be noted that environmental and social considerations are of lesser importance
in the NW-III Project. The PMT/PCC team stated that these considerations are
essential in all World Bank financed projects.
4. In the NW-IIl terminals the only facility proposed is a septic tank designed for 50
people. This is meant for official/guest use and not for the public. This is inadequate

Kerala State Transport Project                  Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
for the KSTP-IWT standard. KSTP has proposed a septic tank for 200 people use,
including the official/public use, besides the disposal of waste from on-board vessel
facilities according to the KSTP vessel designs.
5. At present there are no garbagecollectionanddisposalarrangements'proposed in the NW-
III Project.
6. The NW-III Project has obtained the Environmental Clearance from the Ministry of
Environment and Forests, Government of India.
7. For water hyacinth removal and disposal IWAI have contacted Ecotech (Phone
0484-323809) dealing with proven environmental solutions. There are early proposals
to hire this company for removing water hyacinth using mechanical water hyacinth
harvesters. The cost of this harvester is 60 lakhs. Currently IWAI has not developed
any plan for the disposal arrangements.
8. The NW-III Project has carried out a detailed Disaster Management Plan and risk
analysis related to the hazardous cargo movements at terminals. There are inbuilt
proposals for fire fighting equipments in the terminals.
9. There are no institutional capabilities within the IWAI for executing any
environmental and social components of the project. The IWAI depends on the
Revenue Department and other agencies for land acquisition and other
environmental and social requirements of the project.
10. At present there are no design vessels proposed with inbuilt garbage collection and
disposal facilities in the NW-IIl Project.
11. There have been some conflicts with the fishing community in the NW-HI Project.
When they happen, they are referred to the Fisheries Department, Government of
Kerala.
12. There are some discrepancies regarding the channel marking standards between the
NW-III and KSTP proposals. However, this is a minor issue that can be resolved
easily.
13. The IWAI has raised concerns regarding the certificate of competency to the boat
drivers and the boat masters. There is some confusion regarding the present setup. It
is understood that the Water Resources Department at Alappuzha has been
authorized to issue boat registration certificates but not competency certificates. If
some training is required this needs to be imparted.
14. The Director declared that the entire current legal framework and particularly the
environmental laws are inadequate thereby hampering the growth of the waterways.
Suitable laws need to be framed and implemented for effectively managing the
environmental and social requirements and to meet international accepted standards.
15. Regarding the dredge disposal options the NW-III Project has resorted to all
available means, i.e. open land and lake disposal, land fill, bund protection and land
reclamation. They informed the KSTP participants that there are many potential
buyers for dredged material.
16. The PMT/PCC Team gave information on the proposed task force meeting for the
KSTP-IWT Project. IWAI participation is necessary for waterways related issues in
Kerala. In this context the KSTP Team stated that they would convey these aspects
to the concerned officials.
The meeting was closed at 1.00 p.m.

Kerala State Transport Project                  Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
ANNEXURE-3
AGENDA NOTES FOR THE PROPOSED MEETING OF THE
TASK FORCE ON KSTP -rWT ON 11/10/2002
1.   Dredge disposal arrangement proposed in the implementation plan.
The Kerala State Transport Project has decided to dispose of the dredged material from the
three selected canals for improvement in an environmental friendly manner. The Project has
carried out sampling and testing during the project preparation. The test results indicate that
the sediments are slightly contaminated at certain locations. The main contamination is due
to the presence of BHC. Therefore the dredge material will be used only for the
embankment/bund/sidewall protection and strengthening. There is a great demand for the
dredge material. But the Project will not use the material for any land filling or filling of
padashekraarams or for land reclamation of water-spread areas. The total estimated dredge
material from the three Inland Water Transport canals is 156,000 m3. The project will carry
out testing of samples simultaneously with dredging to confirm the material is free of any
contamination. The testing will be carried out in the accredited laboratories already identified
at Bangalore and Kochi. The estimated amount for the testing is Rupees twenty lakhs. Any
reporting of higher levels of contamination by the laboratories will make the Confined
Disposal Facility arrangements necessary for disposal. The arrangements will continue for a
period of two years with testing of the contamination at an interval of four months. About
ten sites have been identified for this arrangement and consents have been obtained.
Government of Kerala has informed the World Bank team that the BHC has been officially
banned since 2000. So the level of contamination will be considerably less than the earlier
testing. In view of the above the dredge material will be used only for strengthening of
embankments till test results prove that there is no contamination and can otherwise be used
for land filling etc as per rules.
Pointfor decision- Whether the proposed embankment strengthening using the dredge material
can be adopted. If test results prove that there is no contamination whether it can be used for
land filling etc as per rules.
2.   Future plan for the control of excessive water hyacinth growth.
The contractor will remove the waterweeds during the construction period up to the 24"h
month till handing over the waterways for operation. The occurrence of the water hyacinth
varies from season to season depending on many factors especially the water flow along the
canals and the monsoon season. The contractor will deposit the manually removed water
hyacinth on the coconut plantations as a mulch6. Traditionally these materials have been used
as a 'mulching material' for coconut plantations. At present there is nothing that will be
against the continuing of this tradition. Necessary provision has been included in the bill of
quantities.
The operational control of the waterweeds is not within the scope of this project. As desired
by the World Bank an operational strategy needs to be formulated for effectively controlling
the water hyacinth. The earlier plan of testing by 'bioremediation measures' such as the one
proposed by the Clean Flow International Inc. has been dropped from further consideration
due to the exhorbitant cost involved and also the doubts regarding the practical aspects of
implementation in open canals. The water hyacinth removal and disposal arrangements
during the operational stage will use the outcome of the meeting of the researchers/experts in
6 A mass of leaves, bark, or compost spread around or over a plant for protection or to enrich the soil.

Kerala State Transport Project                 Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Pro)ect
this field that has been scheduled to be held on loth October 2002 at Kottayam. The
recommendations of this meeting on control of water hyacinth will be considered by the
Task Force and appropriate decisions will be taken.
The expert panel constituted to study the possibility to open Thannirmukkom and
Thottappally barrages has recently submitted their recommendations. The committee has
recommended the opening of the barrages for a period of one year on an experimental basis.
The Government of Kerala will take an appropriate decision based on the recommendations.
Government of Kerala will have to take in to consideration the interests of both fisheries and
agricultural sectors. The opening of the two barrages is thought to be a permanent solution
for the waterweeds, as the weeds cannot survive in higher salinities.
Pointfor decision- Whether the proposal to use the water hyacinth as a mulching material
can be accepted. Decision on the recommendations in the meeting of the researchers/experts
in this field scheduled to be held on 10th October 2002 to be taken.
3.   Bathing Ghats arrangement for canal / waterway users.
During the project preparation stage, Project Coordinating Consultants has carried out a
number of public consultations and participation programmes. The people in general
recommended to maintain privacy of women taking bath along the side of the canals.
Accordingly a design was proposed in the Environmental and Social Assessment and
Management Plan (ESAMP). Frequent maintenance will be required for this construction
made of fibreglass. Although it is a low cost method, due to the uncertainty regarding its
continued maintenance, is aesthetic quality and also due to the projected nature of the design,
World Bank has objected to its adoption.
Subsequently the design prepared as per the recommendation of the World Bank and the
local Water Resources Department (WRD) engineers is also found not acceptable to the local
community because of the loss of their land for providing bathing ghat arrangements. A new
design for bathing ghats has been prepared in consultation with the WRD engineers. The
design has been presented to a cross section of inhabitants along the canal sides. The general
opinion was that this is possible only at public bathing ghats where adequate government
land is available. The minimum land requirement for the proposed bathing ghat is 7.15 sq.m
(1.3 x 5.5m). The total number of bathing ghats on government land that can be considered
for construction will be 25 numbers per canal (total 75 nos). All other private bathing ghats
will have to be retained or maintained taking care to ensure aesthetic quality.
The cost of 75 public bathing ghats will be part of the cost of bund construction along the
sides of the canal. Since the materials of construction are similar to that of bunds this is not a
separate item of payment to the contractor. In this case only the quantity will vary and the
contractor will be paid as per the claim for additional quantities. The standard rates are
available for all materials and the work involved.
Pointfor decision - Whether the proposal to construct 75 Nos. of bathing ghats as per the
design can be adopted.
4.   Co-ordination with other departments for the provision of sanitation facilities.
The earlier consultancy studies recommended some initiatives on improving the sanitation in
the Kuttanad area (identified Project Influence Area). The recommendation was based on the
environmental studies especially the studies related to water quality carried out at selected
locations along the canals. Although the total sanitation of the project area requires huge
investments, the consultants recommended around 300 nos. of low cost sanitation units (for

BPL families to be decided after a survey by the selected Non Governmental Orgamsation)
along the three Inland Water Transport Pilot Project waterways. This recommendaton was
primarily to increase the awareness on the importance of water quality along the waterways.
These recommendations were later dropped from further consideration of IWT project,
following the June 2002 Mission of World Bank. The Mission note however recommended
coordinating all sanutation programmes by various departments/orgamisations in the
Kuttanad region and the issue was left to the Task Force for taking a decision.
The IWT project requires coordination of number of lne departments of GOK and GOI for
the provision of sanitation facihties. This includes KWA, Tourism, IWAI, local self-
government bodies, SWTD, SPCB, etc. However the following two projects are more
important with regard to sanitation.
Kerala Total Sanutation Mission, under Kerala Rural Development Department.
Kerala Rural Water and Sanitation Mission (KRWSM), under Kerala Water Authority.
Considering the seriousness of the sanitation situation in Kuttanad these two Missions need
to work more closely to protect the environment.
Apart from this, the involvement of NGOs in promoting low cost samtation techniques may
be emphasised. It may be noted that GOI project like National Waterway-No III has no
proposal for sanitation, garbage collection and disposal facilies in the terminals. There are
no specific designs for collection and disposal of waste materials from the vessels
Pointfor deasion - To decide which department/agency will be providing sanitafion faclities in
the project area.
5.   Environmental Awareness Programme.
The public participation programmes wlfl focus on the project influence area panchayats with
in the Kuttanad area. The awareness programme will consider the health, hygiene and
sanutation aspects of the Kuttanad region in additon to the management related issues of
waterways during operational stage. The responsibilites of the individuals, wvaterway users,
inhabitants of Kuttanad and tourists wilU be covered during the programmes. The already
identified NGO will organise the activities with the involvement of Project Management
Team and Project Coordinating Consultants at Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam IWT division
and the district and panchayat administration in the Kuttanad area.
The entire programme wil target 13 PIA Panchayats. These panchayats are lsted below:

16. Mr. A.L.Charles, Planning officer, Tourism Department.
The meeting discussed the issues in the agenda notes circulated in advance to all the
participants. The Principal Secretary, Water Resources Department (WRD) chaired the
meeting. The Chairman introduced the purpose of the meeting with a brief description of the
project. The PCC Environmental Specialist then made a power point presentation on the
IWT pilot project. The items on the agenda were then taken up for discussion.
1) Dredge disposal arrangements proposed in the Implementation Plan
The Secretary, PWD explained in detail about the dredge disposal arrangements. The
participants discussed the various aspects of the arrangements. The present proposal is to use
the dredge material for the embankment strengthening. The Chairman wanted to know
whether other uses for the dredge materials could be considered under the project if the test
results indicate nil or much lower levels of contamination. The secretary, PWD stated that the
Task Force has to take a decision in this regard. One of the participants emphasised the need
for a fool-proof method for the dredge disposal as there is a great demand for the dredge in
the entire Kuttanad area both for land filling and for embankment strengthening. The
recently prepared IWT Implementation Plan has clearly identified the areas that can be used
for storing the dredged material. Another participant stated that the involvement of the local
panchayat should be ensured in this area.
Decision: The Task Force is of the opinion that the entire dredge material will not be
required for embankment strengthening. It is therefore decided that if the test results during
implementation phase indicates nil or lower levels of contamination in the dredged material,
other applications that are socially and locally relevant should be considered under the
project. The next meeting of the Task Force will discuss a comprehensive scheme for the
dredge disposal, meeting the above considerations. This will help to avoid conflicts since
there is a great demand for the dredge for various uses in Kuttanad area.

2) Future plan for the control of excessive water hyacinth growth
The recommendation of the meeting of experts conducted at Kottayam on 10th October
2002 was presented before the Task Force to discuss and to take a decision thereon The
recommendation was to procure a mechanical harvester within the pilot project and to use it
during the construction and operational phases. The CE (Mechanical) stated that the
procurement of water hyacinth harvester as recommended by the meeting of the experts on
10th October 2002 at Kottayam will help to solve the problem only partially as the experience
indicates that the machine could be only used for three months in a year when excessive
growth of the weeds occurs. The Director, IW AI, Kochi stated that they are planning to
procure a water hyacinth harvester very shortly, which will cost around Rs. 60 Lakhs.
Another participant stated that a multi pronged approach that will involve a variety of
techniques viz use of harvester in wider areas and manual removal in narrow sections and
using the weeds for applications like mulching, composting or as a raw material for paper
manufacturing units etc will be more appropriate. The expert from the Agricultural University
pointed out that biological methods for eradicating the water hyacinth are not practical in this
case.
The involvement of the local panchayats, voluntary organisations, self-help groups and
Kudumbasree should be ensured for manual removal. The project should also hold
consultations with Hindustan Newsprint Ltd. and small-scale paper industries in this matter.
One of the participants stated that due to unsafe working environment, some small-scale
mechanical devices and tools are required for manual removal of the water hyacinth. The
handling of waterweeds with bare hands is not possible due to the presence of snakes, insects
etc and hence gloves and rubber footwear should be provided.
Decision: A multi pronged approach should be adopted for the removal of water hyacinth
along the project feeder canals. With regard to procurement of water hyacin.tn harvester it
was decided that based on the experience of the IW AI a decision would be taken later. The
experiences of other agencies using this harvester will be gathered by the SE, IWT. The local
panchayats, Hindustan Newsprint Ltd and small-scale paper industries will be consulted
regarding use of the water hyacinth as a raw material.
3) Bathing ghat arrangements along the canals.
Some of the participants stated that the design prepared is not spacious enough to take bath
and hence might not be used. Therefore the design needs to be changed slightly. The
consultant stated that the design is for the minimum space and provides adequate flexibility.
However, if sufficient public land is available it could be made more spacious. The Chairman
wanted to know whether all the locations are identified and verified. The consultants stated
that the 75 bathing ghats have been provided in the contract document. There can be
variation in the design and in the number of these ghats along the .three canals. It was
stressed that there will not be any land acquisition within this project.
Decision: The necessity of the bathing ghats needs to be further ascertained from the
women organisations and lady members of the local bodies. The Task Force decided that a
few bathing ghats would be constructed on an experimental basis. Based on the social
acceptability and other feedback, the remaining bathing ghats will be constructed.
4) Sanitation arrangements in the Kuttanad region.
The Chairman stated that 'Kerala Total Sanitation Mission' is the only authority operating in
Kuttanad region. Therefore this Mission could act as the nodal agency for the various

sanitation arrangements in the area. The Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency is
an independent body operating in four districts of Kerala and this does not include Kuttanad
area. The Chairman requested the IW AI to include adequate sanitation facilities in the three
terminals (Alappuzha, Thannirmukkom and Vaikom) coming within the purview of the
project.
Responding to the question of licensing of vessels without on board waste disposal
arrangements, the PCB representative stated that the PCB is currently drafting legislation to
make such arrangements in all vessels mandatory and that this will be implemented very
shortly. The representative from Tourism Department stated that while at present it is not
mandatory for vessels like house boats to install waste disposal facility, that department has
classified vessels particularly houseboats based on the facilities provided for collection and
disposal of waste. The device that is being used in these house boats is the Marine Sanitation
Device. This will soon be made applicable to all houseboats registered under Tourism
Department SE, IWT will" collect copies of the order of PCB and Tourism Department on
this subject.
Decision: This will be included in the awareness programme during the implementation of
the project. The Task Force also recommended that the conversion of the open latrines to
safe two pit latrines be popularised. The IW AI was requested to provide the necessary
sanitation and waste disposal facilities for the three terminals coming under the purview of
the pilot project. The NA TP AC and Rural Development authorities are to be invited for the
next meeting. The sanitation program of the local self govt bodies and other agencies will be
coordinated by the Kerala Total Sanitation Mission and this will be reviewed by the Task
Force.
5) Environmental Awareness Programme.
The CWRDM representative stated that it is necessary to streamline the awareness
programme through the Kudumbasree organisations. Decision: The proposed awareness
programme could be implemented on the lines is stated in the agenda notes.
6) Coordination between different agencies including IWAI.
The Chairman stated that as indicated in the agenda notes there are a number of other
agencies involved. For coordination with all such agencies, the Task Force will be the best
forum.
Decision: The Task Force itself will act as the coordination agency.
7) IWT future vision and scope of expansion
The Chairman stated that a centrally sponsored West Coast Canal project is under
consideration of Government. .
Decision: The experience from this IWT project will be taken as guiding principles for the
future expansion of the waterways in Kerala. The action plan will be developed in due course
with the implementation of the pilot project.
8) Any other items
There were no other items for discussion.

THE GOK EXPERT PANEL 2002 RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE OPENING OF
THANNERMUKKOM BUND
The expert panel constituted to study the possibility to open Thannirmukkom barrages has
recently submitted their recommendations. The committee has recommended to open the
barrages for an additional period of 15 days on an experimental basis. The GOK will take an
appropriate decision based on the recommendations. The delicate decision is based on the
conflict situation of fisheries communities and the agricultural communities in the entire
Kuttand area. The opening of the two barrages is thought to be a permanent solution for the
waterweeds, as the weeds cannot survive in higher salinities. However the committee has
concluded that the suggestion to leave the barrage open throughout the year is not a
socially and economically viable solution to the problems faced by the present
operation of the barrage. A more technically feasible and socially acceptable solution is to
minimize the time of closure of the barrage. It is observed that the ideal time to close the
barrage is when the salinity level of the water reaches two parts per trillion (ppt) on the
southern side of the barrage by around the second week of December. To allow the flushing
of pollutants and to reduce the environmental impacts, barrage shall be opened by the end of
the second week of March. The farmers shall be made aware of the need to exercise crop
discipline to adjust with the schedule of barrage operation from mid-December to mid-
March. When emergency situations arise, the operation has to consider the difference of
water levels on the upstream and downstream of the barrage. A Committee of all concerned
departments and agencies may take this decision on the emergency operation. By minimising
the annual period of closure of the barrage, it is expected that the health of the aquatic
ecosystem will improve. This will not only help in improving the flushing of the estuary and
reducing the weed growth but also in slowly regaining the biodiversity. The fisheries sector
also will benefit from this decision.

MINUTES OF MEETING CONDUCTED AT KOTTAYAM
FOR EVOLVING A PRACTICAL APPROACH/ SOLUTION FOR WATER HYACINTH
MANAGEMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONAL PHASES OF THE PROJECT.
Venue: PWD Rest house, Kottayam.        Date, Time: 10 October 2002, 11.00. a.m.
PARTICIPANTS:
List of participants is provided.
PARTICIPANTS FROM KSTP (PCC/PMT):
Mr Thomas, Superintendent Engineer (SE) Project Management Team (PMT)
Mr Ramakrishnan, Superintendent Engineer (SE) Water Resources Department /PMT
Mr Yohannan, Executive Engineer, Water Resources Department /PMT
Mr Sreekandan Nair, Environmental Engineer, PMT
Mr Sundara Rajan, Environmental Specialist, Project Coordinating Consultants (PCC)
Purpose of the meeting was to derive a practical concrete recommendation for the collection
and disposal of waterweeds especially the water hyacinths from the three canals selected
under the IWT Pilot project.
The meeting started with a welcoming address and a description of the purpose of the
meeting by Mr Thomas, Superintending Engineer, Project Management Team (PMT).
Later Mr Sundara Rajan, C.V. Environmental specialist, Louis Berger International Inc, using
'Power Point' presented an overview of the Pilot waterways component of the Kerala State
Transport Project',
Following the 'project over view presentation' the subject was opened for discussion.
1. Dr Joy of Agricultural University stated that there are a variety of research techniques
including biological control using fishes, beetles and bites. After having discussed the
various detailed aspects and techniques, Dr Joy concluded that the only practical way is
to apply/use mechanical devices using mechanical harvesters. The collected weeds can
be suitably disposed off for feeding fishes and also for compost making. The services
of voluntary organisations, self help groups etc could be utilised for this activity.
2. Further the Deputy Collector, Kottayam stated that the only practical way is to control
by allowing natural salinity intrusion through Thannirmukkom and Thottapally
spillways. The Deputy Collector also described the various problems related to the
large-scale presence of waterweeds faced by the Kuttanad people including the recent
menace of increased snakebite cases.
3. Dr George Abe from CWRDM stated that a decision to keep the bund open is not easy
as it involves several complex issues. Dr Abe for example quoted the future of three
water supply projects in the Kuttanad region. The PCC environmentalist stated that the
food security of the state was also a serious concern as it is necessary to retain the vast
areas of paddy cultivation in the Kuttanad.
4. The PCC environmentalist stated that a report has been prepared and submitted to the
Government of Kerala by an expert committee set-up by GOK with Dr James
Executive Director, CWRDM as the head of the expert committee. The government

Kerala State Transport Project                 Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
will examine the report to take an appropriate decision. It is also important to consider
the long-term effect of salinity that will definitely affect the agricultural operations in
the areas since the surface and groundwater are the part of the same system.
5. One of the participants stated that the use mechanical harvester using floating JCB and
manual methods for removal could be of great help to control the waterweeds.
6. The participants presented different techniques for compost making. The vermi
compost making is also a possibility but unsure about the marketing possibilities of the
product. One main problem for such purposes is the land availability. The system need
dry chambers, which is not practical in Kuttanad unless casting of such concrete slabs
have been considered by the project.
7. Following Dr Joy of agricultural University many representatives including
representative form the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) also stated that the best
possible way under the present circumstances is to use mechanical harvesters even
during construction and operational period of the project.
8. The KSTP team stated that the use of mechanical harvester during the construction
stage would save 45Lakhs included as a contract bill of quantities (BOQ) item in the
IWT Pilot component. This depends on the possibility of procuring the machine within
a reasonable time of two-three months. The cost of the mechanical harvester is
approximately 60-70 Lakhs. The use of mechanical harvester along the canals will not
provide the desired results and therefore the use in the entire Kuttanad need to be
taken up for effective control by the government.
The meeting was closed at 1.30 pm with the following recommendation which was read out
to all participants prior to the close of the meeting.
RECOMMENDATION
The meeting recommended procuring a mechanical harvester within the pilot waterways
project and using it during the construction and operational phases of the project. This could
be operated and maintained by the Mechanical wing of the Water Resources Department
(WRD). The arrangement can continue till a concrete mechanism is evolved for renting out
of the machine for various other agencies including the Inland Waterways Authority of India
(TWAI).
The meeting also recommended the disposal of harvester collected waterweeds by means of
compost making and or to use it as a pulp material for Hindustan newsprint /local small-
scale paper industrial units.

CHECK LIST FOR LAND ACQUISISTION
PROVISION OF THE R & R
If any person is adversely impacted during implementation, the R&R Policy of the KSTP will
be implemented. A concise checklist for the social impacts for the contractors is added in
case the R& R Policy and the resettlement action plan (RAP) for the highways component
are to be used and implemented under the IWT pilot project. The checklist is as follows:
CONTRACTOR TO MEASURE THE EXISTING WIDTH AND THE REQUIRED WIDTH
A. IF A STRUCTURE/PLOT OF LAND IS AFFECTED:
* Identify the location (chainage, side [L/R], existing width, modified width);
* Identify the address of the owner and/or user of the property;
*   Measure the area of the affected land;
*   Identify and note the details of what else is lost (well, tank, trees, etc)
* Refer to the RAP for mitigation measures;
* Identify the number of trees and the ownership (public / private) of the tree to be
removed.
B. IF A CPR (WELL, HAND PUMP, SCHOOLS, ETC) IS AFFECTED:
* Identify the location (chainage, side [L/R], existing width, modified width);
* Identify if these are privately owned or owned by the government;
* Measure the affected area and identify the owner;
* In case of private owners, follow the RAP mitigating measures;
* In case of public properties coordinate with the WRD and the relevant affected
Government Department to rehabilitate the affected CPR.
C. IF A RELIGIOUS/CULTURAL PROPERTY IS AFFECTED:
*> Identify the location (chainage, side [L/R], existing width, modified width)
*> Identify the property (temple, church, mosque, hyundi,7 etc.);
* Measure the area affected and identify the quantum of loss;
*   For compensation and benefits enhancement measures refer to the RAP.
E. THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE CHECKLIST IN THE
FIELD.
The R&R Co-ordinator of the PMT will provide the clearance note prior to the
commencement of the civil works.
The social issues anticipated are provided in the ESAMP report

HAZARDOUS CARGO HANDLING AT NW-III TERMINALS
The Alappuzha NW-III terminal (other terminals are not related to the pilot project) are also
intended to handle classified hazardous cargo's as described in the Hazardous management
rules of GOI according to the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986. The IWAI has
therefore carried out a study and prepared a Disaster Management Plan and Risk Analysis.
The World Bank supported IWT canals are not related to the hazardous cargo transport. The
terminal arrangements and hazardous cargo handling at the terminals are also not linked to
the World Bank project. For these arrangements the World Bank requires much stringent
measures according to the safeguard policies of the Bank. Since the Alappuzha terminals are
also terminals of IWT pilot project, a copy of this report will be made available to World
Bank for any additional recommendations, clarifications or guidelines. The implementation of
any such recommended activity from World Bank need the ratification of Task Force
constituted for IWT project implementation. The Task Force is the nodal agency identified
for interagency/interdepartmental linkages. This activity will continue till all the activities
realize the WB safe guard Policies. If necessary these aspects will also be disclosed to the
public at the appropriate time after the finalisation as desired by the Bank

REPORT ON THE FIELD INSPECTION FOR KSTP- IWT PILOT PROJECT
DATE OF FIELD VISIT: 17 SEPTEMBER 2002
Purpose of the field visit: Ascertain the social acceptability of the proposed design for bathing
ghats and also to understand the number of bathing ghats that can be constructed without
protruding to the canal.
Field team:
PMT/PCC and Water Resources Department, Thiruvananthapuram
Mr Ramakrishnan SE, Water Resources Department
Mr Yohannan EE, PMT/ WRD
Mr Sundara Rajan, Environmental Specialist, PCC
Local Water Resources Department, Kottayam
Mrs Rekha, Assistant Engineer, WRD, Kottayam.
Mr Bino, Overseer, WRD
Mr Sunny George, Overseer, WRD
Mr Santhosh Kumar, Overseer, WRD
Mrs. Kunjamma Antony, Assistant Engineer, WRD, Changanassery
The team has visited the IWT project canals for public consultation regarding the proposed
design for bathing ghats. Earlier the Water Resources Engineers from the Kuttanad region
proposed a design for bathing ghats, which will not project towards canals. The construction
of the bathing ghat will require a minimum of 7 Sq.m of land area.
The team has traversed along the representative sections of the three IWT canals and
consulted several local people along the sides of the water ways regarding the acceptability of
the proposed bathing ghats as it require a minimum of seven square metre land area.
Although the team had organised two meetings 1) at Illikkal for AK and KV canals and 2) at
Kidangara for AC canal the team also consulted several individuals along the canals regarding
the bathing ghat arrangements. The lists of people contacted are provided as attachment-1.

Kerala State Transport Project                Implementation Plan For IWT Pilot Project
The out come of the field visit and consultations are as follows.
* Majority of the bathing ghats comes under the category of 'private'.
* Very few public bathing ghats exist along the three canals compared to the total
number of bathing ghats along the canals.
* The newly proposed bathing ghat arrangements are permanent concrete structures and
need minimum maintenance.
*>  A proposal for using creepers such as curtain plants can be used as a green cover
* The inhabitants along the side of the canals categorically stated that they couldn't give
away any land for the construction of the bathing ghats hence all bathing ghats
considered are public bathing ghats with adequate government land availability.
* The team estimated a total of 25 numbers of public bathing ghats along each of these
canals totalling a requirement of 75 bathing ghats as per the proposed design.
