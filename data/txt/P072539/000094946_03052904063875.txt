Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                    ESAMP
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project (IWT Pilot Project),
as part of the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), is to improve the performance of the
State's water transport network by upgrading the waterways conditions and capacity,
together with development of the in-house capabilities of the Kerala Irrigation Department
(ID) to plan, develop and maintain the waterways network. The goal of the project is to
promote greater use of the existing inland waterways in Kerala as a more economical and
environmentally friendly mode of transport and as an integral part of the State's transport
network, with private sector and community participation. The pilot project has selected
three waterways for upgrading with the aim of being able of using the experience gained to
prepare a master plan for the revival of the inland water transport sector.
This Report, together with its appendices and incorporation by reference, constitutes an
environmental assessment as defined by the World Bank's OP 4.01 and an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) as defined by the applicable GOI legislation. It complies with
the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.  As no
resettlement has been necessary, a resettlement action plan (RAP) has not been
attempted. The purpose of the Environmental and Social Assessment and Management
Plan (ESAMP) include:
Documentation of the manner in which environmental considerations have
been incorporated in the development of the IWT Pilot Project and the
manner in which the physical, biological and social aspects of the
environment have been incorporated into the design process. This includes:
Provision of a documented assessment of the ambient environment, the
potential impacts that could occur and the actions taken to avoid or
otherwise mitigate significant adverse impacts so that decision-makers may
be fully informed and decisions taken on an informed basis.
Evaluation of potential impacts of the project.
Establishment of an engineering design philosophy that integrates
environmental and social considerations into the project's detailed
engineering design.
Assessment of alternative project designs and provide input into project
design.
Design of appropriate and  practical mitigation and environmental
management measures to be implemented during construction and
operation.
Provision of practical environmental and social management plans.
Proposing and design of environmental enhancements to be incorporated
in the project implementation plans.
The document has been completed in the standard format for environmental assessments.
Sufficient technical information has been included in the body of the report for the general
reader to make an informed decision on the issues addressed. Further technical and
other information is included in a separate volume of appendices.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                   ESAMP
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Kerala Pilot Waterway study consists of three waterways:
Alappuzha to Kottayam (AK canal)
Alappuzha to Changanaserry (AC Canal)
Kottayam - Vaikom (KV Canal)
All the proposed canals are along currently existing waterways. Both the AK and AC
canals are operational and used by country (small) boats and waterbuses. Through traffic
on the KV canal is blocked by a low bridge and an abundance of water hyacinth. Some
sections are currently used by small boats. All the waterways connect to the West Coast
Canal, a national waterway currently being dredged. This provides access to Kochi
Harbour and Ernakulam, the major port and the commercial and industrial hub of Kerala.
Thus these canals will provide important feeder routes to the national canal. The existing
and currently proposed network of canals in Kerala is shown on Exhibit 1.2 and the
location of the pilot project canals is shown on Exhibit 1.4.
The channels in the canals are going to be widened and deepened to allow sufficiently
large vessels to use them to make them attractive for commercial traffic in order to
convince private and local interests to invest in vessels and infrastructure which would
allow them to be used as viable alternative transport routes relieving road congestion in
the area.
The limiting factors to vessel passage are width and depth of the canal channels. Three
alternative combinations were considered:
17.5 m width, 1.8 m depth
17.5 m width, 2.2 m depth
20.0 m width, 2.5 m depth
Based on a study of traffic, environmental considerations and cost, the second alternative
was selected. The channel will be narrower than 17.5 m for short sections that avoids the
need to take any land. In addition to widening and deepening of the channels, the project
includes:
Raising of bridges to allow passage of vessels,
Replacement of lift bridges by modern pedestrian bridges,
Strengthening of the sides of the waterways (bunds) to prevent their erosion and collapse
due to the wave action caused by passing boats, and,
Construction of jetties to allow access to the waterways by passenger freight traffic.
The area within which these waterways are to be located is part of the coastal and lagoon
system known as the Kuttanad. This was formed by the uplifting of Arabian Sea offshore
forming a lagoon. Much of the area of this lagoon has been filled by sediments carried by
west flowing rivers coming off the Gnat Mountains to the east. Other extensive areas have
been poldered and are used to grow rice and other crops. The rest has remained as a
lagoon known as Vembanad Lake. This shallow water body used to be directly connected
to the sea at Kochi and subject to the intrusion of saline water flowing in from the sea
during the dry season when runoff from the rivers was insufficient to maintain the water
level. Salt water intrusion has now been prevented by the construction of a salinity
barrage at Thannirmukkom. A lock on either side of the barrage allows the passage of
boats. The gates of the barrage are kept open during the rainy season to allow the outflow
of the river waters and closed during the dry season to prevent the entry of saline waters.

The water quality in the waterways has been found to be high except for contamination by
faecal coliform.  As to be expected in an area with a high population with totally
inadequate sanitary facilities, and many domestic animals including large flocks of ducks,
is highly contaminated with faecal coliform, an indicator of other human pathogens being
present.
The area is quiet and generally has a high air quality being in a rural area away from road
traffic.
There is a significant population of birds in the area but little other wildlife. There are two
areas of mangroves and a private bird sanctuary in the area but they are sufficiently far
from the pilot waterways not be disturbed by them.
The sediments that will have to be dredged are substantially contaminated with pesticides.
The total population of the Districts of Alappuzha and Kottayam, within which the
waterways lie and which will be the beneficiaries of the project, is 3.8 million. However,
the population in the reclaimed area and along the waterways, who will be directly
impacted by the project, is relatively small. Many of the panchayats (rural communities)
served by the waterways are isolated and lack transport modes other than by water.
Where settlements have developed populations are concentrated and densities are high.
Generally, waterway communities are less well off than their mainland neighbours. Some
of the panchayats (communities) have a high proportion of their population below the
poverty level. There are 2276 houses adjacent to the waterways. Their quality is on
average of a standard lower than the state average. Electrification is higher than the
Kerala average of 48 percent. While 93 percent of the population is literate, only 45
percent have school leaving certificates.
Men and women interact with the waterways in different ways. Women's roles bring them
in frequent contact with the water for washing, laundry and many other household tasks.
Both men and women use the waterways for bathing. Fishing, sand mining, bund repair
and other occupations bring men into contact with the water. Both men and women are
involved in agricultural labour though in different roles. It was reported that some people
use the water for drinking. Only 30 percent of the population has a piped water supply.
Not surprisingly, a high incidence of disease was reported by local people during public
consultations. The diseases they reported included: jaundice, cholera, typhoid, skin
diseases, weils disease and stomach problems.
The project is expected to bring significant benefits to local people in terms of access to
social services, markets and their fields. It is expected to generate economic activity in the
project area and so contribute to poverty alleviation there.
The public consultations identified two particular concerns of the local people, the first was
that increased traffic would interfere with private bathing, especially by women and that the
second that increased traffic would increase the fouling of local waters by human wastes.
To address these problems, the project will provide bathing screens and require vessels to
have toilets that are emptied to adequate septic waste systems at the terminals of the
waterways. Bathing screens will be provided free for people below poverty level and at
cost for people who can afford them. The installation of enclosed toilets on vessels is,
however, not expected to reduce faecal coliform counts significantly but it does address a
local concern. A similar requirement is being made for vessels operating on national
waterways. It is therefore included for the pilot project.

The most important environmental concern addressed is the contamination of the
sediments with pesticides. The sediments were analysed at six locations for both
pesticides and heavy metals. The concentrations of heavy metals were not found to be at
levels of concern. The sediments were analysed for three pesticides, DDT, DDE (a
derivative of DDT) and BHC. No DDT was found, a concentration of 12.7 mg/kg of DDE
was found at one location; and BHC was found in concentrations of between 6.35 and
38.35 mg/kg at all the sampling sites. These are significant concentrations, considerably
greater  than  found  in  a  testing  program  carried  out in  1989.  BHC
(Betahexachlorocyclohexane) is a relatively long-lasting compound used as a pesticide
(lindane) with high yield varieties of rice. It does, however, breakdown over time. It has
therefore been decided to place dredged materials in confined disposal facilities and for
them to be covered with vegetation. They will then be tested annually for a range of
pesticides. Once the concentrations are sufficiently low for the material to be deemed safe
to be used for beneficial purposes such as topsoil, building foundations and bund repair,
the CDFs may cleared and the materials disposed of. BHC binds itself tightly to sediments
so it will not be released in significant concentrations during dredging or dewatering of
dredged materials placed in CDFs.
A detailed environmental and social assessment management plan has been prepared
detailing the responsibilities and monitoring requirements during the construction and
operation of the pilot waterways.
The costs of environmental measures have been calculated and those to be undertaken
by the contractor have been included in a bill of quantities forming part of the construction
contract.

I     PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 PROJECT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
The Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project (IWT Pilot Project), as a component
of the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), is to provide a model for the improvement of
the performance of the State's water transport network. This to be achieved by upgrading
the waterways' condition and capacity, together with development of the in-house
capabilities of the Kerala Irrigation Department (ID) to plan, develop and maintain the
waterway network. The objectives of the project are:
To promote greater use of the natural resources of inland waterways in
Kerala as a more economical and environmentally friendly mode of
transport and as an integral part of the State's transport network, with
private sector and community participation;
To use the experience gained through the pilot project to prepare a master
plan for the revival of the inland water transport sector.
To prepare a design of the waterways, which will maximise benefits to the
users and minimise negative environmental and social impacts by
incorporating environmental and social safety measures.
For a review of inland water transport in Kerala see Appendix A
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Government of Kerala has requested loan assistance from the World Bank (WB) for
the Kerala State Transport Project. In addition to its highway component, the project
includes a pilot waterway component. The Kerala State PWD is the executing agency for
the project. This infrastructure development is expected to encourage investment in the
State's industrial development.
The Pilot Inland Water Transport (IWT) component is limited to the development of three
selected feeder canals in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts to connect to, and to
supplement the national West Cost Canal. The feeder waterways selected for
improvements are (1) Alappuzha - Kottayam (2) Alappuzha - Changanaserry and (3)
Kottayam - Vaikom canals. The proposed pilot project will provide the basis for shaping a
strategy for the revival of the inland water transport system in Kerala. This component
includes a comprehensive review of the past performance of the inland water transport
system in Kerala, in particular, the preliminary report on a pilot component of the IWT
prepared by the Irrigation Department of the Government of Kerala in October 1997.
Together with other state canals, the project feeder canals connect the midlands in the
Kottayam District to the West Coast Canal and coastal areas. These canals link the towns
and industrial centres in the project area with the West Coast Canal, and through it, Kochi
Port, which is the main seaport and the major point of origin and destination of goods
transported in Kerala.
The development of the feeder canals under the IWT Pilot Project is intended to capitalize
on the improvements now underway and to assist in further promoting the development of
the IWT in the State. With the improvements proposed under the Pilot Project, the feeder
canals are expected to take on a greater role in transportation of bulk cargoes in the
project influence area After completion of the proposed improvements larger vessels will
have access to the main urban centres of the State.

1.2.1  Project Location
The project canals are located in two districts. Alappuzha and Kottayam, which constitute
the project area As the State canals are directly linked to National Waterway-Ill, the West
Coast Canal (WCC), the project is likely to have a positive impact on the neighbouring
districts, especially on Ernakulam district, which includes Kochi - the major IWT terminal,
in terms of the movement of cargo. The project will also assist in the development of
tourism in the project area.
The main development envisaged under the pilot project is the rehabilitation of
approximately 93 km of feeder canals in Alappuzha and Kottayam Districts connecting
with the National Waterway System (Exhibit 1.1). The feeder canals selected for
improvement are indicated in the following table and shown in the location map, Exhibit
1.2.

3  1 Kottayam - Vaikom             KV canal            42
The proposed work includes rehabilitating existing jetties and constructing 16 new jetties
on the KV canal, 3 new jetties on the AK Canal, 9 new jetties on the AC Canal and
constructing two new terminals at Kottayam and Changanaserry. Jetties are required for
the "landing" of cargo and for people to embark and disembark. These are typically a
simple square concrete platform on piles constructed over the water with two levels to
account for water level variations (Exhibit 1.3).
EXHIBIT 1.3: A TYPICAL JETTY
The    Kottayam-Vaikom   canal
includes sections of the Alappuzha-
Kottayam  canal, meeting at the
Kanjiram Junction (Exhibit 1.4). Of
the proposed 16 new jetties on the
KV Canal, 3 are located on the AK
section and 13 are on the KV
section.
In the main towns, at the end of each waterway, terminals are required for consolidation of
cargo and loading of the vessels. Passenger facilities, including utilities and waiting rooms
are proposed in the terminals. The terminal facilities in Kottayam and Changanaserry will
be constructed as part of this project. The land required for the construction of the
terminals is being made available by the State Irrigation Department at both locations. A
separate project for National Waterway IlIl will include the terminal designs and
construction for Alappuzha and Vaikom.
1.2.1.1 The Location of the Alappuzha-Changanaserry Canal
This route links Alappuzha, and the WCC to Changanaserry via Block C, a distance of 28
km   Please see Exhibit 1 4 This route has been recommended by the Consultant for
survey and rehabilitation due to better revenue prospects in the transportation of
agricultural products such as paddy, hay, manure, coconuts and allied products,

construction materials, lime shell etc. This route also facilitates the movement of labour. It
is noted that 1.3 km (Chainage 5.9 to 7.2) of the canal passes through Vembanad Lake.
The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has proposed terminals for National
Waterway IlIl at Alappuzha within the PIA.
1.2.1.2 The Location of the Alappuzha-Kottayam Canal
This proposed route starts from Alappuzha, passes the Munro lighthouse, between C and
S Blocks and continues between Q and R Blocks to Kottayam. The Alappuzha-Kottayam
canal also passes along a cultivated area reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake where the
paddy fields are located in 'Blocks', surrounded by artificial canals and embankments.
Agricultural activities require the transport of labourers to the reclaimed blocks via the
waterway, which is the only route available. Three km of the A-K canal passes through the
Vembanad Lake.
1.2.1.3 The Location of the Kottayam-Vaikom Canal
The Kottayam-Vaikom canal is proposed to start at the Kodimatha new terminal in
Kottayam, follow along the A-K canal until the Kanjiram junction from where it takes a
sharp right angle turn towards Vaikom, passing through Illikal, Prappuzha, Pulikuttucherry,
Mania Parambu and enters Vembanad lake at Cheepumkal. It continues on the inner route
between the mainland and the reclaimed coconut plantation (Swamikkalle) joining the
WCC in Vembanad Lake before Thannirmukkom barrage. The total length of the K-V
canal from Kottayam to Vaikom is 42 km of which the Kottayam- Kanjiram stretch,
included in the A-K Canal, is about 3.5 km and the reach from Cheepumkal to Vaikom of
14 km is part of the National Waterway IlIl. Thus the actual K-V waterways construction
work will be limited to 24.5 km between Kanjiram and Cheepumkal. The Inland Waterways
Authority of India (IWAI) has proposed terminals for National waterway Ill at Vaikom and
Thannirmukkom within the Project area.
1.2.2 Project Influence Area
The Kuttanad region, as shown in Exhibit 1.5, is considered the Project Influence Area
(PIA) for the purpose of environmental analysis. As shown in the exhibit, the entire
Kuttanad region can be considered as an environmental system, 1,100 sq. km in area.
The system is almost completely isolated from other water bodies by the Thannirmukkom
bund and Thottapally spillway. There are a number of prevailing environmental issues in
this area, which need a 'system approach'for mitigation or minimization and improvement
of environmental conditions within the area. For example improving the sanitary conditions
of the project waterways alone cannot control the presence of higher faecal coliform level
in water. This is not because of the water circulation alone but because of a number of
complex social and environmental issues prevalent in the area. This makes it necessary
to consider the entire Kuttanad region as the Influence Area of the Project. In addition to
the Kottayam and Alappuzha districts, which are in the project area, some portions of the
Pathanamthitta district is also a part of the Kuttanad region.
1.2.3 The Proposed Improvement Work
The waterways Pilot Project aims to rehabilitate the canal routes connecting the towns of
Alappuzha, Changanaserry, Kottayam and Vaikom.  A summary of the proposed
rehabilitation works is shown in Exhibit 1.6. The objectives are to improve the facilities for
passenger transport as well as for the transportation of cargo and produce throughout the
project area. Furthermore these improvements must be attractive to the private sector so
that they will be encouraged use the canal for the transport of cargo between the towns,
and possibly onwards to Kochi Port.

Technical, social and environmental assessments investigated the feasibility of canal and
waterway improvement work that include:
*      Limiting improvement to the available width;
*      Dredging and removing obstructions including the placing of dredged
materals in confined disposal facilities;
*      Easing of any sharp curves;
*      Improvement of side protection to both banks;
*      Rebuilding of bridges that have inadequate vertical clearances for vessels
to pass and removal of old bridge/remnants and other structures;
*      Rehabilitation of old jetties as required and construction of new jetties;
*      Installation of navigation aids;
*      Provision of terminal facilities; and
*     Clearing and removal of water hyacinths from     the waterways and
composting them.
The recommended works are described in detail in Chapter 4 of the Inland Water
Transport Pilot Project (IWTPP) Final Report, itemised in the IWTPP Final Engineering
Report, and shown in the design drawings. These are summarised in Exhibit 1.6. Design
recommendations have been developed based on a 10-tonne design vessel.

2     APPLICABLE POLICIES AND LEGAL & REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
2.1 INDIAN NATIONAL AND KERALA STATE REQUIREMENTS
There is no requirement for any national or state government clearance for the IWT as it
does not fall under any of the categories requiring clearance, including eco-sensitive
areas, and it is not included in the state Coastal Regulation Zone Management Plan
(CRZMP). A discussion of Indian and Kerala State regulatory frameworks is included in
Appendix B
2.2 WORLD BANK POLICIES AND REQUIREMENTS
The World Bank environmental requirements are based on the World Bank Operational
Policy OP 4.01. Under this policy, projects are classified into Category A, B or C, with
Category A representing the highest level of concern. The Bank has classified the KSTP
project as Category A. The Bank requires an environmental assessment to deal with both
the generic and the project specific issues.
The Bank has set out certain mandatory social impact mitigation requirements for its loan
projects. The Operational Policy 4.301 describes Bank policy and procedures for projects
that involve involuntary resettlement. This policy aims to improve, or at a minimum,
restore the welfare of the people who will be displaced because of a development project.
This Policy also requires that the project minimize the need for involuntary resettlement.
Where displacement is unavoidable, resettlement plans should pay particular attention to
the vulnerable groups. The Pilot Waterways component of the KSTP, however, does not
have any adverse impact on land or livelihood, as there is no requirement for additional
land for the IWT improvement works. Therefore, a resettlement action plan (RAP) was not
required. The general approach adopted in this Report has been to provide enhancement
of community resources for the people living along the canal. The land required for the
disposal of the dredge waste and the water hyacinth will be leased by the contractor and
returned to the owner when the contaminants have degraded to a safe level.
In addition, the Bank has special policy guidelines for dealing with impacts on the
indigenous communities2 due to development projects. There are no such communities
affected by the project.
In the context of the IWT environmental and social impact assessment, the applicability of
10 environmental safeguard policies of the Bank was examined as follows in Exhibit 2.1.

consultation are to be addressed in the design process in a positive manner. The other
requirements include environmental and social documentation, institutional arrangements
for implementation of environmental and social management plans during construction
and operational phases of the project and obtaining all State and National clearances.
These issues have been dealt with in a subsequent chapter.

3 METHODOLOGY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
ASSESSMENT
3.1 SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENTS
Together with engineering studies and the environmental and social assessment process
of the project, there were a few typical concerns to address. Unlike the road sector
projects, this is a pilot project without any prior experience of comparable feeder canal
projects in the country. There are neither previous studies nor Government statistics
available for the project preparation, and the baseline data collection required much
greater input than was initially anticipated.
3.2 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY OF THE ASSESSMENTS
The potential environmental and social aspects have been examined in detail at different
stages as a process. The incorporation of feed-back and assessments of those likely to
be directly affected by the proposed project is an essential feature of the methodology and
becomes increasingly important as the assessment process develops.
3.2.1 Environmental Assessment
The environmental assessment of the project examined the potential impacts on the
natural environment as well as physical impacts on the human population such as
exposure to toxins, air quality and noise. The assessment involved field work, laboratory
testing and the review of available documentation on the local environment. In addition,
input was provided from through the public participation program. The physical impact of
construction and operation of the waterways on the local population was also addressed.
Such impacts include the potential destruction of bunds that protect extensive agricultural
fields due to erosion caused by the wash created by passing vessels.
The approach and methodology included the following activities:
Reconnaissance Survey Report. Reconnaissance surveys were undertaken by the
environmental team together with the Project Coordinating Consultant's hydrographer,
commencing with a joint reconnaissance with members of the Irrigation Department and
those responsible for the documentation of the environmental investigations and issues in
April 1999. In addition to field investigations and observations, consultations were held
with local officials, and available environmental documentation was assembled for review.
Assembly and Analysis of Previously Collected Data. This included both published
and unpublished environmental data. Literature searches were undertaken and relevant
agencies (e.g., the Department of Forest, the State Pollution Control Board,
Archaeological Survey of India, etc.) were contacted and apprised of the proposed project.
Sources of previously collected data included:
*     Air, Water (surface and groundwater) and noise quality data from the
Central Pollution Control Board
*     Flora and Fauna from various sources, including the World Wildlife
Foundation (WWF) and State Forest Department
*     Baseline aspects from District Gazetteers
*     Survey of India (SOI) maps for the potentially affected districts.

Visual Inspections and Photographs. During the course of the project preparation,
besides the environmental and social assessment team, the engineering team,
economists and World Bank experts also visited the canal areas and made visual
inspections of various aspects of the required works. A large number of photographs were
taken for reference.
Preparation of the Feasibility Report. The following aspects were taken into
consideration in preparing the feasibility report:
*     Sensitive and/or critical natural habitats (e.g., national parks, wildlife
reserves, sanctuaries, sacred groves, protected areas, forest, wetlands,
etc.);
Major rivers and waterways;
*     Recorded cultural heritage sites; and
*     Any potentially sensitive areas, based on recent GOI census, official data
and information from NGOs (non-government organisations) as well as site
visits.
The results of this analysis were plotted on maps and tabulated to identify any conflicts
and recommendations made on how to resolve them. The analysis of alternatives and/or
mitigation was made as a precursor to engineering design and before undertaking the
required social impact and environmental assessment studies.
Determination of the Potential Impact Area for the Purpose of EA: It is recognised that the
exact limits of the 'potentially affected area" may require expansion in accordance with the
circumstances of the particular characteristic under discussion. It may be argued, for
example, that the improvements of Waterways will, to some degree, have a State level
impact due to their contribution as a critical element in transport planning especially with
regard to the tourism sector and food security.
To ensure a comprehensive approach and an appropriate environmental context for
discussion, wherever necessary the State/District wise data is presented as a context and
the Kuttanad area as a whole through which the waterways pass have been adopted as
the outer limits of the potentially affected area for the purposes of the EA. The Kuttanad
area in which the project waterways are located is unique in environmental and social
aspects. In addition to Kottayam and Alappuzha some portions of Pathanamthitta also
form the Kuttanad region. In the discussion of baseline data that follows, therefore,

Kuttanad data are followed by detailed expositions of the present waterways situation for
each environmental criterion.
3.2.2 Social Assessment
The social assessment addressed aspects of the project related to the human
environment other than those of a physical nature. This included:
*  The general population distribution;
*  Concentration of tribal or cultural groups;
*  Concentration of low income communities;
*  Areas of significant canal encroachments;
Social assessments of the project examined the potential impact of proposed project
actions on the social environment, particularly those communities and households directly
affected by waterway improvements. Attention was directed to potential negative impacts
associated with physical relocation, loss of land or other physical assets, and loss of
access to livelihood. Of particular concern were potential impacts on Scheduled Tribes,
Scheduled Castes, and other marginal or vulnerable groups including the Other Backward
Castes, widows and women-headed households.
The process of social assessment encouraged informed public participation in project
planning including involvement of the potential project affected groups and local
Governments. The assessment results were considered with technical and economic
feasibility findings in the final determination of waterway improvements. The assessments
also contributed to the preparation of social action plans governing project implementation
and the mitigation of adverse social impacts.
Social assessments complied with appropriate national and local laws and guidelines, and
in accordance with World Bank policy directives. Minimizing resettlement, displacement of
populations, and other negative social impacts were important criteria both in determining
alignments and in final selection of project alternatives.
The social assessment process featured internal and external scoping activities, field
appraisals and investigations, collaboration with the Irrigation Department and GOK to
prepare a policy framework governing social impacts and resettlement and rehabilitation,
and a variety of consultations with stakeholders, beneficiaries and affected communities.
Key issues and concerns identified in the consultation process are discussed in Chapter 6.
The process of assessment is described below.
3.2.2.1 Preliminary Social Assessment
A preliminary social assessment was carried out in September 1999 soon after the
inception of project preparation. It involved an initial internal scoping of potential issues
and concerns based on the review of project materials and preliminary plans, review of
available secondary information, and meetings and interviews with project authorities and
knowledgeable persons. It also included reconnaissance-level field surveys of the pilot
project canals. Findings of the preliminary social assessment were reported in the IWT
Monthly Progress Reports and the IWT Pilot Project Draft Feasibility Report submitted in
October 1999.

3.2.2.2 Scoping Sessions
In addition to internal scoping, social issues and concerns associated with the IWT Pilot
Project were considered in a comprehensive external scoping exercise carried out in
conjunction with stakeholder consultations and workshops.
Detailed project information was prepared and distributed to nearly 200 NGOs,
government agencies, university and research institute experts, and other interested
parties, and they were invited to take part in or provide information to Scoping Workshops
organized by the PCC under the PWD and ID sponsorship. This is elaborated in
Chapter 6.
3.2.2.3 Local Consultations
An essential feature of the social assessment process was consultation with local experts
and stakeholders, particularly those potentially project-affected persons and communities
who will be most directly impacted by the project actions. Social and environmental
scientists and others in the Kerala academic and research sector and government
organisations were among experts that were requested to contribute to assessment of
project impacts. Identified stakeholders included the public, commercial and industrial
waterway-users, communities and local governments along canals proposed for
rehabilitation, State and Centre development and regulatory agencies, non-government
organisations (NGOs), and others with a 'stake' or interest in the project. Stakeholder
perspectives and concerns were solicited and addressed through consultations and a
variety of participatory- and action-research approaches.
3.2.2.4 Field Surveys
The social assessment process made use of data gathered in topographical, hydrological,
and other engineering field surveys and studies. Preliminary census and survey of canal
front households and structures were carried out along the project canals. Results of these
exercises, including preliminary house and structure counts by project chainage and for
each affected local government unit are provided in Appendix 3.1.
Detailed census and survey instruments were developed, but the adoption of project
designs that eliminated the need for canal widening and minimized the project corridor of
impact, made their deployment unnecessary. A variety of rapid rural appraisal techniques
were utilized in a series of field visits to the project area. These included semi-structured
interviews and informal consultations and focus group discussions with canal residents,
users, and affected groups. The semi-structured interview format is provided in Appendix
3.2.

4     ENVIRONMENTAL AND              SOCIAL BASELINE OF THE
PROJECT AREA
The project, as previously indicated, is located in the Kuttanad area of Alappuzha and
Kottayam districts. The western portions of all three pilot waterways run through Lake
Vembanad. The eastern portions of the Alappuzha to Kottayam and Alappuzha to
Changanaserry waterways run through areas that are extensively poldered and below the
level of the surrounding waters. Man has extensively altered the environment of the
backwaters by the construction of barrages and poldering. These areas are collectively
known as the Kuttanad. The total area of Kuttanad including the agricultural land, areas
covered by water and other areas is 1,100 sq.km. in three different districts: Alappuzha,
Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. The following sections describe the social and
environmental baseline of the project area.
4.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
4.1.1 Topography, Soil and Geology
Topography: The Kuttanad has unusual topographical features with a sizable area lying
below sea level. The area has a concave relief and slopes down towards the northwest.
Towards the west the elevation gradually descends below sea level. Then it increases and
rises above sea level.
Physiographically, the Kuttanad region is located within the sandy coastal region and the
midland region.  The sandy coastal region is a narrow strip of low-lying land,
interspersed with extensive backwaters. This strip comprises about 10 percent of the total
area and supports 26 percent of the population. The midland region is an undulating
region to the east of the coastal sandy region having clustered hills and numerous valleys
watered by many streams. These regions cover about 42 percent of the total area of the
state and support 59 percent of the population. It grows a diversity of seasonal, annual
and perennial crops such as rice, sugarcane, tapioca, banana, coconut, areca nut, pepper,
cashew, rubber etc.
Three types of landforms characterize the present landscape, which appears to have
evolved from a process of aggradations: marine forms, lacustrine forms and fluvial forms.
Much of the land is poldered and under the level of the surrounding water which is
controlled by two barrages across Lake Vembanad at Thannirmukkom and at Thottapally
as shown earlier in Exhibit 1.5. The Exhibit 4.1 shows the major features along each of
the project waterways in linear diagrams. This includes agricultural areas, areas to be
dredged, dredge spoils disposal areas, pumping stations, temples, schools hospitals,
existing jetties, air, water, noise and sediment monitoring locations, Vembanad lake area,
waterways and narrow sections.
Soil: The soil is generally sandy though clayey black soil was noted in the land areas of
the waterways being studied. The soil is mainly coastal and riverine alluvium. The coastal
alluvium soil is immature with high sand content, low water holding capacity and a pH
value of less than 6.5 in most areas. It is very deep with surface texture ranging from
sandy loam to clay. It has originated from recent deposits, predominantly marine, with
some fluvial sediment along the coastline. The riverine alluvium has developed along the
river valleys and occurs throughout the districts cutting across the extensive laterite soil. It
is very fertile having a high water holding capacity and containing plant nutrients, which
are regularly replenished during floods.

Any improvement to the waterways will necessitate the strengthening of the canal bunds
on both sides to protect the agricultural land. The movement of boats, especially
motorboats, creates waves capable of eroding the bunds to destructive levels. Any
collapse of these bunds will result in submergence of vast agricultural areas and loss of
standing crops worth many lakhs3 of rupees.
Geology: Originally the project area was part of the shallow coastal area of the Arabian
Sea. As a result of Geological uplift, a shallow lagoon was formed into which the rivers,
draining from the mountains to the east, discharge. The silt deposits carried by the rivers
have formed the coast. The original lagoon became an extensive brackish water lagoon
and backwater system extending from Alappuzha in the south to Kochi in the north and
connected to the sea by the Kochi channel. In Kottayam District, there are a number of
quarries, which can supply the required construction materials. The charnockites and
migmatic gneisses make up the bulk of the exposed rocks in the State. Granite is seen
near Chengannur and Thiruvalla. The location of material resources in and around
Kuttanad region is shown in the Exhibit 4.3 (Consultant's Geotechnical report, April 2000).
Climate: Kerala has a humid tropical climate with relatively little temperature variation.
It is neither too cold in winter nor too hot in summer. It is subject to the southwest and
northeast monsoons.

Wind: Wind direction4 and speed recorded at 0830 hrs and 17.30 hrs for all the days
during the period 1979-1980 have been processed and depicted by wind Rose diagrams.
A wind rose diagram for Alappuzha station is presented in Exhibit 4.4. In Kochi and
Alappuzha the wind is mainly from the west and northwest. In Kerala, the distribution
pattern indicates that the inland stations experience more calm days due to the sheltering
effects of the Western Ghats
Rainfall: The average annual rainfall in the project area varies from 3000 to 4600 mm and
results in flooding of the rivers and canals during the southwest monsoon from June to
September. About 60 % of the annual rainfall occurs during that period, the number of
rainy days being 130-145 per year. The rainfall in the project-influenced area is about
3000 mm/year. Two seasons are apparent. The wet season from May to November and
the dry season from December to April. The wet season starts with the southwest
monsoon as in other parts of Kerala, which lasts from the end of May until September, and
continues, with the northeast monsoon until November. The rainfall data for the districts of
Alappuzha and Kottayam are presented in Exhibit 4.5.

4.1.2 Surface Hydrology
The lagoons are normally subjected to salinity intrusion. However, in the project area this
is prevented by the barrages at Thannirmukkom, approximately 10 km south from Vaikom,
(Plate 17 & 18, Appendix 4.1) and Thottapally in the south. The sluice gates regulate the
water level in the backwaters. During the monsoon seasons the gates are kept open to
allow the overflow of the rainwater to discharge into the sea. The gates are closed again in
the dry seasons to prevent the saline water flowing into the backwaters. To allow
navigation, the barrages have locks at both ends the measurements of which were an
important factor in the planning and designing of the feeder canal design vessel and
structures. The dimension of the gates will allow IWT design vessels (length 25m, width
4.4m and draft 1.8m) to fit.
Groundwater: There are extensive groundwater resources in the coastal alluvial plains
but much of this is saline.
Rivers: The water level in the Kuttanad canals has varied considerably over the years,
mainly as a result of discharge from the rivers running into Vembanad Lake. The details of
various rivers draining to the Kuttanad areas are shown in Exhibit 4.6 and the location of
the rivers are shown in Exhibit 1.5 (Section 1). A further influence upon the level variations
is the operation of the Thannirmukkom barrage, restricting tidal influence. During the
season in which the gates are permanently open, a significant level variation is noticeable
in the lake as far as the extreme ends of the project canals. During the dry season it is
noted that there are very few currents in the canal network studied. Therefore it is
considered safe to assume that no significant water slopes exist during the extreme low
water periods.

4.1.2.1 Vembanad Lake
This is the biggest water body along the west coast of India. This lake extends from
Alappuzha to Azhikode. The total area of Vembanad Lake is 36,500 ha. Exhibit 4.7
shows the land use characteristics of the Kuttanad region. About 64% of the water
surface area has been reclaimed for various purposes such as paddy cultivation, coconut
retting, aquaculture etc. The reclaimed area in general is the Kuttanad. The water in lake
Vembanad is brackish. The eastern portion of the waterways is likely to have similar
salinities during the dry season but may have lower salinities during the monsoons.

4.1.3 Water Quality
4.1.3.1 Sanitation practices along the waterways
Sanitation practices, that influence water quality, are described in Exhibit 4.8. Extensive
monitoring of the water quality between March 1988 and June 1989 revealed a relatively
good state of the aquatic environment considering that the Kuttanad is a densely
populated area. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), an important indicator of the water
quality, was found to be generally low and the water is almost saturated with dissolved
oxygen. The water is severely polluted only near Alappuzha. All the effluents directly enter
the canals through small outlets. This is due to the fact that Alappuzha is a highly
developed and congested urban area having no sewerage collection and treatment
system.
As with Alappuzha, there are no sewerage and treatment systems in the urban areas of
Kottayam and Changanaserry. All the effluents directly enter the canals through numerous
small outlets. There are sizeable flocks of ducks on the waterways. The major deficiency
found was a high level of faecal bacteria, the levels being in general 10 times the
allowable level according to the Indian Standards for production of drinking water by
simple disinfection.
The level of faecal bacteria is also very high for other domestic purposes (bathing and
washing). Sanitation facilities are available to one third of the population in the Kuttanad
basin. The present population is 10 lakh (one million). The cost of providing sanitation
facilities to over seven lakh people would be over 140 crores (1400 million) rupees. To
arrive at this estimate the family size considered is five members per family and the cost
per facility is 0.01 million rupees (cost for low cost sanitation). Only 25% of the total
population have access to piped drinking water supply.

4.1.3.2 Water Quality Laboratory Analysis
Water Quality Testing And Analysis has been carried out for the most important
parameters namely, pH, DO, BOD, Faecal coliform and Oil and grease at the locations
shown on Exhibit 4.9. The tests were undertaken in the month of May, prior to the
southwest monsoon and June 2000, during the monsoon. The comprehensive water
quality investigations were carried out in the same area as the Kuttanad Water Balance
Study', which also represent the characteristics of project waterways and canals. The
survey period was March 1987 to June 1989. The results of the water quality analyses are
shown in Exhibit 4.1 0. They are compared to Indian tolerance limits in Exhibit 4.11. Also

*Faecal coliform (Source: Kuttanad Water Balance Study)
pH: The pH of natural water usually lies in the range of 4.4 to 8.5 (with neutral at 7.0). Its
value is governed largely by the carbon dioxide/carbonate/bicarbonate equilibrium.
Organic substances may affect it, by change in the carbonate equilibrium due to the
bioactivity of plants and in some cases by hydrolysable salts. The "desirable" range of pH
prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is between 6.5 and 8.5. This is
the range, which provides adequate protection to the life of fresh water fish and bottom
dwelling invertebrates.
Dissolved Oxygen: The solubility of atmospheric oxygen in fresh water ranges from 14.6
mg/l at 0°C to about 7 mg/l at 350C under 1 atmospheric pressure. The CPCB
recommends a dissolved oxygen value of 4-6 mg/l in all types of water. The minimum
dissolved oxygen concentration of 4 mg/I reflects freedom from acute oxygen consuming
organic pollution upstream of the water body. The dissolved oxygen values ranged from
5.0 to 6.33 mg/l in five stations; only at Changanaserry, was a very low value of 1.27 mg/l
recorded.
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): BOD is a measure of oxygen required by micro-
organisms in decomposing the organic matter present in the water. BOD indicates the
amount of oxidisable organic matter present in the solution and the pollution a capability' of
the matter. In the study area BOD values range from a minimum of 0.73 mg/l to a
maximum of 2.33 mg/I. According to CPCB recommendation, the BOD value of 2 mg/l or
less of the water ensures that the water is almost pure. The BOD of 3 mg/l or less
indicates reasonable freedom from oxygen demanding wastes.
Total Suspended Solids (TSS): The concentration of total suspended solids ranges from
1.0 mg/l to 31.5 mg/I. The water sample collected at Changanaserry recorded the highest
value of suspended solids.
Oil & Grease: Oil & Grease is any material, which is extracted or recovered as a
substance soluble in petroleum, ether or hexane. If present in excessive amounts, this
may- interfere with both aerobic and anaerobic biological processes. According to the
Bureau of Indian Standards for Industrial and Sewage Effluent Discharge, the maximum
permissible concentration of Oil and Grease in effluent to be discharged to inland surface
water is 10 mg/l. All the water samples analysed contain oil and grease at a concentration
of 10 mg/l or less. The maximum concentration of 10 mg/l was found at Alappuzha boat
jetty.
Faecal Coliforms: Water usually contains millions of micro-organisms, most of which are
harmless, at times it may also contain pathogenic organisms (Refer to Exhibit 4.12).
Faecal pollution and sewage contamination are some of the common water quality
Louis Berger International/Sheladia Associates/CES/ICT                  27

problems. A measure of the degree of microbic pollution is needed to determine the
suitability of the water for drinking, swimming or aquaculture. Sanitary conditions are
considered satisfactory as long as the faecal Coliform bacterial levels do not exceed a
mean of 200 per 100 ml based on a minimum of five samples taken over an 80-day period
as long as at least 10 % of the total samples taken during any 30-day period do not
exceed 400 per 100 ml. Very high concentrations of faecal coliform were detected in all
the locations except at Marthandam. The values ranged from 4300 MPN/100 ml to 7500
MPN/100 ml with the maximum value observed at Changanaserry station.
Water Temperature: Temperatures in the Kuttanad waters vary between 24 and 350 C.
Water temperature is at a minimum during the monsoon season between July and
September. From November onwards the temperature increases steadily, reaching a
maximum in April. Temperatures are generally lower, upstream of Kuttanad and gradually
increase towards the Vembanad Lake.
Kuttanad Water Balance Study: As a measure of comparison, the Kuttanad Water
Balance Studies (December 1989) revealed the following test results for the entire
Kuttanad region as follows:
pH: Generally pH in the Kuttanad varied between 6.5 and 7.5. Low values of 4 to 4.8
occurred when the acid soils are flushed.
Oxygen Balance: The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) rarely exceeds 5 mg/I. An
oxygen concentration of 7-8 mg/l at 300 C means complete saturation. In the polluted
Alappuzha canals DO values vary between 0 and 5 mg/l. whereas BOD values were 10 to
20 mg/I and COD levels attained 80 mg/I. All Stations occasionally had BOD values above
2 mg/I, which is the Indian standard maximum level for drinking water.
Faecal Coliform: Faecal Coliform counts often exceeded the Indian standard for
swimming water of 500 per 100 ml of sample (EEC 1975).
Salinity: Salinities in the Kochi backwaters gradually increase towards the north. Salinity
intrusion also takes place through the Thottapally spillway and the Thrikunnapuzha River.
Leakage through locks and shutters allows brackish water to enter Vembanad Lake when
the Thannirmukkom barrier is closed.
Primary Productivity: During the monsoon season primary productivity is generally low.
Although nutrient concentrations during the floods are high, light intensity is low due to the
high water turbidity. Therefore the nutrients are not effectively used by the phytoplankton
before the post monsoon period, resulting in an increase in the primary productivity during
that season. In the Vembanad Lake including the project waterways behind the salinity
barrier productivity is lower than the southern part of the lake. In Kochi backwaters high
levels of fish and prawn production is due to the highest primary production.
4.1.3.3 Results of Water Analysis
The water quality analysis indicated that the waterways are highly contaminated with
pathogens but otherwise are generally of sufficiently high quality to support a healthy
aquatic eco-system. Other factors may be causing environmental stress.
4.1.3.4 Sedimentation
Depth Characteristics: The general depth aspects are very important to the operation of
waterways. Sediments from the rivers are being deposited in the lake. This is the main
factor affecting its depth. Further industrial and other wastes also decrease the depth at a

slow rate. The present depth is not sufficient in many sections for safe navigation in all
seasons. Dredging will be required at many sections to make the canal navigable in all
seasons. Manual dredging is a common sight in the waterways. Usually the local people
wanted to fill land to reclaim it for various purposes. Mining for sand, clay etc along the
waterways is not an uncommon sight. The sampling locations for dredge material and
water quality are as shown in Exhibit 4.8. It is also estimated that for maintenance about
5% of initial dredging will be required annually. Appendix I provides the report of Central
Water Analysis Laboratory.
Sediment Quality: The parameters analysed for sediments were pesticides and heavy
metals. The analytical results for heavy metals are presented in Exhibit 4.12 and those for
pesticides in Exhibit 4.13. Mercury, Chromium, Cadmium, Copper, Lead and Arsenic are
the heavy metals that were analysed. The pesticides were DDT, BHC and DDE.

Note: ND- Not Detected
Heavy Metals: Of the six heavy metals analyzed in the sample, three were not detected.
The undetected three metals were arsenic, cadmium, and mercury. The metals, copper
(3.85-10.95 mg/kg), chromium (ranged from non-detectable to 6 25 mg/kg) and lead (0.15-
0.95 mg/kg) were found at sufficient levels to warrant review. It was assumed that the
chromium was total chromium and that the valence state of the material in the sediment
was Cr+3, rather than the considerably more toxic Cr+6. Using the US Army Corps of

Engineers (USACE) guidance, the concentrations of metals found in the sediment were
not of sufficient levels to indicate potential problems in the elutriates (or the re-suspended
sediments in the water column due to dredging). The concentrations discussed in USACE
conversations were compared against the World Bank Standard and were considerably
below these levels for the metals analyzed.
Pesticides: Three pesticides (actually two pesticides and one of the pesticide's metabolic
by products) were also evaluated. The six locations were evaluated for DDT [dichloro-
diphenyl-tichloroethane] (non-detectable), DDE [dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene] (found
in one sample at 12.7 mg/kg) and BHC [Betahexachlorocyclohexane] (ranged from 6.35-
38.35 mg/kg or ppm). A previous study in this region by BKH Consulting Engineers
(1989)7 found the sediments to range in BHC from 0-200 ppb (20,000 ng/l). At first glance
it would appear that the sediments in the most recent sampling were considerably more
concentrated with regards to BHC than the 1989 study. However, the most recent
samples were collected using the surficial sampling techniques and only sampled the most
recently deposited sediments that have not been allowed to undergo anaerobic
degradation in the sediment. Thus these concentrations are probably worst case. There
should not be any long term effects anticipated from these concentrations of pesticides on
aquatic life or humans that consume fish, prawns, or clams due to the tropical conditions
of this region. However, these pesticides will have a potential to contribute to effects on
the aquatic environment or humans if the sediments from the dredging operations are not
managed correctly. This is because the sediments may have sufficient levels of BHC to
contribute to an adverse aquatic impact for a relatively short period. The pesticide BHC is
readily degraded under anaerobic conditions but not under aerobic conditions. In addition,
DDE is highly persistent in the environment and may be of greater concern if it becomes
more wide spread and at higher concentrations.
4.1.4 Air Quality
The air quality in the vicinity of the waterways is good as there is little industry and only a
few roads in the vicinity. Cooking and other fires in the area cause some pollution.
The National and State air quality standards are shown in Exhibit 4.14 Air quality testing
has been undertaken in Kottayam and the results are shown in on Exhibit 4.15.

As can be seen by comparison of these tables, sulphur dioxide concentrations do not
exceed national standards for sensitive areas. Nitrogen oxide concentrations slightly
exceeded the maximum 24-hour standard for residential areas. Particulate levels are
high. However, concentrations in the urban areas of Kottayam are not representative of
those along the waterways, which are certainly much lower.
Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in an agreement with Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) of the KSTP has generated primary data on air quality.
This work was conducted during April 2001. Test locations are the same as that of the
water and sediment sampling locations. The average values of all parameters are
provided in the Exhibit 4.16.

4.1.5 Noise
Noise levels are generally low in the vicinity of the waterways as there are few sources of
loud noise, such as highways and factories.  There will be activities such as rice
harvesting and loud radios and festivals that will be the sources of occasional noise in
some locations. The Government of Kerala has published ambient noise standards8,
which are shown in Exhibit 4.17.

and Kerala state ambient noise standards.
4.1.6 Biological Environment: Flora, Fauna and Ecosystems
4.1.6.1 Terrestrial Ecology
Flora and Fauna In The Kuttanad Area: The area is rich in avifauna. Like other parts of
Kerala many species are seen in this region. There are no other species of wildlife of
importance than birds in the project area. The area is densely populated with cultivation of
Paddy, Coconut and Plantain, pepper and rubber being the most dominant. Ducks, cattle
and sheep as domestic animals and poultry are common.
The mangrove ecosystems in the project area are shown in the Exhibit 4.19. The
Kumarakom mangrove ecosystem (approximately five km from Chipunkal - the nearest
location along the KV canal) attracts large number of birds, especially migrants.9 This
ecosystem is a bird sanctuary, which is managed privately. The Pathiramanal mangroves

(approximately six km from the nearest location of the project canal) were also surveyed
as apart of the project (refer to Exhibit 1.5). The mangroves at Pathiramanal and
Kumarakom are highly degraded in appearance. At Kumarakom a mangrove eco-
restoration program has been observed. The effect of salinity control would be the main
threat to these ecological systems. A project for establishing a tourist hotel complex at
Pathiramanal Island is being undertaken by the Kerala Tourism Department. Survey work
has been observed. The chief species of mangroves'° are the Rhizophora species,
Brugiriera conjugata, Ceroips, Candoleana, Sonneratia, Pandanus, etc.

Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary: The bird sanctuary at Kumarakom is 'private' (not listed by
Government agencies such as the Forest Department) and is very small. It is spread over
14 acres of lush greenery and blue waters, Kumarakom offers sanctuary to various birds
including water foul, waterbucks, cuckoos and Siberian storks which nest and spend the
summer here. About 63 species of birds are reported to frequent this sanctury. Many
tourists combine their backwater tourism with a visit to this sanctuary. This sanctuary is
about 4-6 Km away from the Cheepumkal area of Kottayam- Vaikom canal, the nearest
location to the Project waterways.
4.1.6.2 Aquatic Ecology
The water quality studies carried out for the Kuttanad Water Balance Project between
March 1988 and June 1989 revealed a healthy state of the aquatic environment
considering the Kuttanad as a densely populated area. The water is severely polluted only
near Alappuzha. This is due to the solid and liquid waste from the Alappuzha urban area.
There are no sewerage systems in the Alappuzha, Kottayam and Changanaserry town
areas. Due to the construction of Thannirmukkom salinity barrier there was a sudden
decline in the water quality, which adversely affected the prevailing aquatic environment.
This is due to the sudden cessation of natural flushing and cleaning of the area. In the
case of molluscs, which were found abundantly in the Vembanad Lake, there was a large
decrease in number.
The IWT Pilot Project will have no significant direct impacts on the aquatic eco-system as
it is extremely large in volume and the project activity, including dredging, is confined to a
very small area. A detailed data on aquatic benthic fauna is not available. The entire
aquatic ecosystem is dependent on the primary production in the aquatic ecosystem
(Details in Section 4.1.4.1, sub-titled Primary Productivity).

Fauna:   The large water bodies attract all types of marine birds and harbour an
abundance of brackish water fish fauna.
Water Fauna: The common fish and mollusc and other aquatic species include konju,
kanimeen, vala, katla, mrigaala, varal, cherumeen, tortoise, and water snakes. Migrating
marine fish and prawns, tolerant of a wide salinity range and true brackish water species
constitute the main resources for the estuarine fisheries."
Avifauna: Most common are crows (house crows as well as jungle crows), tree pies
(Dendrocitta), babblers and the seven sisters, mynahs. Other birds such as bulbuls,
magpie robins, paradise flycatchers, king crows or drongo (Dicrurus) and tylor bird are
also common.
The aquatic or marsh birds, permanent dwellers or migrants, are abundant along the water
bodies. The Kadal Kakka,(Terns and Thalassus) are abundant in one season. The paddy
bird (Ardeola grayi) is found in inundated paddy fields. The migratory teals coming to the
shores during winter months represent the ducks.
Flora. The ground is moist and marshy or even covered with water during the major part
of the year. In the area submerged species12 of Chara, Nitella, Ceratophyllam, Utrichlaria,
Hydrilla and Potamojcton could be seen. In Shallow waters grow Aponogeton, Ludwigia,
Limnophyla, Marsilia, Myriophyllaum, Hygrorhyxa, Jussciaea, Neptunia, Nymphyea and
Limnathamum. Exhibit 4.20 shows the plants of economic importance in the region.
Weeds: The major weeds encountered are wild rice, echnicloa and aquatic weeds, which
are swept into the paddy fields. The removal of wild rice and echnicloa is carried out by
hand or herbicides are used. The African payal (Salvinia) or water fern is now under
control.
Water Hyacinth: Water Hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) is a free-floating plant, most
commonly seen along the canals and waterways in abundance. This plant has nodes and
small roots. Only one or two roots just touch the mud. It reproduces rapidly by vegetative
propagation. The detailed description of water hyacinth in the project area has been
provided in Appendix K. The current activity of the National Waterways Ill does not include
weed control. The National waterway is planned through the wide-open lake and kayal
areas. In all these areas weeds are not a serious threat to navigation.
The weed causes hindrance to the movement of vessels and country boats along the
canals of the Kuttanad area. Water hyacinths provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes
and seriously affect the health of the people unless prompt and vigorous action is taken to
eradicate it. Apart from being a nuisance to fishing operations, the propellers of motorised

vessels often become fouled with this weed resulting in their frequent stopping to clear
propellers with the consequent loss of time. Therefore, control and removal of water
hyacinth is an important part of the present project. The project will use a combination of
mechanical and manual methods for collection of weeds from the lake and canals. A
comparison of the mechanical and manual methods is provided in Appendix K.
The testing of water hyacinth for heavy metal content has been undertaken by CWRDM -
an autonomous research organisation established by the Government of Kerala. The
hyacinths were sampled on both sides of the waterways at the same locations as those
from which sediment samples were taken. The results are shown in Exhibit 4.21. The full
report on sampling and analysis is contained in Appendix L.

use as composted manure. However they should not be used as cattle or other animal
feed. (See Appendix J)
4.2 SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE PROJECT AREA
4.2.1 Demographic Overview
India is made up of 28 States and seven Union Territories out of which Kerala is the tenth
largest in population. With more than 31 million people"3, Kerala houses 3.44% of the
national population. The area of the State, approximately 38,800 sq km, is only 1.2% of
the nation's area and its population density of 749 persons/sq km, is almost three times
greater than the national average. Despite being one of the most densely populated
States, the 10-year population growth rate (1981-1991) in Kerala was 14.36%, significantly
less than the national average of 23.89%.
Considering only two districts, Alappuzha and Kottayam, in which project improvements
will occur, the beneficiary population is slightly more than 3.8 million, about 13% of
Kerala's population. The social assessment conducted for the project did not identify any
tribal population. The land area of these two districts is more than 3600 kM2, about 9.3%
of the State's total. A demographic profile of this Project Area is shown in Exhibit 4.22.
Women beneficiaries outnumber men. Kerala has the distinction of being the only Indian
State with a sex ratio that shows a surplus of women. In 1991, there were 1036 women
for every 1000 men in Kerala, against an all India figure of 927. In the 2001 Census the

number of women went up to 1058 for every 1000 men The project area shows figures
proportional to those of the State.
4.2.2 Social Profile
The overall population in the reclaimed block area and along the waterways is relatively
small. Many of the Panchayat areas served by project canals are isolated and lack
transport modes other than the waterways. Where settlements have developed, for
example at key junctions like Kanjiram and along the rivers, populations are concentrated
and densities are quite high. Often confined to the breadth of narrow bunds, waterway
communities are crowded along canal banks, and land is extremely scarce.
In many cases, housing and other standards are below the average levels for the State.
While all Kerala housing construction figures indicate about 56% pucca (high construction
standard), 19% semi-pucca (moderate construction standard), and 25% kutcha (mud and
thatch), the canal-fronting population, particularly in the Panchayat areas, exhibits a higher
percentage of semi-pucca construction. Surveys also enumerated several dozen
temporary shelters along canal banks in the reclaimed block areas housing migrant
agricultural labourers. Household electrification is higher than the Kerala average of 48%,
but some more remote areas remain without service.
Generally, waterway communities are less well off than their mainland neighbours.
Although they enjoy many of the benefits of the progressive social development policies in
Kerala, their access to services and especially to safe water and sanitation are more
limited. While literacy is high in the Kuttanad region14 at 93%, only 45% of the population
has a school-leaving certificate.
Social assessment surveys indicated that in addition to 2276 houses along the three canal
banks, the canal front communities include 303 other bank-side buildings. These include
numerous schools, temples, churches, mosques, hospitals, shops and commercial
properties, pump-sheds and agro-industrial enterprises. People living along the banks of
the canals depend on the waterway primarily to carry on their day-to-day activities, such
as bathing, washing clothes, retailers selling their wares from their boats, collecting spoil to
build bunds, and transport.
Bunds and canal embankments are of vital importance both as living space for the
communities and as structures that prevent undesired flooding and regulate water levels
within the extensive cropped areas during the growing season. To protect their property
and houses, residents build additional temporary sidewalls to increase the height of bank
protection around them during the monsoon period.
Gender dimensions of waterway use are important in the project area. Men and women
use and interact with canals and inland waterways in different spheres. As indicated
above, women's roles bring them frequently to canal banks for washing, laundry and many
other household tasks. Both men and women use the waterways for bathing. Fishing,
sand. mining and other occupations bring men into contact with inland waters, as does
bank and bund repair, another male activity. Both men and women are involved in
agricultural labour in the Kuttanad paddies, although their roles differ. A high proportion of
women works as agricultural labourers.
Members of the Scheduled Castes (SC) comprise nearly 10% of Kerala's population.

average  The SC proportion is higher than average in some places of the project area.
These include Vaikom and Vechoor.
The distribution of the canal-front population and structures for the entire project is shown
in Exhibit 4.23. The canal length to be rehabilitated and the density of canal-side
population and structures vary considerably within the project area. Approximately 77% of
all project-proposed canal rehabilitation occurs within the first ten Panchayats. Four
Panchayats, Thiruvarppu, Kainakari, Kavalam, and Pulinkunnu, account for nearly half of
the canal lengths included in the entire project. These Panchayats are served by more
than one of the three canals. The largest canal-front populations are settled in Thiruvarppu
and Kavalam, closely followed by Alappuzha and Kottayam Municipalities. Greatest
densities of houses and all structures occur in the short Changanaserry segment of the AC
Canal (32/km) and in Aimanam Panchayat (24.7/km).

If the local municipal canal bank population is combined with the estimated ward level
population in the impacted Panchayats, it yields an estimated primary potentially affected
population of 92,370 representing 18,128 households. Of these, 2276 households and
approximately 11,500 persons resident upon the banks of project canals are potentially the
most directly affected.
Canal-front residences and other structures are greatest in number in the Alappuzha,
Thiruvarppu, and Kottayam stretches. Altogether, almost 750 houses and other structures
including shops, schools, religious institutions, pump-houses, and other buildings line the
canal banks over their approximate length of 23 km. Canal fronting structures are detailed
by project chainage in Appendix F, Table A-1 to A-3 and summarized by local government
unit in Appendix F, Table A-4.
4.2.3 Economic Overview
Macro-economic indicators place Kerala below all India levels in income and show income
differentials in the districts within the Project Area. Per capita income in Kerala at current
prices was estimated at Rs. 9066/- for 1996-97, with an annual growth rate of 8.9%. The
State lags behind the national average, with the 1996-1997 gap being approximately
18.5% District level income data for the Project Area at current prices from 1993-94 to
'5LGU = Local Government Unit, includes both the municipal and Panchayat areas

1996-97 is summarized in 4.24. In economic and other measures, Alappuzha generally
ranks behind Kottayam and the State, and it is often considered a depressed area largely
bypassed by development. Of the two project districts, Alappuzha is less developed when
measured by per capita income and its annual growth rate is below the State average.
Kottayam is above the State average in both measures.

Paddy is virtually the only crop grown in the bunded fields of the Kuttanad and the poor
drainage conditions make most of the land unsuitable for other production. Coconut is
grown on the bunds and higher areas and in some cases, in plantations on reclaimed land.
The main paddy crop in the Kuttanad is the punja (grown only once a year). The crop is
grown in the early part of the dry season, from November to March.
There is little industrial development in the project districts and the number of large and
medium industries relative to other Kerala districts is low. The several dozen enterprises at
this scale present are dwarfed by those in neighbouring Ernakulam, the commercial and
industrial centre of the State. With the international Port of Kochi, Ernakulam is the
dominating origin and destination for goods transported in Alappuzha and Kottayam. The
economic structure of Kerala and Project Area districts is profiled in Exhibit 4.25.

Alappuzha, although employment in these sectors is significantly greater in Kottayam,
indicating the difference in size and nature of industry between the two districts.
Exhibit 4.26 shows employment and income patterns of the canal banks area population.
Agricultural labour is the predominant form of employment throughout the canal region and
within this, females dominate in number over the males in all but two Panchayats. Other
important livelihood activities include livestock forestry, fishing, sand mining,
manufacturing processing servicing, construction work, trade and commerce, and
transport storage and communications.
4.2.4 Land Use
The land use characteristics of the region are shown in Exhibit 4.27. The land use in the
vicinity of the waterways is largely agricultural with rice as the main crop. The section of
the Vaikom to Kottayam waterway, from where it diverts to the Alappuzha to Kottayam
section, has many fine pucca buildings with mixed crop gardens of coconut, bananas,
areca nut, etc. There are a number of villages and small settlements bordering the
waterways. It is also a densely populated area. Land use includes built-up residential
areas, schools, temples /churches /mosques, hospitals and commercial establishments.
Agriculture is the major activity in the area, employing about 40% of the population. This is
described in the following section.

4.2.5 Industry
PIA districts: The number of medium and heavy industrial units appears to be higher in
Alappuzha while the employment in these sectors is significantly higher in Kottayam,
indicating the difference in size and nature of industry between the two districts.
There is little industrial development in the Kuttanad and the Upper basins.16 Most
industries are agro-based, consisting of various types of rubber processing in the east and
coconut processing plants in the west. Most large industries have some form of
wastewater treatment facility and improvement and expansion of such facilities is the best
method to reduce pollution from this source.
Alappuzha is traditionally a centre of the coir industry in Kerala, with 158 production plants
out of the State total of 550. These plants produce approximately 15,000 tonnes of
various coir products per annum. Ernakulam district is a commercial and industrial centre
of the State. Therefore, the International Port of Kochi and the Ernakulam district are the
dominating source and destination for the goods transported within the Alappuzha and
Kottayam districts.
Except the two rice mills and an oil mill (refer to Line diagram Exhibit 4.1) along the
Kottayam-Vaikom Canal (Chainage 15 Km form Kanji ram towards Cheepumkal) no other
industries are located in the immediate project influence area.
The main industries, which are potential users of the waterways, are
*     Industries related to agriculture
*     Coir Industry (mainly Alappuzha)
*     Rubber (Kottayam)
Paper (Kottayam)
*     Cement (Kottayam).
4.2.6 Tourism
PIA districts: The major tourist attractions in the project area of Kuttanad at present are
Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, Munro (Pathiramanal) Island, backwater cruising, agricultural
activities and the Kuttanad. About 2 Lakh (0.2 million) domestic tourists visit Alappuzha
and Kottayam annually.
The main agencies involved in tourist development in Kerala are the Department of
Tourism, Kerala Tourism Development Corporation Ltd (KTDC), District Tourism
Promotion Councils and Tourist Resorts Kerala Ltd (TRK). The main organization for the
development of the tourism infrastructure is the Department of Tourism, which has a three
pronged development program in Alappuzha-Kottayam districts;
*     Day cruise facilities to the southern waters from Alappuzha including boat
terminal and accommodation facilities
*     Alappuzha boat terminal and related infrastructure
*     Alappuzha - Kumarakom   -Thannirmukkom  triangle with boating and
accommodation facilities.
The total investment will amount to an estimated Rs 50 million. The development of the
tourist facilities in the Alappuzha - Kottayam route is planned to be carried out in the
second phase whereas no plans are apparent to develop the tourist industry in
is Kuttanad Water Balance Study. 1989

Changanaserry. The local social communication on the project routes constitutes a major
part of the passenger traffic. Tourism, however, appears to have positive prospects if the
infrastructure is developed to meet the requirements of both local and foreign tourists.
Backwaters and the connecting feeder canals constitute an attraction in themselves; that
is not susceptible to competition from the road sector.
Since both the Irrigation Department and the Tourism Department have development
plans in the same areas (Alappuzha and Kottayam), it is recommended that the
improvement of the waterway infrastructure be carried out in close collaboration with the
concerned agencies.

5     ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
Alternatives investigated included design alternatives and methods of construction. The
design alternative for which there are significant environmental concerns is the minimum
cross-section of the waterways, which determines the amount of dredging required.
Construction issues of particular environmental concern are the methods of disposal of
dredge spoils and the method of keeping the waterways clear of water hyacinths. Each is
discussed below.
5.1 ALTERNATIVE WATERWAY CROSS-SECTIONS
The minimum cross-section on the one hand defines the maximum size of vessel that may
use the waterways and therefore their economic value. On the other hand they define the
amount of dredging required both in terms of the length of the waterways to be dredged
and the volume of material to be disposed of. The larger the cross-sections of the
channels, the greater will be the amount of land to be taken for straightening, the distance
to be covered by dredging and the volume of material to be dredged. Thus the impact to
the environment will also be greater.
Three options were considered: 17.5 m width, 1.8 m depth; 17.5 width, 2.2 m depth; and
20 m width, 2.5 m depth. Exhibit 5.1 shows the volumes of material to be dredged for each
design alternative. The volumes of dredge materials could obviously be minimised by
reducing the navigable depth further. Minimising depths, however, restricts the size of
vessel that can use the waterway and therefore their economic viability.
The relative merits of the options are discussed in Exhibit 5.2.

Based on the current demand of the waterways, Option II is preferred, in terms of the
following benefits:
* Highest benefit/cost ratio; and
* Least environmental and social negative impacts.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                   ESAMP
The Option I would not provide the required level of service. Moreover, the success of the
Pilot Project requires it to demonstrate sufficient benefit to be able to attract reasonable
investments from the private sector in terms of vessels, terminals, etc. Option I does not
offer a sufficiently low cost method of transport to justify such investment. Option Ill, in
addition to causing maximum negative environmental and social impacts, would increase
construction costs more than would be justified by additional transportation benefits.
5.2 TAKING OF LAND
Option II, the 17.5 m width/2.2 m depth option would require the taking of about 500 sq. m
of land and the removal of about 23 residences for canal straightening. To avoid this the
option of the narrowing some sections of the canals was considered. It was determined
that a total of 0.6 km only would have to be narrowed to avoid any land taking. These short
sections of narrow canals would have little effect on the operation of vessels on the canal
and this was the option selected.
Thus the design option selected will allow the development of a viable canal system
without any involuntary relocation of the local population.
5.3 DREDGING ALTERNATIVES
Alternative methods of dredging and disposal of dredged materials could impact the
environment in different ways. In the previous section the method of balancing the goal of
minimising the amount of dredging against the economic viability of the waterway system
was discussed. The option selected will generate 156,000 cu. m of material to be disposed
of. Ideally, the least cost method of dredging and disposal would meet environmental
requirements. There is a demand for dredge materials for the foundations of dwellings, the
repair of bunds and to be placed in fields as topsoil. The limiting concern is the level of
pesticides found in the sediments. Given that the sediments contain significant levels of
Betahexachlorocyclane (BHC) they must be initially placed in secure landfills until such
time as the BHC breaks down. After sampling and analysis indicates that the sediments
are safe for general use the landfills can be mined and materials can be used for beneficial
purposes as described above. This is expected to take 3 to 5 years. The details of the
dredging and disposal requirements are described in Section 9.
5.4 WATER HYACINTHS
Water hyacinths cover many of the waterways and must be removed in order to permit
navigation. Alternative methods of removing hyacinths are discussed in Appendix L.
Alternative approaches to their removal and disposal were considered. Essentially, they
could be removed by either mechanical or manual means. Neither method presents
serious environmental concerns. Manual removal has been selected as the most effective
means of removal. However, as described in the previous section, the hyacinths have
accumulated significant levels of heavy metals. They could be disposed of by placing in a
secure landfill, or used for compost and mulch on vegetation, particularly, around coconut
trees. In view of the levels of heavy metals, they should not be used as animal feed.
However, their use for compost and mulch does not present and significant risk. Land
filling would require the acquisition of scarce land. The beneficial use for composting or
mulch is therefore the preferred method of disposal. It may be mixed with the dredge
material after composting, and thus enriching it for future use when the pesticides have
broken down.

5.5 SELECTED ALTERNATIVES
In summary the alternative selected that best matches environmental and social concerns
is that with channels 17.5 m wide and 2.2 m deep without any widening or taking of land.
Dredge materials will be placed in confined disposal facilities until such time that sampling
and testing indicates that it safe for beneficial use. The water hyacinths will be collected,
composted and then disposed of as mulch or mixed with the dredge materials.

6     CONSULTATION AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
6.1 COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
The project preparation involved consultations with stakeholders, beneficiaries and
affected groups in the forms of.stakeholder and scoping workshops and Panchayat level
consultations carried out during the social assessment. The general procedure followed
for public participation was to have state level meetings involving experts, NGOs and State
and Central Government officers. There were project specific consultations in general,
especially in areas where the impact was perceived as significant. In addition, there were
individual consultations with various officers at different levels.
6.2 IDENTIFICATION OF STAKEHOLDERS
Apart from the concerned government agencies, the primary stakeholders of the IWT Pilot
Project included the people residing and pursuing livelihoods along the selected
waterways. Chapter 4 on the baseline information of the project area discusses the
project area population.
6.3 METHODS OF CONSULTATION
Based on preliminary social assessments, scoping, and initial field appraisals, a
participatory strategy was devised to mainstream beneficiary and affected population
participation in project preparation. The purpose of the consultations and the people's
participation was to:
Expand awareness of the project among the public and local government leaders in areas
impacted by proposed waterway improvements;
Expand awareness of the project among the public and local government
leaders in areas impacted by proposed waterway improvements;
Identify social and environmental sensitivities and other concerns in
affected districts that should be considered in project design and planning;
Review  potential impacts of the project identified in social and
environmental assessments to date; measures taken to avoid, reduce, or
mitigate adverse impacts and minimise displacement; and potential
provisions of the project's environmental and social assessment and
management plan;
Explain  principles and  procedures proposed  for land  acquisition,
resettlement and relocation, should these be necessary; and the
compensation and assistance that will be provided to project-affected
persons, households and groups who may lose land or assets or suffer
other losses;
Increase co-operation among local governments and district officials in
project planning and implementation;
Introduce house-to-house surveys, asset verification, videography, local-
level consultations and focus group discussions, and other activities that
may be necessary along the selected canals; and
*     Assure that local-level inputs are considered in project preparation.

6.4 REGIONAL SCOPING WORKSHOPS
Three scoping workshops were conducted during January-February, 2000 in the three key
locations of Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode for a comprehensive external
scoping exercise in conjunction with the stakeholders. The details of environmental and
social scoping workshops are given in Exhibit 6.1 and Plate 6.1 and 6.2. These
stakeholder workshops were a joint exercise of the waterways and the highways
components of the KSTP and adequately represented in the RAP for the highways and
other environmental reports. Minutes of the meetings are to be found in Appendix 0.

Although there were three workshops, it was only at Kochi, the location nearest to the
project that all concerned parties were formally invited for the waterways project. At this
workshop many issues of the waterways were debated at length. The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), the Irrigation Department and the Project Coordinating
Consultants (PCC) decided to cover the entire waterways issues at this scoping workshop.
The other two workshops also discussed the waterways issue albeit at a low profile.
PLATE 6.1: REGIONAL SCOPING SESSION AT KOCHI
The Project authorities invited NGOs,
government agencies, road users and
other stakeholders to identify social
and   environmental  concerns  and
issues that should be addressed in
project  preparation  and  provided
information  regarding  the  project,
enabling informed participation.

The information provided to the participants during the workshop included project
summary for highways and waterways project. The project has disclosed the initial findings
on impacts and environmental issues during presentation. There were photographic
displays as well as displays from press clippings.
The issues discussed on waterways at the Kochi workshop included a comparison of the
relative maintenance costs of the railways, highways and the waterways and it was
concluded that the transportation of passengers and cargo by the waterways was both
cost effective and environmentally non-polluting. However, currently only 75% of the
capacity of the boats and the barges are being used. The minutes of meeting of all three
scoping workshops are presented in Appendix K.
6.5 LOCAL LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
The three scoping workshops held across the State were complemented by extensive,
smaller-scale local consultations with beneficiaries, potential project-affected persons,
stakeholders and other interested parties within the impact corridors and influence areas
of the selected canals. They were also intended to substantially enrich project planning
and design, improve public awareness of development objectives of the Government of
Kerala and promote project acceptability and transparency.
Panchayat-level consultations, which provided valuable input to project preparation and
design, were held in six locales covering the three project canals. Dates, locations, and
attendance of these events are summarised in Exhibit 6.2. Project information suitable for
use in the project area was developed and distributed in the local language and distributed
to residents and Panchayat officers in advance of consultations. In addition to on-the-spot
discussion, as many as 120 attendees sent their written comments on the issues
discussed. Officials met are shown in Appendix 6.3.

6.5.1 Contents of the Local Consultations
At the generic level, stakeholders voiced concern with regard to:
*     Potential maintenance inadequacies;
*     Insufficient participation;
*     Lack of transparency;
*     Insensitivity to social and environmental dimensions;
*     Non-adherence to environmental requirements and regulations;
*     Lack of co-ordination among government agencies; and
*     Potential resettlement and rehabilitation failures.

6.5.2 Details of the Specific Consultations
6.5.2.1 Consultation at Veliyanad Panchayath
The people of the Panchayath are in general below the poverty level, the majority being
agricultural labourers. According to the people of this Panchayath, dredging is to be done
only after the rainy season, which is during the months of February and March or during
September and October. This is because if dredging is done in the rainy season then the
silt is deposited in the canal again. Also people need their damaged bunds to be
strengthened. They want the banks to be protected using concrete walls. People are in
need of the improvement of the existing bridges and also the construction of nearly 20-foot
bridges, which would better connect the two Panchayats. Like Thiruvarppu Panchayath,
people of this Panchayath also encourage tourism although, according to them, the
tourists take photographs of the women bathing by the banks of the canal. So they are in
need of a bathhouse, which means just an opaque separation from the outsiders (tourists).
During the season they harvest the maximum quantity of grain. However, there is no
granary to store the large amounts and the people are in need of a godown. People want
the existing jetties to be improved and extra steps constructed for the convenience of the
people entering the boats. Exhibit 6.3 shows the tabulated comments and suggestions
made during the consultation.

6.5.2.2 Consultation at Aimanam Panchayat
Sixty percent of the people were below the poverty level. The majority of the people are
agricultural labourers and the remaining are fishing families. The agricultural labourers
have an opinion that in Thannirmukkom, there should be permanent shutters for barrages
to stop the saline water entering the canal. If it is opened then it will cause the farmers to
suffer, because agriculture is their main source of income. Although 60% of the people
are below the poverty level, every house has food for their livelihood. People say that the
control of the shutters is under the authority of Alappuzha; if the control comes under
Kottayam then there would be no problems. People are in need of many footbridges and
some single lane bridges. They also want improvement to existing bridges. Also there is a
bridge in Kaithapadam (Thrikanankari), which joins the two Panchayats, Aimanam and
Arpookara. People want a vehicular bridge in place of the existing pedestrian bridge. This
is the major problem for this Panchayat. Water hyacinth removal remains a most important
problem. People want complete destruction of its growth using machines. For this they
need machines. Mechanization makes the hyacinths crush into small pieces, which can
be used as compost. Exhibit 6.4 shows the tabulated comments and suggestions made
during the Consultation.

6.5.2.3 Consultation at Arpookara Panchayat
In this Panchayat 95%of the people are below the poverty level. People are in need of
many footbridges and single lane vehicular traffic bridges. They also want improvement of
the existing bridges. Also there lies a bridge in Kaithapadam (Thrikanankari), which joins
the two Panchayats, Aimanam and Arpookara. So people are in need of a single lane
vehicular bridge in place of the existing one. This is the main problem of this Panchayat.
The majority of the people need the improvement of the existing bridge at Pathinettil. The
other problem faced by the people is that of drinking water. Due to the growth of water
hyacinths the water becomes polluted completely. Also mosquitoes breed in large
numbers. The water has a foul smell and when the people use this dirty water many
contagious diseases like cholera, typhoid, jaundice, skin diseases, weils disease, diseases
affecting stomach etc. could affect them. People need the water to be purified or otherwise
they need pure water supply system because they bring water from a distant place called
Karipputhatta. People wish to encourage tourism because they are of the opinion that only
by tourism can development occur in Arpookara Panchayat. According to the people, if the
canal and waterways were improved and if boat services were increased, they preferred to
travel on waterways rather than roadways. Almost 75% of the people are farmers, 15%
are fisherman and the remaining 10 % farm ducks. Exhibit 6.5 shows the tabulated
comments and suggestions made during the Consultation.

6.5.2.4 Consultation at Kainakary Panchayat
The people of the Panchayat are below the poverty level. The majority of the people are
agricultural labourers. The main problem faced by the people is the inadequate
accessibility of drinking water. According to the people, tourists are polluting the water by
depositing human excreta. People use this contaminated water and many contagious
diseases like jaundice, cholera, typhoid, skin diseases etc affect them. In order to avoid
this, permanent toilet facilities are to be constructed on the banks of the canal Also peopie
want the water to be purified. People living near the canals are in need of latrines. In some
areas people lack health centres, schools, electricity, etc. People are in need of four big
bridges; from Cherukayal-C Block-Marthanda-R Block-Chithira. The Kuppapuram bridge
needs to be improved. Exhibit 6.6 shows the tabulated comments and suggestions made
during the Consultation.

6.5.2.5 Consultation at Kavalam Panchayat
The most important problem of this Panchayat is inadequate accessibility of drinking
water. The majority of the people drink water from the canal itself. The canal water is full
of water hyacinth. Because of its growth the water becomes stagnant and a foul smell
emanates. As a result of this, the people contact many contagious diseases like cholera,
typhoid, weils disease jaundice, etc. So the growth of water hyacinth has become a
headache to the people. According to them water hyacinth can be removed only by
mechanization. Manual removal is very difficult. If this weed is removed first by machine
then it won't be that hard for the people to remove in future. Agriculture is the main
occupation of the people. Seventy percent of the people are agricultural labourers and the
remainder are fishermen. But they are in need of bathhouses. People encourage tourism
because of economic and social developments. People are in need of a separate land for
buying and selling of fish. The fishermen are in need of Yamaha motorboats and nets.

6.5.2.6 Consultation at Thiruvarppu Panchayath
The majority of people of this Panchayath are below the poverty level. Seventy percent of
the people are agricultural labourers. People encourage tourism because it brings social
and economic benefit to the people. The biggest problem faced by the people is the
growth of water hyacinths along the canals. As a result of the growth of water hyacinth,
mosquitoes breed in large numbers, the water gets polluted and has a foul smell. Many
contagious diseases occur in this area due to the use of the contaminated water. Diseases
like cholera, typhoid, skin diseases etc. occur here, so the people want the complete
destruction of this plant or otherwise they want the removal of plants twice a year. A canal,
which lies in the M.M Block, is the easiest way to Kumarakom. If that canal is improved,
then it is easier for the tourists to go to Kumarakom. Exhibit 6.8 shows the tabulated
comments and suggestions made during the Consultation.

6.7 JUSTIFICATION OF ISSUES THAT CAN OR CANNOT BE ADDRESSED BY THE
PROJECT
Some of the most important concerns and considerations of the people consulted are also
the ones that the project considered as most important for the development of the project
area. These are listed below along with their appropriate disposition in the project.
*     Bund protection - most important part of the engineering aspect of the
project;
*     Provision of piped drinking water supply - Not part of project
*     Sanitation arrangements - Addressed, see Section B
*     Water hyacinth removal - important part of the engineering component,
with the objective of navigability;
*     Improvement in the tourism potential of the region -an objective of the
project;
*     The reconstruction, improvement etc. to the bridges and foot bridges
existing across; the Canal - Important part of the engineering component,
with the objective of navigability;
Waiting sheds to the jetties - addressed;
*     Bath houses for the privacy of women- included as a social impact.
Other issues which were raised by the project area population but were not addressed by
the project, mainly related to those not under the scope of the project, such as the
suggestion for the construction of a new bridge. These issues have been appropriately
marked under the local level consultations Exhibits in Sections 6.5.2.1 to 6.5.2.6.
6.8 OTHER CONSULTATIONS
In addition to scoping meeting and meetings held with local people at village level,
extensive consultations were held with public officials, representatives of NGOs and other
interested persons. A list of those people consulted for both the waterways and the road
component of the project is included in Appendix P.

7     ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT, ISSUES, AND
MITIGATION
Waterways are a generally environmentally friendly mode of transport. Apart from the very
small negative impact upon the environment and people, they have a number of positive
impacts. The single most positive would be the contribution to the 'Save fuel campaign of
the Nation' Water transport is an energy efficient method of transporting cargo
The proposed pilot waterways will not have any negative social impacts, as the project
does not require any land acquisition. On the other hand, the project in general has
positive social impacts in terms of providing a means of communication and access to
markets and their fields for local people, the protection of agricultural land by the repair of
bunds and the protection of property from flooding. This will enhance agricultural
production and provide employment opportunities for local people thus promoting overall
poverty alleviation in the affected areas. The positive impacts of the projects are listed in
Box 7.1.
BOX 7.1 IMPORTANT POSITIVE IMPACTS
*    Better control of floodwaters and irrigation, greatly increasing potential for improved
agricultural production.
.    Capacity to transport goods and people at a comparatively lower cost.
.    Minimum demand on energy sources.
*    A necessary mode of transport in areas without roads, and not served by
other modes of transport.
.    Employment opportunities for a larger section of the Population (in addition to
many
other direct and indirect benefits).
*    Reduced atmospheric pollution.
.    More effective maintenance of environmental and ecological balances.
.    Reduction in congestion and accident risk on the roads and other indirect benefits.
.    Development of tourism.
The results of the analysis of direct and indirect benefits of the project are described later
in this section. The single most serious concern in this project is the dredging and
associated disposal of sediments. The second most important concern is the collection
and disposal of water hyacinth from the waterways during construction and operation
phases of the project.
7.1 IMPACTS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The issues involved in these engineering actions to rehabilitate the canals are:
Dredging and associated disposal of dredged materials
The repair of the sides and bunds of waterways
Poor sanitation for large number of people in the PIA
Water hyacinth as a major threat for navigation
Impact on existing ferry services operating in the area
Clearing or pruning of any private trees of economic importance, projecting
into waterways channel
The risk oil spillage due to increased traffic
Construction or improvement of approach roads for the reconstructing
bridges
The following sub-sections describe the physical environmental impact issues in the same
order as in the baseline chapter for ease of cross-reference.
7.1.1 Topography, Soil, and Geology
Impacts: There are no anticipated impacts due to the construction and operation of the
proposed waterways on topography and geology of the project area. Dredging is
considered separately in the water resources section. Unlike road projects, substantial
quantities of rocks and sand will not be required for the construction of jetties and other
structures needed for the waterways improvement. There would not be any measurable
depletion of material resources due to the quarrying of rocks required for construction
activities. All jetties and associated structures considered in the project are designed as
projections into the waterways without any land acquisition. At Changanaserry and
Kottayam, boat terminals will be upgraded without additional land acquisition. The land
available at Kottayam terminal belongs to the Government whereas the terminal at
Changanaserry will be constructed on a platform above the water level, very close to the
existing terminal. There will be slight disturbance to soil in these areas. This is not
expected to contribute to any significant soil erosion in the area, as the area involved will
be very small, of the order of 200 sq.m only.]
Borrow material management: Although the material requirement from borrow areas
would not be substantial, there would be a limited requirement for the improvement of
jetties and terminals at Changanaserry and Kottayam, approach roads for bridges and
even during the bund reconstruction. Where they are low and impede navigation, bridges
will be raised and this will necessitate a corresponding raising of the existing approach
roads. The works on the approach roads are minor. This may not necessitate the
opening of new borrow areas. In case the Contractor depends on existing borrow areas, it
is necessary to conform to all environmental requirements as provided in the
Environmental Management Plan of the KSTP. If new borrow areas are opened, these pits
may cause drainage and visual problems as well as presenting a potential for increased
vector activity (mosquitoes) or water contamination.
Erosion: The surveys indicated that about 18,465 m of side bunds (left and right side
inclusive) are prone to erosion, as shown in Exhibit 4.2. The typical cases of these are
illustrated by reference to plates in Appendix H, Plate 2 and Plate 9. The cost of
reconstruction of the bunds is included in the engineering cost estimates. These bunds
would need to be reconstructed immediately before the operation of waterways along the
three IWT Pilot Project routes.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                    ESAMP
The dikes in the polder lands are traditionally constructed with a pitched stone protection
wall. Presently, through a severe lack of maintenance, most of these walls are in a state of
decay and temporary bamboo structures have been erected in various places to reinforce
dikes and protect the land from flooding during the monsoon season. These walls will be
reconstructed where they front the pilot waterways.
Mitigation: Quarrying of construction material shall be from licensed quarries only. The
Contractor will have to prepare and execute a Quarry and Borrow Area Management Plan
as per the guidelines in Chapter 9 of this report. The cost for the preparation and
execution will be included in the BOQ. The 18,465 m of side bunds will be reconstructed
during the construction phase. In fact, this will constitute the single largest share of the
total investment for the implementation of project. The Contractor should adopt
environmental precautions while selecting borrow areas according to the IRC
specifications. Borrow and quarry material shall be transported in trucks covered with
tarpaulin sheets to avoid any inconvenience to the public.
The engineering report prepared for the project in January 2001 describes measures to
rehabilitate the traditional bank protection structures, and to provide additional revetments
at places where it no longer exists or was never constructed. The costs for these bank
protection measures are an integral part of the project. Wherever water can get into direct
contact with the silty clay material, with which the dikes are constructed, washout will
occur initiating failure of the revetment. The locally available coir filter cloth has been
recommended and included in the place of expensive geo-textiles between the bank
protection, and the soil behind it to prevent such washouts, and guarantee stability.
Water Resources
Impact: The project waterways are used extensively for bathing, swimming, washing of
clothes, cleaning of household items and utensils. The anticipated traffic volumes,
especially foreign tourists, are not very high in the immediate future after commissioning of
the project. The project is expected to have a minimal impact on water resources.
Mitigation: Bathing enclosures will be provided to ensure privacy from passing boats for
people using the waterways for bathing.
7.1.1.1 Impact on Water Quality
Impact: The water is highly contaminated with faecal coliform. The prevailing sanitation
practices along the waterways are described in the baseline water quality section and also
tabulated in the Exhibit 4.11 with approximate costing for mitigation measures for the
prevailing sanitation practices. The proposed waterway improvements will not induce any
significant impacts other than the disposal of human faeces and other solid wastes,
polythene bags etc from the vessels operating along the waterways. The garbage in
normal service boats will be of the order of 10 kg by weight per service with 10 services
per day per canal makes 30 service boats producing (30 x1O) 300 kg quantity of garbage
by weight.
There would be a complementary effect. The Pilot waterways will benefit the traffic along
the National Waterway and vice versa. The National Waterways Project is planning to
develop three effluent treatment plants by 2014 AD at Kochi, Alappuzha and Kollam. All
facilities at the national waterways and the facilities at IWT Pilot waterways will be mutually
beneficial. The proposed Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at Alappuzha will reduce pollution
during operational stage.

During the operational phase there could be some oil and grease spillage. This will be
minor and can be neglected (oil and grease was tested for the IWT Pilot Project). Other
than this, there will not be any significant project induced environmental impacts.
Mitigation: Except for contamination by faecal coliform, water quality observed was
relatively good. A comprehensive integrated system approach for the entire Kuttanad area
is required for an effective mitigation action to address the faecal coliform problem that
presents a major health concern for the local population that is in frequent contact with the
water and at times drinks it. The proposed integrated approach will be able to monitor all
the activities within the Kuttanad basin so as to enable a qualitative improvement in the
water, health and sanitation in the region. This is not within the scope of this project, which
will have a small impact on contamination by faecal coliform.
Specifically for this project, vessels will be required to have enclosed toilets and low cost
sanitation facilities will be provided to some local people. This, on its own, will have little
effect on the overall faecal coliform counts but it responds to the concerns of the local
people
The disposal of garbage will be shared by over 100 jetties and terminal facilities requiring
small disposal arrangements at each jetty. This is considered in the project design. Any
commercial establishment allowed the use of jetties and terminals should have their own
facilities for disposal of wastes. The five terminal facilities, including those of NW-Ill at
Alappuzha, Vaikom and Thannirmukkom, will accept all sanitary wastes.
7.1.2 Vembanad Lake, Link Canals and Cross Canals
7.1.2.1 Sedimentation and General Depth Characteristics
Impact: There will be dredging of approximately 156,000 cu.m. of sediment from the
waterways to make them navigable. The environmental aspects of dredging are discussed
in the Appendices J, R and S. In addition to this, there will be an expected annual dredging
requirement of 5% of this initial volume (7500 cu.m).
7.1.3 Analysis of Dredge Disposal Plan
The dredge disposal plan is based on the results obtained from the Central Water Analysis
Laboratory of CWRDM.'1 The sampling and test report of CWRDM   is attached as
Appendix I and discussed in Appendix J. These indicate that there is a high enough level
of contamination with long-life pesticides to present a significant concern. As a result it
has been determined that dredge spoils must be stored in secure landfills until sampling
and analysis has indicated that the pesticides present have sufficiently decayed for the
material to be safe for beneficial use such as house foundations and the repair of bunds.
Neither dredging nor the dewatering of dredge spoils will result in the release of significant
amounts of the pesticides to the water column as these chemicals are tightly bound to
sediment particles and thus dredging will not result in the contamination of the waterways
with pesticides. It may lead to the release of ammonia, which is toxic to fish and could
lead to some local fish kills. The effect would be localised and quickly dissipated. There
will be no long-term effects on the environment.

7.1.3.1 Dredge Disposal Special Mitigation Measures
The contractor will be required to locate suitable sites for land disposal, negotiate with the
landowner and obtain the approval of the Construction Supervisory Consultant/Kerala
Public Works Department. The contractor will be required to construct a confined disposal
facility (CDF) on each site as described in Appendix J and Section 9. Dredged materials
will be transported to the CDF and deposited there. They will be allowed to dewater and
settle. They will be sampled and tested annually as described in Section 9. When the
pesticides present have decayed sufficiently to present no risk the CDFs may be cleared
and the materials used for beneficial purposes. Other mitigation measures are outlined in
Exhibit 7.2.

7.1.4 Terrestrial Ecology
Impact On Mangrove Ecosystem: There would not be any negative impact on the
mangrove ecosystems, both of which are five to six km from the nearest section of the
pilot waterways at Cheepumkal. The positive impact involves the attraction of more
tourists for the eco-tourism projects like Pathiramanal and Kumarakom. There would not
be any negative impact on the bird sanctuary except for disturbance caused by additional
tourists due to increased traffic generated by the waterways.
Water Hyacinth: The presence of water hyacinth along the waterways will be a major
problem for smooth operation of waterways. From the navigational point of view, the
objective is to clear the waterways, eliminate fouling of propellers by water hyacinth, and
ensure unobstructed passage of boats. Ecologically, water hyacinth provides a benefit by
providing shade for fish. On the other hand they provide breeding areas for mosquitoes.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                    ESAMP
Regular removal of water hyacinth is required by any suitable method. Chemical methods
shall not be adopted, as it will further deteriorate the water quality in the area. An African
experimental method for biological control of water hyacinth could be tried in this location.
The operation18 was first successfully carried out in Papua New Guinea.
A manual method is included in the project costs, as described in the water hyacinth
management plan in Appendix L.
Alternatively another international organisation 'Clean-flow International' may be called for
remedial measures. This could be more expensive but could be a practical approach to
address the issues in the region. A proposal received recently from them has been
evaluated and found worthy of trial on an experimental basis in the project. The practical
aspects of the applicability of the clean flow principles in the Kuttanad canals are to be
confirmed. This is mainly due to the non-stagnant nature of the canal water. The flowing
water in the canals and the discharge of the canal water to the Vembanad Lake may
create problem for the implementation of the work.
The EMU of the PIU/lrrigation Department obtained Government approval for a trial of the
clean flow or any other bio remedial technique on an experimental basis in order to
determine a sustainable long term solution along the KV canal at the first meeting of the
task force set-up by the Government for the pilot project. The necessary budget provisions
have been included. Extensive enquiries by the Consultants conclude that there are no
safe biological control alternatives in use in India at this time and manual removal is
recommended. A separate water hyacinth management plan has been prepared and
provided as Appendix L.
A manual method is included in the project costs, as described in the water hyacinth
management plan in Appendix L.
7.1.5 Aquatic Ecology
Impact on aquatic ecology: The increased traffic will not result in any adverse impact on
the aquatic environment except the human defecation from the boats and also small-scale
oil spills.
*     As there would not be any major fishing operation possible in the pilot
waterways there will be a slight positive impact to the aquatic environment.
*     There will be large-scale removal of water hyacinth from the aquatic
environment.
Potential oil spills will be in traces when compared with the size of the Vembinad Lake.
The impact due to the pollution of water may occur due to the following reasons:
*     Oil pollution due to discharge of bilge wastes from the floating crafts or
spillage.
*     Spillage of chemical and other cargo, which can have a detrimental effect.
Mitigation:
Suitable measures in the boat design for effective disposal of various
human wastes to safe terminal disposal system provided at terminals
(Changanaserry and Kottayam). The cost for this has been estimated and
included as environmental costs. The Kottayam and Vaikom terminals are
part of the National waterways.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                    ESAMP
The large-scale removal of water hyacinth will reduce the mosquito menace
prevalent in the area. The removal of water hyacinth is a public issue in the
Kuttanad region and this could be one of the most popular elements of the
project.
Strict regulations regarding disposal of oil wastes should be imposed and
implemented. Oil booms and skimmers are to be provided to remove the
floating oil slicks and assist in recovery operations. Waste oil from bilges
etc. should be collected at terminals and they should be treated and
disposed after recovering useful oil. Special treatment plants will have to be
set up at terminals.
Transportation of Hazardous goods, including POL (petroleum, oil and liquid
petroleum gases) The feeder canals are not expected to transport any kind of hazardous
goods during operational stage. The NW-III and a feeder canal near the FACT and Cochin
refineries are used for the transport of crude oil. This are not located in the project area.
However, containment of any possible spillage of POL products, chemicals and fertilisers
will have to be addressed by a Contingency Spill Cleanup Plan. The envisaged
programme is as follows.
Primarily all efforts should be made to avoid any spillage, as it will mean
heavy loses. But accidental spillage cannot always be avoided.
*     Accidental spillages need to be considered in the cleanup plan.
Spillage at terminals is most likely during the loading and unloading
tankers.
Regular monitoring and removal of any spilled material by dredgers, which
should be transported to any user plants for reuse/disposal in a safe
manner. In case of large scale spillages, chemical neutralising agents
should be used to neutralise and treat them.
*     Spill of POL can be avoided by regular training of crews in handling them.
In case of accidents booms and skimmers should be deployed to prevent
spreading and help recovery.
The coordination of IWAI NW-3 and the proposed waterways wing of the Irrigation
Department is required for an effective coordinated and technically sound contingency
plan. The task force constituted by the ID recently for addressing various issues related to
the IWT Pilot project has committed to look into this issue.
Co-ordination between the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and the Waterways
Division of the Irrigation Department will be required for the preparation of an adequate
contingency plan for spill cleanup. The institutional arrangements for the cleanup
programme need to be determined immediately after commissioning of the Pilot
Waterways. The zoning of the different areas for transportation of hazardous cargo
including POL need to be well defined and the rules shall be strictly adhered to during the
operational stage of the project.
Impact: Passing motorized craft will cause some noise. Outboard motors tend to make
more noise. However, at the restricted speeds at which boats will be required to operate
in the waterways (to avoid damage to the canal walls), the noise they generate would not
be great and may be regarded by some riparian residents as not unpleasant.

7.2 IMPACTS ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
7.2.1 Positive Impacts
The proposed Inland Water Transport Pilot Project will invest in using waterways for
passenger and cargo transport. This improvement programme will produce both tangible
and intangible benefits. The major direct and indirect benefits expected to be obtained
from the project include:
Lower transport and maintenance costs as a result of traffic diverting from
roads to project canals.
*     Improved access to markets for people without access to the road network.
*     Protection of banks against failures from vessel waves and of agriculture by
reducing risk of bank failures and regular catastrophic flooding.
*     Additional transport alternative and local development along the waterway
in the case of the Kottayam-Vaikom route.
*     Improvement in navigation conditions and waterway safety, and a reduction
in health problems associated with mosquitoes as a consequence of the
removal of water hyacinth.
The project will raise and rehabilitate 19 bridges and crossings, construct 28 new jetties,
rehabilitate 76 jetties, provide 32 new landings, improve 152 km of bank protection, and
restore operating depth over more than 30 km of canal length by excavating more than
155,000 cubic metresl9 of accumulated silt and other materials. These rehabilitation
measures are expected to encourage the tourism development in the State.
The anticipated employment of local population in the construction of the project and in the
removal of water hyacinth will provide direct monetary benefits to the poor. Studies
suggest that inland waterways have the highest employment co-efficient per unit of
investment compared to other transport modes, and economic analysis suggests that for
every investment of Rs. 6 million, IWT provides employment to more than 33 persons in
operation and 13 persons in channel development activities. This is a significantly greater
number than in road construction. At this rate, the total project investment of Rs. 246.2
million in the project feeder canals is expected to generate employment benefits to nearly
1,887 persons in the construction (terminals, jetties, bridges) and maintenance (bank
protection, water hyacinth removal, dredging) activities.
Due to the seasonal nature of the principal agricultural activities it has not been possible to
obtain accurate data regarding the precise number of direct beneficiaries. The penetration
of the developing road system has reduced the number of canal side residents dependent
upon the canal system for social and work related movement. The social assessment
exercise suggests, though, that there are still a great many families and workers totally
dependent upon the canals for social travel as well as their livelihoods. These people are
principally agricultural and other workers from among the approximately 11,500 persons
mentioned in Section 4.3.2. These people will be the direct beneficiaries of the project in
terms of enhanced transport facilities that are expected to create more avenues to sell
their labour and/or wares.
The social assessment suggests that as the unemployment rate is high, there is surplus
labour in the project canal area. However, this surplus labour may not be appropriate for
the skilled labour involved. While the available local labour should be mobilised by the

respective panchayats for contracts, labour from outside the area may have to be brought
in.
The IWT Pilot Project does not adversely affect any person or property, as no land taking
is involved. Therefore, although the full economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the
waterways has proved difficult to determine with the same accuracy as in the highways
sector, the project has an obvious positive impact on the:
Social, communication and transport costs;
Protection of agricultural land and other properties from flooding;
Enhancing agricultural production;
Providing employment opportunities; and
*     Overall poverty alleviation in the affected areas.
7.2.2 Negative Impacts
The Pilot Phase of the project does not anticipate any negative impacts on the people
living along the project canal banks. In case any significant negative impact emerges
during the implementation of the project, this report will be updated to provide any
appropriate mitigating measures.
7.2.3 Social Impact Mitigating Measures
Exhibit 7.3 summarises the social issues, as obtained from the social analysis and the
consultations and their impact mitigating measures.

Project Affected Person (PAP) due to the improvements of the project canals. On the other
hand, it is expected that there would be a general improvement of all livelihoods.
Impact to bathing ghats This is locally known as Kuli kadavu. However as the bank
protection measures are an integral part of the project many bathing ghats will be affected.
All the men, woman and children take baths at these locations openly as very little traffic
exists at this stage. The proposed waterways improvements could be very inconvenient for
them especially for women in using these ghats. The bathing ghats are well built in some
cases, whereas these are crude in other cases, depending upon the wealth of the people.
Impact Mitigation. The project-affected ghats will be rebuilt. This will be necessary as
they are very much part of the local life. Replacement costs will be a social cost and a part
of the original contract costs. There is an estimated need of 1000 bathing enclosures for
the privacy of women. The proposed structures create sufficient privacy for women bathing
in the canal waters. The project proposes to construct 300 such bathing enclosures on an
experimental basis, 100 on each pilot project canal at a total cost of Rs 4.5 Million. As a
pilot project the ID department will monitor and confirm the social acceptability of such
structures before deciding on large-scale construction of such structures. It is proposed
that users above the poverty line will bear the complete cost and the project will only
facilitate the provision. The provision of suitable structures should mitigate any invasion of
privacy. The cost of this structure is included in the IWT environmental and social cost.
7.2.5 Land Use
Impact: There will not be any land acquisition/ or resettlement associated with this project.
7.2.6 Industry
Impact: All industrial units in the Kuttanad could positively benefit due to the opening of
these waterways as they provide an alternative low cost means of transport. There would
not be any significant negative impact to the industrial establishments due to construction
and operation of the project. All industries like rubber processing, cement industries, shell
meat processing and coir industries will benefit positively from the waterways
improvements. The transportation of raw material and the final products of these industries
can be transported at low cost.
7.2.7 Tourism
Impact: There will be a positive boost to the tourism sector by the improved operation of
the pilot waterways. This will also set an example for the sustainable revival and
development of the Inland Waterways Sector in Kerala. The combined impact of the
different environmental components and the tourism project of the region will improve the
local environmental awareness as this project involves many components, which are new
to the society. The environmental budgetary provision in a development project will
definitely give a boost to the local interests to stop polluting the precious water resources
of the region.
There are a number of environmental enhancement measures built into the project. This
aspect is separately discussed in Chapter 8, Benefits Enhancements.
The development of the AK, AC and KV canals as proposed in the pilot project, will
connect to the National Waterway (NW ll). This will help the tourism industry mainly due
to the direct link to Kochi. In fact, linkage of Kottayam, Alappuzha and Changanaserry will
positively help the tourists to enjoy the backwater tourism and the Kuttanadan rural set-up.

Tourism Linkages The Alappuzha town Is connected by National Highway - 47.
Kottayam and Changanaserry are located in the State Highway -1 (SH-1). All these three
towns are also connected by Rail.
7.3 INLAND WATER TRANSPORT IN THE PROJECT AREA
Impact: During the construction phase no negative impacts are anticipated. During the
operational phase an anticipated increase in the traffic and possible speed of the vessels
could affect the interests of the people living on both sides and also on their agricultural
lands.
The operation of high-speed boats would produce waves which will damage the banks and
hence their property and safety.
Mitigation: There will be an improved boundary in the form of geo-textiles etc., included in
the project design. This aspect is already accommodated in the design and the cost
included as engineering cost. Unlike other development projects the nature of this project
certainly necessitates the development of the side bunds of agricultural areas. Speed
restrictions in critical areas are a part of the design program. The Padashekarams20 are
especially vulnerable at the time of standing crops. This is mainly because of the vast
areas involved in each block. Any possible break in the boundary will destroy substantial
crops worth many lakhs of rupees. In the narrow sections there would be speed
restrictions with proper signing, etc. As the project concentrates on improving the
condition of the banks and this will have a major positive impact.
20 A padashekaram is reclaimed land from the kayal (lake), used for agriculture The area of a padashekaram
is found to be of several hectares

8     BENEFITS ENHANCEMENTS
8.1 SOCIAL BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT
The project proposes to assist the low-income group population of the project canal area
with a comprehensive low-cost sanitation programme that includes converting the existing
open latrines into a new type of latrines (discussed in Section 8.2.7). Each converted
latrine would cost approximately Rs. 20,000/-, and an initial provision of Rs. 6 million has
been made in the budget for the community benefit enhancement for 300 latrines (roughly
100 latrines for each pilot project canal). This provision is for people who live immediately
adjacent to the waterways. The deserving low-income group households will be selected
by an NGO recruited by the KSTP. The mitigation of other impacts, such as the privacy of
women, air quality, noise, and present traffic has been discussed in Section 7.
The project proposes to construct bath areas for the privacy of women at the canal
locations where people use the water for bathing and washing (kuli kadavu in locai terms).
Presently, the men, women and children take baths in the canals in the open as little traffic
exists. The improvement of the waterways, however, will increase traffic that may have
adverse social impacts, especially on the women. Typically, the proposed bath area is an
enclosed structure with fibreglass sheets on three sides to prevent the boat users from
gazing at the bathers and otherwise kuli kadavu users.  The structure will be
projecting/hanging from the canal bank to the water using a clamping arrangement on the
sides. The frame will be of iron rods and GI pipes. Each such structure is expected to
cost approximately Rs. 15,000/-. There is an estimated need for 1000 such structures.
The project proposes to construct 300 structures, 100 on each pilot project canal, at a total
cost of Rs. 4.5 million.
As explained in Section 6.2.4, it is proposed that users above the poverty line will have to
bear the complete cost of the structures beyond the 300 numbers to be constructed by the
Project. The process of identification of beneficiaries and sites will be done by the NGOs
recruited by the KSTP, in consultation with the local populations. The cost of the NGO
has been included in the environmental and social budget of the IWT Pilot Project (Section
11).
Local consultations highlighted the people's concern regarding the urgent need for safe
drinking water. It was indicated before that approximately 60% of the latrines in the canal
area are open, which directly or indirectly lead into the waterways. As a result, they are
highly contaminated.  As part of the community benefit enhancement, however, it
proposed to include the community relations programme to generate awareness among
the people on the following issues:
*     Sources of faecal coliform in water;
*     Solid wastes from houses and market areas;
Liquid waste sources;
Sanitary arrangements in the Kuttanad area;
*     Water quality in the canals;
*     The level of hygienic conditions required;
Water hyacinth menace; and
*     Solid waste from the households and agricultural fields floating on water.

9     ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ACTION MANAGEMENT
PLAN
This chapter addresses the environmental and social assessment management plan
(ESAMP) for the 93 km of waterways project included in the Phase-1 improvement
programme. This is    prepared  to  help the  Contractor and  the  Irrigation
Department/Highway Authority, Consultants, and their personnel to incorporate the
necessary environmental requirements during the construction and operational phases of
the project. This document will assist the Contractor to appreciate the environmental
impacts and the necessary mitigation measures required to minimise those impacts as
well as to enhance the positive factors. All environmental mitigation costs have been
included in the Bill of Quantities (BOQ).
This document assists the Contractor and associated officials to mitigate or minimise the
negative social and environmental impacts due to the construction and operation of the
waterways project and to enhance the positive advantages of this project.  The
management plan has been prepared to meet the GOI requirements as specified by the
Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) and the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST)
as well as meeting the requirements of the World Bank. Its purpose is to implement
potential impact mitigation and environmental enhancement measures due to the
proposed upgrading of the existing waterways linking Alappuzha to Changanaserry and
Alappuzha to Kottayam and the revival of the Kottayam-Vaikom section. The document
has identified the impacts, mitigation measures and appropriate costs for the proposed
mitigation measures. The environmental mitigation costs have been included in project Bill
of Quantities (BOQ), Bill No. 10 for the environmental mitigation and social management
costs. The costs are shown in this document in section 11. In addition to this, an
environmental monitoring and training budget has been included separately as EMU/PIU
costs, part of the project costs.
The project will be based upon, and incorporate strategies for implementing of contract
provisions and other environmental and social impact mitigation and enhancement
provisions such as those specified in this document. The procurement of monitoring
equipment, provision of technical assistance and training, including environmental training
and provision for the supervision of civil works is also part of the IWT Pilot Project.

The environmental mitigation and enhancement costs are included in the BOQ The entire
mitigation and enhancement plans are part of the ESAMP.
9.1.2 Synergies of the Various Implementing Agencies
Although the waterways in Kerala are under the State Irrigation Department, the PIU
constituted at the State PWD is the executing agency for the project. The Irrigation
Department recently constituted a Task Force as per G.O. (Rt) No. 27/2001/ CSIND,
Dated Thiruvanthapauram, 27.11.2001 (enclosed as part of Appendix C). The Task Force
has members from ID, PWD, Tourism Department, Kerala Sanitation Mission, District
Collector Alappuzha, District Panchayath President Alappuzha, State Water Transport
Department, Managing Director of Kerala Water Authority, Director of Ports, and Advisor
of Sector Reforms Project.
The first meeting of the Task Force was held on 30 September 2001. The inputs from
meeting are reflected in all relevant sections of this report.
The Task Force, coupled with the proposed formation of a separate waterways division for
this project within the Irrigation Department with headquarters at Kottayam, will work as an
effective monitoring and evaluation agency for the Pilot Waterways Project. The Task
Force is presided by the Secretary of the Irrigation Department; the link between the Task
Force and the ID (and the PIU of the PWD as the executing agency) is necessarily crucial.
9.1.3 Public Participation Along the Waterways
The participation of people during the construction phase is very important for the effective
implementation of the ESAMP. This is also necessary to minimise undue hardships to the
population, for identification of locations for asphalt plants (near approach roads for
repairing of existing bridges), location of labour camps, etc. All the actors in the
implementation of the project will be responsible for carrying out the public consultations.
The consultation among the Contractor, Supervising Consultant, affected landowners and
local communities prior to construction will improve the opportunities for environmental
enhancement.
The EO in consultation with the PIU Rehabilitation Officer should organise public meetings
at Alappuzha, Kottayam, Changanaserry, Kanjiram, Kavalam, Cheepumkal and
Pulikatuchery along the pilot waterways with the affected communities. The Contractor
may evolve a common strategy agreed by the local communities to avoid any undue

9.1.4 Action Plan for the ESAMP (Environmental Aspects)
Environmental mitigation measures, described in Section 7, have been incorporated within
the design process. Appropriate measures have also been identified for action in the
construction and operational phases. Exhibit 9.2 identifies the nature of the potential
environmental impact, the measures, which have been taken or will be taken, the time
frame in which they are taken, the implementing agency and responsible organisation for
supervision and, where appropriate, the contractual clause referring to the measure. It lists
measures that are common to all waterways as well as those which are specific to each
canal.
The role and responsibilities of the responsible organisations mentioned in the Exhibit 9.2
are mentioned below.
State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) -The State Pollution Control Board will be
responsible for any matters related to air, water and noise pollution during construction
and operational stages. Any matters related to this may be brought under their notice for
solution
Forest Department - Any matters related to social forestry, forests, wildlife and public
and private trees should be consulted with the local DFO or Forest Range Officer, Forest
Department, depending upon the advice required.
PIU and ID - PIU will be available only in the State Headquarters at Thiruvananthapuram.
Most of the work in the local level will be taken care of at the local ID level.
Health Department - will be responsible for any matters relating to health, hygienic
conditions, sanitary arrangements and environmental awareness programme

Geology Department may be required to assist with the activity.
9.2 ACTION PLAN FOR THE ESAMP (SOCIAL ASPECTS)
9.2.1 Project Implementation Unit
As no land acquisition is involved in the Pilot Phase of the IWT project, an Executive
Engineer of the Irrigation Department at the PIU level will function as the Rehabilitation
Officer to monitor the implementation of the community benefit enhancement programmes
and to ensure that land is not required during the implementation of the project. In addition
to this, the Kottayam Division of the ID will directly monitor the implementation
arrangements. The Rehabilitation Officer will ensure that no one else is adversely affected
by the project and will carry out the activity for establishing community relations.
9.2.2 Implementation Roles and Responsibilities
Exhibit 9.3 outlines the roles and responsibilities of the functionaries with regard to the
implementation of the social aspects of the ESAMP.

9.3 CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDS
Institutional strengthening will be undertaken to achieve the goals of the Irrigation
Department. Steps to be taken are discussed under the following sub-headings:
*     Organisation and Staffing;
Environmental Training;
*     Monitoring and Reporting; and
*     Work Progress records.
9.3.1 Organisation and Staffing
Due to the small size of the pilot project it has been decided that no separate
arrangements for environmental and social activities were required in the Irrigation
Department. The envisaged institutional organisation is shown in Exhibit 9.4. Prior to the
revival of the entire waterways sector, the ID will, however, develop a full-fledged
Environmental and Social Monitoring Unit (ESMU) after the successful implementation of
the pilot project to address the day-to-day activities along the waterways during the
construction and operational stages of the future projects.
An Environmental Officer (EO) has been recruited into the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU). The Environmental officer will assist the Project Director (PD) in the overseeing of
environmental aspects of the construction contracts, including the enforcement of all
monitoring provisions and advice on the locations of construction and labour camps, etc.
Before the commencement of construction, the Project Director will receive training in the
environmental issues associated with waterways construction and maintenance projects.
The Environmental Officer will organise the training for the ID Engineers in the PIU.
The Environmental Officer will be familiar with the Indian environmental legislation and be
experienced in monitoring and co-ordinating large irrigation watershed management or
road sector construction or similar projects. The main duties of the Environmental Officer
will include:
Collection and dissemination  of relevant environmental documents
including amendments to Environmental Protection Acts issued by the
Government and various agencies such as the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and other organisations.
Co-ordination with non-government organisations (NGOs), community
groups, Government Departments, etc. on environmental issues and
obtaining the necessary clearances from the Regulatory Authorities.
Monitoring the environmental aspects of the Project during construction to
ensure that the environmental requirements of the contract and the
mitigation measures proposed in the ESMP are implemented.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                    ESAMP
*     Advising the Project Director and preparing the environmental input to the
quarterly progress report.
*     Development of guidelines or a code of good practice on low-cost
environmental measures that can be implemented in the Waterways and
road construction and maintenance programs for the Irrigation and Public
Works Department.
*     Development of environmental training activities for Contractors and
Supervisory Consultants staff.
*     Promotion of the policies adopted for the development of waterway side
amenities.
In addition, as mentioned in Section 9.1.4.1, an Executive Engineer of the Irrigation
Department, attached to the PIU, will function as Rehabilitation Officer to oversee the
social aspects (viz., community benefits enhancement activities) of the ESAMP.
9.3.2 Training Plans
The training requirement varies for different officials.
Environmental Awareness Training is required for the Project Director PIU, Chief
Engineer, Superintendent Engineers of ID and the Contractor's personnel.
ESAMP Implementation Training This is required to be given to the full time
Environmental Officer of the PIU. As a precautionary measure this training shall be
extended to two others at Assistant Executive Engineers level. This is to ensure continuity
of service in the absence of one or two individuals.
Environmental Legislation Training The target group for this will include all PIU staff
and the nominated ID members including the Chief Engineer. The Chief Engineer will
identify the ID staff.
Arrangement for On-the-Job Training and Field Visit to Sultan's Canal in Kannur District
and NW-Ill Dredging Activities at Alappuzha-Kochi Section: This could be one of the most
important experience for those who are directly involved in the Kerala State Inland Water
Transport Pilot Project. This can be very useful to the Contractor's men, Construction
Supervision Team and the PIU officers. The canal was operational in 1999-2000. The
team can also visit the NW-Ill dredging activities.
Training for Contractors: Training for the Contractor's men in the environmental and
social mitigation plan would be necessary, especially if the selected Contractors are local.
This will be planned and executed by the CSC and the PIU, depending on the
requirement.
Identified Training Institutions: Some of the training institutes identified at this stage are
(1) Loyola College of Social Sciences, based in Thiruvananthapuram; (2) KIRTADS, based
in Kozhikode, (3) Administrative Staff College of India, based in Hyderabad, 4) Centre for
Water Resources Development and Management, Kozhikode, 5) Rajagiri School of Social
Sciences, Kochi. The training institutions in India, the World Bank's Economic
Development Institute (Environment and Natural Resources Division), the Central Pollution
Control Board (CBIP), and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) conduct regular
training and access to these resources may be sought. The Engineering Staff Training
College at Hyderabad has now become an important training centre for environmental and
social issues.

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pliot Project                    ESAMP
The need for additional and specialised training will be examined and appropriate training
will be undertaken as required.
The ID and PIU officers at the district level, who will be associated with the environmental
social activities have been identified. A one-day in-house training programme was
conducted on 24 August 2001 with the officials from the southern districts of the State to
sensitise them on the social and environmental issues involved in a transport project. It
has been planned to commission specialised training institutes to prepare tailor made
training modules for the training of the PIU and ID officials.
In addition to this environmental awareness training, ESAMP implementation training
needs to be provided jointly by the Environmental and Social Management Unit, PCC and
Construction Supervision Consultants. The suggested Environmental training modules are
Module 1 Environmental Overview
Module 2 Environmental Regulations and Acts
Module 3 Pollution
Module 4 Environmental Impact Assessment
Module 5 Environmental Management Plan
Module 6 Transport Projects and Environmental Issues
Module 7 Environmental Issues in the Project
Module 8 Environmental Management Plan for Waterways Project
Module 9 Environmentally Sound Construction Management
Module 10 Planning for Environmentally Sustainable Operation for waterways
Module 11 Long-term environmental Issues in Waterway Management
Module 12 Social Impact Issues and Management Related to the IWT Project
9.4 GRIEVANCE REDRESS BY THE WORLD BANK
The inspection panel of the World Bank is a three member non-judicial body created by
the Board of Executive Directors of IBRD and IDA in 1993 to provide an independent
forum for private citizens who believe that their rights or interests have been, or could be,
directly harmed by a project financed by the Bank. Affected people may bring their
concerns to the attention of the panel by filling a request for inspection. Based on this the
Bank will issue notice of registration followed by a field visit to the project site. The
"registration" is an administrative procedure established by the panel and it implies no
judgement whatsoever concerning the eligibility of the request for inspection. In addition to
the concerns of the affected parties the report will also look into whether the project
proponent has followed all the relevant safeguard of the bank. The Bank management will
review the panel report for necessary actions.
9.5 GRIEVANCE REDRESS WITHIN THE IWT
9.5.1 The Grievance Redress Process
The Pilot Phase of the IWT project does not involve land acquisition.  Therefore,
grievances related to resettlement and rehabilitation and their redress are not applicable.
However, this Report outlines the grievance redress provisions for any possible
grievances during the implementation of the Pilot Phase.
The grievance redress process specifies procedures for registering and addressing
complaints including appeal mechanisms and recourse to civil courts. This process may
be used to settle disputes through mediation to reduce unnecessary litigation.
In general, a Grievance Redress Committees (GRC) could be formed in the affected
district within a month of the registration of a grievance by a project affected person to look

into its grievance(s). The GRC will include the Executive Engineer of the Irrigation
Department, District Magistrate or any other person nominated by the District Magistrate,
and local PAP and NGO representatives.
The function of the GRC will be to:
Categorise, prioritise and resolve the grievance(s) within one month.
Provide support to those affected by land acquisition problems including
contested compensation and assistance awards.
The GRC will meet as needed during the project implementation. It will deliver decisions
within one month of a case registration. The District Collector will hear appeals against
the decisions of the GRC. His decisions will be final and can be contested only in a court
of law. The following flow-chart (Exhibit 9.5) depicts the grievance redress mechanism.

9.6 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS AND SCHEDULE
The most important aspects of the implementation are the appointment of the
Environmental Officer at the PIU to oversee the implementation of the environmental and
social mitigation measures incorporated in the project design and contract specifications.
Development and delivery of an environmental and social training program for selected
PIU staff and other engineering staff, responsible for overseeing the construction
contracts, can commence immediately thereafter. This will be an ongoing process.
Contracts will be awarded over a period of many months. Exhibit 9.6 indicates the
implementation schedule.

10 MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring as specified for this project will primarily involve ensuring that actions taken are
in accordance with contract and specification clauses, and specified mitigation measures.
Some awareness training may be provided to the contractor's personnel to ensure that this
is effective. This may help the Contractor to devise a practical plan to implement various
mitigation methods proposed in the Environmental and Social Management Plan in the
previous chapter.
Statutory Government agencies may assess Contractor practices and, if high pollutant
levels are suspected, will require measurement by the ID, SPCB or private sector
laboratories to verify measurements on a routine basis. Photographic records will be
established to provide useful environmental monitoring tools. A full record will be kept as
part of normal contract monitoring.
The Project Director and Environmental Officer will enforce all applicable regulations.
Under the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules 1993, for example, water
quality discharge standards have been established for inland surface waters and land for
irrigation. It is a legal obligation of the Contractor that any discharges from the work site
should meet these standards. Steps will be taken by the PD and Environmental Officer for
regular monitoring of pH, suspended solids, BOD, COD, oil and grease (Section 3, Exhibit
3.13). All contractor liaisons must be conducted through the Engineer.
10.1 IDENTIFIED INDICATORS
10.1.1 Monitoring the Environmental Aspects
The project environmental monitoring programme is shown in Exhibit 10.1.
The proposed monitoring shall be carried out for (a) Compliance monitoring and (b) Effects
monitoring.
Compliance Monitoring The compliance monitoring is to check the pollution levels by
quantitative measurements.
Effects Monitoring The effects monitoring is to evaluate the Environmental and Social
mitigation measures. This is usually carried out by determining effects of the project, for
example the effects of clearing of water hyacinth during construction by means of
measuring the area covered by weeds left in the canals after the cleaning operation. The
other methods is by noting the public complaints regarding issues such as the disposal of
dredged materials or weeds by the Contractor etc. The effects monitoring needs to be
carried out by EMU on a monthly basis.
Dredged Materials As previously described, the sediments to be dredged have been
found to be contaminated with pesticides and are to be placed in confined disposal
facilities (CDFs). The pesticides are expected to decay over a period of time after which
the materials may be cleared from the CDFs and used for beneficial purposes and the
CDFs returned to their original condition. To determine whether the materials have
become safe a regular sampling and analysis programme is to be undertaken at least
annually. The sampling procedure and parameters to be analysed are described in
Appendix J. A report shall be made after each occasion this sampling and analysis is
undertaken and a determination made of the readiness of the materials for re-use. When
a determination has been made of the their being safe for re-use the determination shall
be approved in writing by the owner. Each CDF may treated on an individual basis and
approved for reuse separately.

Water Hyacinths As previously described, water hyacinths that are to be removed from
the waterways have been found to contain heavy metals. This makes them safe and
suitable for use as compost around vegetation but unsuitable as animal feed. They are to
be placed in windrows and turned until they form compost. After this they may either be
combined with the dredged materials in the CDFs or alternately directly used as compost.
The condition and disposal of the compost shall be monitored and a report prepared on
how it has been disposed of. See Appendix J for further details.
10.1.2 Monitoring the Social Aspects
The project authorities will monitor the project implementation with regard to the
community benefit enhancement programme and community relations programme. While
monitoring will be carried out at a regular interval of every three months, evaluations will
be carried out by an external agency during the middle and the end of the pilot phase
implementation. The evaluation exercise will be based on the monitoring reports.
10.1.2.1     Monitoring Indicators
Exhibit 10.2 itemises the monitoring indicators for the social impact of the IWT project for
the purpose of evaluation.

10.2 RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities for the internal monitoring of the project progress lies with the PIU.
The responsibilities of the respective personnel within the PIU has been described in
Section 9.
10.3 COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN M&E
As the social component of the Pilot IWT project involves primarily community benefits
enhancement, the participation of the community members as well as members of the
local government (Panchayat) is essential. The Rehabilitation Officer at the PIU will
ensure that the contractors carry out consultations with the community members on

regular basis. Section 8.1.2, Public Participation along the Waterways, discusses in detail
the role of the community participation in monitoring and evaluation.
10.4 MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES
Appendix V contains a number of reporting formats attached for monitoring various
environmental requirements. All monitoring activities will be reported quarterly. The EMP
reporting by the Contractor to the Construction Supervision Consultant is the most crucial
part. The Supervision Consultants will report to the Project Director with various
supervision inputs. The reporting formats of the CSC to the PIU will contain the following:
Temporary acquisition of land for borrow areas;
Borrow area identification;
*     Quarry source identification;
Site identification and setting up of workers camp, concrete mixing plant
etc.;
*     Pollution monitoring for air, water and noise;
*     Hygiene reporting at construction camps and labour camps;
*     Water required for construction;
*     Dust suppression at construction plants;
*     Dust suppression at borrow area sites;
*     Dust suppression at crusher sites;
*     Summary mitigation and enhancement for bathing ghats and low cost
sanitation facilities;
*     Enhancement and mitigation of new Jetties and terminal facilities at
Kottayam and Changanaserry;
Re-development of borrow areas;
*     Re-development of quarry areas;
*     Restoration of construction sites.
The monitoring and evaluation of the SIMP will involve monitoring the community benefit
enhancement programmes and the community relations programme. The reporting
procedure for this activity will be tied up with the monitoring and evaluation of the KSTP
RAP for the highways.
10.5 WORK PROGRESS RECORDS
Mitigation and enhancement measures adopted in the final design will be identified in the
Contract documents and Bill of quantities so that performance and completion is effective.
The periodic site visits of the EO of the CSC, EO of the PIU and the Engineers of
Kottayam ID division, will keep a record of progress as well as the site-specific ESMP
implementation records. The frequent meeting of the EO of CSC with the Contractors will
ensure any information and communication gap with regard to the Construction phase
environmental management at construction site, labour and construction camps.

I Rupees
A comprehensive environmental awareness programme - An amount of two million
Rupees is included as project cost to cover this item. The Environmental Assessment
process in this region identified the need for comprehensive pollution control measures in
the whole Kuttanad region.
Survey and identification of BPL families for sanitation and bath enclosure
programme - 0.5 million Rupees. The cost for the identification of poor households by a
physical ground survey by an NGO is provided in Exhibit 11.1 for providing sanitation
facilities along the waterways. This will be carried out by an NGO during implementation
stage. It is necessary to provide sanitation facilities for the households immediately
adjacent to the waterways on a priority basis. These facilities will be provided free of cost
to poor households adjacent to canals and on actual cost basis to the other deserving or
needy households.
11.1.2 Construction Related Environmental and Social Mitigation Costs
The cost of various mitigation measures are estimated and tabulated in Exhibit 11.2.
Those which can be undertaken in this project are as follows: -
Low cost sanitation facilities for the BPL families - as described in the project costs
and the environmental mitigation cost table.
Water hyacinth disposal and Compost making - as identified and described by the
Water Hyacinth Management Plan in Appendix L.
Bath enclosures - the design for bath enclosures is shown in Appendix W - IWT Design
Drawings. The structure proposed includes three fibreglass sheets of suitable size (2m x
2m) projecting/hanging from the sides to the water covering the bathing ghat. The
structure is framed using a clamping arrangement on the sides using nuts and bolts. The
frame will be of steel rods and GI pipes. In those locations where the width of the canal is
not-suitable, the entire set-up can be structured landwards by digging the minimum space
required and also by providing steps. The cost for the structures is estimated and
tabulated as an environmental and social cost with maintenance cost borne by the
people/Panchayat authorities. The cost is included in the BOQ, Bill No. 10.
Terminal facilities at Changanaserry and Kottayam - the design for terminal facilities
for accepting and disposal of solid and liquid waste is shown in Appendix Y. The cost

Kerala State Inland Water Transport Pilot Project                     ESAMP
includes landscaping and visual integration of all terminal facilities with suitable tree, shrub
planting and other facilities. The cost included in the BOQ.
Dredge disposal cost The cost for dredging and disposal is a part of the Engineering
cost. Two designs have been provided for confined disposal facility. First one is a general
design can be applied anywhere and the second one is a very low cost techniques for
coconut plantations in the Kuttanad area. The cost included in the BOQ.
Solid and liquid wastes (sewage) disposal - Solid and liquid wastes (sewage) disposal
during construction from construction camps including toilet during construction from
construction camps including toilet. The cost included in the BOQ.
Safe disposal of human waste - As in aircrafts, there would be suitable arrangements in
the vessels (passenger boats, motor boats etc,) to collect human defecation. The safe
disposal of this should be planned and disposal sites identified without affecting the
waterways. A provision of Rs 12 Lakh (Rs. 1.2 million) has been included for three years
initially as the cost for making proper disposal arrangements. The cost included in the
BOQ.
In addition to this, there should be terminal arrangements in the form of septic tanks to
accept or dispose of the sewage from the vessels. This is required only because no
sewerage systems are available at Changanaserry and Kottayam. In all these locations a
closed septic tank of 40 cubic metres costing Rs. 1.5 million will be required. Open and
closed septic tanks are used in the area. This will necessitate an additional requirement of
Rs 30 Lakhs. This is a permanent investment in this direction.
All other cost aspects, such as the following, are tabulated in the Exhibit 11.2.
Quarry and Borrow area development and rehabilitation plan - The cost included in the
BOQ.
Waste Management Plan - The cost included in the BOQ.
Waiting shed for Jetties along Waterways: It is planned to construct jetty shelters in all
jetties. This facility is included in the Jetty construction cost.
Solid waste collection and disposal facilities at Jetties: There are 110 jetties
altogether, each one requiring a garbage bin of standard design size. The cost includes
visual integration of the structure. A number of these may be required at jetties. The cost
for this is included.
