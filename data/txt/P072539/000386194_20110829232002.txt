1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 The project was approved at a time when India’s economy was growing at a rate of 8
percent per year and prospects for growth were strong. Kerala though was the first State in India
to provide 100 percent connectivity to all of its Panchayats1. Yet the country’s transport system
was, by international standards, highly inefficient due to congestion, road accidents, etc. Of the
3,330 km of State highways (SHs) around 70 percent were still single-lane. In the case of Road
Safety and traffic, the total economic loss due to road accident in Kerala for 2009 was about Rs
405 crores (approximately US$92 million) which was more or less equivalent to the annual PWD
budget. Economic loss for poor or bad conditions was also significant as a result of a large
backlog of road maintenance work which has been estimated at more than US$100 million.
Kerala is one of the few Indian States with a vast inland waterways network that could be
developed as a significant complementary transport mode. Recognizing that infrastructure
bottlenecks constituted one of the major constraints to poverty reduction and private sector-led
growth, the Government of India (GOI) and the State Government of Kerala (GOK) embarked on
a large road development programs through the National Highway Development Plan and various
state-level initiatives to improve and upgrade the state-managed road network.

1.1.2 Capacity of the State Road Network: At the time of appraisal the State of Kerala, had an
area of 38,863 square km and a population of about 29 million, the State’s total road length was
about 142,343 km; with 88 percent of this paved. About 23,125 km of this primary road network
was under Public Works Department (PWD) responsibility, which comprises about 1,350 km of
National Highways; 3,330 km of State roads; 11,320 km of major district roads, 3,810 km of
Other District Roads, and 3,315 km of Village Roads. The rapid growth of registered motor
vehicles in Kerala (13 percent per year during last 20 years) coupled with the poor quality and
condition of the road network due to lack of maintenance of existing assets, contributed to high
transport operating costs, road traffic accidents, and serious environmental pollution.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank with its worldwide knowledge of effective
institutions, policies, financing and implementation mechanisms was in the best position to
respond to the opportunities and challenges faced by GOK by: (a) improving the critical long-
term capital needed to support infrastructure development for accelerated economic growth; (b)
using its lending and advisory capabilities to leverage the institutional and policy reform process;
(c) strengthening social and environmental issues associated with the road sector; and (d)
facilitating greater private sector participation and road user involvement. The Bank’s
involvement in KSTP was in line with its Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India in which a
key objective was the removal of highway infrastructure bottlenecks that constrained poverty
reduction and private-sector led growth.

1.1.4 Higher-level Objectives: At the time of approval, the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) targeted the reduction of infrastructure constraints for economic growth by:
    a) Promoting State-level reforms in the road infrastructure sector;

    A district level unit




                                                 1
    b) Improving strategic planning and maintenance effectiveness; and
    c) Mobilizing increased outlays for investment in engineering, construction and
       maintenance.

1.1.5 The Kerala State Transport Project was designed to address several key sector issues by:
    a) Improving the capacity and quality of highly congested State highways and major
       districts roads;
    b) Improving road maintenance planning and management practices;
    c) Reducing accidents on major roads;
    d) Piloting an inland water transport (IWT) improvement component for selected canals;
       and
    e) Strengthening the technical, financial and management capacities of the Kerala Public
       Works Department (PWD) and the Kerala Irrigation Department (ID).

1.1.6   The project, therefore, was expected to contribute to several of the CAS objectives.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved).

1.2.1. The PDO was to: (a) improve traffic flow and road safety on the State primary road
network; and (b) strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of key transport sector
agencies.

The key indicators for monitoring the achievement of objectives were:

Outcome/Impact Indicators:
   a) Reduction in travel time and vehicle operating costs by 20 percent on the 1,600km of
      roads to be improved under the project by EOP;
   b) Reduction in the share of SH network in poor condition from 90 percent to 50 percent by
      EOP;
   c) Reduction in road accidents up to 30 percent at accident black spot sites improved under
      the project; and
   d) Implementation of time-based ISAP by EOP.

Output Indicators:
   a) Upgrading/widening of about 600 km of high priority SHs by EOP;
   b) Rehabilitation of about 100 km of inland waterways and installation of navigational aide
        by EOP;
   c) Completion of all environmental mitigation measures and full delivery of entitlements to
        PAPs;
   d) Rehabilitation of about 1,000 km of SHs to a good standard (IRI<4.5) by EOP;
   e) Improvement of 50 accidents black spots by EOP;
   f) Establishment of following units within PWD by mid-term review: (a) social and
        environment safeguards, and (b) financial management;
   g) Comprehensive revision and implementation of PWD codes and manuals by mid-term
        review; and
   h) Development and implementation of road management information system within PWD
        by EOP.

1.3 Revised Key Indicators under the original PDOs (as approved by original approving
authority) and reasons/justification.




                                                2
1.3.1 The PDOs were not revised but some of the outcome and output indicators were adjusted
to reflect the revised physical work scope due to implementation delays, cost overrun associated
with land acquisition and pre-construction activities for road widening works. The restructuring
aimed to: (a) reduce the risk of further implementation delays; and (b) complete the land
acquisition and resettlement actions for the Phase II roads sections for subsequent separate
financing. Therefore, the corrective restructuring (approved on September 2009) comprised: (a)
the exclusion of Phase II Corridor Improvement Works Component (about 327 km); and (b) and
reallocation of the resulting loan savings (of about US$30 million) to extend the coverage of the
periodic road maintenance component to an additional 200 km of Kerala’s State’s primary road
network. The revised PDO indicators are as follows:

Outcome/Impact Indicators: (a) Reduction in travel time and vehicle operating costs by 20
percent on the 1,450 km of roads to be improved under the project by EOP; (b) Reduction in the
share of SH network in poor condition from 90 percent to 54 percent by EOP; and (c) Reduction
in road accidents up to 20 percent at accident black spot sites improved under the project.

Output Indicators: (a) Upgrading/widening of about 254 km of high priority SHs by EOP; (b)
Rehabilitation of about 77 km of inland waterways and installation of navigational aide by EOP;
(c) Rehabilitation of about 1,200 km of SHs to a good standard (IRI<4.5) by EOP; and (d)
Improvement of 30 accidents black spots by EOP.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries.

1.4.1 The main beneficiaries of the project were the users living along the project corridors,
mainly the traveling public, agricultural and industrial producers, consumers and local
communities. The benefits were mainly in the form of reduced transport bottlenecks and lower
passenger and freight transport costs, travel time and improved road safety, specifically, the
reduction of the fatalities due to road accidents reduced significantly after improvement of black
spots. In addition, they were expected to benefit from improved access to markets resources,
social services, health education and economic services. Moreover, the pilot IWT component
was expected to have a significant positive impact on communication and transport costs,
protection of agricultural lands, and other properties from flooding and increased eco-tourism.
Generation of more employment in the project influence area was also envisaged.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 Component 1: Transport Corridor Upgrading (estimated total cost: US$261.55
million).
This component comprised civil works, supervision and quality control services, environmental
management, and preconstruction activities such as land acquisition, resettlement and

1.6 Revised Components.
1.6.1 Component 1: (a) Upgrading of roads 254.70 km (US$119.03 million) revised out of
original 600 km (579 km actual- US$165.4 million). The Phase II corridor improvement works
324.2 km (US$89.8 million) excluded from the project. (b) Rehabilitation of 73 km (US$3.55
million) revised out of original 100 km (US$7.3 million) IWT canals.

1.6.2 Component 2: Road maintenance for about 1,156 km (US$127.64 million) revised out of
1,200 km (1,000 km original at US$51.5 million plus 200 km additional for about US$30 million
from restructuring) of the State Highways.

1.7 Other significant changes.

1.7.1 The loan closing date was extended four times in a period of three years from December
31, 2007 to December 31, 2010 to accommodate delays in the civil works due to slow




                                               4
performance of some contractors, design changes, procurement process, land acquisition (LA)
and force majeure event of extended monsoon season during Year 2004, 2005.

1.7.2 Funding allocations. The initial loan amount was US$255 million. At the request of the
Borrower US$8 million (resulting from reduction in the expected civil works contract claims)
was cancelled in November 2010 and US$14 million (loan surplus after final disbursement) was
cancelled in March 2011. Finally, the surplus balance amount of about US$1 million was
cancelled on May 13, 2011, leaving a total disbursed amount of US$232 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry.

2.1.1 Soundness of the background analysis and design: The key lessons considered and
incorporated in the design are as follows:
    a) To ensure quality at entry, based on the strategic options study (undertook by GOK in
        1997), a techno-economic study, and detailed design and contract document preparation
        tasks were carried out in 1999-2001 (for civil works and institutional development
        components) prior to the project appraisal in 2002;
    b) Contractors for civil works (Ph-I road rehabilitation works, first year periodic
        maintenance works) were pre-qualified, bids received and evaluated and the contract for
        the supervision consultant was ready for signing before the loan approval in 2002;
    c) To ensure upfront commitment to sector reforms, an agreement reached on a final ISAP,
        including and implementation timetable endorsed by the government;
    d) Prior to loan effectiveness, to ensure readiness for implementation, 35 percent of the civil
        works contracts were awarded;
    e) Upfront preparation of the RAP, and advance assessment did not ensure timely initiation
        of the LA process to avoid delays in construction activities. However, it was fully
        completed in the end;
    f) Development of a project financial management system which was made operational
        prior to project effectiveness; and,
    g) Upfront completion of a road safety audit, the preparation of a draft integrated Road
        Safety Action Plan, and pilot road accident black spot investigations undertaken, to
        ensure the prioritization of road safety engineering activities.

2.1.2 Participatory processes: The project was prepared and implemented in a participatory
manner with several stakeholders, mainly but not limited to various government departments,
community leaders, local government officials, NGOs, potentially affected people:
    a) The PWD completed a comprehensive Institutional Development Strategy (IDS) study
       involving all key stakeholders and prepared the final ISAP; the government developed a
       draft Road Development Policy for Kerala;
    b) GOK drafted a Medium-Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) for the road sector in close
       coordination with the Public Works Department, State Planning Board, Department of
       Finance projecting fund requirements and financing sources;
    c) Wide stakeholder consultations were organized for enacting the Kerala Highway
       Projection Act in order to protect highway corridors from encroachments and undesirable
       land use developments;
    d) the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy framework was prepared through wide
       stakeholder participation approved and ratified by the State legislature, and the same
       policy was subsequently adopted for all fast track projects in the State;




                                                5
    e) Three rounds of user satisfaction surveys were carried out to assess user perception and
       feedback and the findings of the surveys were suitably integrated in project
       implementation and PWD’s operational framework;
    f) A multi-sector road safety action plan was developed through consultation among the
       transport department, PWD, Police department, health and education department and
       NGOs; and
    g) A public information and communication system, including a 24x7 grievance redressal
       system were successfully designed and implemented to significantly improve PWD’s
       service level quality.

2.1.3 Risks and Mitigation Measures: The two major risks contemplated were (a) whether the
counterpart funding will be adequate in a fiscally weak State, and (b) what constraints the project
preparatory activities, particularly LA and R&R could impose on smooth project implementation.
The first risk was very well mitigated by designing a ring-fenced fund flow system away from the
central fund pool through establishment of dedicated project account. The second risk however,
could not be fully mitigated and made serious impact on project implementation which resulted in
serious time and cost overrun, eventually leading to restructuring of the physical scope of the
project and adjustment of outcome/output indicators. On the other hand, the risk associated with
the design and implementation of the IWT sub-component was underestimated that faced
unexpected major issues during implementation and had to be significantly cut down.

2.1.4   Quality at Entry: No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried out.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 According to the ISR ratings, the implementation in the first two years was satisfactory
but then started lagging behind and at the mid-term review of the project (November 2004), it
was downgraded to unsatisfactory, improved to moderately satisfactory in 2005, 2006 and then
on, essentially remained moderate/unsatisfactory until the restructuring in 2009. Subsequent to
restructuring, implementation improved to moderately satisfactory which was maintained until
the project completion. The following were the main factors that affected implementation of the
project before the restructuring:

    a) Force majeure: Heavy and longer period of monsoons contributed to the delays to the
        Contractors’ works during the first three years of the project period.

    b) Land Acquisition and Resettlement Actions: The time-line provided in the RAP proved
        to be unrealistic. Although fully and satisfactorily completed in the end, the land
        acquisition was not initiated in time to resettle a very large number of Project-Affected
        Families (PAFs) (over 30,000 and acquisition of 176 ha. land) in a very dense urban-rural
        continuum and deficiencies experienced included: (i) lack of effective collaboration
        between PMT/PWD and Revenue Department to match the LA activities with the civil
        works implementation schedule, (ii) delays in disbursement of compensation to the
        project affected people, and (iii) land acquisition proposals did not take into account all
        the affected land parcels and the additional land required for improving the vertical
        profile, slope protection works, and utility relocation resulting in multiple notifications
        for initiating LA process.

    c) Project Management:(i) high turnover of project management team members including
        the Project Directors; (ii) lack of adequate oversight by PWD and the supervision




                                                 6
        consultants; non integration of land acquisition schedule and utility relocation schedule
        with award of civil works; (iii) lack of coordination between PWD/PMT, contractors,
        consultants and NGOs; (iv) delays in utility relocation and availability of encumbrance
        free site; (v) delayed decision making, delayed release of contract payments; and (vi)
        delayed project restructuring.

    d) Contract Management: (i) inadequate contractor capacity; (ii) poor contract planning
        and monitoring; and (iii) repeated termination of contracts and re-bidding.

    e) Inadequate Staffing: Inadequate staffing at Project Implementation Unit/Public works
        Department (PIU/PWD), frequent transfers of project staff, and in other concerned
        departments such as revenue.

    f) The quality of the works in place, pavements, riding was generally satisfactory. However,
        the adverse effect of above mentioned weakness was reflected in the substandard quality
        of work at some sections, especially on the side shoulders and drains.

2.2.2 Among the achievements, the completion of the institutional development strengthening
component needs to be specifically highlighted as it will ensure the project sustainability. It put
the PWD on the transformation path from a traditional road department to a performance-oriented
and user-responsive modern road agency.

2.2.3 Mid- Term Review (MTR-November 2004): At the MTR, more than two and a half
years after the start of project implementation, the IP was downgraded to Unsatisfactory due to:
(i) the slow loan disbursement (only 23 percent); and (ii) significant delays in the implementation
of the transport corridor improvement component (that accounted for about 78 percent of the total
project cost); and (iii) LA and utility relocation delays.

2.2.4    Two out of the three road improvement contracts of Phase I came to a complete halt
following the contractor’s decision to terminate the contracts citing delays to their progress
payments for five consecutive months since May 2006 by the PWD (counterpart funding). The
Phase I road improvement works were thus running about 20 months behind schedule in
2006/2007. The implementation progress rating (in ISRs), therefore, was intermittent between
Unsatisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory from January 2007 to May 2009.

2.2.5 Action Taken: A formal restructuring was approved on September 29, 2009 to: (i)
exclude the Phase II corridor improvement works (about 324 km) from the scope of work due to
shortage of time and funds; and (ii) to use part of the balance unallocated loan through
undertaking additional periodic maintenance works (about 200 km). The restructuring resulted in
bringing back the project on track improving the implementation progress rating to moderately
satisfactory.

2.2.6 Progress on Resettlement and Rehabilitation (safeguard issue) also suffered due to its
dependence on LA and timely compensation payments. However, given its magnitude, overall
R&R was completed satisfactorily in the end.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: The overall monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility of PWD.
The original PDOs were not revised: (i) improve traffic flow and road safety on the State primary




                                                7
road network; and (ii) strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of key transport sector
agencies. However, as a result of the restructuring, (i.e. exclusion of the Phase II civil works),
and the addition of about 200 km of road for rehabilitation, the end of the project targets for three
outcome indicators and associated output indicators were modified. The indicators for the Inland
Water Transport (IWT) were also revised due to the design deficiency and the poor contractor
performance.

M&E Implementation: The PDOs were periodically monitored and reported in the Mission Aide-
Memoires and the ISRs. The intermediate output indicator for the rehabilitation pilot of IWT
canals could not be assessed accurately. The PAD Annex 1 mentioned targets of the performance
indicators to be achieved by midterm review and at the end of the Project (EOP). It would have
been better to measure the performance more frequently by the implementing agency.

M&E Utilization: The supervision mission reports and action plans provided the assessments of
the performance indicators, PDOs and evaluation periodically (about every six months). Although,
the PWD/PMT conducted frequent inspections to prepare weekly and monthly progress reports
and pointed out deficiencies, however, it lacked more detailed evaluation surveys and analysis.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard compliance is rated Moderately Satisfactory on the account of the following
achievements:

2.4.1 Social safeguards: At the outset of the Project implementation, the GOK lacked
institutional capacity to undertake management of the social safeguard tasks involved in the
project. Several progressive steps were taken such as introduction of Direct Purchase method for
land, appointment of Sociologists in the respective Project implementation Unit, several onsite
and offsite trainings and sensitization sessions on R&R, continuing intensive consultations with
community and project affected people throughout project implementation.
Including Phase I and II about 30,811 Families (65 percent higher than RAP) were affected and
176 hectares of land (54 percent higher than RAP) were acquired. The increase of the affected
families was due to incomplete list of affected land parcels and the additional land required for
improving the vertical profile, slope protection works and utility relocations. This resulted in
multiple notifications for initiating LA process in the same stretch of the road. Out of the total
affected people: (a) 65 percent were titleholders (35 percent not-titleholders); and (b) 24 percent
were permanently displaced families (76 percent temporarily displaced). Project roads passed
through densely populated areas with habitations in the form of ribbon development in almost an
entire stretch. Hence, in order to carry out widening, not only the number of structures affected
per kilometer of roads was high but also restoring access to abutting properties, shifting of
utilities and temporary diversions for traffic became a major cause of concern during construction,
resulting in substantial delay in Phase I.

Social assessment was carried out as part of the project preparation with the participation of
stakeholders. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared and implemented for Phase1 and
Phase II of road up-gradation component. Similarly, an Environmental and Social Management
Plan (ESMP) were prepared for the road maintenance and waterways component of the project.
The GOK prepared Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA), Environmental Assessment (EA),
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP),
RAP, an R&R Policy, and Environment and Social Assessment and Management Plans (ESAMP)
in accordance with the Bank’s Operational Directive OP 4.01, OD 4.30, OD 4.20, OPN 11.03,



                                                 8
which were disclosed in public places in effected districts. A Social and Environment
Management Cell was also established for implementing the RAP and Environment and Social
Assessment and Management Plan (ESMAP). Moreover, GOK has done an independent review
of the project’s environmental and social assessment.

Land acquisition (65 Hectares) and R&R activities for 11,485 PAFs under Phase I were
completed as per the project’s R&R policy, whereas, the progress of LA and R&R for Phase II
was also undertaken and is about 95 percent with some incomplete patches in between. Since the
actions were already underway and, the Bank continued to supervise the process of LA and R&R
for Phase II, although this phase was excluded from the scope of this project but was being
prepared for the follow up project that the Government requested for the Bank’s assistance.
Social impacts screening of additional 160 km of maintenance roads has also been completed and
no social impacts were identified.

2.4.2 Environment Safeguards was rated Satisfactory through the project period.
In the first few years of project implementation, a system was established to ensure that all
environmental clearances with the State Pollution Control Board were periodically obtained. The
GOK officials – both in the PWD and in the PMT – have extended support in the conduct of
environmental assessments, public consultations and implementing the requirements of the
various environmental management plans (EMP) that were developed during the preparation
phase. High commitment of the PWD/PMT in establishing the project’s Environmental
Management Cell and in continuing its activities throughout the project period. At the outset,
extensive capacity building and training was done for the State Government officials (PMT),
construction supervision consultants, technical audit consultants and the contractors by the PCC.
This helped in making the project’s Environmental Cell and its functions operational. Roadside
compensatory plantation (more than 10,000 trees) to make up for the trees cut (about 4,000 trees)
along the different project roads was done in line with the environmental management plan
requirements. Throughout the project period, environmental management implementation was
integrated with the overall implementation. Environmental management was not seen as a
separate activity that needed a separate organization structure; it was fully integrated with the rest
of the activities at the contractor, construction supervision consultant and PMT levels. The
project identified environmental management as a focused area of work in the institutional
development of the road sector in the State.

Therefore, the overall implementation is rated Satisfactory considering that Kerala is an
environmentally sensitive and aware state with an active civil society, thus, to implement a road
development project – covering the length and the breadth of the State – without any major
implementation lapses is a creditable achievement.

Fiduciary compliance was rated Satisfactory on account of the followings:

2.4.3 Financial Management: The Kerala PWD was not quite experienced in Bank’s
disbursement procedures and financial reporting accounting and auditing requirements when the
project was launched. However, they learnt quite expediently and the Project Financial
Management System (PFMS) was installed and fully operated across the State’s PWD field
divisions with some minor lag in data entry. This collated real time project financial information
from individual PWD field divisions, and consolidated this information centrally at the PWD
headquarters in Trivandrum. An important aspect of the project was the R&R payments to a very
large number of beneficiaries and the documentation and verification thereof. The project
reflected good coordination between the supervision consultant and the finance staff at the KSTP
PMU who were responsible for passing the bills for payment after their own mandatory checks.



                                                  9
It ensured that payment delays were minimized and the centralized payment process was simpler
and efficient. On the other hand, the shortcomings were also observed; the pace of work
completion and/or expenditure was very low, and the disbursement figures were somewhat
stagnant for long periods of time. There were consistent delays in the receipt of statutory audit
reports each year. This was sometimes due to delays in submission of accounts by the project and
also due to delays in the office of the AG, Kerala, who was the auditor.

2.4.4 Procurement: Procurement of works, goods, and consulting services were carried out in
accordance with the Bank guidelines. The up-gradation civil works component was subject to
major delays and thus resulted in the cancellation of the Phase II road works. This was attributed
to poor procurement planning with detailed engineering and land acquisition led to serious time
overruns, cost escalations, poor performance resulting to termination of contracts and rebidding
for fragmented patchy works of the project. Overall, procurement process management was
however carried out without any significant F&C issues or complaints on the procurement cycle
management. Major revision provisions of the bidding documents have been updated to
international standards, an integrated software was developed by the project that starts from BoQs
and takes through tendering, contract award and post award management and payment phases
which was one of the best contributions the project had made to the department for road
construction.

2.4.5 Disbursement: The total loan amount was revised downwards from US$255 million to
US$232 million, by cancelling US$8 million and US$14 million in two tranches, in 2010 and
2011, respectively. The revised loan amount was fully disbursed. The cancellations were
primarily done as the revised project cost during restructuring assumed significant payout of
contract claims in various stages of disputes at that point of time. However, as the project
implementation significantly improved during the last two years, many of the claims were
mutually resolved or even withdrawn by the contractors, resulting in overall savings of the
overruns in Phase I corridor improvement component.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Post-completion Operations: The successful implementation of over 1,410 km of State
highway and institutional strengthening component has a major positive impact on the State’s
transport network operations. Furthermore, the road safety program particularly the physical road
safety and hazard mitigation measures, achieved progress beyond original targets. Kerala as the
first State in India to establish a fully empowered and independent road safety authority with a
dedicated safety fund will also go a long way to lead the nation. The focus will be on the
sustainability of assets created through catalyzing institutional set up (GIS, RMMS, FMS, E&SM
cell) to undertake proper management. The institutional capacity of the PWD has acquired
substantial experience to entrust post-completion operations of the said project.

2.5.2 Next Phase: GOK has prepared a proposed project to DEA for World Bank assistance to
carry out the Second State Transport Project (KSTP II), including:
    a) Upgrading of the State highways about 324 km (excluded Phase II);
    b) Performance based maintenance contracts (PPP or annuity arrangements);
    c) Strategic Option Study for future improvement formulating short term, midterm and
        longer plans on road safety; and
    d) Land Acquisition (98 percent completed for Phase II) for about 110 hectares.

3. Assessment of Outcomes.




                                               10
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation.

3.1.1 The PDOs remain highly relevant to the current national priorities and the World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009-2012 which focuses on improving much-
needed infrastructure to help sustain rapid economic growth to achieve poverty reduction
objectives. The strategy is thus closely aligned with the Government of India’s own development
priorities expressed in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. Pre-feasibility study and design preparation
has been very effective and must be continued. Implementation procedures need to be further
strengthened. The sustainability of the institutional development, GIS, RMMS and FMS achieved
will improve implementation in the future roads construction and maintenance operations.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives.

3.2.1 The project was formally restructured in September 2009 maintaining the original PDOs,
while the Outcome and associated output Indicators were adjusted/revised to be consistent with
the scope changes. Overall disbursement at the time of formal restructuring was 65 percent of the
total loan amount. Therefore, the assessment has been done for both original and revised targets.
The Project was completed about three years behind original schedule and with about 35 percent
cost overrun of the original budget plan.

3.2.2 The achievement of the PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This assessment is based
on the following analysis of achievement:

Objective 1: Improve traffic flow and road safety on the State primary road network (88
percent or the original and 97 percent of the revised target achieved at EOP).

3.2.3 The objectives of improved traffic flow (travel time, cost savings) and road safety were
substantially achieved but on a scaled down road network than what was in the original scope.
Although, the road widening component was not fully accomplished (only 42 percent of the
original target-achieved), the road maintenance rehabilitation component was fully achieved (115
percent of original, and 96 percent of the revised target). The inland waterways pilot was
substantially unimplemented (about 35 percent achieved) and unsuccessful with the loss of
envisaged benefits. The road safety works undertaken in the project have exceeded the original
target and resulted in improved safety outcomes on the primary road network of the State:

    (a) The travel time has been reduced to 40 percent against 20 percent target on the
        restructured scope of 1,410 km against 1,600 km (achieved);
    (b) The vehicle operating cost savings realized are about 35 percent on restructured scope of
        1,410 km (achieved);
    (c) The share of poor condition roads in the core State road network (State highways plus
        upgraded/rehabilitated roads under the project) has been reduced to 54 percent, against 50
        percent original target at the EOP (achieved revised target);2
    (d) Road accidents have been reduced to 20 percent against 30 percent original target at 37
        improved accident black spot sites against 50 black spots improvement (achieved).




2
  This assumes that 100 percent of the upgraded and rehabilitated roads (1,410 km) constitute the Core State Highways
(of total 3,930 km).




                                                        11
Objective 2: Strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of key transport sector agencies
(95 percent of original target achieved at EOP).

3.2.4 The institutional development component was successful laying foundations for
sustainable roads asset management, planning and budgeting. The implementation of the PWD-
centered institutional and financial strengthening strategies is satisfactory. Significant overall
strengthening of key transport sector agencies and frameworks has been achieved throughout the
project. The empowerment, capacity and efficiency of the PWD has been improved with major
enhancements in the roads sector policy and legislative framework, in PWD organization and
staffing, in technical policy and processes for roads project management and road maintenance, in
new capacity for environmental and social safeguards action, in financial management and e-
governance tools, and in PWD specific IT assets and systems, Public Information and
Communication action and PWD integration of new specialist cells is completed. The only
remaining is the finalization of PWD Codes and Manual.

3.3 Efficiency.

Efficiency in achieving the project objectives in terms of economic rate of return is Moderately
Satisfactory. The IERR at ICR stage is higher than at the appraisal stage. However, this is not
counting lost benefits (non-quantifiable) to the users but is due to the higher traffic growth than
predicted subsequent to three years completion delay (8.5 at appraisal vs. 15.4 at ICR stage).

3.3.1 To the extent possible, the same methodology and assumptions used during the appraisal
stage were used at ICR stage adjusting forecasted values to actual values. More details on the
economic analyses at appraisal and ICR stage are given in Annex 3; and a summary is given in
the table below.

3.3.2 The overall weighted average EIRR for the “widening and strengthening? component is
28 percent at ICR stage, a two percent point increase with respect to the ERR calculated at
appraisal (26 percent) and above the threshold of 12 percent for all the road sections. The
weighted average of the benefit-cost ratio was higher at ICR stage (7.4) than at appraisal stage
(5.3). The benefit-cost ratio was above one for all the road sections and it was found to be
increased for two road sections (RMC4 and RMC10).




                                                  12
3.3.3 In the case of the widening and strengthening component, on average, the cost of the
component has decreased by five percent and the time overrun was of approximately 56 months,
which represents a 198 percent increased with respect to the time originally planned at appraisal.
The time overrun has impacted negatively in the economic rate of return; however, the marginal
decrease in the project cost along with the increase in the volume of traffic in the project roads
(from a predicted average growth rate of 8.5 percent at appraisal to an average 15.4 percent at
ICR stage) has counteracted favorably, keeping EIRR above twelve percent and, in most cases,
above forecasted values at appraisal.

3.3.4 In the case of the road maintenance component, the benefit-cost ratio is lower for most of
the sections where information is available at appraisal. This can be explained by an increase in
the average capital cost (approximately a 149 percent increase) and time overruns (approximately
an 84 percent increase). Overcoming all these negative parameters, traffic growth rate has been
much higher than forecasted at appraisal stage (an average increase of 51 percent). The increase
in traffic volume is one of the main reasons the component has reached a weighted average
benefit-cost ratio higher than at appraisal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4.1 The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory, given the relevance and efficiency
of the project and achievement of the project development objectives. The PDO was successfully
achieved except for the inland waterways pilot works and about 10 percent reduction in the
originally envisage upgrading of the primary road network. The Project did not fully foresee the
huge magnitude of the land acquisition and resettlement actions involving more than 30,000
affected families. While the executing agency lacked capacity to plan and undertake the extensive
task, the Government (Revenue Department) was also not prepared to respond within the required
time. The Project hence suffered starting delays when the contractors already mobilized were
forced to follow a stop and go schedule, requiring additional time and incurring cost overrun
which gave rise to contract claims. Also, among other reasons, at one point due to the late
payments, two of the four main contractors terminated their contracts. The work thus remained
suspended for about one year. During the elapsed duration, the prices of the major construction
commodities hiked, thus raising the overall project cost. The funding shortfall consequently
forced exclusion of Phase II road upgrading works thus necessitating restructuring of the project
in September of 2009 and extension of loan closing date. However, the addition of about 200 km
of roads to the roads rehabilitation component, substantially compensated for the lost benefits.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts.

With 840 people per square kilometer, Kerala State is one of the most densely populated states of
India. Therefore, acquiring right of way for roads improvement and widening is a huge challenge.
Introduction of Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the project affected persons was a novel
concept for the State administration. However, this action has had a paramount impact on the
community acceptance of the project.




(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development.




                                               13
There was no study on poverty impact and gender aspects undertaken during the preparation of
the project. However, the following observations were documented as a result of the significant
resettlement program (over 30,000 affected persons) and related actions undertaken during
project implementation.

3.5.1 As per end-term evaluation, a survey and report carried out by an independent consultant
were submitted in December of 2010. They reported on the satisfaction level on such aspects as
quality of life, environment, vehicle operating cost, road safety, etc. Furthermore, on the social
aspects, the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan has had a number of positive
impacts on the project-affected persons, as noted below.

        (a) Availability of cash for daily needs and business investment: 75 percent of the
peripherally affected families used the compensation to upgrade their housing and acquire assets
and facilities. Remaining 25 percent used the money for loan repayments and household
expenses. Forty-three percent reported improvement in their social status and 0.5 percent moved
from own house to rented house

         (b) Improvement in living conditions: The end-term evaluation survey reported impact
on the income, occupation, ownership of assets and housing. Twenty-nine percent reported
improvement in income and social status. Although no significant change in occupation, 1.5
percent moved from non-farm wage labor and private service to agriculture. Those living in
rented house increased from one percent to 1.5 percent and others sustained their previous status.
Forty percent reported no change in their socio-economic status; and 31 percent reported loss due
to closing of business and loss of customers and presence of new business competitors

         (c) Increase in household income: The end-term evaluation survey reveals that money
cannot compensate all the loss and suffering of PAFs, PAPs and the Community. Land
acquisition actions cause psychological distress and trauma among the project affected persons
(PAPs) leading to psychosocial dysfunction in some cases.

         (d) Gender Aspects Included. Although no specific study on Gender was conducted in
the implementation process of RAP, the gender related issues were covered while re-settling and
rehabilitating around 350 squatters, title of land was issued in joint names of the wife and
husband?. Negotiated purchase method of land acquisition was preferred by almost all PAPs.
Sixty percent PAPs expressed satisfaction in the attitude and approach of KSTP personnel
whereas remaining was neutral about it.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening.

3.5.2 This component has supported the implementation of a wide range of roads sector reform
measures. Notable among those are introduction of modern technology, upgraded training
programs and capacity building actions under the PWD-Centered Institutional Strengthening
Action Plan (ISAP). The ISAP encompasses roads sector policy, statutory and legislative
frameworks, organization and human resources management, contract and financial management
system (FMS), technical policy and processes, planning and design capacity, roads funding, road
safety engineering countermeasures, enhancements of IT assets and systems, and resources
development training.

3.5.3 As part of the institutional strengthening initiative, the PWD code and Manual has been
thoroughly revised (fine tuning is ongoing) to make it compatible with the functioning of a



                                               14
modern road agency, while integrating with other cells. One other key institutional strengthening
initiative was development of a Geographical Information System (GIS) in conjunction with
Road Maintenance Management System (RMMS). Along with the GIS supported RMMs and
FMS, development and operationalizing of the web-based PWD IT backbone system ‘WINGS’
has also contributed modernizing the PWD functions in a big way. Similarly, pioneering work
was done in establishing a dedicated independent Road Safety Authority in the State and the
Road Safety Fund. This initiative was complemented by setting up a dedicated road safety cell in
the PWD.

3.5.4 In summary, the implementation of the Institutional Development Strengthening Action
Plans (ISAP) contributed to the success of the project. This has enhanced PWD’s operational
efficiency in but not limited to, safeguards, fiduciary and project management practices. The
transformation of PWD from a traditional road department to a performance-oriented and user-
responsive modern road agency has been the most successful factor in project sustainability. The
establishment of the various cells within PWD has mostly been beneficial and rewarding.
However, the terms of reference for some of the cells e.g. the Quality Management cell or the
Environmental Monitoring cell could have been more tightly defined to make these cells more
effective.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative).

Banking on the success of the institutional strengthening action plan, the PWD is foreseeing
efficiency gains through outsourcing certain functions of the new cells so that the PWD staff can
only monitor performance with PWD’s reduced overhead budget.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops.

3.6.1 There were three phases for Road User Satisfaction Survey (RUSS): RUSS 2003, RUSS
2006 and RUSS 2010. RUSS 2003 was conducted at an earlier stage of KSTP, and RUSS 2006
was conducted midway through the project. RUSS 2010 was a conclusive survey incorporating
people's acceptance of the project for its socio-economical and environmental viability. RUSS
2010 extended its survey sample to include secondary road users. Relevant aspects related to road
quality and engineering have been taken in to account. RUSS 2010 shows better satisfaction
levels on all aspects of road development. Summary of the survey results is in Annex 5.

3.6.2 The Bank participated in a workshop organized by PWD/PIU inviting all implementing
agencies, contractors, consultants and NGOs who have been involved in the preparation and
implementation over the course of the life project. The objective of the workshop was to provide
an opportunity to the participants to express lessons learned from successes and failures observed
the life of the project. The issues discussed are summarized in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1     The risk that the achieved development outcomes will not be sustained is moderate. The
State has identified a core network of 12,000 km and mooted a decadal investment plan of Rs.
40,000 Crores (about US$9.0 billion) for development/management of the network. However,
considering that the current PWD annual budget is only about US$150 million, mobilization of
funds and implementation/absorption capacity of the PWD for such a large program remains a
question mark. Further, Kerala has been able to increase the maintenance funding on the core
road network (project roads included). However, the overall maintenance financing has largely



                                               15
remained in the range of 20 percent of the demands in an unconstrained situation seriously
affecting the maintenance and quality of the non-core network. The State has to embark on a
medium/long term financing strategy (based on the RMMS support) for developing and managing
the road network including exploring mobilization of funds through the PPP routes for which the
State is still to develop a suitable framework.

4.2      As regards the sustaining the institutional improvement and road safety management
framework, the State seems to be committed as evident in preparing a sustainability plan and
allocating adequate resources to sustain the project funded initiatives. However, besides
providing resources, the senior level oversight and monitoring both in institutional strengthening
and road safety management needs to be enhanced to ensure long-term sustainability of these
project funded initiatives.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance.

5.1 Bank Performance.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory
based on such facts: The Bank’s team undertook rigorous project preparation and supported
lessons from other states of India and other countries in the region and made a detailed review for
the engineering aspects of the physical components, environmental and financial management
aspects. However, it fell short on the following aspects: (a) full assessment of the social impacts,
especially for the land acquisition and resettlement action involved and thus preparing the
implementing agency to take on the challenge; and (b) the scope of civil works included for
upgrading the Inland Water Transport (IWT) as a pilot, was a significant intervention to support
the State road network in transporting freight and people and therefore could be taken up
separately not as a piggy back component with this roads improvement project.

(b) Quality of Supervision.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

 5.1.2 The Bank missions were extensive including frequent interim missions every six months.
Although the quality of supervisions was effective, there have been some deficiencies that could
have been avoided at earlier stage of the project implementation. The restructuring of the project
by dropping the Phase II works could have been initiated at the mid-term review in 2004 rather
late in 2009, after it became clear that the project will not be completed with the stipulated
implementation period: (i) at that time, the total loan disbursement was only 23 percent out of
total loan utilization period of 5.5 years; and (ii) the main delays occurred in the corridor
improvement component which accounted for 78 percent of the total cost of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Based on justifications mentioned above.

5.2 Borrower Performance.

(a) Government Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                16
5.2.1 The GOK demonstrated a high level of commitment and ownership toward the project
design, preparation and implementation through number of actions. These included:

     (a) full endorsement of the model Project Identification and Preparation Framework;
     (b) Preparation and submission to the Central Government of a Road Sector Policy Letter
         outlining the State’s commitment to improve both management and funding of the road
         sector;
     (c) Spending substantial resources (US$4 million) under the Technical Assistance Loan on
         the project preparation without any assurance that the project would materialize; and
     (d) Funding the pre-feasibility study focusing on the investment needs of the core SH
         network in 1994 and the preparation of the Strategic Options Study to identify roads for
         improvement and;

However, the Government failed to assess the high magnitude challenges of the land acquisition
and resettlement impacts in road projects, funding needs (by the revenue department) which
contributed to the extensive delays to the project implementation resulting in the funding shortfall
to support the original scope and thus necessitating restructuring of the Project.

Also, it is important to mention that due to a change of Government in 2006, the level of
commitment to the project was interrupted in 2006/2007 whereby the implementation faced
important delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2.2 The implementing agency managed the project in a professional manner but was
handicapped due to lack of qualified staff and equipment during most of the implementation
period. This was mainly due to frequent turnover of staff and more importantly of project
director. The PWD/PMT had about seven different Project Directors (PD) in a seven-year project
period out of which two years of PD’s absence. It made it difficult to manage the project in an
efficient and effective manner. Contractors and consultants were left without proper supervision
from PWD/PMT. The implementing agency had no authority to make decision (for instance with
revenue department on land acquisition issues). The new project director and project team had
shown seriousness and professionalism in managing successfully the project although late in the
process.

More specifically, the implementing agency did not insure that the contractors’ payment and
claims were processed duly to prevent the Contractor’s action to terminate the contract and
suspending the works for prolonged period. This was a major factor in overall time delay and cost
increase, which forced the exclusion of the Phase II civil works from the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned .

6.1    Project Preparation. The period between the completion of the preparation and
commencement of implementation should be minimized (preferably should be within one year) to
avoid major variations of the existing physical conditions of pavement. The project readiness for




                                                17
implementation should duly consider the progress on land acquisition and resettlement actions
(preferably award contracts only after at least 70 percent land is made available).

6.2     Raising Awareness: For financing such single state projects, substantive capacity
building and training on safeguards, environmental, financial and procurement aspects should be
planned for the project implementation agency (PWD). An effective and vigorous Public
Consultation should be conducted on proposals regarding realignment, and bypasses.

6.3     Safeguards Management aspect:
6.3.1 Environmental Aspect: Contractors for the major works (e.g. rehabilitation or upgrading),
should have an Environmental specialist to coordinate the implementation on environmental
safeguard aspects. A contractor rating on environmental performance should be attempted in
future projects to create an incentive for contractors.

6.3.2 Social Aspects: Non-completion of Land acquisition and resettlement operations before the
start of the civil works was a major issue in the implementation of the project resulting in the time
and cost overrun. Land Acquisition Plans should also include space for utility relocation, outlet
of drains, impact on access and safety due to cutting and filling to avoid small works such as
drains, restoration of access, installation of safety barriers etc. This aspect if delayed or left
unattended during design or construction stage would result in substantial dissatisfaction among
the roadside communities. Progress on land acquisition and establishment of RoW greatly
suffered due to high dependence on revenue department.

6.3.3 The introduction of the direct purchase method allowed the PAPs to participate in the
process of fixing land value and a fair chance to demand for due price for their asset loss. Hence,
only about three percent of the PAPs approached the court for enhancement of compensation.
Timely payment of assistances amounts and the distribution in installments ensured the
productive utilization of the assistance. Pooling of entitlements by individual vulnerable families
to enhance their purchasing power for larger parcel of land for resettlement and introduction of
low-cost technology for construction of houses was a good experience. PWD must manage its
own records for its RoW to avoid the current level of dependency on revenue department.

6.4     Effective and Efficient Project Management: Implementing agency’s project
management unit should be put in place including key personnel before mobilization of
contractor with due authority of decision making to manage the project. Staff stability including
at key project management levels should be ensured for smooth project implementation.

6.5      Contract Management Aspects: Sites for disposal of waste/surplus material satisfying
environmental criteria should be indicated at the early stage to allow proper pricing by the bidders.
It is encouraged to ensure that BoQ items relating to environmental management are included in
the bidding documents that properly reflect the value of the EMP compliance.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.     On the readiness of the project, the Bank team should advise the borrower more
definitively; such as, completion of detailed designs, pending land acquisition and resettlement
actions as in the case of this project.

(b) Cofinanciers
(c) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

A. Description of the Components of the Project that were evaluated for the Economic
Analysis.

1.     The project has two civil works components: (i) Widening and Strengthening, and (ii)
Major Maintenance of identified road corridors.

2.       Widening and Strengthening Component: At appraisal stage, a total length of 578 km
of corridors was envisaged to be taken up for widening and strengthening. The civil works
contracts were planned to be carried out in two phases, with an estimated cost of INR 9,173
million (US$191 million) [at 2001-2002 prices]. The expected implementation period was five
years. This component was revised, and by the time of completion, 254 km of roads had received
attention, for an investment of INR 5,295 million (US$110.3 million) [at 2010-11 prices], and a
project implementation period of nearly nine years.

Average cost per km (2010 US$        523 (adjusted by CPI)              430
thousands)
Implementation Period                       5 years                   9 years
Note: CPI denotes Consumer Price Index for India from World Development Indicators, The World Bank.

3.      Road Maintenance Component: At appraisal stage, a total length of 1,009 km of State
Highways was envisaged for road maintenance. These road works were to be phased over three
years from 2001 to 2004 as RMC-1, 2 and 3 respectively. The estimated cost was INR 2,822
million (US$58.2 million) [at 2001-2002 prices]. By large, this component was implemented as
envisaged baring addition of 156 km in the fourth year. At the time of completion, 1,156 km of
roads had received attention, for an investment of INR 5,795 million (US$120.7 million) [at
2010-11 prices] and a project implementation period of nearly nine years.

B. Economic Analysis at ICR stage

4.    An economic analysis was carried out at the ICR stage. The analysis has re-assessed the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and economic net present value (ENPV) of the
components of the project after they were completed. The approach used for estimating the
economic benefit for both upgrading and maintenance projects is similar to the one used at



                                                21
appraisal. The analysis framework is based on “IRC: SP 30:1993, Manual on Economic
Evaluation of Highway Projects in India?, along with the “Updated Road User Cost Data by the
Central Road Research Institute?, both 1992 and 2001. HDM4 (Version 1.3) is used for the
analysis in which all the project roads are considered separately.

5.      All costs and benefits considered in the analysis were in monetary terms expressed in
economic prices to avoid distortions in the input prices due to tax, grants, labor price etc.
Comparison between the total transport costs for the projects roads between ‘with project’ and
‘without project’ were done during the defined analysis period.

6.       To the extent possible, the same input variables4 used during the appraisal stage were
used for the present ICR stage adjusting forecasted values to actual values. Traffic data collected
on evaluation roads during the post-completion (2011) was compared to the Base Year (2000) to
arrive the actual growth rate achieved during the implementation period 2000-2011. These
achieved growth rates during 2000-2011 for different vehicle types were replaced in the projected
growth rates. Same elasticity based traffic growth rates used in project appraisal stage was used
for the remaining period for the analysis.

7.      Completed construction costs were discounted back to the base year (2000). Unit rates of
different maintenance activities used in Feasibility Analysis (2000) were used in the present
analysis. The maintenance strategy includes Seal Coat at 6th. and 18th. year; and periodic overlay
of 40 mm during 12th. year.

8.      For the ex-post economic evaluation, all the 254 km length of roads completed with
under the “strengthening and widening? component is considered. Of the 1,156 km length of
taken up for major maintenance, only 21 percent of the roads (237.9 km including 51 road
sections) were picked up on a sample basis representing all regions and different years of
maintenance program for post economic evaluation.

9.      Stratified sampling followed for maintenance roads selection for ICR evaluation was
guided by the following objectives: (i) Representation to all four maintenance strategy projects;
(ii) 20 percent as sample size in terms of both length and number of road sections; (iii)




4
   The key inputs and assumptions used in the analysis include: (i) For ‘upgrading roads’, a 25 years analysis period from 2000 (Base
year) is uded. For RMC roads, ten years operation period after the completion of the improvement and 2000 as ‘base year’ are
considered. All the observed data at post completion stage like construction cost etc were discounted back to 2000 level for uniformity
in the analysis at appraisal stage; (ii) Construction costs have been phased over the actual construction period, using actual
disbursement data.; (iii) Environmental and R&R costs were made available only as totals for each road. Therefore, they have been
allocated to the initial stage of construction; (iv) All costs and benefits are converted to 2000 prices to maintain a common datum for
analysis; (v) The pavement maintenance cost had been generated by the HDM Model. Periodic maintenance has been considered as:
Seal Coat at 6th and 18th year from the Base Year for ‘without project’ scenario and from operation start year for ‘with project’
scenario; and Periodic overlay of 40 mm at 12th year from the Base Year for ‘without project’ scenario and from operation start year
for ‘with project’ scenario; (vi) All financial costs have been converted to economic prices using a factor of 0.9; (vii) A discount rate
of 12 percent has been used for the analysis; (viii) Traffic level in the project completion year, for each corridor, has been taken after
comparing the data made available by the KSTP with the ones available with M/s Louis Berger, as part of earlier feasibility studies
(2000) for upgrading options and M/s LASA for maintenance options. For the period beyond 2011, the periodical growth rates
estimated for different vehicles during the feasibility analysis (2000) were adopted. Using this completion traffic of 2011 along with
the feasibility stage traffic (2000), the observed growth rate during the period 2000 – 2011 was estimated and the same was used to
perform the feasibility analysis in the same ‘PAD’ format; (ix) The same values as at appraisal were used for passenger time, and
goods time; and (x) All other inputs used at appraisal for estimating VOC and time value were used for the re-evaluation analysis.

Geographical distribution covering north, south, east and western regions of the State; (iv)
Representation to different surface conditions, i.e., good and fair; and (v) More focus to 1st. and
2nd. year projects than to 3rd. and 4th. year maintenance roads which were completed
comparatively later.

11.     As during appraisal, the benefit-cost ratios have been calculated for the road maintenance
component. This indicator has been calculated considering savings in vehicle operating costs and
the value of time saved. The results are shown in Table A3.5. These values are based on a 10
years operation period after completion of the improvement and using 2000 as the ‘base year.’

C. Comparison between Appraisal and ICR stage and Main Conclusions

12.     The ERR estimated at appraisal (ex-ante) are compared with those at ICR stage (ex-post).
The Table A3.6 shows results for the widening and strengthening component, and table A3.7
presents results for the road maintenance component.

13.    The widening and strengthening component: Due to the different versions of HDM
model used at appraisal and ICR stage and different approaches used in treating the AADT for




                                                24
    analysis (i.e. due to the limitations in the HDM3 used in appraisal stage, two wheelers and three
    wheelers were suitably converted into cars for analysis, slow moving vehicles could not be
    considered, etc), accurate comparison of vehicle traffic during both stages could not be made.
    However, even after discounting this factor, the traffic arrived for ICR stage was found to be
    more in most of the vehicle categories.

    14.     The economic returns on investment are on the higher side than those envisaged at
    appraisal, for most of roads. Only section “Taikkod-Kottarakara (Link 01)? and “Kottarakara –
    Adoor (Link 02)? have ERRs lower than the one forecasted at appraisal, but still are above the 12
    percent threshold.

    15.       Increased implementation period has been an adverse change in all the sections, ranging
    from a 104 percent increase to a 304 percent increase. On average project implementation period
    has taken three times the length originally planned. Cost has on average, remained as planned
    with an average decrease of five percent. Overcoming the implementation period overrun, return
    on investment was found to be increased for most of the road sections due to the increased traffic
    level; i.e. actual traffic level were much higher than the traffic forecasted at appraisal stage (with
    an average increase of 86 percent in the traffic growth rate). The weighted average ERR is 28
    percent at ICR stage, a two percent point increase with respect to the ERR calculated at appraisal
    (26 percent). The Table A3.7 shows the main factors contributing to the changes in ERR by road
    section.

      16.      Road Maintenance Component: The economic returns on investments measure by the
      “benefit-cost ratios’ are on the lower side than those envisaged at appraisal for most of the roads
      in the sample.

      17.      There are considerable adverse changes in the inputs considered for ICR stage analysis,
      particularly in increased cost (an average increase of 149 percent), and increased implementation
      period (an average increase of 84 percent). Overcoming all these negative parameters, traffic
      growth rate has been much higher that forecasted at appraisal stage (an average increase of 51
      percent). The weighted average of the return on investment measured by benefit-cost ratio was
      much higher at ICR stage (7.4) than at appraisal stage (5.3). The benefit-cost ratio was above one
      for all the road sections and it was found to be increased for two road sections (RMC4 and
      RMC10).

18.     Main Conclusions: The overall weighted average EIRR for the “widening and
strengthening? component is 28 percent at ICR stage, a two percent point increase with respect to
the ERR calculated at appraisal (26 percent). The weighted average of the return on investment
measured by benefit-cost ratio was much higher at ICR stage (7.4) than at appraisal stage (5.3).
The benefit-cost ratio was above one for all the road sections and it was found to be increased for
two road sections (RMC4 and RMC10).

19.     In the case of the widening and strengthening component, on average, the cost of the
component has decreased by five percent and the time overrun was of approximately 56 months,
which represents a 198 percent increased with respect to the time originally planned at appraisal.
The time overrun has impacted negatively in the economic rate of return; however, the marginal
decrease in the project cost along with the increase in traffic in the project roads (from a predicted
average growth rate of 8.5 percent on an average at appraisal to 15.4 percent on an average at ICR
stage) has counteracted favorably, keeping EIRR above 12 percent and, in most cases, above
forecasted values at appraisal.

20.      In the case of the road maintenance component, the benefit-cost ratio is lower for most of
the sections where information is available at appraisal. This can be explained by an increase in
the average capital cost (approximately a 149 percent increase) and time overrun (approximately
a 84 percent increase). Overcoming all these negative parameters, traffic growth rate has been
much higher than forecasted at appraisal stage (an average increase of 51 percent). The increase
in traffic volume is one of the main reasons the component has reached a weighted average
benefit-cost ratio higher than at appraisal.

1. There were three phases for Road User Satisfaction Survey (RUSS): RUSS 2003,
RUSS 2006 and RUSS 2010. RUSS 2003 was conducted at an earlier stage of KSTP, and
RUSS 2006 conducted midway through the project. RUSS 2010 was a conclusive survey
incorporating people's acceptance of the project for its socio-economical and
environmental viability. RUSS 2010 extended its survey sample to include secondary
road users. Relevant aspects related to road quality and engineering have been taken in to
account. RUSS 2010 shows better satisfaction levels on all aspects of road development.

Summary of Survey Findings
    (a) Dependency on Road
The survey findings show that drivers across the localities are heavily dependent on roads.
Communities in the urban area think that they are less dependent on roads while data of
the rural communities show comparatively increased dependency levels.

    (b) Overall improvement in Quality of life
A question was raised to gauge the improvement of certain elements of quality of life,
influenced by road development.

        Overall, satisfaction level is very positive. The rural population has benefitted
more from road development projects. Substantial benefits are there for both primary
(Drivers) and Secondary (Other Communities) road users. The increase in real estate
value is a predominant factor.

    (c) Environmental Impact of Road Development
According to all stake holders, adverse environmental effects were nominal or negligible
across all sectors. The rural sector shows comparatively increased concern over
environmental impact caused by road development.

    (d) Vehicle Operating Cost
Vehicle operating costs have decreased due to road development, despite the fact that
other external factors such as fuel price, cost of spare parts etc. have adversely affected
the vehicle operating cost. Compared to other two regions, south region shows a marked
decrease in this regard.

    (e) Travel safety on KSTP Roads
KSTP roads- both MDRs and SHs are relatively safe for travelling. The safety level in the
northern region is found to be comparatively lower.

Sector wise and group wise, the satisfaction level is more or less the same. Compared to
rural sector, the urban sector users find KSTP roads safer to travel.

   (f) Pedestrian facilities
The respondents’ opinion is that only a moderate improvement has been made on
pedestrian facilities.



                                            30
   (g) Pedestrian's facilities- Users Satisfaction level
The respondents expressed that only a moderate improvement has been made on
pedestrian facilities.

     (h) Reasons for Major Accidents
As urban and rural sectors show the same pattern as far as reasons for road accidents go,
it is inferred that inquiry into accidents and its remedial measures should be the same for
both sectors.

Road Quality, Road Geometry, Road Design.

    (i) Road Geometry
The findings indicate that the satisfaction level of users with respect of width of the road
is comparatively low on MDRs. The same is the case regarding encroachments on MDRs,
despite the fact that similar concerns were also by raised by users of SHs.

    (j) Road Quality
The findings show that users were not satisfied with condition of road shoulders and
drainage facilities. The pattern is similar on SHs and MDRs. Users of MDR roads in
northern region are dissatisfied with the recurring occurrence of potholes. Road surface
has got better satisfaction ratings.

    (k) Performance of KSTP
Performance of KSTP is found to be satisfactory. People from the south have approved
KSTP projects better than other regions. Communities are more satisfied with the project
compared to drivers. Overall satisfaction level is found to be fairly good.

Other relevant factors.

    (l) Use of roads for purposes other than Travel
A Majority of respondents wanted the authorities to ban all type of activities (i.e.:
political, religious, cultural, public, private functions, programs, etc. on roads) other than
travel on roads. Around one third of respondents were ready to allow some of the
activities. Only a very few respondents supported the use of roads for other activities, 8
percent abstained from commenting on the issue.

Cultural and educational programs are relatively permissible compared to activities like
public meetings and political show of strength.

   (m) Place of worship and traffic concerns
The opinions were nearly divided equally on the question whether traffic hassles are
caused by such structures.




                                             31
    (n) Satisfaction level on existing road / traffic conditions
Respondents were just about satisfied with the existing road and traffic conditions. The
findings from the south region indicate relatively better satisfaction levels.

    (o) Awareness level of PWD Helpline
Since the department did not give sufficient publicity for the PWD helpline and the
helpline numbers; the awareness level is very low, thus not fulfilling its objectives
satisfactorily.

    (p) Relevance of PWD Helpline
A vast majority of respondents endorsed that the PWD Helpline is a great initiative in
bridging the gap between public and the department.

    (q) Relevance of Road protection committees
The response in the survey was very positive. The respondents assert that with the
involvement of local communities in safeguarding roads and road furniture, damaging
and protection of roads by unauthorized persons/activities can be prevented at grass root
level.

   (r) Present procedures of land acquisition- Satisfaction level
The respondents are fairly satisfied with the current procedures followed by the KSTP.

   (s) Road funding options
Accepting international loans for road development is a favored option in road funding.

    (t) Alternative measures to solve traffic congestion in the future
In the urban area, both the classes of respondents more or less agree on the prioritization
of solutions the respondents from the rural sector have different perspectives in this
regard.

   (u) Aspirations on future roads
Respondents preferred flyovers, bypasses and special passages for heavy vehicles as the
most urgent measures to be brought in.

Comparative analysis of Previous surveys.

Road User Satisfaction Index (RUSI).
   (a) RUSI was not part of the scope of the project. However, the unique approach of
       RUSS 2010 developed a verifiable RUSI.
   (b) The index is evolved within the limitations of the available data; an attempt has
       been made to derive index factors.
   (c) The RUSI indicates that the road users, in general, are fairly satisfied with the
       road network in Kerala.

                 Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The Bank participated in a workshop organized by PWD/PIU inviting all implementing
agencies, contractors, consultants and NGOs who have been involved in the preparation
and implementation over the course of the life project. The objective of the workshop
was to provide an opportunity to the participants to express lessons learned from
successes and failures observed the life of the project. The following issues discussed are
summarized below:
   (a) DPR should be rechecked with the present site conditions before implementing to
       observe any problems and report with higher officials to solve the matter before
       awarding the work to the contractor.
   (b) Proposals for shifting utilities should be made based on proper surveys and
       consultations with the concerned departments and be part of the contract.
   (c) LA and utilities shifting should be well planned and coordinated and all pre-
       construction activities should be completed before award of work.
   (d) Joint verification with revenue personnel prior to finalization of LA plans.
   (e) Involvement of NGOs and sociologists at field and PMT level is a perquisite for
       bridging the gap between the PAPs and the project and management of R&R and
       other social issues to avoid major delays between project preparation and
       implementation.
   (f) Environmental Management Plan to be part of the contract in the BOQ.
   (g) Social, Forest, Environment, and LA clearances should be requested during the
       design phase and obtained before the implementation phase.
   (h) Indian Standards and codes of practice should be given priority particularly as
       they continue to improve and reflect the actualities of local conditions.
   (i) In the absence of legal axle weight enforcement enhanced factor of safety,
       stronger pavement in designs should be required for corridors with high volumes
       of industrial traffic.
   (j) Traffic diversions should be determined at the design stage not during
       construction.
   (k) Introduction of formal safety audits at the design stage is commensurate with
       international practices.
   (l) Close collaboration between Road safety cell and Police department.
   (m) Road Safety should be part of the contract.
   (n) Public consultation should be part in terms of realignment, and bypasses to
       incorporate their views on local requirements.
   (o) Introduce a clause to reinforce the engagement/replacement of key personal and if
       not fulfilled introduce a penalty for non compliance.
   (p) Define clearly the role of PCC in the contract.
   (q) The contract management cell should be created in PMT to attend to all matter
       related to disputes and to process to DRB and arbitration.
   (r) There should be independent and dedicated cell comprising of PWD officials
       monitor the project implementation.

Introduction 1
1.1 Background
Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) is one of the important and successful endeavors of
Government of Kerala (GOK) and Public Works Department (PWD) implemented with the
assistance of the World Bank (WB).

This major initiative towards improvement of State Highway network has achieved substantial
project completion by December 2010.

The reference to conceiving of this project goes back to 1998; by then GOK-PWD appreciated
the lower efficiency of major road network due to rapid growth in traffic levels coupled with
existing inadequate and deteriorating road infrastructure. To this respect the 'Strategic Options
Study' (SOS), was carried out in 1997 covering nearly 9000km of roads for prioritization.

This important study based on strategic parameters recommended a priority list of road corridors
for further techno economic feasibility study and then Detailed Engineering.

The PCC services under KSTP commenced in the year 1999 wherein 2810 km of roads

The studies were funded by the Bank in the form of TA Loan (4114 IN) of US$4.00 M. Detailed
Design and Contract preparation of the project was carried out from 2000-2001. The project was
appraised by the bank in Nov, 2001 with the project cost to the tune of US$336M followed by
negotiations in May,2002 which resulted in with loan (IBRD Loan No 4653 IN)assistance from
the bank to the tune of US$255 million, with a Loan Repayment Period of 20 years including a
Moratorium Period of 5 years. The loan negotiation took place in February 2002, and the Board
approval obtained in Mar 2002 followed by Signing of the Agreement in April 2002 Project
Implementation was initially from 2002-2007, but was extended by two years and subsequently
by further one year to 31st. December 2010.

After implementation of the KSTP; WB desires, as part of its mandatory requirements, to prepare
project implementation completion and results report (ICR), which would state the success

and/or failure of the project implementation as well as lessons learned and opportunities for
applying such lessons in similar projects in future. One of the components of ICR is Borrower's
Own evaluation of the project. This is to present borrower's own assessment of performance of
key players, outcome of the project, lessons learnt and suggestions for WB and/or for future
project of such magnitude.

The PCC services under KSTP commenced in the year 1999 wherein 2810 km of roads

period most of the expansion
                                Approval
in the State road network
had occurred on the low capacity village road (VR) network while state motor vehicle registration
had increased by about 10.69 percent per year and traffic also by the same rate.
The draft road policy recognized the needs due to rapid growing traffic levels and the existing
inadequate and deteriorating road infrastructure conditions. As a result the GOK had sought WB
assistance in improving both the capacity and quality of its core State road network. As a first
step the State had in the past a National Highway (NH) four-lane Project implemented through
ADB funding. Hence focus on capacity and structural improvement to the State Highway network
was more than essential then (1997-2000).

To address the Road Development Plan GOK had framed State Road Policy, which was
consistent with WB's strategy as defined in "India Transport Sector - Long Term Issues Report
(1995)".
With this background broad focus areas identified to be the part of the project were:
    1. Strengthening institutional capacity of PWD
    2. Reduction of Periodic Maintenance backlog
    3. Increase in Maintenance Funds in real terms
    4. Improving capacity and quality of State road network Based on above focus areas,
        mutually PWD and WB had framed objectives for KSTP at Project Appraisal Stage.
        Accordingly key performance indicators were also finalized as reported in PAD.

1.3 The project comprises of four components
        1. Corridor improvements
           a. Upgrading 600km of priority State Highways
           b. Rehabilitation of 100km IWT canals

        2. Periodic maintenance program for about 1000km State HIgways
        3. Road Safety Engineering Program
        4. Institutional Strengthening of PWD, ID and TA to prepare follow up studies and
           implementation of State Road Safety Action Plan

Development Objectives.
The project’s principal development objectives are to improve traffic flow and road safety on
Kerala State’s primary road network and to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of
Kerala’s key transport sector agencies. The project will support the above development objectives
by: (a) improving the capacity and quality of highly congested State Highways and major district
roads; (b) improving road maintenance planning and management practices; (c) reducing
accidents on major roads; (d) piloting an inland water transport (IWT) improvement component
for selected canals: and (e) strengthening the technical, financial and management capacities of
the Kerala Public Works Department (PWD) and the Kerala Irrigation Department (ID).

1.3.1 Restructuring of project in 2008. The upgrading component was originally structured to be
taken up in two phases, 254.7km of SH and 93km of IWT Canals in Phase I and 324.2km in
Phase II. The bids for Phase II packages were received in KSTP and the Bank had cleared the
bids for award of works in one package in 2005-06. Mean while the contractors for the then
ongoing KSTP I and IV had terminated the contracts due to non payments of bills. There was
delay in LA and related problems in the Progress of works including shore protection and
dredging canals in IWT component. More over the balance uncommitted fund was not sufficient
to take up the Phase II works so as to complete before the extended loan period of December
2009.Placed in such a situation the Bank had advised the GOK not to go in for the Phase II
implementation. In view of this, the State Govt. in consultation with the Bank had decided to
delink Phase II from the KSTP and take up as a standalone project in June 2008. Hence it
was necessitated to re-structure the project. The restructured project consists of

Component 1 (a) Upgradaing of about 254.70 km of SHs Design

2. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RE EVALUATION
2.1 Component wise details
The objectives and benefits have been substantially achieved through the following six
components of the project:

Component 1(a) - Upgrading: Total length of 254.70 km of core network has been completed in
one phase (Phase I). In all three contract packages covered this upgrading length of 254.70 km,
which was supervised by international consultants. Regular meetings by PMT/PWD with all
concerned agencies and rating of construction changes during implementation has yielded good
results. Also ESMU and consultants imparted training to implementing agencies and their staff on
job. The roads are constructed to a high standard and attain travel time reduction and also
achieved good riding quality which is comparable to standard International Roughness Index
(IRI) of less than 4 m/km. Consequently, travel speeds have increased close to 40 percent. The
new roads are inherently safer than before. Higher speeds may have an effect on accident cause
and severity but not due to geometric deficiency. Surveys of road users and stakeholders,
especially those located adjacent to the new roads, have revealed only satisfaction of the obvious
advantages that the improved roads have provided in terms of riding comfort, speed and
aesthetics. Clearly the commercial, social and environmental benefits are significant and reflect



                                                 37
Kerala’s development goals. Although the design of the project roads was carried out earlier
under a separate TA loan (Ln 4114-IN) by the PCC, their services were continued through the
construction phase. The PCC services primarily included; developing financial management
system, contract document preparation, procurement issues, and construction monitoring,
training, quality assurance appraisal, design changes and contract management advice to the
PWD project director and Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PCC also supported the ESMU
for the implementation of the RAP. Two international consultants were employed to supervise the
upgrading works for the three highways contract packages and one IWT packages.

Component 1(b) - The Inland Water Transport Component. Envisages the rehabilitation of
three feeder canals supplementing the National Water Ways. The GOK has intentions to expand
the IWT sector as a means to relieve pressure on the road net work in the State and the
improvement of these canals was taken up as pilot project for the revival of the defunct IWT net
work in the State. Due to delay in acquiring marginal land for constructing bank protective walls
and bridge approaches and due to failure of the contractor, the scope of the project was
necessitated to be limited to construction of terminal buildings, jetties, foot over bridges and
approaches to bridges.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement and Rehabilitation: In association with Component 1
Land Acquisition and R&R was carried out successfully and in line with the WB's safeguard
policies. Implementation of the R&R was carried out under separate Resettlement Action Plans
(RAP) for each of the Phases. The PWD, as part of its institutional arrangements, established the
Social Environmental Management Unit (E&SM), which was responsible for implementing the
RAPs with the assistance of NGOs; procured specifically for the purpose. The Project-Affected-
Persons and families (PAPs) were for the most part satisfied with the RAP implementation and
associated compensation and training provided. During the RAP process a grievance redressal
committee was established to hear and adjudicate grievances. The land acquisition process took a
time, longer than expected, but was completely successful. However in a few locations the
engineering design had to be adjusted due to problems in acquisition. PWD made extraordinary
efforts and applied new methods like direct purchase through negotiation to speed up land
acquisition. However due to non-commensurate actions of revenue department and a few other
departments of GOK related to utility shifting that there were delays in handing over land to
commence the civil works in certain sections of the project roads.

Component 2 - Periodic Maintenance of SHs: Length of 1156 km of core network was
successfully completed under four successive road maintenance programs (RMC-1st to 4th year).
The initial intention was for three years maintenance program for about 1000 to 1009 km road
length but the fourth year maintenance component of about 156 km was added to achieve project
objective for periodic maintenance. The works were implemented by local contractors supervised
by the PWD with technical assistance from consultants who also carried out the project
preparation for RMC-1st year. The year II, III and IV documents were prepared by the PMT of
KSTP. The roads are constructed to a high standard and attain considerable travel time reduction.
The typical roughness before the project of 6.0 to 10.0 mkm (IRI) has been reduced to 2.5 to 4.0
m/km (IRI) for the newly maintained roads. Consequently travel speeds have increased close to
40 percent. Surveys of road users and stakeholders, especially those located adjacent to the new
roads, have revealed satisfaction of the obvious advantages that the smoother roads have provided
in terms of riding comfort, speed and aesthetics.

Component 3 – Road Safety Engineering: Improvement 37 accident black spots have lowered
the accident rate by 30 percent in the improved black spots. The KSTP also had taken up projects
on developing model safe roads under this component.



                                               38
Component 4 - Institutional Strengthening, This component was to fund consultant services
for implementing the IDS developed institutional strengthening action plans designed to
strengthen the PWD's capabilities in managing the road network. An international consultant was
employed to support the PWD in achieving the objectives of the Institutional Strengthening
Action Plan. The consultant's role was mainly; (i) to advise the Chief Engineer’s committee on
policy and planning and management to road construction program (ii) to strengthen quality
management in design and construction and (iii) to develop a Road Maintenance Management
System (RMMS) and GIS. These three activities have successfully been completed with tangible
outputs, mainly; setting up of dedicated units in PWD such as Project Preparation Unit (PPU),
Environmental and Social Unit (E&SM), Road Safety, Human Resources and IT Unit. The
training needs envisaged under the Project were to focus on the planning and management of the
State road network with particular emphasis in the areas of procurement, construction and
maintenance management of the existing network. Along with procurement of modern
equipments for PWD office and for modernization and road management systems, this
component also included the development of Finance Management System which was rolled out
for main stream accounting functions in the PWD. Another achievement was the revision of
outdated PWD Manual. In the revised manual new chapters on social safeguards and
environmental management, the newly developed IT System management and quality
management in construction have been included. The functions of newly formed cells in PWD
including staffing arrangements have also been incorporated in the manual to ensure
sustainability. Though the revision of manual was completed, in the dissemination process, a few
comments and suggestions were received from the stake holders including at the Government
level, the contractor’s and Engineer’s association and public. The main suggestions were about
inadequate restructuring of PWD functions which was one of the key targets in the ISAP. The
other suggestion was on the tendering chapter including PPP provisions. Since government
intends to process the Manuel to the legislature to replace the PWD code, it is necessary to have a
relook on the relevant provisions, which is under way. The achievement of this objective is
satisfactory as a whole. The RMMS was developed for streamlining the PWD maintenance
activities, planning and fund allocations. Developed Quality Management Manuals introducing
best practices in implementation of projects in PWD. The Road Safety Action Plan was
implemented through an internationally experienced consultant with emphasis on co-oridination
and management, publicity, road planning and design, road safety education, traffic legislation
enforcement, driver training and testing, vehicle safety standards emergency aid purchase of
equipments and black spot identification and improvement program. The State has formed a Road
Safety Authority with sufficient funding arrangements for managing road safety programmes
effectively on sustainable bases. The authorities establishment has been strengthen to take up road
safety programmes in a big way. The Road Safety Cell created in by PWD as part of the ISAP is
supporting the activities of the KRSA in close co-ordination. Due to effective implementation of
RSAP there was significant reduction in accident rate (10 percent) in the State. A new generation
Road Fund and Board has been constituted as part of the ISAP, implementation which is funding
for maintenance and new projects under Public Private Partnership arrangement at
Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode cities. The public information cell set up in PWD as part of
the ISAP, has enabled the PWD to function as people friendly road manager with the introduction
of toll free numbers for grievance redressal.

As part of ISAP a Strategic Options Study for prioritizing SHs for upgrading/maintenance was
completed. This paves the way for a subsequent programme of investment for widening and
strengthening and maintenance works for up to a further 1200 km of the core road network. These
road sections have been proposed for further studies for various projects.

Impact of Institutional Development on Social and Environmental Management
     Continued existence of the Environmental Cell in the PMT throughout the project period.
     Formation of the Environmental and Social Management Cell in the PWD.
     Chapter on Environmental Management and social development in the new PWD
         Manual, which when legislated would pave way for sustainable procedures and practices
         in PWD.
     Enhanced capacity of PWD Engineers on environmental management through training
     Building the awareness of Kerala – based road contractors on environmental
         management, particularly through the KSTP road maintenance programmes.
     Reduced dust pollution due to improved road surface conditions
     Survival of trees planted under the compensatory Tree Plantation programme.
Sustainability of the ISAP initiated systems The State Govt. has provided sufficient allocations
of funds for sustainability of IT Systems developed through the ISAP for the fiscal 2011-2012 in
the State Budget.

2.2 Delay and other concurrent problems faced
2.2.1 Reasons for Delays
Even though the project could be successfully completed, it was delayed for about three years:
The main reasons for the delays were:
1. Time required for land acquisition was not adequately considered with respect to award of the
    civil works.
2. There was delay in handing over encumbrance free land for unhindered progress of work. The
    fast track arrangements for land take over did not work as fast as anticipated, due to
    departmental delay (Revenue). Moreover the social impact of LA was more than 10 times
    that of any other projects of this nature in India due to density of population and ribbon-type
    development along the road and R&R was intense even in rural areas.
3. LA plans did not account for road levels and utility relocation
4. Some delay has occurred due to presence numerous underground services in the urban areas
   which were not identified at the project preparation stage. This was compounded by lack of
   cooperation by services owners and local residents.
5 Higher number of disputes on contractual issues and delays in decision making has also
   resulted in delay.
6 Unprecedented rains in 2006 and 2007.
7 Complaints of local public on dumping of debris in to their properties by the contractors
   during construction and lack of proper access to the residence where cutting and filling was
   involved.

2.2.2   Problems Faced
   i.   Continuous rainy season:
           (a) Short working period due to prolonged monsoon season.
           (b) Shortage of construction materials during rainy season and
           (c) Closing of water courses at exit point of CDs cross drainages by local land owners.
  ii.   The High intensity of traffic during construction was a hurdle in overall progress of the
        work, especially for the sections where traffic was heavy and/or urban/town sections.
        [Refer suggestion 4.2.1 (vi)]
 iii.   Strengthening and widening to 7 m wide pavement was envisaged under this project,
        therefore construction activities in specified sections had to be restricted on half the width
        of Carriageway and the remaining half CW was left open for movement of the regular
        traffic. On High volume traffic corridors Management of traffic on half width of
        carriageway had posed a big problem especially on sections where overlay of wet mix



                                                 40
        macadam was provided. The WMM surface is prone to disintegration if the traffic moves
        on freshly laid surface without bituminous paving layer. Despite having all traffic
        management measures in place it was awfully difficult to control the movement of traffic
        on WMM surface during night hours, which caused disintegration and damages to WMM
        surfaces. [Refer suggestion 4.2.1 (vi)]
 iv.    Contractor's susceptibility to compromise on quality of work. [Refer suggestion 4.2. 1
        (v)]
  v.    Lack of accountability and ownership sense from CSC. [Refer suggestion 4.2.4 (vi)]
 vi.    Contractors failure to mobilize required resources as per work programme. [Refer
        suggestion 4.2.4 (vi)]
vii.    In town areas, problems were encountered due to presence of unknown underground
        utilities. Identification and relocation of unknown underground utilities during the
        construction have been one of the problems. [Refer suggestion 4.2.(iv)]
viii.   Problem in construction did arise because of lack of effective inter departmental
        coordination, such as Revenue, KWA forest and other agencies. [Refer suggestion
        4.2.1(iv)]
 ix.    Heavy vehicular traffic on urban and rural link of the corridors. [Refer suggestion 4.2.1
        (vi)]
  x.    Unauthorized closing to exit points of CDs by the adjacent land owners. [Refer
        suggestion 4.2.1 (x)
 xi.    Tendency of contractors to resort to Arbitration on minor issues. [Refer suggestion 4.2.1
        (ix)
xii.    Steep rise in prices of bitumen and fuel during project implementation period had upset
        the contractor's financial planning.

2.3 Economic Re-evaluation upon completion
At completion, economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Upgrade Roads are found to be
between 17.6 percent (Kottarakara – Adoor - Link 02) and 43.3 percent (Angamali –
Muvattupuzha - Link 06). Among the 9 sections, only two sections (Thaikod-Kottarakara – Link
01 and Kottarakara – Adoor – link 02) are found to be with reduced EIRR than the feasibility
results obtained during the appraisal stage.

For Major Maintenance Roads, only two sections are found to be with improved Benefit – Cost
Ratio when compared with the results at appraisal stage, though all are with positive results with
more than one. Annexure 3 shows detailed comparative results of Cost Benefit Analysis of the
Kerala State Highway Project at completion with the appraisal stage.

There are considerable adverse changes in the inputs considered for ICR stage re-evaluation
analysis, particularly in increased cost, and increased implementation period. Overcoming all
these negative parameters, return on investment was found to be increased for most of the road
sections due to the increased traffic level; i.e. actual traffic level were much higher than the traffic
forecasted at appraisal stage.

3. ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTED PROJECT
3.1 By Borrower (GOK)
   i.  Being the first project of its kind and unique socio-economic environment of the State.
       PWD provides internal rating to the project as satisfactory after the restructuring. This
       statement gets support of user satisfaction surveys, economic re-evaluation after
       implementation completion and enhanced skills-capabilities of PWD staff along with
       contractors.




                                                  41
  ii.   The PWD officers were actively involved in the corridor readiness activities, local liaison,
        monitoring of the works, environmental/social issues and gained indirect experience of
        the duties of the Engineer and contract administration under FIDIC conditions. This will
        be of great utility for other projects of such magnitude.
 iii.   The evaluation and pre-qualification and award of contracts were prompt.
 iv.    During project execution the Divisional Offices were actively involved, somewhere
        directly (especially in RMC works and implementation of EMP and RAP) somewhere
        indirectly.
  v.    Overall contribution from ESMU had been excellent. Implementation of RAP, regular
        site visits, interactions with contractors and consultants, imparting training to their staff
        on job as well as in PMT and taking contractual actions of retaining payment, not
        releasing dues to contractors have greatly helped in successful implementation of EMP
        and ESMP.
 vi.    The KSTP resorted to direct purchase of land from the PAP/ families through negotiation
        involving active participation of land-owners groups. This is in compliance of R&R
        policy compatible with OD 3.40of the World Bank. This process is faster than the LA
        process under LA Act (1894) and there are no further liabilities on the part of the Govt. or
        PAPs.
vii.    The department has done satisfactorily on human resources front by setting up of
        dedicated HRD unit in the Chief Engineer Administration Office and related
        development objectives.
viii.   PWD's staff was trained and enhanced technical skills through KSTP and has
        demonstrated skill transfer in many ways. To quote (1) training sessions were conducted
        by Environmental, Social Road Safety Cell and IT Cell to other PWD Engineers.
 ix.    A tree planting strategy was worked out and trees were planted on all project roads.
  x.    Auditors are normally not aware of FIDIC contract conditions, roles and responsibilities
        etc. and are increasing work load for department by raising number of not required
        queries.
 xi.    The Banks support missions were of a generally high standard and beneficial to the
        project. The Bank's rigorous mission, touching the minute details had helped in
        successful completion of civil works, financial monitoring, quality control,
        implementation of EMP and R&R, though it sometimes felt tedious to the implementing
        agency. The comments and suggestions in Aide Memoire had helped in solving the
        problems with other line departments of GOK.
xii.    A frequent staff changes amongst the consultants and PMT Revenue department and
        NGOs was an issue, which constantly arose during the project duration. Replacements of
        consultants were not found same caliber of the original staff and on many occasion it has
        been observed that the personnel employed by the consultant are always project specific
        and not belonging to the regular establishment of the consultant. Such project specific
        personnel lacks allegiance towards work, therefore the quality of work suffers.
xiii.   Though the Environmental Guidelines and R&R framework prepared by PMT has
        received open appreciation from Bank and other government agencies the contractors
        have a tendency to attach less importance on implementing the EMP and ESMP in the
        true spirit.
xiv.    Audit objections were raised many issues by Auditor General's office. Many of the
        objectives were raised as the audit staffs were not used to audit such works under FIDIC
        condition. However these were later on dropped by the Account General. Except for a
        few cases, Audit Certificates were received within time.
 xv.    In all, the project has been completed and received good appreciation from all spheres.
        The able assistance from WB, contribution from PMT-PWD [with lean staffing structure]
        along with consultants and contractors made it possible to provide quality infrastructure.



                                                42
         The targeted benefits to the community are getting realized and will continue to accrue in
         years to come.
 xvi.    This project has set number of standards on various aspects; to be particular about
         reducing claims and disputes though were many cases referred. The facts and figures in
         respect of claiming are:
                                                    DRB        Arbitration Court of Law
      Total Number of Cases Referred                 39             35             12+3
      Number of Cases in Favour of GOK                1              6              2+7
      Number of Cases in Favour of Contractor        38             29               2
      Number of cases in progress                    Nil            12             10+3
xvii.    Though the KSTP had limited previous experience in handling disputes, such good
         experience and exposure have made department more confident to take on with similar
         projects in near future.

4. Lessons learned and suggestions
4.1 Lessons Learned
 i. Avoid major delays between Project Preparation and Implementation: Due to this there
       could be major variation at the implementation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and
       quantities, mainly in earth work.
ii Involvement of NGOs and sociologists at field and PMT level is a prerequisite for bridging
      the gap between the PAPs and the project and in effective management of R&R and other
      social issues.
iii. Requirement of adequate diversion width and temporary acquisition: Temporary land
      acquisition for traffic diversions where insufficient space exists within the ROW was one of
      the major problems.
iv. Environmental Management to be part of project BoQ: Environment Management is an
      aspect of the contract which is very difficult to control with widespread abuses by the
      contractor, ruled simply by cost versus profit. The majority of bidders will not make
      sufficient allowance in their price and do their best to avoid or minimize their expenditure on
      EMP compliance after contract award.
v. Need for Safety Audits: Safety audits were felt inadequate at the completion stage.
vi. Define Substantial Completion of the project: The basic requirements to satisfy
      substantial completion are not clearly defined in the documents.
vii. Actual Deployment of Contractor's Key Staff: Contractor's key personnel named in the
     schedule or approved replacement candidates are sometimes not available at works site
     during normal working hours. Sometimes contractor's foreman or junior technical personnel
     manage the day to day construction activities at site. This has adverse impact on the quality of
     work.
viii. Define Role of Project Consultants appropriately: Neither in contract for civil works nor
     in construction supervision contracts the role and mandate of Project Coordinating Consultant
     has been clearly defined.
ix. CSC time lines beyond project completion: Normally reference for arbitration is made after
     completion of work and by that time the CSC has already demobilized his establishment from
     project office, therefore the entire onus of defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on
     the Employer. Though such decision was taken independently by the CSC without making
     any reference to the Employer, but still the Employer who is ignorant about the matter is
     required to defend the same before the arbitrator. Absence of a contract specialist in the Team
     of CSC resulted in increase of disputes.
x. Power of Attorney: The role and mandate of Power Attorney holder is not clearly defined in
     the bid document as a result of this many times the power of attorney plays the full role of




                                                 43
     contractor or sub contractor and this adversely affects the work as this is power without
     responsibility.
xi The contract management cell should be created in PMT to attend to all matter related to
disputes and to process to DRB and arbitration.
xii. General
   Upfront training of the PMT engineers and contractors were useful in ensuring EMP
       compliance.
   Difficulties in administering EMP measures with the contractor through the provisions in
       the FIDIC contracts.
   Importance of careful drainage planning as improper drainage leads to the destruction of
       the road surface.
   Difficulties in obtaining leveled land for establishing campsites.
   Non availability of road side land (oxbows) for enhancement measures as the same land is
       used for temporary storage of debris/ earth material.

4.2 Suggestions
From the lessons learned and experiences from the project some of the suggestions brought out
into the notice are given below.

4.2.1 Suggestions for Improving Project Preparation:
i. Time gap between the completion of project preparation and commencement of
      implementation preferably should not be more than 6 to 9 months.
ii. Effective and vigorous Public Consultation should be conducted on Proposals regarding
      realignment, and bypasses to incorporate their views and local requirements.
iii. Proposals for shifting of utilities coming in the right of way should be made based on proper
      surveys and consultations with the concerned departments and be made part of contract.
iv. The work of land acquisition and shifting of utilities should be well planned and
      coordinated. All pre-construction activities should be completed before award of work.
      1) Land plans to include requirement of land for utility relocation.
      2) Loss of access to properties adjacent to the road should also be considered during impact
           assessment.
v. There should be independent and dedicated cell comprising of PWD officials to have a
      control for smooth flow of onsite works with a system of daily appraisal of activities from
      the field, coupled with weekly or fortnight meeting of the coordination committee for Land
      Acquisition.
vi. Temporary land acquisition for traffic diversions should be identified as far as possible and
      resolved at the design stage in such cases where insufficient space exists within the ROW.
vii. Sites for Disposal of waste/surplus material satisfying environmental criteria should be
      identified and indicated at the DPR stage to allow proper pricing by the bidders and the
      contractor to locate proper sites during execution of work disposal.
viii. It is proposed to ensure that BoQ items are put into the bidding documents that properly
      reflect the value of the EMP compliance.
ix Avoid frequent transfers.
x. The provisions in Highway Protection Act 1999 should be strictly enforced.

Design and DPR Stage
i. Whilst international standards were extensively used, it is ultimately preferable that
    wherever available Indian standards and codes of practice are given priority particularly as
    they continue to improve and reflect the actualities of local conditions.




                                               44
ii.    In the absence of legal axle weight enforcement enhanced factor of safety for, stronger
       pavement in designs will be required for corridors carrying high or even moderate volumes
       of industrial traffic.
iii.   Where traffic diversions are required, the practicability of constructing diversions should be
       determined at the design stage not during construction.
iv.    Introduction of formal safety audits at the design stage is commensurate with international
       practice for subsequent projects.
v      While preparing longitudinal profile plan adequate care should be taken to avoid
       environmental impacts due to cutting and filling.
vi     Joint verification with revenue personnel prior to finalization of LA plans.
vii    Marking of the RoW.

4.2.2 Suggestions for Improving the Bidding and Contract Document:
4.2.2.1 Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
i. A Condition may be incorporated in prequalification document and ITB stating that the
     unofficial sub contracting of work either in part or whole is prohibited. Further a condition to
     this effect should also be included in COPA or GCC whereby if during execution it is
     discovered that a contractor had indulged in practice of unofficial sub contracting, he would
     be summarily disqualified for future tendering in the WB financed projects.
ii. Joint Venture partners who abscond from their responsibilities should be subject to punitive
     action. A condition in ITB and COPA/GCC should be incorporated stating that the JV
     partners would be considered as one entity and would respond to the needs of the contract as
     and when required. Responsibilities of JV partners should be clearly defined.
iii. About checking and verification of Financial Statements of Joint Ventures, the contractual
     power should be given to Employer to perform this task, when even contract is in force; the
     details like existence of JV, its Financial Statement and JV as one entity's project related
     documents.
iv. The format of Bank Guarantee should be in accordance with RBI Directives.
v. It is suggested that submission of a bid modification through separate letter should be strictly
     prohibited.
vi. A specific time limit for clarification process should be incorporated in the ITB within which
     a bidder fails to provide the required information, his bid should be considered non
     responsive.
vii. Position of Planning Engineer and Chief Quantity Surveyor should be included in the list of
     Contractor's key personnel. All key personnel should be employee of the main contractor.

4.2.2.2 Conditions of Contract
i. It is suggested that instead of full release of the BG that it is extended for an agreed "full
     completion" period for a reduced amount to cover the value of the outstanding works.
ii. The basic requirements to satisfy substantial completion should be defined in the documents.
iii. The submission of as-built drawings (COPA clause 6.6) should not be linked to the issue of
     the Taking- over certificate. It would be better to revise the wording of the clause to give a
     specific time limit,
iv. It is suggested that the performance Bank Guarantee should be from a Bank specified by the
     employer.
v. The power of attorney clause should be deleted from the GCC.

International Competitive Bidding
  vi. Under FIDIC conditions of contract and COPA, time limit is not prescribed for rectification
      of defects noted or identified during defect liability period. According to the Clause 49.4 in
      case of default at the part of the contractor in carrying out such instructions within a



                                                  45
       reasonable time the employer will rectify the defect at the risk and cost of the contractor.
       The reasonable time is very vague term. Because of this deficiency in contract conditions,
       the contractors often avoid timely rectification of defects causing inconvenience to the
       public. To avert such situation it is suggested to include the following provision in COPA.
       Every time notice of a defect is given, the contractor shall correct the notified defect within
       the length of time specified by the Engineer's notice.
vii. A definite time limit should be prescribed from the date of serving of notice to adjudicate the
     disputed matter to DRB/Adjudicator by any party to the actual date of making reference for
     adjudication.

    National Competitive Bidding
viii. A condition should be included in GCC (NCB) which should mean as under: "The contractor
      will deploy at site only those key personnel who are approved by the 'Engineer'. Non
      deployment of approved key personnel at work site would attract penalty as stated in contract
      data.
ix. The Employer should be empowered to make recovery of a specified amount per person per
       month if the approved key personnel remains absent from the works site without valid
       reasons exceeding a period of 7 days in a month
x.     According to Clause 38 the Engineer will adjust the rate of an item if its final quantity
       differs from the quantity stated in BOQ by more than 25 percent provided the change
       exceeds 1 percent of initial contract price. In order to adjust the rate the Engineer may ask
       the contractor for detailed cost break down of any item in the BOQ. Clear cut mechanism
       for adjusting the rate should be incorporated in the contract. Moreover the limit of change
       exceeds 1 percent is on lower end especially for maintenance nature of contract. It should
       be increased to 5 percent for Road maintenance contracts.
xi. If the contractor's quotation is unreasonable for variation item, the Engineer will make his
      own forecast of the effects of the variation on contractor's costs. Mechanism to forecast the
      effects on contractor's cost should be included in the contract.
xii. According to Clause 47 Price Adjustment in 18 months contract time escalation is not
       allowed. Escalation should be applicable for government controlled items even for small
       contract.

4.2.3 Suggestions for Improving Project Coordinating Consultant's Services
i. Performance of design consultants/PCC should be monitored. The TOR/Agreement should
     incorporate suitable clauses for: (i) Quality assurance on Detailed Engineering designs
     included in DPR; (ii)Quality audit and safety audit on detailed engineering design carried out
     by the design consultant (ii)Responsibility for accuracy of design with economy/aesthetics;
     (iii) Disincentives and deterrent action for deficiency in designs and consultancy services; (iv)
     Performance appraisal report.
ii. In contract for civil works and in construction supervision contracts the role and mandate of
     Project Coordinating Consultant needs to be defined clearly.
iii. It may be desirable that the PCC is retained as the Supervision Consultant also. This will
     enable quick decision, early processing of design changes and ensure reduction in variations.
   4.2.4 Suggestions for Improving Supervision Consultant's services
i. The make-up of staff with strong international experience and local staff should be more
    balanced if international consultants are to be employed otherwise the benefit of employing an
    international consultant is diminished.
ii. Replacement staff must be equal in caliber to the outgoing incumbent and in place in a timely
      fashion. Such replaced person should be inducted only after approval by the client. The
      remuneration should be reduced to 90 percent for such replacement each time.




                                                 46
iii. Procedure for monitoring the performance of CSC should be evolved and incorporated in the
     TOR of CSC.
iv. It is suggested that consultant's personnel posted on site supervision works should belong to
     the regular establishment of the consulting firm.
v. The entire onus of defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on the Employer. It is
     suggested that the CSC should be made responsible to provide his input until the arbitration
     process is over. A condition to this effect should be included in the terms reference of CSC
     services. The contract empowers CSC to take decision in respect of many aspects of
     exclusions without employer's concurrence. If any dispute arises, act of such decisions taken
     by engineer, onus of defending such disputes should entirely be on the CSC. If any extra
     payment results from disputes, CSC should be made to pay the same in such cases.
vi. Accountability and liabilities of CSC and PCC have not been clearly laid out in the TOR of
     services. The TOR should include this aspect also.

4.2.5 Suggestions for Borrower's Effectiveness
i. It would help in future works contracts to specify the role of the Divisional Offices and the
     limits of authority as delegated by the Chief Engineer/ Project Director. In other words the
     Employer's representatives and their respective authority should be clearly defined.
ii. At the time of negotiations itself with Bank, the structure for PMT should be finalized along
     with importantly, the line departments of GOK and their roles and responsibilities at different
     stages.
iii. Engineer's powers stated in the contract document should prevail the delegated powers.
iv. Government Auditors are not exposed with FIDIC contract conditions, before start of the
     project implementation; training shall be imparted to group of Auditors.

4.2.6 Suggestions to Bank
i. Bank may consider limiting arbitration provisions only to NCB contracts.

5. WAY FORWARD.

With successful implementation of over 1,410 km of State highways, the focus will be on proper
management of the assets created. The RMMS developed and established in PWD shall be
effectively put to use for planning and allocation of funds for maintenance. The project
Preparation Unit established in the PWD should take up new project preparation preferably under
PPP or Annuity arrangement. Performance based maintenance contract system should be adopted.
The State PWD has prepared a project on upgrading the road sections included in Phase II along
with maintenance roads identified in the supplementary Strategic Option Study and widening and
strengthening bridges, road safety engineering and decongesting busy towns. Provisions has been
made on formulating and implementing short term, midterm and long term plans on road safety in
the Phase II proposals. This project shall be considered for implementing with external funding.
Social management programmes are required in the case of KSTP II Implementation.
    ? continue the Grievance Redressal Committees at district level and engage sociologists at
        division level to bridge the gap between the project and the PAPs and communities and
        implement mitigation measures
    ? Impact on access to properties to be treated as PAPs
    ? Public consultation prior to starting civil works to mobilize public support at every stage
        including utility shifting
    ? There shall be project kept ready with land acquisition completed before moving for
        external funding.
