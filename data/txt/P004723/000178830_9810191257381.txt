THAILAND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND (TOT)
FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      Three entities under the Ministry of Communications, namely the
Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), the Communications Authority of
Thailand (CAT), and the Posts and Telegraphs Department (PTD), are
responsible for Thailand's public telecommunications and postal services.
TOT and CAT are wholly state-owned autonomous corporations, each managed by a
Board of Directors appointed by Government, the Chairmen being answerable to
the Minister of Communications.  PTD is a government department under the
Under Secretary, Communications.
1.02      TOT operates (a) the domestic local and long distance public
telephone service, which accounts for the bulk of the sector's current assets
and planned investment; (b) international telephone service to several
neighboring countries (mainly Malaysia and Laos); and (c) leased circuits for
domestic point to point transmission of voice, telegraph, radio and
television, and will, in future, develop other domestic services essentialLy
based on the use of the telephone network (low speed data, facsimile and
telephoto). CAT operates (a) postal service, (b) the public international
telephone service interconnected with TOT (except to neighboring countries),
(c) domestic and international public telegraph and telex services; (d)
interinational leased circuits, (e) domestic radiotelephone links to some
isolated places, and (f) telephoto and facsimile services, and will, in
future, develop new services which require a network distinct from the
telephone system-- main]y high speed and message switched data transmission.
1.03      A committee in the Ministry of Communications, where TOT and CAT
are represented, coordinates investment and services between these entities.
Although CAT's and TOT's services and plants overlap marginalLy, efficiency
loss from plant duplications in FY82-85 is likely to be small-- CAT's
telecommunications investment program for the period is less than 1% of
TOT's-- and may well be more than offset by advantages in sector dynamics
arising from the presence of more than one operating entity, and by security
considerations. Numerous government agencies and some large private
industrial and commercial entities operate their own radio telephone
networks, but earlier proliferation of these (leading to inefficient
investment and congestion of the radio frequencies spectrum) has now been
checked.



- 2 -
1.04      PTD regulates, manages and monitors radio frequencies, and licenses
public and private radio cornmunication stations; it also represents the
Government on all international telecommunications matters. Various other
government bodies have regulatory powers over TOT and CAT. The National
Economic and Social Development Bureau (NESDB) and cabinet approve TOT's
budget and investment program. The Ministry of Finance sanctions all TOT's
borrowings. The Ministries of Communications and Finance, NESDB and the
Budget Bureau have roles in the process of revising telecommunications
tariffs, which are established by Cabinet decree.
Access to Service
1.05      As of January 1980, Thailand had an average density of 1.0
telephones per 100 inhabitants. Whereas this is somewhat above the average
of 0.7 for other developing countries in the East Asia region, it is less
than in the better-off developing nations in that region, e.g., Malaysia 3.3,
Republic of Korea 7.8, Taiwan 14.6, and Singapore 26.5 (Annex 1). Likewise,
Bangkok, the capital city, which has by far the most developed telephone
service in the country, has only 5.4 telephones per 100 population as
compared with other capital cities in the region, e.g., Manila 7.9, Seoul
15.1, Taipei 27.7, and Kuala Lumpur 32.1.
1.06      As of June 30, 1981, of the 6,033 tambons1 in Thailand, only 666
tambons (11% of the total with 25% of the country's population) had access to
telephone service (Annexes 2 and 3).  Under the current investment program,
about 286 additional tambons will be provided with access to service, 48
through telephone exchanges and 238 through long distance call offices,
leaving 5,081 tambons (84% of total with 70% of the country's population)
still without service. There are currently about 5,800 local and long
distance pay (coin box) telephones in Bangkok and 750 in provincial towns.
About 4,500 more pay telephones are to be added in Bangkok and 1,500 in
provincial towns under the delayed FY78-84 program, which will further
improve access to urban population--in Bangkok from 0.9 pay telephones per
1,000 population to 1.6, and in provincial towns from 0.2 to 0.6 pay
telephones per 1,000 population.
Usage of Service
1.07      In 1980, about 62% of the country's telephone lines were connected
to business and government subscribers and the balance 38% to residential
subscribers. About 90% of the non-residential subscribers were engaged in
communications-intensive tertiary sectors of the economy, mainly wholesale
and retail trade, finance, transport, communication, utilities and other
services, and government administration (Annex 4).
1/ Thailand is divided into 660 administrative divisions called amphoes;
these are further subdivided into 6,033 subdivisions called tambons.
Number of tambons per amphoe ranges between 7 and 11. For area and
population details of tambons, refer Annex 3.



- 3 -
1.08      In 1980, the averdge number of calls per subscriber line per annum
was about 2,500 local calls and 50 long distance calls. The average annual
reveriue per line was about US$350 equivalent. Business lines accounted for
about 83% of telephone calls and revenues. Some types of businesses were
exceptiorially intensive users, particularly those in the finance sector
(banking, insurance arid real estate) which averaged 4,500 local calls, 200
long distance calls and US$960 equivalent bill. per line per year.  Other
intensive users inc.luded subscribers mainly in transport dnd communications,
other services (including personal services), commerce and government, all
averaging more than 3,500 calls per year.
1.09      Even these figures, however, understate the extent to which
telephones are used in Thailand for calls related to directly productive
activities; in 1980, a sampl.e survey of 168 subscribers in Banigkok and the
Provinces showed that over 50% of residential telephones were used most
frequently to communicate with retailers in connection with obtaining goods
and services for the household, and to call one's workplace, customers and
government agencies. Overall, it is estimated that about 90% of all
telephone calls and revenues in Thailand relate mainly to productive and
distribution activities of the economy.
Quality of Service
1.10      The telephone facilities as of September 30, 1981 dre indiCdted in
Annex 5. As a result of installations aimed at relieving the traffic
congestion in the local te.lephone networks and systems expansions undertaken
under Bank projects since 1972, and better supervision over initial
installation and jointirig of cables and wires, there has been an appreciable
improvement in the quality of service through reduction in call failures due
to technical faults and system congestion.  The total number of faults
reported and cleared per month per subscriber has decreased by about 40% in
the last three years.  The proportion of faults in telephone cables and
wires, stil.l dominant, has been reduced from about 72% of total faults in
1978 to 62% in 1981. However, because of the shortage of telephones
vis-a-vis the demand (paragraph 1.13), the usage of available telephone lines
is very high; consequently, telephone lines are kept busy for relatively long
periods and unavailable for incoming calls. This leads to repeat call
attempts which, in turn, worsen congestion. Overall, a very low average of
only 62% of daily local calL attempts are completed; during peak business
hours the proportion is probably considerably lower.
1.11      Fully automatic national subscriber trunk dialling (STD) service
was achieved by the end of 1980. Statistical analysis of the quality of SID
service is not available but from public reaction dnd sharp increases in the
long distance traffic aiid revenues, the service appears to be functioning
satisfactorily. Sample observations during August 1980 in the northwest
region showed that, in a period of two months after STD was introduced, the
number of l.ong distance calls from that region to Bangkok and revenue
therefrom increased by about 155%; in the other direction, calLs from Bdngkok

to the northwest region and revenues therefrom increased by about 65%.  These
increases are likely to be representative of most routes.
Demand for Service
1.12      Historically, TOT's forecasts of service demand have been very
conservative. For example, TOT's forecast in 1977 for growth in the demand
of telephone connections over the period 1977-80 was 8.1% per annum, well
below the actual 15.5% subsequently observed for the same period.  One of the
reasons was that, until 1977, TOT did not maintain waiting lists of
applicants for new telephones and thus had no data on registered demand.
After the recording of waiting lists in existing service areas was introduced
in 1977 as covenanted under the second Bank loan, TOT started to build up a
better data base for assessing demand. However, even today, the registered
demand is likely to be far below the real demand as there are many potential
suscribers who have been discouraged from registering with TOT by heavy
delays in getting new connections. Also, applications are not received in
dreas where service is not currently available. While TOT makes a
substantial effort towards assessment of demand, its methodology in demand
forecasting needs improvement. Also, different sections of TOT (e.g.,
exchange planning and cable planning) prepare and maintain separate forecasts
of demand which are not always reconciled, resulting in some imbalance in
planning and provision of facilities and consequently in some idle assets.
1.13      The table below summarizes the actual growth in the telephone
network between 1977 and 1981 and TOT's forecast for demand and network
growth up to 1986.  Annex 6 gives year by year details of network and demand
growth from 1971 to 1990 separately for the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and the
Proviinces.

As of September 30, 1981, the unmet demand in Bangkok was 226,600 (44% of
total demand) and in the Provinces 99,600 (49% of total demand). The
forecast annual growth rates in total demand between now and 1990 of 15% for
Bangkok and 20% for the Provincial areas are considered reasonable, although
subject to considerable uncertainty.

Sector Goals
1.14      A ten-year Master Plan for the Transportation and Communicatior
sector has been un-der development since 1979 dnd subjected to successive
rounds of review by the Ministry of Communications, NESDB and the
participating sector entities including TOT.  The current draft of the Master
Plan covers the years FY82-91 which corresponds to the periods under the
Fifth and Sixth National Economic and Social Development Plans (FY82-86 and
FY87-91 respectively). The main overalL service development targets for FY86
set for TOT in the present form of the draft Mdster Plan and the targets as
per TOT's development program (paragraph 1.16) are as summarized below:

1.15      In a broad sense, the targets set by the Master Plan are consistent
with the outline for the Fifth Plan--mainly in that they emphasize
telecommunications investment in the provinces, extension of service to most
dmphoes, and more expeditious provision of services in main centers.  In
particular, by end of FY86, about 67% of projected demand in Bangkok and 79%
in the Provinces would have been met; also, all amphoes with 10,000



- 6 -
inhabitants or more will have been provided with telephone facilities through
long distance public call offices, which can subsequently be upgraded to
exchange connections as traffic develops.
1.16       Attaining the Master Plan targets for FY86 requires increasing
TOT's growth rate in lines connected from about 11% per annum achieved over
the period FY78-81 to a very high 23% in FY82-86. Such an implementation
rate is difficult, but possible if TOT's management procedures, organization,
and training are improved.  At the Bank's suggestion, planned expansion
during the period was reduced from 0.88 million lines proposed in the Master
Plan to 0.70 million lines, in the light of the high goals and of the
implementation constraints (paragraph 1.17). Given this, and the fact that
by September 1981 the number of lines in service was significantly less than
forecast in the Master Plan (especially in Bangkok), the FY86 density target
in the Bangkok area has been cut back by about 16% while that for the
Provinces was increased by about 10%.  Still the current targets imply a high
23% yearly increase in connections and 42% yearly increase in assets
(paragraph 5.05) during the project period. The table below shows the
overall growth planned for FY82-86 vis-a-vis the much lower achievements
during FY78-81.

Sector Constraints
1.17       The main constraint on the rate at which telephone services can be
expanded to meet demand lies in TOT's capacity to undertake the large
investment program and to efficiently operate and maintain the facilities
installed.  To some extent, TOT's implementation capacity is being augmented
by resorting increasingly to private suppliers and contractors for equipment
installation (paragraph 2.10) in addition to the more usual use of private
contractors for buildings and other civil works. However, TOT has not
developed commensurately its capacity to carry out the commercial,



- 7 -
administrative and technical tasks involved in connecting new subscribers and
properly operating and maintaining the new facilities.  Over the period
FY72-81 TOT was able to improve maintenance and operations (paragraph 1.10)
while expanding connections at a rate of about 10% per annum. In the period
FY77-82, it is likely that TOT cou]d have sustained growth at the planned 17%
per annum, had it not incurred major delays in procurement. Provided
appropriate steps are taken to strengthen commercial, operation and
maintenance functions (paragraphs 4.04 and 4.05), it is considered that,
during FY82-86, TOI has a reasonable chance to achieve the high growth in
telephone connections and in asset value as proposed in TOT's approved
investment program.
Bank's Role
1.18      During the last ten years, the Bank has played a significant role
in the development of the telephone services in Thailand through three
projects. Before the Bank's first participation in the sector in 1972, the
telephone services in Thailand were deteriorating with increasing traffic
congestion and faults.  Hence, the first project (Loan 864-TH of December
1972 for US$37 million) was basically a holding operation designed to provide
facilities needed to prevent further deterioration in the quality of
telephone service in areas where service was available. Based on
recommendations of consultants financed by the Bank, TOT was reorganized in
the early 1970s to improve its capabilities in management, operation and
development of the domestic telephone services.  Under the second project
(Loan 1253-TH of June 1976 for US$26 million), the Bank supported TOT in
expansion of the local telephone facilities in Bankgok and other urban areas
in the Provinces to partly meet the anticipated demand, and towards provision
of stable, high capacity, long distance radio telephone systems and trunk
automatic exchanges with automatic message accounting facility to provide
fully automatic STD service. The First Project was completed and the loan
closed on December 31, 1980, four years behind schedule. The Second Project
was completed and the loan closed on December 31, 1981, two years behind
schedule. In both projects, the delays were primarily at start-up and
procurement stages; otherwise, TOT's performance on both projects was
reasonably adequate, all physical targets were achieved and the loan
covenants met. The internal rate of return on the investments over the
combined two project periods is estimated at about 17% which is
satisfactory. Because of close proximity of the closing dates of the first
and second projects and the fact that many works under the two projects were
executed concurrently, a combined Project Completion Report for the two
projects will be completed in early 1982.
1.19      Under the third project (Loan 1620-TH of October 1978 for US$90
million), the Bank indicated to TOT management the need for (a) more rapid
pace of telephone expansion than proposed by them under their FY81-84
development program, and (b) establishment of rural long distance public calL
offices to provide access to service in rural areas for the first time in the
country. The Bank also played a role in guiding TOT away from undertaking



- 8 -
major expansions with older electromechaniical equipment designs and instead
adopting the latest stored program controlled (SPC) electronic digital
technology in telecommunications with considerable long-term costs savings
arid other benefits. Institutional. measures covenanted under the loan such as
establishmenit within TOT of a Management Information System and a Fundamental
Planning Unit, and execution of an economic study of telecommunications in
Thdiland should also lead to more efficient development and management of the
telephone services when fully implemented.  The Third Project is currently
about two years behind schedul.e. WhiLe there was perhaps a justifiable delay
initially in TOT's decision, at Bank's persuasion, to adopt digital
technology for future telephone development in Thailand, there were
unnecessary delays in evaluation of bids received for all items and taking
decisions on contract awards. As of end of 1981, TOT had committed US$42.8
million. The balance US$47.2 million of the loan is expected to be committed
by mid 1982. The project is now expected to be completed by December 1984,
two years behind schedule.
1.20       Since 1972, to a large extent through experience gained in carrying
out the expansions under the Bank projects, TOT has developed adequate
i.nternal expertise in technical planning, design and implementation of
domestic telephone development progrdms. It has established a network of
facilities covering the main cities, based on which further improvement and
expansion of services as well as extension into new rurdl areas can be
undertaken.  TOT's financial situation and outlook are overall adequate to
support rapid growth whil.e also contributing considerable amounts to
government through taxes and import duties (paragraph 3.08).  These
developments by themselves, however, do not ensure a better running of TOT,
whose organization and management after being revised in the early 1970s have
not kept pace with the large growth in services achieved and planned
(paragraph 4.02-4.05). With the major additional expansions envisaged during
FY82-85 and thereafter, the Bank has an important role to play over the next
few years, focused on helping TOT consolidate and improve its institutional
development.
1.21       Specifically, the Bank's continued participation  in the sector
through the proposed fourth loani to TOT focuses on:
(a) consol idating the institutional improvements in TOT
undertakern under the previous projects;
(b)  helping design dnd i.mplement a comprehensive packdge of
organization and management improvements which would enable
TOT to undertake a sustained anid more rapid service
development, arnd operate and manage the services provided in
ani effective and efficient mannrrer, with little or no further
recourse to external guidance;



-  -
(c)  promoting within TOT a more dyndmic attitude towards
adoption of new technologies when technicalLy dnd
economicalLy justified and accelerating the transition to
the new technologies chosen;
(d)  assisting TOT in developing guidelines for future investment
which are responsive to priorities set forth by the
Government in its National Plans, particularly those
pertaining to accelerated extension of service to different
categories of provincial cities and rural areas; and
(e)  helping TOT meet partially its long term foreign exchange
financing needs, and providing a frdmework of technical and
financial overview within which TOT may continue to mobilize
the balance of its requirements through bilateral and
commercial sources.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      TOT's FY82-85 investment program comprises the following:
(a)  ongoirig works;
(b) proposed fourth telecommunications project;
(c) preinvestment for program after FY85; and
(d)  other annual investments.
The total investments under this program are estimated at B 30,247.8 million
(US$1,351.1 million) with a foreign component of B 15,390.8 million (US$669.2
million). The investments under the different components of the program
and their sources of financing are given in Annex 7. Annual investments in
each of the yedrs FY82 to FY85 dre shown in Annex 8. The financing plan for
the program is discussed in paragraph 5.05.
Works Other than the Proposed Fourth Project
2.02      Ongoing works comprise primarily the Bank's delayed third project
(paragraph 1.19) and "Other Works" which comprise 15 mobile exchanges
(totalLing 13,000 lines) which TOT has ordered under its own funding to meet
some urgent demands in Bangkok.  The provisions under "Preinvestment for
Program After FY85" are preparatory investments for works to be undertaken
after FY85; these are tentative as TOT is still to formulate plans for these
works.  "Other Annual Investments" include miscellaneous capital investments
which do not directly relate to expansion of TOT's services and facilities



- 10 -
but are essential for TOT to maintain, operate and manage the existing assets
and assets to be installed under the program, and for a TOT headquarters
building.
The Project
2.03      The proposed FY82-85 fourth telecommunicatiorns project is a
balanced integrated package of high priority works needed for: (a) expansion
of local telephone facilities in Bangkok and the Provinces; (b) providing
access to service for the first time to about 330 out of about 5,080 rural
settlements which will be still without service at the end of the third
project; and (c) expansion of long distance facilities to cater for the
additional traffic generated by the above expansions. In addition to
physical expansion of telephone facilities, a major thrust of the project
will be on institution building (paragraphs 4.09 to 4.12).
2.04      The main components of the project are as follows:
(a)  provision of management consultants, technical assistance
and training fellowships for improving TOT's
institutional capabilities;
(b)  installation of about 373,000 lines of local switching
equipment (344,000 lines through new procurement and
about 29,000 lines by recovery and relocation of existing
equipment) with associated cable networks and subscriber
plant to connect about 278,000 new subscriber lines
including about 1,100 public call offices;
(c)  installation of (i) about 13,400 additional circuit
terminations in four existing tandem exchanges, and (ii)
one new tandem exchange with about 6,000 circuit
terminations in Bangkok;
(d)  installation of about 16,000 additional circuit
terminations in long distance trunk automatic exchanges;
(e)  installation of about 42 microwave radio telephone
systems, about 18 PCM cable systems and about 22,000
channel ends on main transmission routes;
(f)  installation of about 285 radio, PCM and cable systems to
connect about 1,200 rural public call offices in about
300 locations;
(g)  procurement of about 300 vehicles of different types for
project implementation; and
(h)  civil works for the project including cable ducts.

Details of equipment installations under the project are given in Annex 9.
Lists of local telephone exchanges and microwave and other radio and cable
systems to be installed or augmented under the project are given in Annexes
10 to 12. The implementation schedule for the project is shown in Annex 13.
The map (IBRD 16149) shows the long distance network and the extent of
telephone service coverage of the country on completion of the project in
September 1985.
Project Costs
2.05      The total cost of the project is estimated at B 11,320.5 million
(US$492.2 million) including a foreign cost component of B 6,369.7 million
(US$276.9 million).  The distribution of project costs between local (urban),
long-distance and rural components is approximately as follows: local
service (Bangkok): 42.4%; local service (Provincial towns): 27.0%; long
distance service between provincial towns and to Bangkok: 12.9%; rural long
distance public call offices in areas now without service: 17.7%. Local
cost includes about B 977.7 million in duties and taxes averaging about 17%
of the project's foreign cost. The cost estimates, based on TOT's experience
with contracts for ongoing works with adjustments to March 1982 levels, are
reasonable. Cost of financing a firm of management consultants (paragraphs
4.09 and 4.10) has been assessed at $15,000 per manmonth, and training and
other experts at $5,700 per manmonth. The costs of individual components of
the project are set out below.

Contingencies
2.06      The provisions for equipment and civil works under the project are
based for the most part on detailed designs and engineering. Hence, the
proposed quantities are not expected to change significantly in the project
period. Also, the continuous and dispersed nature of telecommunications
development allows adequate flexibility for adjustments and experience has
shown that increases at some points are compensated by decreases at others.
However, to cover unforeseen requirements over the four-year project period,
a physical contingency provision of 2% of annual base local and foreign costs
has been included and is considered adequate. Local price contingencies are
based on annual increases of 12% in 1982 and 1983, 10% in 1984 and 9% in
1985. Foreign price contingencies are based on annual increases of 8.0% for



- 13 -
1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7.0% for 1985. Since telecommunications
contracts are normally fixed price contracts, the foreign cost increases are
applied up to the anticipated contract dates. Based on these assumptions,
the local and foreign price contingencies amount to 22.2% and 9.5%
respectively of base costs plus physical contingencies.
Project Financing
2.07      The local cost of the project amounting to B 4,950.8 million
(US$215.3) million will be financed from TOT's internal cash generation, and
from subscriber bonds and customer deposits which are pooled with earnings
and applied to operational and developmental expenses without separate
allocations (paragraph 5.05). A Bank loan of US$142.1 million to TOT is
proposed of which US$2.1 million is the front-end fee; the balance US$140.0
million will finance about 50% of the foreign cost of the project. Financing
of the balance foreign cost of US$136.9 million was discussed during
negotiations. TOT indicated that (a) it was negotiating a supplier's credit
of about US$50 million equivaLent (at 7.75% annual interest for a term of 10
years) with Nippon Electric Company of Japan which will supply switching
equipment for Bangkok Metropolitan Area, and (b) in inviting bids for
equipment items other than those financed by the proposed Bank loan, TOT has
required bidders to propose terms for supplier's credit; TOT will decide on
the financing of these items after bids are opened. The contracts not
financed by suppliers' credits will be covered by bilateral credits or
commercial bank loans. TOT does not anticipate undue difficulty in arranging
these as needed.
Items for Bank-financing
2.08      The allocation of the proposed Bank loan of US$142.1 million is as
follows:
US$ Million
Local and trunk switching equipment                           60.0
with associated power equipment and services
Transmission equipment for main routes                       63.0

Procurement of equipment is discussed in paragraphs 2.11-2.13, and
appointment of consultants and training experts in paragraphs 4.09-4.12.
Project Implementation
2.09      TOT engineers will prepare all engineering designs, technical
specifications and bid invitation documents, evaluate bids and prepare
contracts. While TOT engineers have acquired adequate capabilities to
undertake these tasks, TOT's cumbersome administrative rules and procedures
have led to delays on previous projects, particularly on the third Bank
project, in issue of bid invitations and in finalizing evaluations and
decisions on contract awards. While steps to amend the present rules and
procedures are proposed under the institutional part of this proposed
project, to avoid recurrence of delays, the award of contracts for major
equipment items and to the selected firm of management consultants (paragraph
4.10) shall be a condition of loan effectiveness, except that in case TOT is
unable to award contract for any item because of circumstances beyond its
control, TOT will write to the Bank giving detailed reasons for such delay
and the Bank will consider waiving the condition of effectiveness for such
item.
2.10      For administrative reasons, and particularly as many installations
under this project are likely to overlap with those under the delayed third
project, (paragraph 1.19) TOT proposes to have major switching and
transmission equipment and cable installations carried out by suppliers.
Acceptance and commissioning tests on all equipment, including those
installed by contractors, will be carried out by TOT. While the major
equipment installations can be farmed out to suppliers, this is not possible
with the operation and maintenance of facilities or with the administrative,
commercial and other functions associated with connection of new lines to
subscribers. Together with delayed works under the third project, TOT will
have to connect about 358,000 lines in two years FY84 and FY85 against about
20,000 lines connected per year at present, and augment its operation and
maintenance capabilities currently geared to about 389,000 working lines to
about 858,000 lines by end of FY85. TOT, therefore, needs to take special
measures to build up the necessary organization and staff to meet its
responsibilties. Bank-financed assistance to TOT in this regard is,
therefore, included in the project (paragraph 4.10). With this assistance,
it is anticipated that TOT should be able to maintain the implementation
schedule at Annex 13 and complete the project by September 30, 1985.
Procurement
2.11      Advance Commitment:  Of the 344,000 lines of local switching
equipment to be procured for the project, TOT had included 40,200
lines--which comprises extension of digital exchanges under the third
project--in a Bank-financed international competitive tender announced in
February 1980. The Bank had concurred to this inclusion because of the
considerable technical and price advantages of procuring and installing the



- 15 -
extension equipment simultaneously with the main equipment. The cost of this
extension equipment (which now forms part of the Bank-approved contract TOT
W/4B signed by TOT with NEC of Japan on September 29, 1981) is US$11.9
million equivalent. Following TOT's request, approval of this advance
commitment of US$11.9 million equivalent of the loan is recommended.
2.12       Goods:  By March 1, 1982, TOT had announced bids for all major
equipment items to be financed under the proposed loan totalling about US$123
million which would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Qualifying
domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% or
the import duty, whichever is lower. Remaining items that cannot be grouped
to form packages of more than US$100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with TOT's current
procurement procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
2.13       Contract Review:  About ten bidding packages/contracts are expected
to make up the estimated US$123 million in the equipment category under the
proposed project. With a threshold of US$250,000 for prior Bank review of
procurement documentation, about 90% of the total number of packages would
cover 95% of the value contracted.  On that basis about nine contracts worth
about US$117 million would be subject to prior review over the two year
procurement period which represents a reasonable workload for Bank staff.
Random checks on other contracts would be carried out in the field.
2.14       Retroactive financing:  In addition to 40,200 lines of switching
equipment for which contract has already beer awarded (paragraph 2.11), TOT
expects to sign contracts with suppliers for all other major Bank-financed
items and with the management consultants between June and November 1982. As
requested by TOT during negotiations, it is recommended that the Bank agree
to retroactive financing of up to US$14 million representing about 10% down
payments likely to be made by TOT for these contracts after June 1, 1982.
Disbursements
2.15       Disbursements under the loan against full documentation would
cover: (a) 100% of foreign (CIF) expenditure for imported goods; (b) 100% of
foreign expenditure on installation and/or supervision services by suppliers,
(c) 100% of ex-factory costs of localLy manufactured items; (d) 65% of costs
of items procured locally off-the-shelf; and (e) 100% of the costs of
consultants and staff training abroad. Based on past Bank experience in the
telecommunications sector, but keeping in view the facts that (a) TOT had
announced bids for all Bank-financed items by end February 1982, and (b) the
award of contracts for all major equipment items is prescribed as a



- 16 -
condition of effectiveness (paragraph 2.09), the proposed loan is expected to
be fully disbursed by June 30, 1987.  The estimated schedule of disbursements
is at Annex 14.
Performance Indicators
2.16      A set of performance indicators which will help TOT's management
and the Bank monitor the project entity's project implementation, operational
and financial performance is given in Annex 15. TOT will be required to
include these indicators in its half-yearly progress reports on the project
except for financial indicators which will be included in the annual
financial report.
Ill. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The following analysis refers to TOT's FY82-85 investment program,
of which the delayed works under the third project and the proposed fourth
project constitute the major part. Wherever appropriate, distinction is made
between investments under the proposed fourth project and concurrent ongoing
works.
Telecommunications and Economic Development
3.02      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of a country's
economy. Compared with alternative means of communication,
telecommunications are often more efficient in terms of capital, energy
consumption and user time. With telecommunications, the level and variety of
productive communication can be increased considerably, and activities which
wou]d otherwise not be feasible can be realized. In terms of the specific
constraints on Thailand's economic and social development, telecommunications
can be expected to play a significant role especially in connection with:
(a) reducing the costs of locating production outside Bangkok, thereby
helping decentralize the economy; (b) facilitating the operation of small
enterprises, trade associations (e.g., cooperatives) and support facilities
(e.g., banks, technical assistance) as required to deconcentrate ownership of
production and distribution; (c) improving the working of the market
mechanism by expediting and extending access to information as needed to
foster competition and develop domestic and international trade; (d)
increasing the efficiency of transportation through coordination of vehicle
use and some substitution of travel, resulting in energy savings and/or
greater efficiency of productive interactions for a given level of energy
consumption; (e) facilitating the extension of health, education, government
administration and other services to low income rural areas, including
extension of the reach of scarce expertise for advice, support and
supervision; and (f) mobilizing domestic savings in the form of surpluses
from telecommunications operations transferred to government as taxes and
duties (paragraph 3.08).



Program Size and Composition
3.03       TOT's FY82-85 investment progrdm is very large given what TOT has
been able to achieve in the past (paragraph 1.16).  However, it falls short
of what is needed to meet outstanding applications for telephone lines,
satisfy new demand forecast to arise in the period, and initiate investment
for the following period. Despite TOT's plans for expansion at record high
rates, the unsatisfied demand of about 0.46 million lines at the end of the
project will be actually larger than at its start. Nonetheless, during the
project, a turning point would have been passed (in FY84) after which unmet
demand is expected to decline, and by the end of the project about 65% of
total demand will be met as against 54% at its start (paragraph 1.13).
3.04       In general, the FY82-85 program comprises a reasonable mix on
investment addressed to improve and expand service across the country in
response to forecast demand, broad regional priorities expressed by national
policy, and sound system engineering practice.  However, investment planning
shouLd be based in the future on better economic inputs, especially in three
partly inter-related areas. First, there is considerable uncertainty
associated with the demand forecasts (paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13). Although
the risk of overinvestment under the fourth project is negligible,2 as TOT
tends to catch up with demand in the late 1980s, more reliable forecasting
will be needed. Under the third project, TOT agreed to carry out a review
and consolidation of its forecasting practices, as one of the initial efforts
in developing in-house expertise in economic analysis and long range
planning. While usage information has been collected, it has not yet been
incorporated in a demand forecasting methodology, partly due to lack of
technical expertise. Second, the main tool for resource allocation within
the sector--pricing--needs to be improved. Action in this direction
initiated under the third project will be supported and followed through in
the fourth project (paragraph 3.10). Finally, although TOT's FY82-85
investment program is reasonably in line with national policies (paragraphs
1.15 and 1.16), it would be useful and possible to draw up guidelines for
subsequent investment which reflect more closely the spatial arnd sectoral
priorities as expressed in the Fifth Plan outline. The outcome would include
a detailed 10-year strategy for the development of rural telephone service,
more explicit criteria for the allocation of priority among rural places, and
specific criteria for the provision of urban public telephones in low income
areas. A provision has been included in this project to finance experts and
trainirig to help TOT in carrying out these three tasks under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank (paragraphs 4.09, 4.11 and 4.12).
2/ Demand forecasts, although not very reliable, are overall plausible and in
line with Thai experience in recent past yedrs.  Also, since the projected
gap between supply and demand at project end is large, there is overall
tolerance for forecasting inaccuracies at present.



- 18 -
Least Cost Solution
3.05       The technical means to achieve the FY82-85 service development
objectives are to a large extent determined by the characteristics of the
existing systems and decisions taken in connection with the third project.
Within these limits, the solutions chosen are likely to result i.n the lowest
costs regarding both initial investment and total cost over the life of the
new facilities. In particular, the adoption of modern technology (electronic
digital) for telephone switching and associated remote subscriber units, PCM
on existing cables to increase their capacity, and digital. microwave and UHF
transmission systems for both the third and fourth projects resulted from
sound engineering economic analyses of alternatives and are l.ikelv to result
in considerable reduction of space requirements and installation and
maintenance costs.
Distribution of Benefits
3.06       On the basis of current usage patterns (paragraphs 1.07-1.09) and
the composition of a sample of outstanding applications, it is expected that
about 40% of lines added under the program will be connected to businesses,
which will account for about 66% of new calls generated.  Including business
use of residential telephones, almost 80% of aL] calls by new lines will be
directly related to the economic production and distribution activities of
the economy. The proportion is likely to be even higher in the provinces.3
3.07       Under the fourth project, there will be faster service development
in the provinces than in the Bangkok metropolis in relative terms (paragraph
1.16). In particular, by the end of FY85, 80% or more of forecast telephone
connections demand could be met in Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen,
Songhla/Hat Yai and Chonburi, the five main provincial urban centers on which
is based the Government's strategy to decentralize economic activity, against
76% in the Provinces overall and 61% in Bangkok.   Public telephones to be
installed in rural tambons will extend service to about 3 million rural
inhabitants, with which the proportion of the country's population living in
places with telephone service will rise from 30% including facilities being
built under the third project to 35% at the end of the fourth project.  On
the basis of a preliminary TOT analysis of expected costs and revenues, the
provision of these rural facilities will involve some subsidy from the
financially more lucrative urban and interurban services.
3/ About 50% of new provincial lines are expected to be connected to
businesses, as against 40% in Bangkok. Averaae use of long distance
service is likely to be much higher in the provinces, especially in
services, manufacturing and construction sectors which at present average
about three times as many long distance calls per line as similar Bangkok
subscribers.  About 60% of provincial residential lines are used most
frequently for calls relating to the economy, as against about 50% in
Bangkok.



- 19 -
3.08      No funds will be required from Government.  Rather, despite the
high cash generation requirements of TOT's large expansion program, over the
period FY82-85 TOT will make a very large total financial contribution to
Government of about B 8799 million (US$382.6 million) as shown in the table
below.
B Million      US$ Million
Custom duties                     2663             115.8
Tax on TOT profits                6136             266.8
Total Contribution from TOT       8799             382.6
to Government
In FY86, the first year after completion of the fourth project, TOT will pay
about B 3,458 million (US$150 million) in tax on profits, which is about
B 2,850 million (US$124 million) more than would be the case without the
fourth project investments (or about US$47 million if also the effect of the
1982 tariff increase is exc].uded). The annual fiscal contribution associated
with the fourth project will be higher in subsequent years as new subscribers
are connected.
Tariffs
3.09      TOT's present telephone tariffs mainly comprise a B 1,500-B 2,500
(US$65-109) non-reimbursable one-time connection charge, a monthly rental of
B 50-B 100 (US$22-44) and a B 2.00 (US$0.09) unit call charge (untimed local
calls or timed distance-dependent part of long distance calls). Subscribers
are also required to purchase one of several interest-bearing TOT bonds
intended to serve the purpose of rationing excess connections demand in
addition to providing TOT with low cost investment funds. Annex 16
summarizes TOT's tariffs and Annex 17 discusses several problems associated
with the bond system and tariffs.
3.10      There is a need to revise the structure of TOT's tariffs,
particularly regarding the sale of bonds and related allocation of new
connections, the charges for long distance calls and stimulation of system
use outside business hours. These are discussed in detail in Annex 17. As
one of its assignments, the Office of Economic Study (OES) established in TOT
under the third project agreed to carry out a review of TOT's tariffs,
focusing on cost of service and the characteristics of demand, while also
taking into account equity, regional development and other objectives of



- 20 -
government policy.4 OES has colLected background information on usage of
current subscribers and on outstanding applications; however, it has lacked
the in-house economic expertise to undertake the main tariff study. Hence,
provision has been made in this fourth project, to finance technical
assistance to help carry out a tariff study under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 4.12). However, in advance of the
comprehensive tariff study, TOT will examine improvements in the application
of the present bond system, mainly to ensure that, in Bangkok where two-level
bond system operates, high-bond applicants receive effective priority (Annex
17, paragraph 2), and to simplify administration of the bond sales to reduce
TOT cost and public inconvenience, and introduce changes acceptable to the
Bank by March 31, 1983.
3.11      TOT's tariffs were last increased in late 1979 and TOT has obtained
a reasonabLe rate of return on average assets in operation (paragraph 5.01).
Recently, TOT requested Government authorization to increase tariffs in order
to ensure increased internal generation of funds as needed to carry out the
very large expansion under the FY82-85 program (paragraphs 1.16 and 5.05).
It was agreed during negotiations that, as a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan, TOT shall have increased its fees and charges, and the
Government shall have approved appropriate measures, for TOT to meet its
obligations under paragraph 5.08. Given that the demand for both connections
and traffic exceeds the system's capabilities (paragraph 1.13 and Annex 17),
the increase in tariffs is unlikely to have any adverse effects on overall
resource allocation at this time.
Return on Investment
3.12      The internal financial rate of return on the program, defined as
the discount rate which equalizes the present value of cost and revenue
streams (at 1981 constant prices) attributable to the program is 26% (Annex
18). This rate of return understates the real benefits to be derived from
the investment program, partly because the benefits stream used in the
calculation does not take fully into consideration the indirect and external
benefits which are received by nonusers of the service. It also does not
include the consumer surplus which telephone users receive. To illustrate
4/ Although the study will be limited to TOT's tariffs, the knowledge gained
from it on TOT's cost structure will shed some light on the issue of
division of international telephone service revenues between CAT and TOT.
At present, TOT retains only B 4 per minute of outgoing calls, which
averages less than 10% of the total paid by the user. TOT also receives
B 4 per minute of each incoming call. Very high international tariffs,
set by bilateral agreement, thus result in only minor revenue to TOT but a
large surplus to CAT which it uses to meet the losses of the postal
service.



- 21 -
the significance of this, a portion of the consumer surplus has been
estimated by (a) tabulating over the program period the prices in 1981 real
terms which the existing subscribers and registered applicants have
demonstrated a williingness to pay; and (b) assuming that the future
applicants will also be willing to pay the same real amount as existing
subscribers and currently registered waiting applicants have demonstrated a
willngness to pay. Given these reasonable assumptions, the quantifiable
estimate of the economic rate of return on the program would be 43%.
Risks
3.13      The project offers acceptable risk.  The principal risk is the
possibility of delayed physical implementation associated with the large
investment program. Such delay would be due to unforeseen circumstances and
could result in a consequent delay in benefits.  In telecommunications
projects, however, which involve a relatively large number of independent
activities, delay in the completion of a few works does not generally prevent
the use of other newly created assets. Furthermore, costs and benefits are
often delayed in roughly the same degree, so the impact on the rate of return
may not be significant. A sensitivity analysis on the internal financial
rate of return (Annex 18) shows that a combination of 10 percent higher
capital costs and 10 percent lower revenues would result in a return of 18
percent.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization and Management
4.01       TOT, an autonomous state enterprise, is administered by an
eight-member Board of Directors. The Bodrd comprises the Chairman, the
Managing Director of TOT, the President of CAT, the Director General of PTD
and four other external directors appointed by the Government. TOT's
organization structure is shown at Annex 19, and is generally along the lines
of similar autonomous telecommunications entities in other developing
countries.
4.02      White the organization is overall adequate for current needs and
TOT's senior and middle management staff are individually experienced,
competent and qualified, some deficiencies have developed since TOT's
organization and management were last subjected to comprehensive revisions in
the early 1970s. These need to be corrected, considering especially the very
large increase in the volume of operations expected in the next few years.
The primary problem seems to be that there is inadequate delegation of
authority throughout TOT. Although, in principle, the Board is required to
lay down broad policies with the Managing Director being fulLy responsible
for day-to-day management, in practice past Managing Directors have not
exhibited adequate administrative and financial authority. Consequently, the
Board has tended to become involved in technical, administrative and
financial details to the detriment of management's effectiveness and the
Board's policy functions. Likewise, the department directors and division



- 22 -
chiefs exercise inadequate decision making power which results in too many
references to the Managing Director.
4.03      Related to the delegation of authority problem is the fact that
TOT's management has tended to be overly timid and rigid, and averse to
taking bold decisions. This, combined with inadequate delegation, results in
top management and even the Board getting involved excessively in detailed
investment planning, and in frequent references to the management or the
Board for any subsequent adjustments, however minor. This problem also
exists in the relationship between TOT and NESDB which is involved in
decisions on TOT's investment programs. Because TOT initially submits,
unnecessarily in the Bank's view, very detailed plans of its development
programs to NESDB, adjustments over the program period in response to
changing demand patterns, as is usual for all telecommunications entities
worldwide, need to be further referred to and approved by NESDB. This is
time consuming and limits TOT's flexibility.
4.04      Within TOT, the functional responsibilities of and interrelations
among the various departments are also neither fulLy satisfactory nor
well-defined; in particular, poor coordination in the execution of project
components results, in some cases, in idle assets and loss of revenue.
Finally, commercial and related functions have not been strengthened as
needed to effectively handle the rapidly increasing numbers of subscribers,
and operation and maintenance do not appear to have been adequately built up
commensurate with the large system expansion currently being undertaken.
4.05      These deficiencies were exacerbated in the last two years by
several changes of top staff and low staff morale. The current Acting
Managing Director, however, who assumed office in July 1981 has acted firmly,
speeded up the decision-making process, and brought back into TOT management
some experienced senior personnel. However, the basic organizational
deficiencies remain. To overcome these, it is proposed to finance under the
project a firm of management consultants to review, under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank, TOT's management and organization, identify
weaknesses, suggest changes and assist in their implementation (paragraph
4.10).
Long-term Planning
4.06      Under the third project, to improve TOT's long-range planning, the
Bank had required establishment of a Fundamental Planning Unit (FPU) within
TOT. While the FPU has been recently estabLished, it is currently not in a
position to effectively present options for policy decisions, it is not
sufficiently separated from routine operations, and it suffers from
inadequate staffing. The economic study of telecommunications in Thailand
which TOT was required to undertake under the third project as a first stage
of developing in-house economic expertise has been entrusted to another TOT
unit, the Office of Economic Study (OES). Due to inadequate staffing and
lack of economic expertise among the TOT personnel, OES also has not been



- 23 -
able to carry out its current assignments adequately. Measures to provide
the necessary expertise in, and the close coordination between or integration
of, FPU and OES are proposed under the project (paragraphs 4.09, 4.11 and
4.12).
Staff
4.07      Annex 20 gives the distribution of TOT staff between different
categories. In 1981, TOT had a staff of about 11,180, equivalent to about 21
employees per 1,000 telephones; this suggests a good labor productivity
higher than in most other developing countries, although amenable to further
improvement. TOT has little difficulty in recruiting staff of requisite
caliber and staff turnover is negligible.  The pay scales are reasonable, and
staff also receive welfare benefits averaging about 15% of total remuneration
and a yearly bonus equivalent to about 1.2 times the average monthly pay.
4.08      TOT's assessment of future staff requirements as given in Annex 20
are based on current methods of operation, and the employee/telephone ratio
has been forecast to improve from current 21 to about 16 per 1,000 telephones
by 1985 through increased productivity resulting from improved organization
of construction, operations, commercial work and administrative functions.
However, TOT has not made a detailed manpower study of its future staff
requirements, taking into account new technologies and services being
introduced or likely to be introduced in the network in the near future,
changes in the pattern of services (especially deeper penetration into rural
areas with wider dispersal of facilities), likely reorganization of its
administration, introduction of more modern management techniques like the
management information system currently being implemented as part of the
Third Bank project, and wider use of computers particularly for commercial
work. It is proposed that the management consultants to be financed under
the proposed loan (paragraph 4.10) should carry out a manpower study and
prepare a manpower plan for TOT until year 1990, prescribing the types and
number of staff of different categories, their job descriptions, recruitment
programs and training needs, the latter for both new and in-service staff.
Training
4.09      The Telecommunications Training Center (TTC) on the outskirts of
Bangkok was established in 1969 with the assistance of the lnternational
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and UNDP financing. TTC is well equipped and
has a training capacity of about 20,000 student-weeks. However, TTC
programmed only 6,000 student-weeks of training in 1981. The training
program for 1982 is set at only 6,800 student weeks, and does not cover
adequately, or not at all, training in new technologies being introduced in
TOT management, administration, and finance and accounts, or in-service
training. No training is scheduled in the use of the new management tools
such as the management information system currently under implementation. To
remedy the situation, the management consultants to be financed by the loan
(paragraph 4.10) wiLl also review the training requirements of TOT and, based



- 24 -
on the findings of the manpower study (paragraph 4.08), propose suitable
training programs in different disciplines--technical, administration and
mdnagemernt, finance and accounts--as also a program of regular in-service
training of TOT staff at all levels.  A provision of US$0.75 million has been
included under the loan to finance about 48 manmonths of training instructors
for the TTC and 150 manmonths of training abroad of TTC instructors, as well
as about 48 manmonths of foreign training of FPU and OES personnel to provide
future in-house expertise within TOT on long-range planning and economic work
(paragraph 4.06).
Consultants
4.10       As indicated in paragraph 4.05, it is proposed to finance under the
loan a firm of management consultants, under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, to review TOT's current organization and management, and suggest
and assist in implementation of measures to correct weaknesses. The
consultants will also be required to prepare a manpower plan for TOT
(paragraph 4.09). Further, since a major inadequacy in TOT in the past has
been the slow utilization of assets installed and delays in connecting new
lines to waiting applicants, the consultants will be required, as a priority
task, to review the organization and working of the commercial, operations
and maintenance branches and suggest changes, propose suitable manpower plans
and recruitment and training programs for these branches, and help implement
these urgently so that, by end of FY83, TOT is adequately equipped and
organized to absorb and exploit immediately the large local network capacity
that would become available from FY84. Consultanit's services are estimated
at about 135 manmoniths at unit cost of about US$15,000 equivalent per
manmonth.5 A provision of US$2 million has accordingly been made under the
loan to finance consultants who wil.I be selected and appointed in accordance
with Bank guideLines.  The award of contract to the selected management
consulting firm under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank shall be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
4.11      It is also proposed to finance individual experts to assist TOT in
the field of planning. One expert would assist the FPU and the OES for about
24 months in setting up and implementing a comprehensive work program to take
over some of the long-term planning activities currently located elsewhere in
TOT, and gradually establishing all other functions prescribed for these
units. In particular, the expert would help in drawing up job descriptions
and qualification requirements for all FPU and OES staff, reviewing the
present staffing situation, selecting the permanent cadre of professionals,
and specifying a program for their initial training on the job and abroad.
He would provide overalL guidance in the development of long term planning in
TOT, and contribute substantively in the design and implementation of
specific practices.
5/ Based on fees paid by TOT to two foreign consulting firms in 1980.



4.12      The project would also provide (a) one telecommunications economics
expert for about six months to help carry out a study of telephone tariffs
(paragraph 3.10) and assist in discussing with TOT managers the implications
of the study's findings on TOT's pricing and investment policy, (b) one
demand forecasting expert for about six months to help upgrade TOT's current
practices in this field (paragraph 1.12) and (c) one telecommunications
economics/regional planning expert for about eight months to help develop
guidelines for future TOT investments (paragraph 3.04). All these experts
are estimated to cost on an average about US$5,700 per manmonth.  A provision
of US$0.25 million has been made under the loan to finance them.
Accounting and Budgeting
4.13      TOT's accounting and budgeting system is satisfactory.  The
accounting system is computerized and commercial accounts are prepared.
Annual budgets are prepared on a monthly basis and each department or office
is responsible for controlling its own budget, and reports to the budget
division every month. Each quarter, the division submits to the Managing
Director a quarterly variance analysis. TOT is currently in process of
implementing a comprehensive management information system which, among other
things, covers the finance and accounts aspects of its operations. Full
implementation of this system is expected by about June 1982.
Billing and Collection
4.14      TOT's billing system is computerized and is satisfactory.  However,
historically, the bill collection system employing bill collectors for
house-to-house collection of dues has been weak. With the expansion of TOT's
business operations, this system was beginning to break down. As required
under the third Bank project, a new bill collection system is now being
implemented which involves invoices being sent by mail and payments being
remitted by subscribers through post, commercial banks and/or at TOT
collection offices. This system is expected to be fully operational by
end-1982. Payment control procedures are also being tightened up. Accounts
receivables have, as a percentage of revenues, risen from a low of 11 percent
in 1977 to about 32 percent in 1981. However, over the FY82-85 program
period, with increased attention being paid to bill collection and arrears
monitoring, receivables are expected to be reduced to about 24 percent in
1982 and about 18 percent in 1985, which is acceptable. Government
receivables in arrears for over 12 months in 1981 were about 7 percent of
total receivables. Twelve percent of receivables represented old long
distance calls which are in dispute. The impact of overdue Government
receivables upon the financial viability of TOT is minimal. Under a covenant
in the third loan, the Government is required to settle all outstanding
receivables by end of FY83.



- 26 -
Audit
4.15       TOT has an internal audit division employing about 50 mostly
qualified people. This internal audit division operates with an audit
program and issues regular audit reports which cover procedures as well as
financial results. The internal audit division of TOT operates in a
satisfactory manner. The external audit of TOT's accounts is carried out by
the Office of the Auditor General of Thailand. The audited statements which
the Bank has received on time have been audited in a satisfactory manner.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TOT will continue to
employ independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, and that audited
accounts will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each
financial year.
Insurance
4.16       TOT does not insure its fixed assets; cost of such insurdnce is
high and TOT considers that the wide geographical spread of its assets
provides good dispersion of risk. This is reasonable and in line with the
approach adopted by other similar telecommunications entities.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01       The past financial performance of TOT has been reasonable.  A

Details of TOT's historical income statements and balance sheets for FY77-81
are given in Annexes 21 and 22. During the period FY77-81, gross assets of
TOT doubled and self-generated funds were sufficient to finance about 44% of
the funds required for this large expansion.
Present Financial Position
5.02      A summary of TOT's balance sheet as at September 30, 1981, is shown
below:

Total Liabilities                      10,933
Long-term debt is made up of subscriber bonds (B 1,115 million), and loans
from IBRD (B 1,085 million), Ex-Im Bank of Japan (B 1,220 million), OECF
(B 1,065 million), AB Svensk Exportkredit (B 224 million) and domestic loans
(B 60 million). The current asset ratio at 2.4 is satisfactory.
Valuation of Assets
5.03      In 1980, TOT revalued its fixed assets using an acceptable method
of revaluation. This revaluation concluded that, as of September 30, 1980,
the book value of assets needed to be increased by about 30% to reflect
current value. To reduce possible distortion in asset values by price
inflation on the one hand and declining unit costs of telecommunications
assets from improved technologies on the other, it was concluded from the
asset revaluation exercise that, in future, assets would be adjusted on a
memorandum basis to reflect the current value of the assets, by being
revalued from the 1980 revised base by 6% per annum which reflects the annual



- 28 -
increase in assets value over the past three years.  This assumption, which
is acceptable, has been used in this report and will be monitored annually
(paragraph 5.04).
5.04      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TOT will, by
June 30, 1983, review and establish the value of its fixed assets according
to methods agreed on with the Bank and that TOT will review the value of its
fixed assets annually thereafter.
Financing Plan
5.05      The following is a summary of the forecast sources and applications
of funds for the period FY82-85, based upon TOT's capital expenditure
program (excluding capital and expense items written off).

Total Sources                         28,376              1,234
Given the tariff increases proposed by TOT, TOT's net internal cash
generation would finance the equivalent of 25% of program costs during the
project period, which is satisfactory given the 300% increase in fixed assets
and work in progress over the project period. The change in working capital
is negative due to a large increase in current liabilities as a result of the
expansion program.

5.06      The long-term financing indicated above is made up as follows:

IBRD                                   5,290               230
OECF                                   1,382                 60
Subscriber bonds                       2,919                127

future projects
19,988               870
Of the above financing, and including the proposed IBRD loan, about 50% is
confirmed. Of the remaining unconfirmed financing, nearly 70% relates to
future works for which it is too early to have confirmed financing. The
balance of 30% is likely to be financed either through suppliers' credits or
commercial bank financing. Arrangements being made by TOT to cover the
balance foreign funds requirements were discussed during negotiations
(paragraph 2.07). No major problems are foreseen relating to the financing
of the program.
Future Financial Performance
5.07      Financial statements for FY82-85 are given in Annexes 23 to 25.  A
summary of TOT's expected future financial performance, assuming cumulative
inflation on operating costs of about 11% per annum is given below (Baht
millions):
FY82      FY83       FY84       FY85
Operating revenues                         3,809      5,673      8,148    11,706
Operating costs                            2,048      2,618      3,280      4,247
Operating surplus                          1,761      3,055      4,868      7,459
Interest                                     368        450        721      1,345

Net operating surplus                        785      1,464      2,358      3,516
Operating ratio                      (%)      54         46         40         36
Rate of return on revalued assets (%)          10        15         19         20

- 30 -
TOT's projected financial performance over the project period is good.  The
operating ratio, due to increased revenues as a result of the proposed tariff
increase and maintenance of operating cost efficiency, over the period falls
to a level of 36% which is very good.
5.08      From FY81 to FY85, TOT's investment in gross fixed assets and work
in progress increases more than four-fold. During this period of rapid
expansion the provision of funds to sustain this expansion and maintain
financial viability is of the utmost importance. Over the period FY82-85,
TOT's internally self-generated funds amount to about 25% of capital
investment requirements. This performance is reasonable given the very large
investment program (paragraph 1.16). During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that TOT would take or cause to be taken all such measures as shall
be required to produce funds from internal sources equivalent to at least 20%
of the capital expenditures incurred during any one year of the FY82-85
period, at least 25% for the whole period and at least 35% for FY86.
5.09      In respect of tariffs, it has been assumed for the financial
projections that there will be no increases during the project period other
than those currently proposed (paragraph 3.10). TOT's future rate of return
on revalued assets is good, despite inflation. This is due to an almost
doubling of telephone lines in service during the program period and to an
increased utilization of the services.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      The folLowing shall be the conditions of loan effectiveness:
(a) TOT shall have signed contracts for major project items
and with a selected firm of management consultants
(paragraphs 2.09 and 4.10); and
(b)  TOT shall have increased its fees and charges and the
Government shall have approved appropriate measures so
that TOT can meet its initial obligations under paragraph
5.08 (paragraph 3.11).
6.02      The Bank agrees to:
(a)  advance contracting of 40,200 lines of switching
equipment costing about US$11.9 million (paragraph 2.11);
and
(b) retroactive financing of up to US$14 million in respect
of payments made by TOT on Bank-financed contracts after
June 1, 1982 (paragraph 2.14).
6.03       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from TOT on the
following:



- 31 -
(a) TOT shall introduce, by March 31, 1983, new procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, for allocating telephones on
the basis of differential subscriber bonds (paragraph
3.10);
(b) TOT shall continue to employ independent auditors
acceptabLe to the Bank and will submit audited accounts
to the Bank within six months of the end of each
financial year (paragraph 4.15);
(c) TOT shall, by June 30, 1983, review and establish the
value of its fixed assets according to methods agreed on
with the Bank and that TOT will review the value of its
fixed assets annually thereafter (paragraph 5.04); and
(d) TOT shall take or shall cause to be taken all such
measures as shall be required to produce funds from
internal sources equivalent to at least 20% of capital
expenditures incurred during any one year of the FY82-85
period, at least 25% for the whole period and at least
35% for FY86 (paragraph 5.08).
6.04       Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan to TOT of US$142.1
million equivalent (including a front-end fee of US$2.1 milLion) for a term
of 20 years including a three-year grace period at the current rate of
interest.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Analysis of Current Telephone Tariffs
1.        TOT's present telephone tariff is summarized in Annex 16.
one-time non reimbursable installation charge of B 1,500-B 2,500 is levi'9
for the connection of a new line to a subscriber, who is also required to buy
a TOT interest bearing bond. A monthly rental of B 50-B 100 is charged for
remaining connected to the system, with no allowance for calls. And B 2.00
is charged for each local call (untimed) and for a distance-related duration
of long distance call. Long distance calls are charged at half rate during
night hours, and operator assisted calls are priced higher than subscriber
dialed calls when this facility is available.
2.        An uncommon feature of TOT tariffs is a bond system used both to
price-ration connections and as a source of low cost funds for investment.
New telephone lines are connected in the order of receipt of application,
except for certain users (mainly government and national security subscribers
when requested with the signature of a minister, industries, banks,
hospitals, schools and doctors) which are granted overriding priority. A few
weeks before new capacity becomes available in a given exchange area,
applicants previously registered with TOT are asked (by letter) to pay the
connection fee and purchase a telephone bond issued by TOT.  In Bangkok, the
bonds are available at two prices: B 30,000 and B 10,000.1 High-bond
(B 30,000) applicants are given priority over low-bond (B 10,000) applicants
within an exchange area. High-bond priority, however, is exercised only
among applications received in a given calendar month. For applications
filed in different months, the month of application takes precedence over the
bond level; that is, all high-bond applicants of the earliest outstanding
month are first asked to pay, then all low-bond applicants of the same month,
then all high-bond applicants of the next month, and so on until all
available lines have been allocated. Thus, an applicant's chance of
obtaining a line in Bangkok in a given expansion batch is only marginally
increased by opting for the higher-priced bond. This seems to be known by
1/ TOT bonds currently issued earn an annual interest of 9%, which is less
than the 13% interest offered to the government savings bank depositors.
The bonds are purchased back by TOT at the end of contract and cannot be
resold in the capital markets now, although this was permitted at the
onset of the bond program in 1977. However, since there is an acute
shortage of telephone lines, these are being traded privately.

the public, and a number of Bangkok applicants register under both hish-bond
and low-bond waiting lists; hence, multiple entries are not uncommon,
adding to uncertainty about the quantity and location of unmet demand. In
the Provinces, the value of the bond is fixed according to the size of
exchange--B 3,000 for exchanges of 1,000 lines and above and B 1,000 for
exchanges below 1,000 lines--and new connections are allocated in each
exchange generally in chronological order.
3.         TOT's tariffs are the outcome of developments along time in which
financial requirements, judgement and public relations considerations were
the main driving forces, and are likely to need revision in terms of economic
efficiency and equity. Initial charges (connection fee and bond
subscription) are high, purposefully serving the function of directing TOT's
limited expansion capability towards users likely to realize the greatest
benefits from obtaining service. Although inital charges should gradually
decrease to levels related to marginal fixed costs as sustained growth allows
TOT to meet demand more promptly, no such reduction need be pursued at
present since even with these high charges at the end of the fourth project
there will be a large unmet demand. Nonetheless, the rationing scheme can be
improved considerably during the fourth project, leading to increased
allocative efficiency. In particular, the two-level bond system in Bangkok,
the low bond level in major provincial cities, the use of rationing in
smaller places and the low rentals, are all questionable; a clear pricing
strategy including a role for rationing should be developed in terms of TOT's
demand forecasts and expectations for expansion, and made known to the public
(among other reasons, in order that prospective subscribers can weigh the
tradeoff between price and time to get a connection); the bond system should
be applied in a way that allows the market's responses to be taken into
account in the planning of TOT expansion; and its administration could be
simplified to the advantage of both TOT and the public.
4.        There is clearly a need to also review TOT's call charges, although
these are roughly in line with practice in other countries. Long distance
calls are likely to be overpriced, which runs counter to government regional
development policy.  In particular, rural telephone service is all long
distance, and there is some contradiction between subsidizing the provision
of such telephones, and then charging the public excessively for using them.
On the other hand, since telephone service is overall congested, call charges
2/ Another important factor of multiple entries in waiting lists is TOT's
inadequate customer relations effort. Whereas change of address in an
existing application is accepted by TOT without loss of time precedence,
this is seldom pursued by the client--a new application is filed instead.
About 25% of the July 1976-September 1978 applicants called until mid-1980
failed to materialized payments. The record of applications is not kept
on computer, and checks and updating are not carried out. Calls are not
publicly advertised, and TOT does not verify address or otherwise follow
up on called applicants that fail to respond.

Could be increased considerably at peak business hours without reducing
effective system use; rather, a reduction in peak traffic offered would
result in less congestion and fewer repeat call attempts, thereby permitting
the existing equipment to carry a somewhat higher number of effective calls.
A considerably lower off-peak charge for local calls could be established (at
present there is no time differentiation of local call charges) to promote
use of facilities when they are underutilized; this should result in greater
use of residential connections, which at about 100 calls/month is low and is
likely to be price elastic.

Return on Investment
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1981-2001, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements during
the program period, excluding preinvestments for future programs, deflated to
bring them to 1981 price levels.
3.         Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based on
the expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and the traffic
increase brought about by the program. Incremental costs excluding
depreciation and interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and
staff requirements expected from the program.  All revenues and costs have
been deflated to bring them to the comparable 1981 price levels.
4.        A summary of the program's incremental cost and benefits stream at
1981 price levels is as follows (in Baht millions):
Year          Capital Costs       Operating Costs        Revenues
1981               2,718                     -                  -
1982               2,746                   242                674
1983               6,134                   909              1,669
1984               5,031                 1,504              3,174
1985               1,566                 2,168              5,201
1986                   -                 2,802              7,424
1987-2001                                  3,663              9,934
5.        The internal rate of return for the above benefit stream is 26
percent.
6.        Estimating the future consumer surplus by tabulating over the
program period the prices in real terms (1981 level) which existing
subscribers and applicants are demonstrating a willingness to pay, and
assuming that new subscribers are prepared to pay the same real amount, the
economic rate of return is 43%.  Labor has not been shadow priced as TOT
mostly employs skilled staff of which there is no surplus in Thailand.
Certain duties and taxes have been deducted from costs.
7.        A sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of return shows that,
with 10% higher costs and 10% lower revenues, the rate of return will be 18%.
