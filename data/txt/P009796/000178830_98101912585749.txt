SUBERNAREKHA IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested IDA assistance in
financing the first four-year time-slice of the Subernarekha Irrigation
System in the Subernarekha River basin. The system will benefit the
States of Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. It will provide irrigation water
to about 250,000 ha in Bihar and Orissa, industrial and municipal water
supply in Bihar and will reduce flood damages in Orissa and West Bengal.
Agriculture and Irrigation in India
1.02      India has a population of about 700 M which is growing at an
annual rate of about 2.2%. Since 1960, per capita income grew at an
annual rate of 1.2% and reached US$240 in 1980. Although the average per
capita income has increased and access to public services has improved, in
general, there has been little change in the incomes of the vast masses of
urban and rural poor, who comprise about 50% of the total population.
Accordingly, GOI's development plans give priority to alleviating poverty
and creating employment, especially in rural areas.
1.03      Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and
contributes about 40% of GNP. It engages about 70% of the labor force and
provides the base for about 45% of India's exports. GOI has devoted
considerable resources to agricultural development, especially irrigation.
1.04      Irrigation development has been given a very high priority since
the beginning of the planning era in 1950. Some 53 M ha were developed by
1979/80, of which about 58% receive water from surface sources and 42%
from groundwater. It is estimated that the increased production resulting
from investment in irrigation has accounted for at least three-quarters of
agricultural growth since 1960. Presently, irrigated agriculture accounts
for about 60% of all agricultural output in India. However, production
levels in much of the irrigated area, especially the area irrigated from
surface sources, is considerably lower than the potential for reasons
explained below.
1.05      At independence Indian irrigation systems commanded some 23 M
ha.  Many of these systems were planned to provide famine protection had
limited or no storage and did not have sufficient control structures.
Water supply was largely unreliable. Irrigation projects of the early
1960s typically involved a storage or diversion dam and main conveyance
system only, leaving the construction of the distribution system from the
project outlets to the individual field to the farmers. As some of these
outlets served areas in excess of 100 ha, conveyance of water to the



-2-
far-,gate required construction of minor channel networks that were some-
times several kilometers long, In most projects, farmers were unable to
finance or organize construction of the minor channels without outside
assistance, which was rarely available, and this resulted in considerable
delays in the utlilization of water.
1.06      In the early 1970s, the concept of the Command Area Development
Authority (CADA) evolved. The main objectives of the CADA were to coor-
dinate the activities of the State Irrigation and Agriculture Departments
and to assist farmers in obtaining institutional credit for the construc-
tion of the minor systems and for land development. The results of this
approach have been below the expectations.  Coordination was not entirely
effective and the attempt to finance on-farm development through institu-
tional credit was unsuccessful since farmers had no confidence in the
reliability of water supply and were reluctant to undertake loan obliga-
tions. This experience indicates that: (i) more emphasis is required on
improving the effriciency and reliability of the conveyance system from the
water source to the irrigation outlets; and (ii) Government should assume
responsibility for conveying water to an outlet closer to farmgate in
order to facilitate the construction of watercourses conveying water to
each individual field. There are clear indications that when the .armer
is fully confident of his water supply he wiLl undertake investments in
modern Jnputs and make full use of the water supplied.  These concepts
have been used in the design of the proposed project.
The State of Bihar
1.07      Salienit Features.  The State of Bihar covers an area of 17.4 M
ha and has a population of about 69.8 M (1981) of which about 61.1 M (88%)
live in rural areas. 2It is one of the most densely populated states in
India (400 persons/km ) and a high proportion of its population (13%)
belongs to scheduled tribes and castes 1/ (para 3.08)n The health stand-
ards are low and there are cniy 34 hospital beds (compared with 71 for
India) and 23 doctors per 100,000 of population. The literacy rate is
26%, considerably lower than the all-India rate of 36%. Although Bihar is
rich in natural resources (including minerals, coal, lumber, uranium, and
iron) their development has been slow.
1.08      Development of Bihar's infrastructure has been slow,  Only about
24% of 'hydro-power potential has been developed and the total installed
power capacity of 910 HW (hydro 16%, thermal 84%) represents only 3% of
1/ The term T"scheduled castes and tribes" refers to lower castes and
tribal people of India scheduled in articles 341, 342 and 366 of the
Indian Constitution. Broadly, the groups embraced in the class-
ification are harijans and other low castes, and most tribes.



-3-
all-India capacity (the State accounts for about 10% of India's popula-
tion). Electricity has reached about 30% of Bihar's villages by 1981
compared to about 12i a decade ago. The road and railway densities are 46
and 31 km per 100 km , respectively, and compare favorably with the
national average.
1.09      The Economy.  The agricultural sector dominates the State's
economy and accounts for 72% of the State's Domestic Product (SDP),
employing about 83% of the working population. The industrial sector
accounts for only 13% of the SDP and employs 7% of the working population.
Per capita income is the lowest in India and in the period 1970/71-1976/77
averaged Rs 560 compared with Rs 860 for the country as a whole. During
the last decade it grew at an annual rate of 1.1%, which was considerably
lower than the average for India (1.6%).
1.10      The Agricultural Sector.  Bihar has three distinct geographic
regions: (i) the northern plains between the Ganges River and the Nepal
border, made up of young alluvial soils; (ii) the central plains consist-
ing of older alluviums lying along the southern banks of the Ganges; and
(iii) the Chotanagpur/Santhal Pargana plateau covering most of the
southern half of the State and made up of red and yellow catenary soils.
While soils in the northern and central plains are quite fertile, those of
the Chotanagpur/Santhal Pargana plateau have restricted agricultural
potential. The tropical monsoon climate is characterized by wet, hot
summer and dry, mild winter. Annual rainfall averages about 1,250 mm.
1.11      Most of the cultivable land is already cropped, and about 34% of
the 8.6 M ha of net cultivated land is irrigated, increasing the cropped
area effectively to 11.3 M ha (gross) through multiple cropping. About
90% of the cropped area is under foodgrains (mainly paddy, wheat and
maize). Sugarcane, jute and potatoes are becoming important cash crops,
but presently account for only 4% of the total area sown. Yields are
generally low (paddy 0.9, wheat 1.3, maize 1.0 tons/ha) and can be
increased considerably with effective irrigation and improved farming
methods. Fertilizer consumption averages 17.8 kg/ha (1980/81) compared
with 32.0 for India, and only 24% of the paddy area is under high yielding
varieties, compared with 42% for the country as a whole. During the
1970s, the annual growth rate of foodgrain production (0.84%) was much
lower than the population growth rate (2.17%). Hence, increasing rural
population resulted in stagnation--and in some years the decline--of rural
incomes. Population pressures have reduced the average size of farm
holdings from 1.5 ha in 1970/71 to 1.1 ha in 1976/77 (-27%). Bihar's
average farm size is amongst the smallest in the country (average for
India in 1976/77 was 2.28 ha). Moreover, the distribution of holding size
is highly skewed; the median size of farm is only about 0.6 hectares and
about 73% of the holdings are less than one hectare in size.



-4-
1.12      Since practically all the cultivable land is already under
cultivation, major expansion of production can come mainly from: (i)
yield increases; (ii) increased cropping intensity. This will require
both expansion of irrigation to new areas and more effective water use in
the areas already under irrigation. The State accords a high priority to
irrigation development as a means of raising both agricultural production
and the incomes of the rural poor.
1.13      Irrigation Development.  Bihar utilizable surface water resour-
ces are estimated as following:
M m3
North Bihar                            49,853
South Bihar                            13,994
Chotanagpur and Santhal
Parganas Plateau                     16,498
Total                            80,345
By 1978, about 21 billion m3 (26% of the potential) was utilized through
major and medium irrigation schemes.l/ In area terms it is estimated that
about 6.5 M ha can be irrigated through medium and major projects, and by
1980 a potential of 2.45 M ha (38%) had been created 2/ by such projects.
1.14      Groundwiter potential is estimated at 41 billion m  of which
about 6 billion m (15%) has been utilized. In area terms irrigation
potential from minor irrigation (minor surface schemes and groundwater) is
estimated at 5.9 M ha and the potential created by 1980/81 was about 2.4 M
ha (41%). Good yields of groundwater are available in North Bihar and in
the Gangetic alluvial tracts of South Bihar. In the Chotanagpur/Santhal
Pargana plateau, groundwater is available only in cracks and fissures in
the underlying rock, and minor surface as well as lift irrigation schemes
are the main source of minor irrigation.
1/  Irrigation schemes are classified as major (over 10,000 ha), medium
(2,000-10,000 ha) and minor (below 2,000 ha).
2/  "Potential" is created when an irrigation system is constructed to the
government outlet; the amount of potential created is equal to the
cultivable area under command of the outlets, multiplied by the design
irrigation intensity.



-5-
1.15      As indicated the State accords a high priority to irrigation.
Since the first Five Year Plan, this sector has continued to receive a
large share of Plan allocation, currently about 30%. Bihar's irrigation
development budget is the third largest among the States (after
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh).
1.16      Between 1969/70 and 1978/79 the rate of increase in irrigation
potential created was about 5% p.a. However, actual utilization of sur-
face irrigation has been well below the potential created, ranging from
66% to 77%. The main reasons for this poor performance are:
a. Inadequate conveyance system. In many cases, dams have been
built and water stored, but distribution systems were left
incomplete with outlet command areas (chaks) ranging from 40 ha
to over 100 ha. Because of this lag in the construction of the
minor distribution systems, the water was preempted at the head
of the system after water had become available in the larger
canals. This, combined with the ability of influential groups
to monopolize water, has resulted in large areas--especially at
the tailend of the commands--being left unirrigated.
b. Over optimistic design assumptions on crop water requirements
and conveyance and irrigation losses, which have not been
monitored under actual field conditions. This has led to a
significant overestimation of the area that can be irrigated
with the water available leaving a substantial gap between the
areas for which canals were built and the areas which actually
received water on a regular basis.
The State of Orissa
1.17      Salient Features.  The State of Orissa, covering some 15.5 M ha,
is located in the Eastern Region on the bay of Bengal and has a common
border with Bihar in the north for about 360 km. Its population of about
26.3 M is predominantly (89%) rural; the average population per vil-
lage--about 410--is the smallest in the country and only sid towns have a
population greater than 50,000. Population density (169/km in 1981) is
about 75% of the all-India average. About 39% of the population belong to
scheduled tribes and castes, a proportion which is the largest among the
States of India. About 60% of the population have incomes below the
poverty line (US$90 per capita). Health and education stanards are below
the all-Indian averages. Literacy rate is 34% and only 34 hospital beds
and 24 doctors are available per 100,000 of population.
1.18      Orissa has vast forest and mineral resources.  It ranks third in
India in forest resources, with 40% of its land area under forests, and is
rich in iron, chromite, manganese, coal, limestone and other minerals.
Despite some recent progress Orissa still lacks the infrastructure to



-6-
develop its natural resources. Only about 30% of hydro-power potential is
utilized and the total installed power capacity is 880 MW (hydro 72%,
thermal 28%). Rural electrification made great progress during the
1970's. Electricity had reached about 40% of villages by the year 1981
compared to only 8% in 1971. The road network densit! is about 74 km per
100 km and the railway network of 12.0 km per 100 km is about 40% lower
than the national average.
1.19      The economy of the State centers on agriculture, which provides
employment for 79% of Orissa's working population and accounts for 69% of
the SDP. The contribution of industry has been low, 12% of SDP and 7% of
employment, although the potential for further growth is high in view of
the State's mineral and forest wealth. The SDP is highly vulnerable to
vagaries of weather because the erratic distribution of rainfall often
results in severe flooding and droughts. Economic growth in Orissa has
been lagging behind the rest of India. Between 1970/71 and 1979/80, the
SDP per capita has declined at an annual rate of 1.4% compared with growth
of 1.6% for India as a whole.
1.20      The Agricultural Sector.  On the basis of physical features and
agro-climatic conditions, Orissa may be roughly divided into four zones:
(i) the Northern Plateau (23% of the State's area) characterized by hill
ranges rising to elevations of 600 m to 900 m above sea level; (ii) the
Central Table Land (23%), generally flat with slightly undulating topog-
raphy, rising to elevations of 1,000 ft; (iii) the Eastern Ghat Region
(36%) with hill ranges along with some plains and valleys lying between
them, with elevations of the plateaus ranging from 900 ft to 2,000 ft, and
(iv) the Coastal Plain (18%) characterized by a number of deltas. Two
types of soils are generally found in Orissa: residual soils of the
uplands, and transported alluvial soils of the lowlands. Residual soils
are predominantly lateritic, highly leached, acidic and low in nitrogen
and organic matter. They tend to be shallow, sandy and erodible and have
low water retention capacity. Transported soils are moderately fertile,
less acidic and more productive than the residual soils and are suitable
for paddy. The tropical monsoon climate is suitable for year round crop-
ping. Annual rainfall ranges from about 1,200 mm in the southern Coastal
Plain to about 1,700 mm in the Northern Plateau (para 3.04) and averages
about 1,500 mm. Some 85% of rainfall occurs during the kharif season
(June to October).
1.21      "Small" and "marginal" farmers (owning less than 2 ha) operate
over 75% of the holdings but control less than 40% of the cultivable land
while farmers with 5 ha or more account for only 7% of the holdings but
control 35%. The individual holding is highly fragmented. Orissa has
undertaken a land consolidation program which has progressed satisfac-
torily.



-7-
1.22      The net sown area is about 6.0 M ha (39% of the State area) of
which 1.1 M ha (18%) is irrigated. Paddy is the predominant crop, cover-
ing 70% of the cropped area, but yields are low, ranging from 1.0 tons/ha
for rainfed kharif to 2.1 tons/ha for irrigated rabi paddy, respectively.
High yielding paddy varieties account for most of the rabi crop but only
for about 10% of the kharif crop. Other crops such as cereals other than
paddy (7% of the cropped area), pulses (14%) and oilseeds (6%) are grown
mostly in upland areas. The yields of most crops have virtually stagnated
during the 1970s.
1.23      Irrigation Development.  Orissa has abundant water resources
that are largely undeveloped.  Its extensive network of r vers, streams
and drainage ways annually discharges about 100 billion m into the Bay
of Bengal. In addition, the annual flow of groundwater into the sea is
estimated at some 30 billion m . Theoretically, these water resources
could irrigate some 15 M ha. However, the potential for utilization of
these resources is limited by a number of factors: (i) more than 80% of
the surface flow occurs during the June-September period when the need for
irrigation water is the lowest; (ii) topography is not conducive to the
construction of major dams; (iii) inflows from upper riparian States are
likely to be substantially reduced as a result of irrigation development;
and (iv) about 80% of the groundwater resources are in the Coastal Plain
which is already well served by surface irrigation systems. The ultimate
irrigation potential and the part already developed, by source of irriga-
tion, are summarized below:
Ultimate Potential      Potential Created 1978/79
Kharif   Rabi   Total   Kharif      Rabi      Total

1.24      Irrigation development started in the second half of the
nineteenth century in the delta areas where about 150,000 ha were brought
under kharif irrigation. During the first half of this century, the canal
irrigated area remained virtually unchanged.  However, since 1950 the
Government of Orissa (GOO) has completed two major irrigation projects
(Salandi and Hirakud) and substantially extended the Mahanadi delta sys-
tem. Initially irrigation development was concentrated in the more



-8-
prosperous delta areas of large rivers. This resulted in uneven distribu-
tion of irrigation benefits and regionally unbalanced growth. In order to
correct this imbalance GOO started around 1960 to construct a number of
medium irrigation projects (MIP) throughout the State, particularly in
areas where large scale irrigation and groundwater development are not
feasible. Investment in irrigation has been given a high priority and
currently accounts for about 28% of Plan allocation. Since the start of
the Fifth Five Year Plan in 1974/75, the emphasis changed from major to
medium projects, and GOO has made a concerted effort to speed up implemen-
tation. The proportion of irrigation sector expenditures on MIP increased
from 41% in the Fourth Plan to 59% in the Fifth Plan. The planned propor-
tion for MIP in the Sixth Plan is about 44%.
1.25      A further decline in the proportion of funds allocated to MIP
is likely in the future since Orissa has several major dams and reservoirs
which have been completed or will be completed in the near future (Ren-
gali, Upper Kolab, Upper Indravati, Subernarekha). Most of these are
multipurpose dams for power generation and irrigation, and power require-
ments are often the dominant consideration in determining the timing of
their construction. With the cost of constructing these dams becoming
"sunk", development of the water conveyance network in the areas commanded
by them will provide a higher return to investment than the MIP.
Previous Bank Group Assistance
1.26      The Bank has assisted both Bihar and Orissa with the implementa-
tion of several agricultural development projects. The Sone Irrigation
Project (Credit 21-IN, 1962, US$15 M) in Bihar and the Salandi Irrigation
Project (Credit 14-IN, 1961, US$8 M) in Orissa were amongst the first
irrigation projects supported by the Bank Group in India. The Bank has
supported development of minor irrigation in Bihar through Bihar Agricul-
tural Credit Project (Credit 440-IN, 1973, US$32 M) and in both States
through the series of ARDC general line of credit projects (ARDC I, II, &
III). Following the Eastern States Foodgrain Review (1976) the Bank has
launched extension and research projects in Bihar and Orissa (Credit
761-IN, 1977, US$8 M in Bihar and Credit 682-IN, 1977, US$20 M in Orissa).
The BankBank has also assisted Orissa with development of medium irriga-
tion through the Orissa Irrigation Development Project (Credit 740-IN,
1977, US$58 M) and is supporting construction of two new barrages on the
Mahanadi River through the Mahanadi Barrages Project (Credit 1078-IN,
1981, US$83 M). Of the on-going projects, the progress of Bihar Extension
Project (Credit 761-IN) has been especially slow. However, the Government
of Bihar (GOB) has recently taken steps to expedite project implementa-
tion. The progress of Credits 682-IN, 740-IN and 1078-IN has been satis-
factory. A second phase of Credit 740-IN has been scheduled for FY83.

II. THE SUBERNAREKHA IRRIGATION SYSTEM
Background
2.01      The Subernarekha is an interstate river flowing through the
States of Bihar, West Benga  and Orissa into the Bay of Bengal.  Its
catchment area is 18,950 km of which about 70% is in Bihar. In its lower
reaches the river cannot carry the heavy flood discharges and frequently
spills over its banks and inundates large areas (up to 100,000 ha) in West
Bengal and Orissa. Development proposals for Subernarekha were submitted
by GOB to GOI as early as 1973. However, plans could not be finalized
until the riparian States had reached an agreement on the sharing of
Subernarekha water. Negotiations between the States were concluded in a
series of meetings between the Chief Ministers of Bihar, Orissa and West
Bengal culminating in an agreement termed "The Tripartite Agreement" (TPA)
which was signed in New Delhi on August 7, 1978.
2.02      The Tripartite Agreement.  Under the TPA, the Subernarekha water
will be shared as following:
Mm  1/         %
Bihar                   3,947           71
Orissa                  1,480           27
West Bengal               124            2
Total               5,551          100
Other important TPA stipulations are:
(i)  the storage capacities and the relative entitlement of the
participating States;
(ii)  the order of execution of the various components;
(iii)  the institutional arrangement for construction and regulation
of the joint works;

(iv) flood moderation arrangements; and
(v) the sharing of the costs.
The TPA is reprinted verbatim as Annex 1l
Project Formulation and Objectives
2.03      Project Preparation.  Assistance with project preparation was
initially provided by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. In 1979 GOB and
GOO contracted the preparation of a feasibility report (completed August,
1981) to the Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS). WAPCOS is a
GOI undertaking providing consultancy services in the spheres of planning
and development of irrigation and associated activities. It has prepared
feasibility reports for Bank-financed projects in India and has provided
consultancy services in several developing countries.
2.04      Flexibility in Project Design.  Project preparation was based on
the best data and the most suitable technical solutions available at
preparation time. However, completion of the .entire Subernarekha Irriga-
tion System (SIS) 1! will take several years and during this period there
will be considerable improvements in the state of knowledge of irrigation
development aspects, which could benefit the SIS, resulting from: (i)
extensive studies and pilot experiments which are being conducted
throughout India as well as those which will be conducted under the
project; and (ii) experience with the operation and maintenance of recent
irrigation projects in India which were designed to improved standa-:ds.
Better solutions to the following issues related to irrigation can be
expected: (i) design of the minor system part of irrigation systems; (ii)
extent of seepage losses; (iii) improved controls (including automatic
controls) and utilization of system storage; (iv) type and extent of
lining; (v) effect of lining on system operation and maintenance; (vi)
operation of the irrigation system above the chak outlet; and (vii)
organization of water distribution at chak and sub-chak level. In order
to benefit from such findings and utilize them to continuously improve
project design, the approach to design must be flexible. Thus, although
provisional design decisions have been made for the whole system to enable
its economic evaluation, only those related to components whose construc-
tion will begin in the first phase can be regarded as final (e.g. dams,
1/ The term SIS refers here to the multiphase program for constructing
and developing the irrigation system which will be implemented through
several phases (projects) each covering a time-slice. The first
time-slice (Phase I) described in this report is the project proposed
for IDA support.



-11-
Galudih barrage, main canals). Project planners will have to take into
consideration the uncertainty of future demand patterns for water. Since
it is difficult (if possible at all) to project accurately future changes
in cropping patterns and irrigation technology, design decisions should
consider the need to make the system easily adaptable to changing require-
ments (e.g. reuse of return flows, greater use of system storage, etc.).
This will often involve only a small incremental cost. To facilitate
flexibility in the utilization of water, canals have been planned for
capacities which also take into account future changes in the cropping
pattern. Organizational arrangements which will facilitate flexibility in
design are outlined in para 6.28.
2.05      Objectives.  The main objectives of the Subernarekha Irrigation
System are to:
(i)  provide a reliable water supply for irrigation of about
255,000 ha of cultivable command area (CCA) in Bihar,
Orissa and West Bengal 1/ (see para 2.10);
(ii)  provide water for industrial and municipal (I&M) use
(mainly in Bihar); and
(iii)  reduce flood damage in Orissa and West Bengal.
The SIS will increase considerably both the agricultural production (para
7.05) and the net incomes of cultivators and laborers in the project area
(para 8.02). It will also facilitate development of both private and
public sector enterprises. Being the first Bank supported irrigation
project in Bihar (in recent years), it will provide an opportunity to
influence irrigation development in this State since it is expected that
design, operation and maintenance criteria developed in SIS will be util-
ized also in other irrigation projects.
SIS Components 2/
2.06      The SIS main source of storage water will be two dams/reservoirs
located in Bihar: (i) Chandil; and (ii) Ichha. The main components of
SIS are shown in Map IBRD 16235 and briefly described below.
1/ West Bengal's share of the water is small, and will be sufficient for
irrigating about 5,000 ha.
2/ The following hierarchy of water distribution network is used in this
report: main canal, branch canal, distributary, minor, sub-minor,
watercourse, and field channel. The sub-minor conveys the water to
the 40 ha chak outlet from which watercourses deliver water to the 5-8
ha sub-chak outlet. The field channel conveys the water from the
sub-chak outlet to individual holdings. The term "minor system"
refers to the distribution network below the distributaries.



-12-
2.07      Works Located in Bihar.  These will include the following:
a. Chandil Dam and Canals
(i)  Chandil Dam and reservoir (1,963 Mm ) on the main
stem of the Subernarekha River. It will store water for
irrigating about 80,000 ha in Bihar and West Bengal,
and for meeting requirement fSr industrial and
municipal water (about 654 Mm at full development)
of the Jamshedpur-Adityapur area in Bihar. It will also
provide storage for flood moderation benefiting Orissa and
West Bengal.
(ii) Chandil Canals. the 134 km long Chandil Left Canal will
supply water for irrigation and for IE&M in Bihar and convey
to West Bengal its share of water from Chandil reservoir.
The 38 km long Chandil Right Canal will provide water for
irrigation and I&M. Planning of this canal is at an initial
stage. The implications of its integration in the system
will be studied under the project (para 4.18).
b. Ichha Dam and Canals
(i)  Ichha Dam and reservoir (1,042 Mm ) on Kharkai River
(a tributary of the Subernarekha River). The storage will be
shared by Bihar (73.5%) and Orissa (26.5%). BiKar share of
the water will meet requirements for I&M (72 Mm ) and
irrigation in the areas commanded by Ichha and Kharkai
Barrage canals. Orissa's share will be released to Kharkai
River and diverted at Galudih Barrage into Galudih Right Canal.
(ii)  Ichha Canals.  Ichha right (32 km) and left (19 km) canals
will supply water for irrigating about 60,000 ha and for I&M
in Bihar.
c. Galudih Barrage and Canals. The barrage will be constructed on
the main stem of Subernarekha River, downstream of its confluence
with Kharkai River. It will be operated in conjunction with Ichha
and Chandil dams as a control structure diverting water into two
canals: (i) the 63.4 km long Galudih Right (Link) Canal conveying
water to the Orissa border and serving also direct outlets in Bihar;
and (ii) Galudih Left Canal, 51 km long, providing water for
irrigation and I&M in Bihar.
d. Kharkai Barrage and Canals. The barrage which will be located
on the Kharkai River will divert water to Kharkai Left and Right
Canals for irrigation and I&M. As there will be ample water supply



-13-
in the first stages from Chandil and Ichha dams, its construction
will be deferred to a subsequent phase. In the intermediate period
Kharkai Barrage Right Canal's command area can be supplied either
through Ichha Right Canal or from Chandil Dam through Chandil Right
Canal. The optimal plan and timing for construction of the Kharkai
Barrage and its canals will be studied under the project.
2.08      Works Located in Orissa.  These will include:  (i) the 35.6 km
Subernarekha Main Canal which is the extension in Orissa of Galudih Right
(Link) Canal; (ii) three command area storage reservoirs with the follow-
ing planned active storage capacities:

and (iii) a network of canals and minor distribution systems to serve about
90,000 ha.2/
2.09      Works Located in West Benga\.  Under the TPA, West Bengal will
be entitled to ths use of about 62 Mm (50,000 acre feet) per annum of
which about 12 Mm (10,000 acre feet) will be conveyed free of charge
through Chandil Left Canal and the balance will be used below 3Kokpara (on
Bihar-West Bengal border). A storage capacity of about 31 Mm (25,000
acre feet) will be provided for West Bengal in the Chandil Dam to
facilitate utilization of its share of the water. West Bengal's share
should be sufficient for irrigating about 5,000 ha of CCA but plans for
its utilization have not yet been finalized.

Flood Control
2.11      Floods in the lower reaches of Subernarekha River have been
causing heavy damages in both Orissa and West Bengal almost every year.
In the period 1965 to 1981 (16 years), significant flood damages occured
in Orissa in 14 of the years (88%).1/ The area affected ranged from 2,550
to 64,400 ha (average 34,400 ha); the population affected ranged from
10,000 to 1,023,000 (average 277,000) and the value of damages ranged from
Rs 1.2 M to Rs 92.7 M (average Rs 36.3 M in 1982 prices).
2.12      In 1972 GOI constituted a committee to examine proposals for
flood control which were formulated by GOB, GOO and GOWB. The committee
studied alternative locations for flood moderation storages, flood modera-
tion through embankments and a combination of storage reservoirs and
embankments. It recommended a combination of flood storage in Chandil Dam
and river embankments in West Bengal and Orissa (Report of the Suber-
narekha Committee dated August 1973).
2.13      During the negotiations between the riparian States it had bees
agreed that the Chandil Dam will have a flood storage capacity of 463 Mm
(.375 million acre-feet) for "flood moderation benefits in West Bengal and
Orissa" (Annex 1, para 2.2.1). In addition, Orissa and West Bengal agreed
to discuss and plan for a simultaneous and co-ordinated execution of an
embankment system in consultation with GOI (Annex 1, para 3.3) but this
has not yet taken place.

b/ Bihar and Orissa are to share the cost as following:
Galudih Barrage - in proportion to the annual designed withdrawal
by each; according to the Central Water Commission
of GOI (CWC) this will amount to 86.2% Orissa and
13.8% Bihar.
Galudih Right (Link) Canal - in proportion to cumec/km withdrawals;
according to CWC estimate this will amount to
94% Orissa and 6% Bihar.
Phasing
2.15      The SIS components are closely interdependent for two main
reasons:
(a)  More than 50% of the command area can be supplied with
water from either Chandil or Ichha dams. These include the
areas to be served through the Galudih complex (including the
entire Orissa part) and the area to be served by the Kharkai
Barrage Right Canal (para 2.07). Thus efficient utilization
of the water resources will require integrated planning, con-
struction and operation of the entire system.
(b)  Since the riparian States do not have the same priorities for
implementation of the main components, they have agreed that
"the execution of the Kharkai 1/ and Chandil dams and Galudih
barrage project along with the right bank canal up to Orissa
1/ Ichha dam is referred to in the TPA as "Kharkai dam".



-16-
border will be taken up together at a time" (Annex 1, para
2.3.4).
In order to avoid long gestation periods both GOB and GOO plan to allocate
sufficient funds and manpower in order to complete the entire system in
the shortest possible time. It is anticipated that by the end of year 9
(1990/91) the development of SIS will be sufficiently complete for water
to reach most (about 85%) of the command area in Bihar. In Orissa water
will reach most of the command area by the end of year 11.  This would be
feasible since Bihar, which will bear most of the cost, has one of the
largest irrigation development budgets in India (para 1.15) and in both
states the SIS would be the focal point of major irrigation development in
the 1980s.
2.16      The proposed project will finance the first phase in the
development of SIS consisting of a four-year time-slice. During this
phase works will be mostly in Bihar and their magnitude will be con-
strained mainly by the need to increase the engineering staff implementing
the project (about four fold in the first phase). In order to complete
the SIS in the shortest possible period it will be essential to proceed as
expeditiously as possible with construction as soon as possible. Con-
centration during the first phase will be on Chandil complex which is at
the most advanced stage of preparation. The second area of concentration
will be the Galudih complex which includes the key components for con-
veyance of water to Orissa. Work will have to start also on the Ichha
complex to ensure that it is completed on time to serve the area it com-
mands. Similar priorities will carry over into the following phases.
Such phasing will ensure a high level of economic viability (see sen-
sitivity tests, para 8.08) and satisfy the TPA requirements.
2.17      The first phase will be an adequate time for conducting studies
and investigations needed for planning the following phases, such as: (i)
system design investigations (Kharkai Barrage, Chandil Right Canal and
advantages of its linkage to the Kharkai system, etc.); (ii) planning and
design details for the minor distribution system; (iii) operation and
maintenance plans and estimates; and (iv) resettlement of displaced per-
sons.

and provision of irrigation is summarized below:

Water Supply and Demand
2.19      The Subernarekha River and its tributaries in Bihar are the
source of water for the SIS. Reservoir inflows have been estimated from
rainfall-runoff correlations using stream gauging records for Subernarekha
River. The period 1954-1978 1/ was used for computerized reservoir opera-
tion studies and water balance computations which take into account
upstream irrigation use, agricultural and I&M water demand, effective
rainfall, evaporation and spills. Crop water requirements have been
calculated in accordance with the methodology outlined in FAO Publication
No. 26 utilizing the modified Penman method. The reservoir operation
studies were based on the assumption that at full development stage the
predominant kharif crop will be paddy whereas the rabi/hot weather crop-
ping pattern will include a mix of wheat, gram, hot weather paddy, hot
weather groundnuts and other crops. In the intermediate period between
the beginning of irrigation and full development, water availability per
ha of CCA will exceed full development allocation by up to 60% and a
1/ Rainfall records are available at several sites from 1954 on.



-18-
larger proportion of the area may be planted to hot weather crops which
are water-intensive.l/ In general, the water supply is adequate to meet
the projected full development water requirements in 9 out of 10 years.
To ensure full utilization of water, availability of reservoir water will
be assessed first in October to ascertain the rabi area which can be
planted, and again in January to determine water allocation to hot weather
crops. More details on water supply and demand are in Supplementary Data
Volume (SDV) Annex 4.
2.20      Groundwater and reuse of return flows could have an important role
ultimately in increasing areas irrigated from SIS facilities. Orissa has
additional areas that can be served by gravity extensions and both states
have additional areas within or adjacent to the project area that can be
served by pump lifts. In most of the Bihar part development of groundwater
will be limited to large diameter dug wells or dug-cum-borehole wells;
tubewells could be developed in the Chakulia-Baharagora tract in the
Southeast.
2.21      Water Quality.  Chemical tests of surface waters in Subernarekha
and Kharkai Rivers show excellent quality for irrigated agriculture pur-
poses. Electrical conductivity is 400 to 500 micromhos/cm compared to a
tolerance limit of 3,000; pH values, boron content, sodium absorption
ratio and other water quality parameters are well within permitted limits.
Groundwater in Bihar is also suitable for irrigation. Total dissolved
solids approach 1,200 milligrams/l and 1,200 micromhos/cm for electrical
conductivity. Chlorides range up to 248 compared to acceptable limit of
600. The water in the three command area reservoirs in Orissa show elec-
trical conductivity of 250 micromhos/cm or less and sodium absorption
ratios of less than 0.40 compared to 2.0 for Subernarekha Rivers in Bihar
at low river stages. The quality of groundwater in Orissa is well within
acceptable limits for irrigation.
Municipal and Industrial Wastewater Disposal
2.22      The Bihar part of the project area includes two major population
centers and many smaller communities, few of which provide the inhabitants
with domestic wastewater disposal systems. There is a significant
industrial development, principally centered around Jamshedpur, whose
industrial wastewater disposal practices have an impact on downstream
water quality. While domestic wastewater would not pose a major threat to
the quality of water for irrigation purposes, it should be treated before
discharge to safeguard downstream domestic and industrial water users.
1/ However, adequate precautions will have to be taken to ensure that
farmers are well aware of the temporary nature of such additional
allocation of water (over full development allocation).



-19-
2.23      Industrial wastewater, especially from the heavy industries in
the Jamshedpur area, can be expected to contain substantial amounts of
metals and other toxic materials and requires treatment. Most of the
wastewater is produced by major industrial concerns which are already
actively engaged in pollution abatement. A relatively small proportion of
the wastewater is produced by small industrial enterprises (e.g. metal
plating shops), who have neither the technical know-how nor the capital
required to install adequate waste treatment facilities and therefore pose
some danger to river water quality. On the basis of steps already taken
as well as those planned (para 6.34), it appears likely that adequate
effluent quality standards will be reached during the next three to four
years.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location (Map IBRD 16235)
3.01      Bihar.  The project area lies entirely in Singhbhum District in
the Chotanagpur Plateau. It is bounded by the Chandil Left Canal in the
Northwest, West Bengal in the Northeast and both West Bengal and Orissa in
the East. The entire area is well connected by a network of roads and
railways and approachable by air through Ranchi. The main towns are
Jamshedpur and Chaibasa (District Headquarters).
3.02      Orissa portion lies mainly in Mayurbhanj District and to a
lesser extent, in Balasore District. The area is bounded by Orissa-Bihar
border and Subernarekha River in the north, the Burhabalang River on the
west and the South Eastern Railway line. Baripada, the district head-
quarters of Mayurbhanj and the only large town, is centrally located
within the project command astride the Madras-Calcutta National Highway
(N.H.) 5. Baripada is also connected with Calcutta by N.H. 6 and to
Jamshedpur by N.H. 5.
Climate (Table 2)
3.03      The climate is tropical with three distinct seasons:  the kharif
or wet season (June-October), the rabi or dry season (November-February)
and the hot weather (March-May). The mean monthly temperature ranges from
18.9 C in January to 33.1C in May. Most of the rainfall occurs during
the southwest monsoon period from mid-June to mid-October. The wettest
month is August (315-376 mm in Bihar and 448 mm in Orissa) and the driest
is December. The average annual rainfall in Bihar is 1,300 mm and in
Orissa about 1,700 mm, of which about 90% falls in the wet season. There
are considerable variations in both tne amount and the distribution of the
monsoon rainfall. Dry spells occuring during the monsoon may last as long



-20-
as 15 to 20 days and often cause substantial reduction in yields. Rain-
fall during the dry season occurs in occasional showers and is inadequate
for crop production.
Topography
3.04      The Bihar command area lies at an elevation of 76-230 m above
sea level and forms an inclined plain from east to west. The physical
terrain of the area is undulating and broken by alternating ridges and
depressions which for the most part form ditches and streams. The slope
of the area varies extensively: about 90% of the area has slopes of less
than 3% and the remaining 10% comprises undulating uplands having a slope
of 3-8%. The Orissa command area lies at a much lower elevation than the
Bihar area (15-90 meters) with gently undulating topography. The area is
characterized by broad ridges intersected by narrow valleys with
well-defined drainage channels becoming almost flat as the command area
approaches the coastal plain. Most of the Orissa area has slopes of 1-5%.
Some 60% of the project area have been bunded and land-shaped for rainfed
paddy cultivation.
Soils
3.05      The soils in the project area can be grouped into two types:
(i) residual soils of the uplands and (ii) transported alluvial soils
mainly in the lowlands of Orissa. The residual soils occupy most of the
command areas in both Bihar and Orissa (over 90%). They are red and
yellow laterites which are leached, acidic, and low in both organic matter
and nitrogen. They tend to be shallow, erodible, somewhat sandy and have
low water retention capacity. Land productivity is, therefore, con-
strained by soil fertility and water holding capacity. However, with
proper soil conservation measures and adequate use of fertilizers and
manure to improve soil fertility, these soils will be suitable for both
irrigated paddy and upland crops. The transported alluvial soils are
moderately fine textured clay loams, less permeable and poorly drained.
They are moderately fertile, less acidic and more productive than the
residual soils. These soils are suited mainly for paddy cultivation.
Population and Land Tenure
3.06      Population.  The agricultural population in the project area is
estimated at about 1.3 million of which about 800,000 are in the Bihar
part and 500,000 in the Orissa part. The average family size is about 5.
3.07      Holding Size.  The average farm-size is about 1.5 ha in both the
Bihar and Orissa parts. Over 90% of the holdings are wholly-owned and
self-operated. The distribution of holdings by size is shown in the
following table:

a/ Data from 1976/77; based on Singbhum District in Bihar and
Mayurbhanj District in Orissa.
The data indicate greater equity of land ownership in the Orissa part.
While in both the Bihar and Orissa parts about 3/4 of the holdings are
less than 2.0 ha in size, in the Bihar part nearly half the holdings (46%)
are smaller than 0.5 ha and operate only 7% of the land. On the other
hand, over one third of the land (38%) in the Bihar part is cultivated by
7% of the landholders operating 5 ha or more. In Orissa the corresponding
proportions are 15% (land) and 3% (landholders of 5 ha +).
3.08      The Tribal Population.  About 50% of the population in the
project area belong to communities who have been enlisted as "Scheduled
Tribes" in accordance with the provisions of Article 342 of the Constitu-
tion of India. There are 30 Scheduled Tribes in Bihar and 62 in Orissa.
The tribal people have had regular economic relationships with the
non-tribal and generally reside in the same villages. Literacy rates of
the tribal population are lower than the average for each State. In Bihar
it is 17% for tribals compared with 20% for the entire State. In Orissa
the corresponding proportions are 9.5% and 26%. Agriculture, especially
arable farming, is the main occupation of the tribal people and about 90%
of the tribal workers are engaged in agriculture. In both the States
tribal people have customary forest rights and are allowed to take forest
products free of royalties. The tribal people have been slow in adapting
modern technologies and their standard of living has been generally lower
than that of the rest of the population.
3.09      Both Bihar and Orissa have taken steps to prevent exploitation
of the tribal population. Various acts and regulations forbid sale of
land owned by tribals to non-tribals without approval of the District
Collector, provide debt relief and forbid bonded labor. In both the



-22-
States there is a specific Five Year Sub-Plan for development of
predefined areas having a high concentration of tribals. The main objec-
tives of the Sub-Plan is to narrow the gap between the level of develop-
ment of the tribal and other areas and to improve the quality of life of
the tribal communities. It outlines development programs for agriculture
and other sectors (including infrastructure) and for services. The bulk
of the resources for the Sub-Plan is derived from each State's Plan funds.
These are supplemented by special assistance from GOI which adds about 10%
to the Sub-Plan allocation. The entire project area in both States is
with the area covered by the Sub-Plan.
Present Cropping Pattern
3.10      In both the Bihar and Orissa parts of the project area, farming
is mainly limited to the kharif season utilizing monsoon rains.l/ Paddy
which is the most important crop, is grown on the terraces or low-lying
areas where the soils are relatively heavier. There are early and late
kharif paddies. Early paddy (autumn paddy) is grown on uplands or on the
terraces. It is broadcast dry at the beginning of monsoon rains and
harvested in September. Late paddy (winter paddy) is either broadcast or
transplanted. The broadcast crop is sown in mid-June mainly in the upper
terraces and harvested towards the end of October and the beginning of
November. Transplanting of the late crop, is practised mainly in the
low-lying area; it is planted in late July and is harvested in December
and January. In a typical year kharif paddy is grown on about 57% and 87%
of the Bihar and Orissa areas respectively. Other kharif crops include
maize, pulses, vegetables and other crops and occupy about 5% in Bihar and
9% in Orissa. During the rabi season, only a limited area (4% in Bihar,
7% in Orissa) is under cultivation due to low soil moisture and inadequate
post-monsoon rains. These include wheat, potato, gram and, to a smaller
extent, oilseeds and groundnut. The present cropping intensity in the
project area is about 66% in the Bihar part and 103% in the Orissa part of
the project area.
Input Use
3.11      Present use of fertilizers is minimal and limited mostly to
paddy, wheat and vegetables. According to local statistics, in 1980/81
only about 310 tons (in nutrient) of fertilizers was supplied to Bihar and
1/  There are a number of minor irrigation schemes in the areas which were
originally designed to irrigate some 9,000 ha in Bihar and 7,000 ha in
Orissa during the kharif season. However, they now irrigate only
about 15% of their design areas due to design deficiencies as well as
poor operation and maintenance. Crops grown in these areas receive
less than the optimal amount of water required for good growth.



-23-
400 tons to Orissa areas an average of 2.2 kg and 4.3 kg per ha, respec-
tively. The use of plant protection chemicals is negligible except for
limited application of insecticides to vegetables and paddy. Only about
5% of the farmers use good quality seeds (paddy, wheat and maize) and the
rest meet their seed requirements from previous harvests or purchase from
neighbors. The project area is well provided with draft animals. On the
average, there is one pair of bullock per ha of cultivated land.
Crop Yields
3.12      Most of the paddies grown in the project area consist of local
varieties producing low yields. For autumn paddy, the farmers use early
maturing coarse grain varieties (Gora and Bala) which yield between
0.6-0.9 t/ha. Yields of local winter paddy varieties (Pankaj, Jagarnath,
etc.) vary considerably from year to year, averaging 1.3 t/ha in years
with good rainfall but less than 1.0 t/ha in less favorable years. For
these paddies, the use of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals is
limited. Some high yielding varieties (Ratna, Jaya and Sita) are grown on
a limited area but their yields, ranging Detween 1.6-1.8 are below their
potential, mainly due to the dependency on rainfall and poor cultural
practices. Hybrid maize (GS2 and GS5) and some composite varieties (Ganga
5 and Vijaya) have been grown in the area since the early 1970's. Yields
of maize are low at 0.7 t/ha due to inadequate use of fertilizers and
plant protection chemicals. High yielding varieties of wheat have
recently been introduced into the area but since many farmers are not yet
familiar with its cultural practices and varieties, the yields are low
ranging between 1.0-1.4 t/ha. Pulses are grown for home consumption and
their low yields (about 0.5 t/ha) offer scope for improvement. In general
as farmers have to rely mostly on rainfall, they tend to use local
varieties, practice traditional cultural methods, and apply limited amount
of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals. As a result the yields of
most crops are low.
IV. THE PROJECT
Scope and Objectives
4.01      The project will finance the first phase of  'IS covering a
four-year time-slice of the irrigation development works and associated
activities. The overall long-term objectives of SIS are summarized in
para 2.05. The specific objectives of the first-phase are to: (i)
achieve the physical targets assigned to the project; (ii) establish the
institutional framework and build up the Irrigation Department estab-
lishment required for implementation of the works located in Bihar (includ-
ing the joint components); and (iii) carry out studies and technical
investigations to provide answers and technical solutions required for the



-24-
preparation of follow-up phases. As indicated, the emphasis of construc-
tion activities will be on the Chandil and Galudih complexes which
together will account for over 70% of the project cost (see discussion on
phasing in paras 2.15 and 2.16).
4.02      Project Components.  The principal components financed under the
project time-slice would be (% to be completed by project end is in brack-
ets):
(a) Chandil Complex: Chandil Dam (50%) and Chandil Left
Canal (30%).
(b) Ichha Complex: Ichha Dam (20%) and Ichha Canals (20%).
(c) Galudih Complex: Galudih Barrage (36%) and Galudih Right
(Link) Canal (22%).
(d) Kharkai Barrage Canals: Construction work on three distri-
butaries amounting to about 18% of the total cost of Kharkai
Barrage Right Canal.
(e) Minor Distribution System Block Development: About 21,000 ha
at various stages of construction.
(f) Pilot Irrigation Areas: About 250 ha each in Bihar and
Orissa.
(g) Training: Establishment of facilities for training in
minor system development and water management in Bihar
and Orissa (paras 6.09 and 6.10). Training of displaced
persons (para 6.19).
(h) Water Pollution Control: Quality monitoring stations,
laboratory equipment and training of sanitary engineers
(para 6.36).
(i) Monitoring and Evaluation, Studies and Research.
Detailed Features
4.03      Chandil Dam (para 2.07 a(i)) would be a 55.2 m high 720 m long
composite dam on the Subernarekha River. The spillway is a concrete
overflow section 228 m long with concrete or rock masonry non-overflow
sections and earth flank dams on eaSh side.  The gross storage capacity
would be 1,963 Mm , of which 204 IM  would be "inactive storage", 463 Mm
for flood moderation and 1,296 Mm "active" (conservation) storage. The
latter is about 37% of the average runoff under present conditions (45%
with projected upstream depletions). During the project period, the



-25-
concrete/masonry sections and the earth flank dams would be started and
brought to 50% completion status. A contract for 12 15.0 x 15.0 m radial
gates would also be awarded.
4.04      Chandil Left Canal (para 2.07 a(ii)).  The Chandil Left Canal is
a contour canal 134.4 km long with head discharge of 84.1 cumecs. The
four sections (out of a total of 13 sections) of the canal which will be
undertaken under the project are in rough terrain involving difficult side
hill construction.
4.05      Galudih barrage (para 2.07 c) would be a gated diversion struc-
ture 436.0 m long with 25 gates 15.25 x 7.62 m size located on the Suber-
narekha River some 60 miles upstream of the Bihar/Orissa border.  Con-
struction of access road and construction camp is underway. Award of
contract is scheduled for October, 1983 and construction is scheduled for
completion in May, 1989. About 40% of the base concrete structure and 10%
of the gate fabrication will be completed under the project.
4.06      Galudih Right (Link) Canal (para 2.07 c) taking off from Galudih
Barrage enroute to Orissa border will be 63.4 km long and its head dis-
charge will be 111.6 cumecs. Some 25% of the earthwork and 10% of the
lining and structures would be completed under the project.
4.07      Ichha Dam (para 2.07 b(i)) would be a 38.4 m high composite dam,
1,216 m long in the river section of which 301.2 m would be spillway. In
addition to the main dam there are five earth saddle dams (or dykes) of
varying heights aggregating 6,017 m in lngth along the abutments.  The3
gross storage capacity would be 1,042 Mm and the active storage 925 Mm
which is 87% of the average river flow after accounting for upstream
depletions. Camp buildings and utilities and access road construction
would be completed during the project period and a start (about 14%) made
on the masonry dam sections and one saddle dam. Completion (exclusive of
spillway gates) is scheduled for 1989/90 which is also the scheduled
completion date for Chandil Dam. Construction work on access road and
buildings have started.
4.08      Ichha Canals (para 2.07 b(ii) would obtain water from separate
headworks located in saddles on the abutments of Ichha Dam.  The 19.2 km
long Left Canal with a head discharge of 18.0 cumec will feed into the
existing Roro Canal system presently fed by a diversion weir on Roro
River.  This existing system will be expanded and modernized to project
design standards.  The Right Canal will be 32 km long (head discharge 48.0
cumec) with one large distributary (Haldipekhar - 18.2 km) and six smaller
distributaries. Excavation works in about 25% of the right canal and 35%
of the left canal will be completed by the end of the project.
4.09      Construction will begin on the 103.5 km long Murakati dis-
tributary (a distributary of Kharkai Barrage Right Canal, see para 2.07 d)



-26-
which will run along the right side of Galudih Right Canal up to the
Bihar-Orissa border and serve about 9,000 ha. The area served by this
distributary has a high concentration of tribals (para 3.08) and its early
development would be essential to reduce local opposition to land acquisi-
tion for Galudih Right (Link) Canal (since it would mainly serve Orissa).
Construction will start also on the Jadugoda and Marda distributaries of
Kharkai Right Canal. The three distributaries will be supplied initially
from the Ichha system (through Edal distributary of Ichha Right Canal) and
at a later stage from Kharkai Barrage (para 4.18).
4.10      Block Development and Drainage.  The minor irrigation distribu-
tion system below main branch and distributary canals consists of minors,
and subminors down to the 40 ha government outlet, watercourses from there
to the 5-8 ha sub-chak outlet and field channels to individual holdings.
Typically a block (2,500 to 4,000 ha) corresponds to the jurisdiction of
an Irrigation Department O&M section. All the work in a block will be
completed before it is turned over (after a commissioning period) to the
operating sections of the Irrigation Department. During the project
time-slice about 21,000 ha of block development works will be either
completed or at various stages of construction.
4.11       li_ implementation sequence in each block would be as following:
(i) alignment surveys for distributary canals and farm link roads; (ii)
planning and construction of roads (where needed, road works should be
completed at least one year before the beginning of block development
works); (iii) planning and construction of sub-distributary and minor
canals with concurrent detailed topographic survey; (iv) planning and
construction of the subminors and watercourses down to the sub-chak out-
let; (v) construction of buildings and a radio communication system for
the canal management and agricultural extension staff; and (vi) completion
of lining of network channels down to the sub-chak level after 12 months
of weathering. Design and construction of chak drains (field and collec-
tor) will proceed concurrently with that of the irrigation channels.
Since most of the area is already bunded, it is expected that only minimal
work will be required for area development items such as land clearing,
the demolition of existing bunds, land levelling/shaping, construction of
new guide bunds and construction of on-farm irrigation and drainage
ditches. To the extent that such works will be necessary they will be
accomplished by farmers using their own resources with assistance from the
Irrigation and Agriculture Departments.
4.12      The drainage system will be designed to provide surface drainage
during the kharif season and to lower the groundwater table sufficiently
after paddy harvesting to permit planting of rabi crops by November. It
will consist mostly of open channels with exposed water surface, except in
low-lying areas susceptible to waterlogging (not more than 6% of the CCA).
In such areas the method of drainage used will be area and crop specific,



-27-
and may include lowering of the water table by pumping, through open
channels, or through buried pipe or tile drains.
4.13      Pilot Irrigation Areas.  Pilot irrigation areas would be estab-
lished in Bihar and Orissa on about 250 ha in each State. The pilot areas
will serve the following purposes:
(a) Trial and demonstration of layouts for minor distribu-
tion systems (below the outlet from the minor canal).
(b) Evaluation of distribution system performance and
cultivator acceptance.
(c) Evaluation of alternative materials and methods of
construction of watercourse lining and control
structures.
(d) Assessment of cultivator groups ability to manage
water distribution within the chak and the government
assistance required for their organization.
(e) Demonstration of improved water management practices for
those cultivators who will receive canal supply early in
the second phase.
(f) Staff training in minor system design and organization
of water distribution (under the training program for
minor system development, see paras 6.09 and 6.10).
4.14      In Bihar, water supply to the pilot area(s) will be through
pumping from the river and several locations which may be suitable have
been identified. In Orissa the pilot area will be supplied from the
Haldia reservoir. It is expected that in both states irrigation in the
pilot areas will begin in year 2. Responsibility for evaluation of the
pilot areas results will be as following:
Bihar - the Planning and Monitoring Cell (para 6.28);
Orissa - the extension service of the Agriculture Department.
4.15      Monitoring, Studies and Investigations.  Provisions have been
made for the establishment of a Planning and Monitoring Cell (paras 6.28
to 6.30) including the cost of incremental staff, vehicles and equipment
(including data processing equipment). Provisions have been made for the
following studies and investigations:
Bihar: (a) System Operation and Maintenance (para 6.27).



-28-
(b) Socio-economic base-line survey (para 6.29) .
(c) System improvements (para 4.18).
(d) Rehabilitation Evaluation (para 6.20).
Orissa: (a)  System Operation and Maintenance (para 6.27).
(b) Preparation of Master Plan for integrated development
of ground and surface resources and drainage (para 4.17).
Cost details are in Table 4j.
4.16      Irrigation and Drainage Master Plan (Orissa).  The Orissa part
of the project area has a considerable scope for development of
groundwater resources and reuse of return flows. The form of groundwater
development, whether through private wells or through augmentation with
the canal system, will have important design implications. Full utiliza-
tion of the groundwater resources may enable larger than presently
anticipated areas to be served and could reduce both the peak requirement
for canal capacity and the storage requirement in the command area reser-
voirs. Groundwater could also provide water for early sowing of paddy
nurseries and reduce the need for retaining carry-over supplies in the
reservoirs. Drainage is another important aspect affecting design. There
are potential drainage problems in about 10 percent of the area. It would
be essential to consider all these factors before plans for the irrigation
distribution system have been finalized.
4.17      The project provides (Table 4j) for preparation of a comprehen-
sive master plan for irrigation and drainage (IDMP) for the Orissa part of
the project area. Preparation of the plan would involve detailed inves-
tigations leading to: (i) assessment of the exact potential and iden-
tification of groundwater locations; (ii) determination of alternative
ways for developing groundwater including comparison of costs and
benefits; (iii) determination of the areas requiring drainage improvement
and preparation of cost estimates for drainage works; (iv) identification
of additional areas which can be brought under irrigation; and (v) deter-
mination of irrigation development priorities. As a part of these inves-
tigations a network of observation wells will be installed tc monitor
groundwater movements. The Irrigation and Power Department of GOO will be
responsible for preparation of the IDMP. An agreement has been reached
with GOO that it would prepare by December 31, 1984 an irrigation and
drainage master plan under terms of reference agreed with IDA.
4.18      System Improvement Investigations.  The main purpose of these
investigations will be to analyze the optimal location, design and timing
of construction of the works described below:



-29-
(a) Kharkai Barrage. The barrage (para 2.07 d) is required to
ensure a full utilization by Bihar of its water share.
However, reservoir operation studies indicate that since
there will be ample water supply during the initial years
from both Chandil and Ichha reservoirs it may be preferable
to postpone the construction of the barrage and supply its
canals for an interim period from alternative sources
(e.g. Ichha system).
(b) Chandil Right Canal (para 2.07 a). The proposed canal will
increase the area served from Chandil Dam and could partially
replace the Kharkai Left Canal. Moreover, it can be linked to
the Kharkai Right Canal, and this will increase the flexibility
of reservoir operation since it will enable to supply the
Kharkai Right Canal area (about 15,000 ha) from Chandil Dam.
(c) Galudih Left Canal. This canal will serve a major industrial
complex as well as a relatively small agricultural area. It
will enable Bihar to realize a greater utilization of the
Subernarekha water, but since ample water will be available
from Chandil Left Canal during the initial years its construc-
tion may also be delayed without loss of benefits.
The investigations will be coordinated with the O&M study (para 6.27) and
include comparisons of costs and benefits and calculation of Net Present
Values for alternative technical solutions. The Subernarekha Project Unit
(para 6.05) will be responsible for conducting the system improvement
investigations. Agreement has been reached with GOB that it would conduct
system improvement studies under terms of reference and methodology agreed
with IDA, and complete such studies by December 31, 1983.
4.19      Irrigation Research Center (Bihar).  The project will finance
the establishment of an irrigation research center in the Regional
Research Station which is being established near Galudih Barrage by the
Birsa Agricultural University. Irrigation research activities will
emphasize the following: (i) crop water requirements; (ii) ways to
increase irrigation efficiencies at farm level; (iii) design of water
distribution system at sub-chak (5 to 8 ha) level; and (iv) study crops
and new varieties which may be suitable under local conditions. The
Irrigation Research Center will establish close contacts with other
research centers in India.
Roads (SDV, Annex 8)
4.20      An adequate network of roads would be essential to facilitate
construction and to reach the level of benefits assumed in this report.
Both GOB and GOO are aware of the importance of adequate roads and plan to
allocate sufficient resources for road construction. During the project



-30-
period construction works will be located exclusively in the Bihar part,
mostly in concentrated areas (Chandil Dam, Galudih Barrage, etc.) which
are adequately served by National Highways 33 and 6 and subsidiary roads.
Therefore, construction of new roads and improvement of existing ones
during this project time-slice will be required mainly to support works
scheduled for the beginning of the second phase and to connect the areas
first to be brought under irrigation with the main roads.
4,21      The implementation schedule for the road network will require
careful planning and close coordination with the construction of the
irrigation network.  Because of budget allocation considerations GOB
prefers not to include the road program under the project but to finance
it under the Tribal Sub-Plan (para 3.09). Agreements have been reached
with GOB that it would: (i) by December 31, 1982 prepare a plan agreed
with IDA for development of project roads during the project implementa-
tion period; (ii) execute such a plan in coordination with the irrigation
development works; and (iii) by December 31, 1984 prepare a comprehensive
road development plan for the entire Bihar part of the SIS.
Design Criteria (SDV, Annex 9).
4.22      The entire distribution system will be lined except in reaches
where tests and observations would indicate that lining would be
uneconomical. Lined channels are generally prefered to unlined ones
because:  (i) lining reduces seepage losses; (ii) in many cases lining is
the most cost-effective technology, especially because lined channels
require a smaller channel section and therefore acquisition of less land;
(iii) it is easier to control weeds and maintain the stability of the
banks; (iv) it is more difficult to take water from undesignated places in
lined channels; and (v) there is usually less spillage and leakage and
undesirable ponding of water in the canal sections is reduced. The
economic analysis of lining (para 8.06) indicates that lining will be
economically viable. However, the flexible approach to project design
which will be used in this project (para 2.04) implies that both the
justification for lining and the best method to line should be con-
tinuously reviewed in the light of new findings and experience gained both
in the project and elsewhere.
4.23      Lining in beds would be in-situ concrete to take advantage of
easy curing and ease in establishing bottom grades. Precast concrete
(PCC) block lining is preferable for all side lining because of the dif-
ficulties in ensuring continuous and proper curing of concrete. Blocks
are to be set in 15 to 20 mm of rich mortar placed on a polythene sheet.
For main and branch canals the blocks would be sandwiched with a further
layer of mortar between the two courses of blocks. Lining would extend at
least 20 cm into the banks for top protection. Bricks would be a suitable
alternative lining method in areas where bricks are readily and economi-
cally obtainable. In brick lining of watercourses and sub-minors, a



-31-
rectangular section is normally designed and constructed, whereas with
blocks the section would be trapezoidal. Generally, in-situ lining would
be at least 75 mm thick if 1:3:6 mix or thicker if 1:4:8 mix. Selected
"murum" backfill (cohesive non-swelling material) would be required and in
prescribed thicknesses where canal alignment passes through expansive clay
soils. Drainage arrangements behind lining may be necessary only in
locations where the groundwater is above the canal bed.
Dam Safety
4.24      Both WAPCOS and IDA have reviewed the investigation procedures
and design criteria during preparation and appraisal stages, and found no
significant deficiencies. Improvements have been recommended and these
will be implemented. To ensure that prescribed methods and criteria are
being met during construction and later in operation stages, a panel of
experts will be constituted by GOB. Agreements have been reached with GOB
that: (i) it would by December 31, 1982 set up and maintain thereafter a
Dam Review Panel with qualifications, experience and terms of reference
acceptable to IDA, to review the plans and designs of each dam and their
associated structures prior to contract award, and as often as necessary
thereafter to determine whether any design changes are necessary 1/ and
whether there are any grounds for concern as to dam safety; and (ii) after
construction, have the dams and related structures inspected periodically
to ensure that there are no operation and maintenance deficiencies that
might endanger the safety of the structures.
4.25      The Panel should be considered as a review body of technical
experts whose judgment and opinions on issues of design and operational
procedures would carry considerable weight in the evaluation of proposed
actions.
Implementation Schedule (Tables 4 & 5, Charts IBRD 23567 & 23568 and Chart 4)
4.26      The project would be implemented over four years, from April 1,
1982, to March 31, 1986 and an additional period of 12 months would be
allowed for completion of disbursements. The main construction period is
from October to May, although certain activities can continue throughout
the monsoon season.
4.27      Initial water delivery from Chandil Reservoir is projected for
1988/89 which is the third year after completion of the project time-slice
(project year 7). Block development will take at least one year for
surveys, layout and design, two years for construction and one year for
1/ Especially critical is the time after foundation exploration and
before embankment placement.



-32-
commissioning. Therefore, in order to have a sizeable area ready at the
time water becomes available, block development should begin at an early
stage. Work in the following blocks would start in the project
time-slice:
Area
Started (ha)
Chandil Left Canal                             - Reaches 1, 2 and 3      9,600
Ichha Left Canal                               - Blocks 1, and 2         6,200
Ichha Right Canal                             - Block 1                  2,300
Kharkai Barrage Right Canal Distributaries  - Block 1                    3,200
4.28      Construction of the Chandil Left Canal will progress as fast as
possible. Every effort would be made to accelerate construction since
this canal is the major constraint in making use of the water as it
becomes available in Chandil Dam. As indicated (para 4.04) the alignment
of this canal is in a difficult area, especially the first four sections
and this will initially limit the speed of construction. It is expected
that a sufficient number of qualified contractors will be available to
undertake the works. However, progress could be constrained by
preparatory activities such as alignment and cross section surveys,
detailed design and quantity computations, land acquisition and tendering.
4.29      Status of Project Preparation.  The design of the dams and
barrages has been entrusted to the Central Water Commission of GOI (CWC).
The CWC has designed a large number of dams and barrages which makes it
one of the most experienced agencies in the world in design of such struc-
tures, especially for labor intensive construction methods. Final plans
and designs for Chandil Dam have been completed and tendering will take
place following negotiations. Construction problems should be minimal as
the bedrock in the river section is exposed. The design of Galudih Bar-
rage is at an advanced stage and tendering is scheduled for October 1983.
While awaiting completion of final designs, GOB has proceeded with con-
struction of access roads, construction camps and other preconstruction
activities. These are largely completed for Chandil Dam including a
submersible bridge below the dam area. GOB has also awarded 3 contracts
for foundation excavation in the earth flank areas adjacent to the river
section. Preconstruction work at Galudih Barrage site has been initiated
but is considerably less advanced than at Chandil Dam.
4.30      Geological explorations have not yet been completed for Ichha
Dam and likewise materials exploration and testing. The final plans and
designs are expected to be completed about June, 1983. Preconstruction
work on access road and construction of buildings has started.
4.31      Detailed design and contract documents are completed for several
segments within the first 25 km in the head reach of Chandil Left Canal



-33-
and bids for a number of dis-connected reaches were advertised in December
1981. The obtainment of right-of-way on forest land and the acquisition
of private land has been a source of delay to orderly progress of canal
construction. This is now being resolved by the posting of additional
Land Acquisition officers. The schedule for construction tendering
proposes packaging slices in a large enough number and aggregate volume to
attract large contractors who are experienced in this relatively difficult
construction work. In an improvement over previous construction prac-
tices, the prime contractor doing excavation work will be responsible for
the in-situ concrete bed lining as well as the pipe and box-culvert type
cross drainage structures which go under the bed.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
Cost Estimates
5.01      Total project cost is estimated at Rs 1,640 M (US$182 M).  Taxes
and duties included in this estimate are negligible. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at Rs 284 M (US$31.4 M) which is about 17% of the
total cost. Physical contingencies, which were estimated separately for
each item range from 10 to 20% and average 16% of the base cost. The
estimates are based on March 1982 prices. Price contingencies, which
account for about 23% of the base cost are based on expected inflation
rates (same rates for local and foreign expenditures) of 10% in 1981/82,
8.5% in 1982/83, 8.0% in 1983/84, 7.5% in 1984/85, 7% in 1985/86 and 6%
thereafter. Cost estimates are detailed in Tables 4a to 4p and summarized
in the following table:

-35-
Financing
5.02      The proposed IDA credit of US$127 M would finance about 70% of
total project cost, including the foreign exchange component of US$31 M
and about 60% of the local cost. All the expenditures would be met by GOB
(about 71%), GOO (about 28%) and GOWB (about 1%) from their development
budget which includes a GOI contribution. The credit would be made to GOI
on standard IDA terms. An agreement has been reached with GOI, that it
would make the proceeds of the credit available to GOB, GOO and GOWB on
GOI's standard terms and arrangements for development assistance to the
States. Agreements have been reached with GOB and GOO that they would (i)
provide sufficient funds and materials to execute the project, in accord-
ance with the four-year project implementation program; and (ii) complete
the entire project as soon as technically and financially feasible after
the credit had been disbursed.
Procurement
5.03      Works.  Works financed under the project would cost about
US$108.0 M excluding engineering and administration costs. Wherever
possible they would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages in order to
facilitate competition among potential bidders. About 85% of the works
will be procured under competitive bidding procedures, as shown below:
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The construction of
major dams and canals totalling approximately US$55 M, excluding
engineering and administrative costs, or about 50% of the works
would be procured by ICB in contracts valued at US$5 M or more.
Eligible domestic bidders would be entitled to a preference of
7-1/2%.
(b) Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). These procedures will be used
to procure about US$37 M (35%) of minor works, each costing
less than US$5.0 M, which will be scattered throughout the pro-
ject area. Such works are not likely to be of interest to
foreign bidders, but they would not be precluded from bidding.
(c)  Other Works.  These works accounting to about US$16 M (15%)
would be individually small and scattered, and their implemen-
tation would be governed by weather conditions and the need to
minimize interference with vital agricultural operations. There-
fore, they will not be suitable for either ICB or LCB tendering
and would be carried out under small piece-work or rate contracts.
When required by safety or quality considerations or when the
quantities of work are difficult to estimate in advance, such
works may be implemented by GOB's departmental forces.
Procurement schedules for civil works are in Table 5.



-36-
5.04      On-going Contracts.  In order to meet the project implementation
targets, GOB has awarded some contracts prior to credit effectiveness.
Works under these contracts which will be incomplete by April 1, 1982,
will be eligible for finance under the project, provided that: (i) the
cost of the contract is Rs 100,000 (US$11,000) or more; (ii) it was let
after appraisal (December 1, 1981); and (iii) the tender arrangements were
reviewed by IDA and found to be satisfactory. The amount of retroactive
finance would not exceed US$6.0 M.
5.05      Goods.  The total cost of goods to be financed under the project
is estimated at US$12.0 M. All the goods will be procured using competi-
tive bidding procedures. Heavy equipment and heavy vehicles costing
approximately US$5.5 M (46%), would be grouped in appropriate bidding
packages and procured through ICB. Qualified domestic manufacturers would
receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of CIF price or the import
duty, whichever is lower. Light equipment, vehicles and various instru-
ments costing US$6.5 M (54%), would be procured under LCB procedures which
are acceptable since there is adequate domestic competition and local
prices are reasonable. These goods would be purchased over four years in
lots too small to attract foreign competition. Furthermore, because of
local servicing capabilities and spare parts supply facilities, local
procurement of such goods will be advantageous. Equipment and vehicles
required for construction are listed in Table 4o.
5.06      Standard Bid Documents.  The CWC of GOI has recently developed
standard ICB and LCB documents and procedures for procurement of both
works and goods that have been approved by the Bank. The GOB has adopted
these documents and procedures and will use them under the project.
5.07      Contract Review.  After the credit becomes effective, all bid-
ding packages for works estimated to cost US$0.5 M equivalent or more and
for goods costing US$100,000 equivalent or more would be subject to IDA
prior review. These will account for at least 80% of the procurement
value of works. The remaining contracts would be subject to IDA
post-review.
Disbursements
5.08      Disbursements under the credit would be made against:
(a) Works - 80%
(b)  Vehicles and equipment (including monitoring equipment):
(i) directly imported - 100% of foreign expenditures;
(ii) locally manufactured - 100% of ex-factory cost; and



-37-
(iii) other locally procured - 70%;
(c) Studies, monitoring, research, pilot areas, training and
pollution control - 99%.
Disbursements for force account work and for payments of less than Rs
300,000 under civil works contracts and Rs 150,000 for equipment, instru-
ments and vehicles would be made against certificates of expenditures,
itemized by sub-project. Documentation for these works would be retained
by the government concerned, audited annually by independent auditors
excepted to IDA and made available for inspection by IDA during review
missions. Full documentation would be required for all other disburse-
ments. The estimated schedule of expenditures, the semi-annual disburse-
ment schedule and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of the credit
are presented in Tables 4, 6 and 7 respectively. It is expected that
disbursements would be completed by April 1987.
Accounts and Audits
5.09      The project would be subject to normal Government control and
auditing procedures which are satisfactory. A resident Audit Officer,
representing the State Accountant General (AG) would audit the project
accounts. Separate accounts would be maintained for the joint components
to facilitate cost sharing between the participating States. Although
continuous and annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the
finalization is a lengthy process of the Statutory Audit Report presented
to the Legislature. It would be essential therefore to have interim
certified statements of account. Such statements certified by the AG or
his designee, supported by an itemized account and a summary of the expen-
ditures, would be submitted to IDA as soon as possible after the end of
each fiscal year. Agreements have been reached with GOB and GOO that they
would: (i) maintain separate accounts on project expenditures; (ii)
ensure that these accounts would be audited annually by the AG and the
resulting interim statement of account would be submitted to IDA as soon
as possible but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal
year; and (iii) make complete accounts and financial statements available
for inspection during IDA review missions.
VI.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
6.01      In Bihar, the responsibility for implementation of irrigation
development works, pilot area and studies would be with the Irrigation
Department (ID) and for research and extension activities with the



-38-
Agriculture Department (AD). Construction of roads (not under the
project) would be the responsibility of the Public Works Department (PWD).
In Orissa, responsibilities for representing GOO in issues related to the
joint components, for establishment and operation of the pilot irrigation
area and for the Irrigation and Drainage Master Plan (para 4.17) would be
with the Irrigation and Power Department (IPD). Design, award of con-
tracts and 4mplementation of the joint components would be in accordance
with the institutional arrangements detailed in paras 6.13 to 6.15.
The Irrigation Department (Bihar)
6.02      General.  The Irrigation Secretary is the administrative head of
the ID. He is assisted by two Special Secretaries, one
Engineer-in-Chief-cum Special Secretary (EIC) and one Additional
Secretary. The EIC is in overall charge of the ID and coordinates the
activities of various Chief Engineers (CE). He has overall responsibility
for planning, investigation, design and execution of major and medium
irrigation projects, flood control schemes and operation and maintenance
of irrigation canal systems. The ID has a centralized organization for
Planning and Monitoring of irrigation projects. Major designs are either
carried out by the Central Design Organization (CDO) of the ID located at
Patna, or entrusted to the CWC. The CDO is also responsible for engineer-
ing research. Project preparation work is the responsibility of three
separate CE (one for North Bihar, one for South Bihar and one for
Chotanagpur and Santhal Parganas region). At present the ID has 19 CE
(exclusive of the EIC) and about 100 Superintending Engineers (SE).
6.03      Allocation of ID staff to projects is determined by the volume
and complexity of the works. A CE is usually assigned when the value of
works to be performed exceeds Rs 100 M and is generally in charge of up to
six Circles. A Circle is headed by a SE and consists of four divisions,
each headed by an Executive Engineer (EE) and staffed with four Assistant
Engineers (AE) and supporting staff.
6.04      Present Organization and Staff Requirement.  Presently, respon-
sibility for project works is with the CE for Subernarekha Project who is
located in Jamshedpur. Project staff is organized in three Construction
Circles and one Design, Planning and Monitoring Circle (which includes a
quality control division), each headed by a SE. There are 16 EE supported
by 64 Assistant and Junior Engineers (AE and JE) and supporting staff.
Project implementation will require a considerable increase of project ID
staff as shown in the following table:



-39-
Present  -----------------Requirement by Year 4-----------------
Camp       Design,
Total   Total  Construction  Mechanical  Maintenance  P&M, Etc.
Chief Engineers           1        2          2            -            -           -
Superintending
Engineers               4       16          8            2            2           4
Executive Engineers      16       64         40            5            7          12
Assistant Engineers      64      256        160           20           28          48
Total Engineers        85      338        210          27            37          64
As shown above, a four fold increase in staff will be required.  Lower
level engineers (AE, JE or Sub-Engineer level) will be available for
recruitment in sufficient numbers. However, in order to ensure a quick
start-up of project works GOB has decided that all the additional project
staff will consist of experienced engineers who will be mostly transferred
from on-going and completed projects. Higher level staff (EE and above)
will come through promotion from lower levels.
6.05      Proposed Organization (Chart 1).  The Subernarekha Irrigation
Project will have a wider scope of activities than a typical Indian
irrigation project. It will have to satisfy the requirements of agricul-
tural and non-agricultural water users, solve complex rehabilitation
problems (paras 6.17 to 6.20) and require sensitive interstate coordina-
tion. Moreover, with up to three CE's eventually responsible for various
components a strong project management will be required to ensure good
coordination and optimal allocation of resources. To facilitate implemen-
tation and management GOB will establish in the ID a Subernarekha Project
Unit (SPU), which will be located in Jamshedpur and be headed by a Senior
Officer in charge of the CEs. The main functions of the SPU would be:
(a)  Preparation of annual budget proposals and implementation
plans.
(b)  Ensuring that plans for supporting infrastructure and
services such as roads, are prepared and implemented
on time.
(c)  Ensuring that the interests of all potential water users
(industrial and municipal users, farmers) are considered
at the design and implementation stages.
(d)  Coordination between the various agencies participating in
or supporting the project.
(e)  Dealing with interstate issues arising during project imple-
mentation.



-40-
(f)  Rehabilitation of displaced persons (through the Rehabilitation
Committee, see para 6.20).
(g)  Monitoring the progress of the project and associated activities
and preparation of progress reports.
(h)  Planning of follow-up phases.
(i)  Submission of applications for reimbursement from the Credit.
6.06      As indicated (para 6.04) the number of CE will increase under
the project from the present one to two with the following allocation of
responsibilities:
CE 1 = Chandil Dam and Canals
CE 2 = Ichha Dam and Canals and Galudih Complex
A special SE reporting directly to the head of SPU will be responsible for
the design and construction of the minor distribution system and the
establishment of pilot irrigation areas (para 4.13) in the Bihar part of
the project area, where minor system design and operation will be experi-
mented with and suitable specifications developed. Construction of the
minor system is to begin in year 3 but survey planning and design
activities will commence earlier. Moreover, the staff selected for this
most important function will require special training (para 6.09). It
wou'ld be essential therefore to appoint the SE (minor systems) at an early
stage and GOB plans to do so by June 30, 1983. An agreement has been
reached with GOB that it would establish by December 31, 1982 a Suber-
narekha Project Unit including a Minor Distribution Systems Planning and
Design Cell with staffing pattern and responsibilities agreed with IDA.
6.07      Quality Control.  The quality of project works will be monitored
systematically. A comprehensive Quality Control Manual for the project
which contains guidelines on codes, procedures and methods of quality
control has been issued recently. The manual establishes the specific
functions and responsibilities of the quality control staff. A field
laboratory for quality control purposes is being established. The
strength of quality control staff would increase from the present one
division for the whole project to one division under each CE.
6.08      Engineering Research.  During phase I, it will be necessary to
develop model designs for minor system development under different
topographical conditions (see also para 6.06 above). For example, in the
undulating uplands it may be preferable to use underground pipe conveyance
rather than open channels. Also, while the economic analysis indicates
the overall economic viability of lining the entire distribution system,
there may be typical sections in which the irretrievable seepage losses



-41-
are very low and where the system can be operated efficiently without
lining. Investigations will be required to develop suitable water dis-
tribution and measurement structures. The CDO (para 6.02) would be the
most suitable organization for undertaking the necessary investigations
through a special unit located in the project area. Agreement has been
reached with GOB that it would, by December 31, 1982 establish and ade-
quately staff a Subernarekha Research Cell in the Central Design Organiza-
tion.
Training in Minor System Development and Water Management
6.09      The speed and effectiveness of water utilization will depend to
a large extent on adequate development of the minor distribution system.
Such development will require personnel experienced in surveying, layout,
construction and subsequent management of distribution systems including
minor canals, watercourses and field channels. Such personnel must have
also adequate knowledge of agricultural practices especially crop water
requirement. Unfortunately this type of expertise at the level of JE or
AE is almost non-existent. In order to fill this deficiency, it would be
essential to start an orderly training program aimed at satisfying the
project requirements of such personnel as well as, eventually, those of
the entire state. The program would comprise courses of duration varying
from 3 to 9 months for personnel in the ID having university degrees or
diplomas in civil or agricultural engineering. Similar training programs
have been initiated in several states (e.g. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh)
to support projects which began at an earlier date, and both Bihar and
Orissa should be able to benefit from their experience.
6.10      The project will assist with the establishment of facilities for
training in minor system development and water management in both Bihar
and Orissa. These could be either a new faculty in an existing University
or an entirely new training institute for minor system development.
Project assistance will include establishment of residential and training
accommodations, equipment, incremental staff salaries, training allowances
and teaching specialists. Specific proposals including detailed curricula
for training will be prepared by GOB and GOO by the end of year 1. The
training program will make full use of the pilot irrigation areas (para
4.13) and the findings made under the engineering research program (para
6.08) and the operation and maintenance studies (para 6.27). Agreements
have been reached with GOB and GOO that they would: (i) prepare detailed
proposals agreed with IDA for training curricula and establishment of
facilities for training in minor system development and water management
by December 31, 1982; and (ii) establish training facilities and commence
training by September 30, 1983.



-42-
The Irrigation Department (Orissa)
6.11      The Secretary, Irrigation and Power Department (IPD) is in
overall charge at State level, and the Additional Secretary (Irrigation)
is responsible for administration of the irrigation section of IPD. The
SE of Baripada Irrigation Circle is in charge of the Orissa part of the
Subernarekha Project and is assisted by one EE. Activities in the Orissa
part of the project area during this project time-slice will be mostly
limited to planning, survey and investigations including the development
of the pilot irrigation area and preparation of the IDMP (para 4.17).
Consequently, staff requirement will be relatively modest as shown below:
Staff Required
Present          Year 4
Chief Construction Engineer         -                  1
Superintending Engineer              1                2
Executive Engineers                  1                 9
Assistant Engineers                  4               22
Total                          6                34
The Agriculture Department (Bihar)
6.12      In order to achieve the level of benefits assumed, farmers must
be well informed of irrigation methods, crop water requirement and selec-
tion of suitable crops and their rotations. The Agriculture Department
(AD) will undertake these functions which will become increasingly impor-
tant from the second phase. Under the project the AD would be responsible
for reorganization of the extension services in the project area according
to the T&V system (para 6.32). It will also coordinate the research and
extension activities in the project area.
Institutional Arrangements for Implementation of the Joint Components 1/
6.13      GOB and GOO have constituted (August 1981) a Joint Control Board
(JCB) for execution of Galudih Barrage and Galudih Right Canal and have
agreed on its main functions. The JCB will be chaired alternately by the
Chief Ministers of Bihar and Orissa. The JCB has appointed a Functional
Committee, and a Technical Committee which will have the administrative
and financial powers required for execution of the Galudih complex.
1/ The TPA (Annex 1) stipulates the organization pattern for execution of
the joint components.



-43-
6.14      With respect to Ichha (Kharkai) Dam, the TPA stipulates that the
arrangement for its execution will be decided by the Chief Ministers of
Bihar and Orissa (Annex 1, para 2.3.4). In a meeting of the JCB dated
December 28, 1981 it has been agreed that the JCB will also look after the
Ichha Dam.
6.15      The operation and management of Ichha Dam are to be governed by
a committee consisting of a Member, CWC (Chairman) and two CE, one from
each state (Bihar and Orissa). Regulation of Chandil Dam and Galudih
Barrage would be by a committee consisting of a Member, CWC (Chairman) and
three CE, one from each of the riparian States.
Resettlement
6.16      Construction of Chandil and Ichha Dams, would result in submer-
gence of about 26,000 ha (17,000 ha of CCA) in Bihar and about 4,000 ha
(all CCA) in Orissa. The number of families affected in the areas sub-
merged by the two dams is estimated at about 10,000 in Bihar and 1,000 in
Orissa. None of the above areas would be submerged during the first
phase. Submergence of the Chandil reservoir area (Bihar only) will begin
about 1987 and that of the Ichha reservoir area will begin about 1990.
However, resettlement of displaced persons in the Bihar part will begin
during phase I.
6.17      Bihar.  GOB has formulated a general policy for resettlement and
rehabilitation of persons displaced as a result of construction of irriga-
tion and power projects. The main provisions under this policy are:
(a) Provision of 0.1 ha of homestead land to each family, free
of cost.
(b) Priority in allocation of agricultural land to Scheduled
Castes and Tribes.
(c) Ad-hoc grant of Rs 750 to cover moving expenditures and a
graduated Grant-in-Aid to families whose compensation for
lost assets will amount to less than Rs 2,000.
(d) Selection of sites for the rehabilitation/resettlement of
oustees in locations where facilities for land development and
irrigation are available and where at least 20 to 30 families
of one group can be settled with essential facilities like
roads, schools and hospitals.
(e) Preference to displaced persons in obtaining employment.
(f) Establishment of a coordinating committee for each location.



-44-
(g) All compensations (for assets lost, grants, etc.) must be
paid and rehabilitation works completed before displacement.
6.18      Resettlement will be a politically sensitive issue.  GOB is
determined to take all the necessary measures to ensure that, after a
reasonable transition period, the displaced persons regain at least their
previous standard of living. Since practically all the cultivable land
is occupied, it will be difficult to compensate all the displaced persons
by providing them with alternative agricultural land in the project area
or in other parts of Bihar. However, as land ownership ceiling for
irrigated land is lower than for rainfed land, some land in the project
area may become available for redistribution. Additional land may become
available through conversion of forest land although both GOI and GOB have
strict regulations forbidding such conversions except under special cir-
cumstances. While the land available for redistribution will be limited,
it could compensate a large number of displaced families since many of the
land holders (about 46%) own an average of only 0.2 ha. An additional
source of partial rehabilitation will be through development of fisheries
in the Chandil and Ichha reservoirs which will have a production potential
of 3,000 tons of fish.
6.19      Perhaps the main source of rehabilitation will be employment in
the industrial sector. The project area has the unique advantage of
including an important and fast growing center of industrial production,
which has attracted many migrants from other parts of India. The
industrial gr^wth rate in the project area should further increase after
water supply constraints had been removed (as a result of the project).
There will, therefore, be considerable opportunities to rehabilitate
displaced persons through industrial employment in their native areas.
Moreover, since most of the holdings are too small to provide adequate
income, it is likely that many of the displaced persons will actually
prefer rehabilitation outside the agricultural sector, especially if such
transition will be facilitated by an effective training program. Provi-
sions for such training have been included under the project (Table 4m).
6.20      GOB has already appointed separate Rehabilitation Committees for
each Chandil and Ichha Dams. The Chairman of both commitees is the Deputy
Commissioner for Singbhum District and the members are various government
officials, local political representatives and village heads from the
areas to be submerged. A guiding principle for rehabilitation will be
that each family will be offered a choice of at least two rehabilitation
alternatives. The Government plans to have a close on-going evaluation
of the rehabilitation process to assess its adequacy and the need for any
corrective measures. The evaluation will be carried out by the Planning
and Monitoring Cell (paras 6.28 to 6.30). It will begin with a baseline
sample survey of the situation before displacement followed by periodical



-45-
post-rehabilitation surveys. Finding and recommendations will be communi-
cated to GOB, SPU and the Rehabilitation Committees. Agreements have been
reached with GOB that it would: (i) by December 31, 1983 commence an
on-going evaluation of its rehabilitation activities, under
terms-of-reference agreed with IDA; and (ii) not less than two years
before causing submergence of any land formulate a rehabilitation plan
including an implementation schedule agreed with IDA.
6.21      Orissa.  Estimates of the area which will be submerged in Orissa
by the construction of Ichha Dam are in para 6.16. In addition the con-
struction of the two command area reservoirs - Jambhira and Baura (para
2.08) and the enlargement of the Haldia reservoir will result in submer-
gence of about 6,500 ha (3,200 ha of CCA) and affect about 1,800 families.
Submergence of these areas would begin in about 1990. In Orissa, it will
be possible to compensate displaced persons by offering them an alterna-
tive agricultural land. GOO has a uniform rehabilitation/resettlement
policy applicable to all major and medium irrigation projects which
includes allotment of 1.2 ha of agricultural land, house sites and assis-
tance with construction of houses. An agreement has been reached with GOO
that not less than two years before causing submergence of any land it
would: (i) constitute a Rehabilitation Committee for the project area;
and (ii) formulate an area specific rehabilitation plan including an
implementation schedule agreed with IDA.
Operation and Maintenance
6.22      Principles for Operation of the Distribution System.  The basic
principles would be that farmers must be notified well in advance of the
amount of water and the timing of its supply in each season, and that the
water supply is both reliable and equitable. This will encourage farmers
to adopt cropping patterns and input levels which will maximize their net
returns from irrigation. Main and branch canals would operate con-
tinuously throughout most of the dry season, at a discharge which will
vary according to actual requirements and with appropriate closure periods
for maintenance decided in consultation with the AD. Distributaries,
minors and sub-minors would be rotated with alternate closure and running
periods in each rotation. In this type of operation of the minor dis-
tribution system at the block level (from 50 cusecs down to the farm
level) the channels would either run with the respective full supply
discharges or remain closed.
6.23      A suitable rotation for the rabi season would be water supply
every 14 days in the lighter soils and every 21 days in heavier textured
soils. In the hot weather season a shorter interval between irrigations
would be required for the rotation period. In the typical 40 ha chak the
parent channel would deliver to the chak outlet a large but managable
stream which will be rotated between the sub-chaks. This will enable both



-46-
quick and uniform distribution of the water in the field and result in a
high level of field irrigation efficiency.
6.24      System Storage.  In both the Bihar and Orissa parts of the
project area it will be possible to ultimately incorporate in the irriga-
tion system existing or newly created storage facilities. These will
consist of the following:
(a) Existing and planned irrigation tanks or small reservoirs
which may be integrated into the project water supply system.
(b) Pondage capacity incorporated in the canals or in the
drainage ways along the canal. The storage may be short
term (i.e. a few hours only to accommodate rapid changes
in water demand rainfall, etc.) of the kind which can be
provided within canals by the use of cross-regulators to
give pondage capacity above the normal water-level or for
longer periods (daily, weekly or even monthly) to accom-
modate short-term variations in demand. Tank storage
will also provide "re-regulation" of canal supply for
storage and use of operational "wastes" and a greater
freedom in adapting the water supply to the needs of
individuals or small groups of farmers, enabling them
to grow fruits or vegetables which require frequent water
applications.
6.25      Water Distribution at Block and Chak Levels.  As indicated, the
distribution system will have sufficient control and measurement struc-
tures to enable operating officers to deliver predetermined quantities of
water to the various turnout points according to predetermined rotational
schedules. The final turnout will be at the sub-chak level (5 to 8 ha).
Water distribution within each sub-chak will be organized by cooperation
between the cultivators, the number of which will generally not exceed 12.
It is anticipated that initially the irrigation within the sub-chak in the
kharif season will be field-to-field which is adequate for paddy, while in
the dry season cultivators will construct temporary field channels to
enable cultivation of crops other than paddy.
6.26      Maintenance.  Adoption of preventive maintenance procedures will
be essential to avoid deterioration of the distribution system. The canal
system will be designed with sufficient escape and gate structures to
enable dewatering of the canal in a short period. Adequate closure
periods will be determined to minimize production losses. Finally, ade-
quate manpower and budget provisions must be made.
6.27      Operation and Maintenance Studies.  While the exact details of
system operation and maintenance can be finalized at a point of time
nearer to the beginning of irrigation, it would be important to begin



-47-
studies and investigations leading to development of O&M procedures and
organization as soon as possible. Firstly, O&M procedures will have
important design implications which should be identified at an early
stage. Secondly, large scale block development works which will start in
year 3 (in Bihar) would require a clear decision on system operation at
block level. Thirdly, it will be necessary to brief the cultivators on
the proposed system operation before the beginning of block development.
Finally, it will be necessary to train system operators at all levels.
Operation and maintenance studies will be conducted in both Bihar and
Orissa. The studies will include evaluation of O&M in each State and
visits to successfully managed projects in and outside the country in
order to benefit from their experience. The studies will also include
computer simulations. Agreements have been reached with GOB and GOO that
each State would: (i) by December 31, 1982 prepare a plan, agreeable to
IDA for a detailed management study, to establish rules, procedures and
requirements for effective management and preventive maintenance of the
entire water distribution system from the dams to the individual field
level; (ii) complete the study by December 31, 1983; and (iii) utilize the
recommendations of the study in formulating the O&M estimates and proce-
dures for subsequent implementation of the project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.28      The SPU will require the support of an effective Planning and
Monitoring Cell (PMC) for the following purposes: (i) ensuring a reliable
assessment of project progress and constraints so that timely corrective
management actions can be undertaken; (ii) implementation of studies and
investigations; (iii) preparation of annual plans; (iv) preparation of
progress reports; (v) on-going evaluation of the rehabilitation of dis-
placed persons; and (vi) preparation of a comprehensive plan for the
second phase of this project. The PMC will also collect data on the
latest improvements in irrigation system design, examine their suitability
to the project and communicate their findings to the SPU and the staff
concerned.
6.29      The main sources of monitoring data would be periodical progress
reports prepared by the project CE and other agencies participating in
project implementation. Since irrigation benefits will begin accruing
only during the second phase, evaluation activities in the Bihar part will
be limited to a base-line survey which will provide data on the
pre-project situation against which future progress can be assessed. The
survey design should enable a comparative analysis of the special charac-
teristics of tribal landholders. Base-line surveys in Orissa will start
at the beginning of the second phase.
6.30      Agreements have been reached with GOB that it would:  (i) estab-
lish by December 31, 1982 in the Subernarekha Project Unit a Planning and
Monitoring Cell with staffing pattern and functions agreed by IDA; and



-48-
(ii) by December 31, 1984 complete a baseline socio-economic survey of the
project with scope and methodology agreed with IDA.
6.31      Reporting.  GOB and GOO will submit to IDA semi-annual and
annual progress reports within three months after the end of each report-
ing period. The reports should: (i) compare plan and actual implementa-
tion in physical and financial terms; (ii) describe deviations from plan
and explain the reasons; and (iii) provide a revised implementation
program for the following period. An agreement has been reached with GOB
that it would submit to IDA a project completion report not later than six
months after the Closing Date.
Supporting Services (Bihar)
6.32      Extension and Research.  Effective extension and research serv-
ices will be vital to project success. Project yield projections and
built-up rates (para 8.04) are based on the assumption that the introduc-
tion of irrigation will be supported by strong extension and research from
an early stage. As indicated, the project will support the establishment
of an Irrigation Research Center near Galudih Barrage (para 4.19). The
extension staff will participate actively in explaining project scope and
objectives to the farmers in order to gain their support and cooperation
and facilitate land acquisition. Moreover, to enable the spread of
irrigation over the entire project in a short period (para 2.18) it would
be necessary to train a large number of farmers before the beginning of
irrigation through visits to the pilot irrigation areas, neighboring
irrigated areas and through audio-visual training aids.
6.33      Under the Bihar Extension Project (Credit 761-IN) GOB has been
introducing the T&V system throughout the State but so far progress has
been slow. An agreement has been reached with GOB that it will introduce
the T&V extension system to the entire SIS area by April 1, 1984.
Environmental Effects
6.34      Prevention of Water Pollution.  At the national level respon-
sibility for enforcement of standards for prevention of water pollution
(Indian Standard 2296) is with the Department of Environment (DOE), Minis-
try of Science and Technology, which is assisted by the Central Board for
the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution (CWP). At State level there
are State Water Pollution Control and Prevention Boards (SCWP). The CWP
provides technical assistance and advice to the the DOE and the SCWP,
undertakes studies, develops and proposes standards and regulations.
Industries are granted permission to discharge the wastewater by the SCWP
and pay a fee which is based on water consumption and used to finance
State and National Board activities.



-49-
6.35      The Bihar SCWP is presently inadequately staffed and has not yet
determined treatment requirements for wastewater discharged into the
Subernarekha water. However, it has been actively recruiting additional
staff and plans to open regional offices in Ranchi and Jamshedpur in 1983
to facilitate its operations in the Subernarekha area. The SCWP plans to
undertake a comprehensive program in order to control water pollution in
Subernarekha. The main steps in this program will be: (i) a survey of
industries and a determination of their waste disposal practices; (ii)
negotiations and agreement with each industry on steps to be taken to
achieve acceptable effluent qualities; and (iii) issuance of industrial
waste discharge permits. The program will also include studies of
effluent quality and an on-going monitoring of river water quality at
selected sampling points.
6.36      Provisions have been made under the project for monitoring and
laboratory equipment and for vehicles, as well as for training over a
period of 6-12 months of the two regional environmental engineers who will
be stationed in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. In addition, the ID will provide
the SCWP with access to and the use of its laboratory facilities. Agree-
ments have been reached with GOB that it would: (i) by December 31, 1983
implement a pollution control and monitoring program in Subernarekha area,
under terms of reference and methodology agreed by IDA; and (ii) deny
supply of water from project facilities to any industry without the neces-
sary clearance by the SCWP.
6.37      Other Effects.  The main water-related diseases whose incidence
may increase by introduction of irrigation are malaria and typhoid. The
construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals would mini-
mize areas of stagnating water which are suitable breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. Therefore it is not expected that the project will result in
an increase in the incidence of the above diseases. While there will be
an increase in the use of fertilizer and pesticides, this is not expected
to have a significant environmental impact.
VII. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, FARM INCOMES, AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Production
7.01      As indicated (paras 3.10 to 3.12) present production levels are
very low and reflect the constraints of rainfed agriculture. Without
irrigation the low paddy yields are unlikely to increase significantly,
and cultivation will be mostly limited to the kharif season with cropping
intensity levels ranging from 60% to 100%.
7.02      The introduction of irrigation is expected to trigger substan-
tial changes in the present farming techniques. Reliable and predictable



-50-
water supply will reduce farmers' risk, enable cultivation in the dry
season and induce investment in cash inputs and land improvement. As a
result yields are expected to rise considerably. Since the construction
of project reservoirs will be completed before the water distribution
system reaches the entire area, it will be possible during initial years
to provide completed irrigation blocks with a larger amount of water (than
at full development stage). However, adequate precautions will have to be
taken to ensure that farmers are aware that the increased water allocation
is temporary.l/
7.03      The main kharif crop will be paddy.  Initially paddy will be
also the main dry weather crop, since farmers are familiar with it. This
will ensure full utilization of irrigation water as soon as it becomes
available. It is anticipated that farmers will gradually move to other
dry weather crops which provide a higher return per unit of water, such as
wheat, potatoes, oilseeds, soybean and groundnut. Additionally, the fast
growing urban centers in the project area (mainly Bihar) are expected to
increase the demand for, and induce cultivation of vegetables and other
high value crops.
7.04      It is anticipated that at "full development" (about year 14) the
cropping pattern will be approximately as following (details are in Table
8):
1/ The best method to do so will have to be studied during phase II. A
possible way will be to make each farmer sign every year a document
declaring that he understands that the increased allocation of water
is temporary.

This cropping pattern should not be taken as a target.  It is based on the
projected water availability, the estimated water requirement and the
projected profitability of crops. If these change, the crop mix maximiz-
ing farmers returns to irrigation will also change.
7.05      The expected annual increase in agricultural production for the
whole project at full development is detailed in Table 9 and summarized
below:

To realize such an increase the entire project need to be completed.
Works financed under the project time-slice will account for about 17% of
the expenditures required to complete the project.
Market Prospects and Prices
7.06      The increased production resulting from the project is not
expected to create marketing difficulties. Incremental production of
paddy which is the principal crop, as well as other foodgrains (e.g.
wheat) and pulses will be partly absorbed within the project area by the
growing rural and urban population and partly exported. In both States
there are ade4"te basic facilities for marketiag, storage and processing
and these facilities will be expanded gradually to absorb the incremental
production which would begin to accrue in year 7 and rise to full develop-
ment levels in about an 8 year period. Producer prices are largely deter-
mined by supply and demand. Procurement prices for the main crops are
fixed by the Government but have been effective only in surplus markets
around harvest time.
Farm Incomes
7.07      Project impact on income levels of individual farms have been
calculated for representative farm models of 0.5 ha, 1.0 ha and 3.0 ha.
The main sources of data were farm surveys and district statistics.
Prevailing financial prices of inputs and outputs were used. The results
are summarized below (details are in Table 14):

Cost Recovery
7.08      Water Charges in Bihar.  For water charge purposes irrigation
schemes in Bihar are classified into: (i) schemes with assured irriga-
tion and perennial flow and (ii) schemes without assured irrigation. The
rate is fixed per irrigation season and is based on the number of water-
ings.  Charges in schemes with assured irrigation are at present Rs 80/ha
for kharif crops, Rs 50/ha for rabi crops and Rs 137/ha for sugarcane.
These charges are about 50% higher than for schemes without assured
irrigation. The Irrigation and Flood Protection Act 1/ provides for
collection of a betterment levy from farmers served from lift irrigation
schemes. However, due to legal difficulties in its enforcement, the Act
was suspended in 1979. Water for industrial and municipal purposes is
charged on a volumetric basis.
7.09      Water Charges in Orissa.  Water rates in Orissa are fixed per
unit area and vary according to the crop and the season. Charges are
linked to the quality of irrigation service and irrigation season and
amount to Rs 40/ha for schemes with assured irrigation, Rs 90/ha for
summer paddy, Rs 34/ha for wheat and Rs 100/ha for sugarcane.

Act, 1959.



-54-
7.10      Other Agricultural Taxes.  Since incomes in the agricultural
sector are much lower than in the manufacturing and service sectors, the
annual rate of agricultural taxation (mainly land revenue) is relatively
modest amounting at present to about Rs 10/ha in Bihar. In Orissa land
revenue levels vary according to soil type, location and the suitability
for double cropping, and average about Rs 20 per ha. In addition a cess
equal to 50% of the land revenue charged. More important from a revenue
point of view in both States, is the agricultural sales tax of 4% levied
on most agricultural produce (excluding vegetables and sugarcane).
7.11      Recovery Prospects.  Revenues from water charges account for
about 1% of the total State income in Bihar and Orissa. Both the States
have budget deficits and are anxious to maximize the revenues from irriga-
tion and irrigation related charges. With respect to water for I&M both
governments plan to charge users at least the full cost of producing and
supplying the water. Irrigation charges present a more difficult issue
for reasons discussed below. GOO has recently reviewed irrigation charges
(as required under Credit 740-IN) and increased them considerably (+50%).
The dialoge between the Bank and GOO on improvement of irrigation cost
recovery is expected to continue under the second phase of that project,
scheduled for FY83. Irrigation under that project will start several
years before Subernarekha water becomes available. GOB has appointed a
high level committee to review water charges and will submit the commit-
tee's recommendations to IDA. Both governments accept IDA principles for
cost recovery but face serious implementation difficulties. The main
constrairts on both the level and the recovery rate of irrigation charges
in traditionally designed projects in both the States have been the ineq-
uity and unreliability of water supply even in the schemes supposedly
having "assured irrigation" (para 7.08). Since the water charges for a
given category of irrigation are uniform throughout each State, their
current level must be within the repayment capability of these farmers
realizing the lowest irrigation benefits (mostly tail-enders). Another
important factor is that irrigation charges are traditionally regarded as
tax rather than as payment for service; their level has to be approved by
the Legislature and is a sensitive political issue.
7.12      By the time irrigation begins (year 7) there will be a con-
siderable improvement in the state of knowledge of how to charge for
irrigation water. This will be largely a result of water charge studies
and reviews conducted under Bank supported projects in several States
(e.g. Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala) which
should be completed by that time. It would be essential also to complete
the operation and maintenance studies (para 6.27) and determine the method
of water allocation in each season since these will effect the method of
both charging and recovery. It will therefore be desirable to defer a
decision on the method and level of irrigation water charges in the
project area to a later stage (beyond the first phase). GOB plans to
conduct in project years 5 and 6 (1987/88 and 1988/89) a systematic review



-55-
of the finding of the above studies and the experience with irrigation
cost recovery elsewhere in order to determine the most suitable irrigation
charging system. It is important that the charging system ultimately
adopted will be both conducive to efficient water use and administratively
feasible (to avoid a repetition of past recovery failures).
7.13      Estimated Cost and Rent Recovery.  It is anticipated that by
full development stage, the average net income (1982 prices) per ha of CCA
in the Project area will increase from the present level of about Rs 900
to Rs 6,400 in the Bihar part and from Rs 1,300 to Rs 6,800 in the Orissa
part. Additionally, the improved design standards will minimize the
differences between "head" and "tail" fields. Consequently, there will be
a considerable scope for increasing irrigation charges especially if the
method of charging will be changed so that irrigation charges in modernly
designed projects are higher than those in traditionally designed ones.
It is anticipated that both Bihar and Orissa will ultimately create a
special level of charges for projects designed to higher standards like
Subernarekha.
7.14      In estimating the levels of cost and rent recoveries, it has
been assumed that following a systematic review, both GOB and GOO will
gradually increase irrigation and irrigation related charges in the
project area, to reach a level of about 30% of the "project rent" in year
10. It was also assumed that the charge for I&M water will be at a level
sufficient to cover the full proportionate cost of capital and O&M. Based
on these assumptions, the cost and rent recovery indices have been
estimated as following (details are in Annex 2 and Tables 15 and 16):

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Project Impact 1/
8.01      If development of the Subernarekha Irrigation System (SIS) does
not take place, water scarcity would be the single most important con-
straint to agro-economic growth, especially in the Bihar part of the
project area. Provision of irrigation water will accelerate economic
development also in the Orissa and West Bengal parts. The overall direct
impact of SIS at full development in terms of agricultural production,
employment generated and other direct benefits are summarized below:

a! Defined as the sum of gross farm incomes minus cost inputs (excluding
labor).
The above impact refers to the entire SIS at full development. Estimating
the impact of this project time slice alone would be arbitrary and was not
attempted.
8.02      Employment Effects.  The increase in employment opportunities
resulting from project activities would come from: (i) construction
works; (ii) intensification of agricultural production; and (iii)
industrial development. It is estimated that the number of unskilled
labor employed daily in construction work during the main construction
period (October to May) over the next 10 years will average about 60,000
mostly in Bihar where all the major structures are located. Labor
1/ In this chapter, the term "project" refers to the entire Subernarekha
Irrigation System (SIS).



-57-
requirement for a typical cropping pattern is expected to increase from 80
man-days/ha at present to about 190 man-days/ha at full development (about
year 14). Thus about 138,000 of full-time job equivalent will be created.
It is estimated that about two thirds of the incremental demand for labor
will be supplied by landless workers. Additional employment in transport,
marketing and processing of incremental agriculture production is
estimated at about 24,800 full-time jobs. The labor demand of industries
in the Bihar part of the project will also increase considerably since the
increased and reliable water supply for I&M will enable both the expansion
of existing industries and establishment o.f new ones.
8.03      Poverty Impact.  The project will result in a substantial reduc-
tion in the incidence of poverty. This projection is based on comparisons
of the percentage of farm families with incomes below the poverty line
with and without the project. The income estimates used in the calcula-
tion are based on the data on the distribution of farms by size and
estimates of the average net farm income per ha. The results are sum-
marized in the following table:
% of Participating Farm Families
Below Poverty Line
Future With
Present               Project
Bihar                    80                     25
Orissa                   70                     20
a/  The estimated poverty line is Rs 800 per annum (in 1982 prices).
Economic Analysis
8.04      Main Assumptions.  The assumptions used in the economic analysis
are detailed in Annex 2 and summarized below:
(a)  Prices and Conversion Factors.  Agricultural output was valued
on the basis of IBRD projected 1990 world market prices expressed
in 1982 currency values (Table 10). The economic price estimate
for paddy which is the main crop was based on the assumption
that its incremental production will be directly or indirectly
exported outside the country. The economic value of water for
I&M was assumed to be equal to the marginal value of water in
agricultural production. Non-traded cost and benefit items have
been adjusted by appropriate conversion factors to bring them
to the same price basis as the traded ones.



-58-
(b) Without and With Project Situation. No substantial changes in
production and income levels are expected in the area without
the project (i.e. under rainfed agriculture). The projections
for the "without" and "with" project situations were based on
field surveys, district yield statistics, data from research
stations and extension staff estimates (Table 11). Projections
of I&M water supply requirements are based on GOB estimates and
the assumptions about flood moderation benefits are based on
estimates of past flood damages in Orissa assuming that the extent
of damages in West Bengal is about proportionate to its share in
the cost of the flood control component of Chandil Dam (about 8%).
(c)  Benefits Build-Up Rates.  It has been assumed that during the
first years of irrigation, farmers will use their entire water
allocation for the dry season to grow summer paddy, since the
crop is known to them and most of the fields are bunded. With
access to credit and inputs, and with adequate extension service,
yields of summer paddy are likely to reach 3.4 t/ha in about 4
years after irrigation had begun. At a later stage farmers are
are expected to gradually diversify production in favor of crops
providing a higher return per unit of water (wheat, groundnuts).
During the kharif season irrigation will supplement rainfall,
therefore its impact on the net income per ha will be smaller.
It has been estimated that it will take farmers about 7 years
to raise the yields of kharif paddy from the present level of
0.9-1.3 t/ha to 2.2-3.2 t/ha at full development.
(d) Project Cost. The economic cost streams include the cost of
civil works (including physical contingencies and establishment
costs) required for completion of the entire Subernarekha Irriga-
tion System, the opportunity cost of land submerged by the
reservoirs, the cost of resettlement, the cost of O&M and
incremental extension, and the cost of construction, upgrading
and maintenance of road network. The economic costs have been
derived from the corresponding financial ones adjusted by the
appropriate conversion factors.
8.05      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  The ERR and the Net Present
Value (NPV) were estimated for the entire project as well as for separable
components. The models analyzed were: (i) the entire project; (ii)
Chandil system; (iii) Ichha system; (iv) irrigation component; (v) flood
moderation; and (vi) I&M Water Supply. The results are summarized below
(the assumptions made for each of the partial models are in Annex 2):

I&M Water Supply                  18.2             252
a/ Discounted at 12% interest.
The ERR was estimated also separately for the Bihar and Orissa parts with
the following results: Bihar 17.8%; Orissa 16.3%. These results indicate
that the entire project as well as each of its components would be
economically viable.
8.06      Economics of Lining.  In much of the project area, the cost of a
lined system will be about the same or only slightly higher than the cost
of an unlined system. This is so because cross sections of lined channels
are considerably smaller than those of unlined ones designed to convey the
same amount of water. In addition lined channels require a smaller den-
sity of drop structures especially in steep terrains. Therefore, the ERR
of lining is relatively high and ranges from 34% to over 50%. The
incremental benefits considered were those generated by the reduction of
seepage losses. This estimate is biased downwards since it does not take
into account substantial benefits from lining, which could not be ade-
quately quantified, such as: (i) the greater flexibility of operating a
lined system and the greater speed in which water can be distributed
especially during the kharif season; and (ii) the greater reliability and
equity of water supply. Detailed analysis is in SDV, Annex 9.
8.07      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analyses were conducted to
determine how deviations from the main assumptions will effect the
economic viability of the project. One type of sensitivity test was
through calculation of the "switching value", that is the value to which
the variable tested will have to increase (or decrease) in order to reduce
the discounted present value of the project's net incremental benefits to
zero. The discount rate used was 12% which has been the estimated oppor-
tunity cost of capital in India. The results are summarized in the fol-
lowing table:

a/  Applies only to the composite model, sensitivity analysis for components
is in Annex 2.
8.08      In addition to the above tests, the effect of the following
occurrences on the ERR was tested:l/
(a) After the first phase, only Chandil Dam, Chandil Left Canal
and its command area are completed but construction of the
other components is postponed indefinitely. The ERR will
decline to 14.6%.
(b) Construction of the Bihar part proceeds as planned but
Orissa postpones development in its area by 10 years. The
ERR will decline to 16.2%.
(c) Farmers restrict production in the dry season to paddy only.
The ERR will decline to 14.6%.
(d) Changes in construction priorities: if the emphasis in the
first phase is on Ichha complex, the ERR will remain sub-
stantially unchanged (17.5%).
(e) Lack of attention to block (minor system) development resulting
in unreliable water supply and drainage problems. The ERR will
decline to 11.2% (see Annex 2, para 26).
The latter result (sensitivity to block development) reinforces the need
to ensure high standards of minor system development which is emphasized
throughout this report.
1/ At the time this SAR was finalized new proposals for IBRD commodity
price forecasts were under review. Had the revised prices been used
for economic analysis, the ERR (composite model) would have declined
to 14.5%



-61-
8.09      Project Risk.  The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate
that only large deviations from the basic project assumptions will make it
economically unviable. The greatest sensitivity is to the quality of
minor system development works since this will determine the capacity of
the irrigation system to provide a reliable water supply. However, the
establishment of specialized training facilities, appointment of a CE for
minor system development and establishment of pilot irrigation areas
(paras 6.10, 6.06 and 4.13 respectively) should ensure high quality of
minor system works. There is a risk that the rehabilitation of displaced
people will encounter greater than anticipated difficulties and delay
implementation. However, the measures to be undertaken under the project
should minimize such risk. Although the implications of either GOB or GOO
not proceeding with the full scope of project works after completion of
this time slice were investigated, such risk is considered to be small for
the following reasons: (i) GOB is fully committed to the development of
the project area and is also under pressure to increase water supply for
I&M purposes; (ii) with the works completed under the first phase becoming
"isunk costs", the economic viability of the remaining works, especially in
the Chandil complex, will be high; (iii) GOO feels itself compelled to
utilize its share of the Subernarekha water as soon as it is available in
order to protect its water rights; and (iv) the governments concerned are
expected to make every effort to avoid violating the TPA which had been
reached after long negotiations.

in its territory, out of which up to 0.06 MAF. Provided that if the flow
in any nnon-monsoon period is less than 0.16 MAF the shortage shall be
shared betwen Bihar and Orissa in the proportion of 3:5. Further provided
that until the Kharkai Dam is constructed and put into operation all
excesses oer 0.16 MAF in the non-monsoon flow at Galudih barrage shall be
utilized by Orissa. This will be exclsive of the releases to be made from
Chandil Dam for West Bengal as per Para. 2.22 above.
2.3.2     The cost of the Galudih barrage and its appurtenant works shall
be shared between Bihar and Orissa in proportion to the annual designed
withdrawals, that is to say, on cusec-day basis.

INDIA
SUBERNAREKHA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Main Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Prices and Conversion Factors
1.        General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural
outputs (at farm gate) were derived from the IBRD projected 1990 world
market prices expressed in 1982 currency value with appropriate adjust-
ments for freight, handling and processing. The projected economic prices
for non-traded foodgrains are derived by applying a foodgrain conversion
factor (FCF) to the financial price (para 4). Non-traded goods and serv-
ices were brought to a common basis with the traded ones through the use
of conversion factors (explained in the following paras). A standard
exchange rate of US$1 to Rs 9.00 was used to convert prices expressed in
US dollars to local currency values. The assumptions used to derived the
estimates are described below.
2.        Standard Conversion Factor (SCF).  For economic analysis pur-
poses the costs and benefits of the project have to be evaluated at world
market prices, in order to measure correctly India's net economic benefits
from the project.  This requires certain adjustment since many items are
not traded on the world market and others are affected by tariffs and
trade restrictions.  In order to make them comparable, a SCF is applied to
the price of non-traded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions, the
SCF can be estimated by using the following formula:
SCF            X + M
X + S + M + T
x        m
where:  X  = export value (f.o.b.);
M = import value (c.i.f.);
S = subsidies on exports;
T = taxes and duties on imports.
m
For the period since 1970, this calculation gives a SCF of 0.86. However,
since this estimate does not take into consideration quantitative restric-
tions on trade, it provides only an upper limit for the SCF. The Indian
Planning Commission recommends for the evaluation of industrial projects,
the use of conversion factors for foreign exchange and for untraded goods
that implicitly give a SCF of about 0.75. Because of the approximate
nature of this estimate, a SCF of 0.8 has been used in the economic



-113-                                ANNEX 2
Page 2
analysis. Specific conversion factors were calculated for construction
costs and non-traded foodgrains (see below).
3.        Construction Conversion Factor.  Project works would be con-
structed using a mixture of equipment, skilled and unskilled labor in the
proportions shown below:
(a)  Traded Component:  This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials.  Hence the conversion
factor is 1.00 and it is estimated that about 12% of the con-
struction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-Traded Component:  This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 45% of the construction costs are included in
this category.
(c)  Unskilled Labor:  A ratio of economic to financial wages equal
to the one assumed for agricultural labor (67% see para 10) has
been assumed for unskilled construction labor. It is estimated
that unskilled labor constitutes about 34% of the construction
costs.
The weighted average of these conversion factors would be as following:
Conversion Factor          Weight
Traded Items                        1.00                   0.21
Non-Traded Items                    0.80                   0.45
Unskilled Labor                     0.67                   0.34
Construction Costs
(weighted average)                 0.80                   1.00
Thus the SCF is in this case equal to the construction conversion factor
and can be used also for converting the cost of construction works from
financial to economic prices.
4.        Foodgrains Conversion Factor.  The economic prices for traded
goods such as rice, wheat, cotton, groundnuts, and sugarcane were derived
by using their border prices in US$ according to Bank projections and
converting it to local currency values at the standard exchange rate. The
domestic cost components (i.e., local transport and marketing charges)
were adjusted by the SCF of 0.80. The economic prices for non-traded
foodgrains (maize and pulses were assumed to be non-traded) were derived



ANNEX 2
Page 3
by applying a FCF to their projected financial prices. The FCF was
estimated using the following formula:
[(Q1+ Q2) RICE x PE RICE] + [(Q1+ Q2) WHEAT x PE WHEAT]
FCF                         --------= 1.27
[(Q1+ Q2) RICE x PF RICE] + [(Q1+ Q2) WHEAT x PF WHEAT]
where:  Q1 = Bihar Production
Q  = Orissa Production
Pi = Economic Price
PF = Financial Price
The projected financial prices for various crops are based on the
estimated historical price trends 1/ in Bihar and Orissa.
5.        The Price of Paddy.  Paddy is the principal crop and source of
nutrition in the project area. Its economic price has major impact on
project benefits and has been thoroughly investigated. At present the
project area is about self sufficient in rice production, it has therefore
been assumed that the incremental production would be exported. Bank
projections indicate that in the 1990s India is likely to become a net
exporter of foodgrains especially rice.2/ Consequently, the economic
price of paddy is based on the assumption that incremental rice production
would be exported out of India. If the incremental production would not
be exported outside India (directly or indirectly) the economic price
would be about 5% higher. The effect on the ERR is discussed in para 26.
Detailed calculations are in Table 1 of this Annex.
6.        Prices of Agricultural Inputs.  Fertilizers have been valued at
the projected world market price. Pesticides and insecticides have been
assumed to be traded; to make allowance for taxes and subsidies and the
total cost of transport and marketing, a conversion factor of 0.95 has
been applied to their financial prices. The economic price of seed and
miscellaneous charges has been assumed to approximate their financial
price. The economic price of a bullock/day was derived from the rental
price for one pair with an operator per day, adjusted by the SCF. A
summary of economic prices is presented in the main report, Table 10.

Labor Analysis
7.        Labor Supply.  The project area Pas a rural population of about
400,000 with a density of about 170 per km . About half the population
is tribal. The average family has 5 members. Literacy rate is about 30%.
Most of the farmers in the project area own the land they cultivate. The
average farm is about 1.1 ha in Bihar part and about 1.5 in Orissa part.
In addition to family labor there is a large pool of agricultural
laborers. At present underemployment and unemployment is wide spread,
particularly off season. The estimates of labor supply have been made
using an average of 240 days per annum per worker. This allows for less
than a full day work for the young and old who are included in the labor
force estimate and also for people working long hours during peak months
of agricultural activities (the peak monthly labor supply is higher than
the average for the year).
8.        Labor Demand.  Farm labor demand is based on requirements for
various crops (main report, Table 11). They are at present about 70
man-days per ha of cultivated area and are projected to increase to about
190 man-days per ha at full development.
9.        Non-Farm Employment.  The municipal and industrial water supply
by the project is likely to generate additional industrial growth and
urbanization of Jamshedpur and other towns located in the project area.
This, as well as additional employment generated through marketing,
processing and transport of incremental agricultural production would
create additional employment opportunities.
10.       Opportunity Cost of Labor.  Agricultural wage rates in the
project area vary seasonally from Rs 2 to 5 per man-day for rainfed
agriculture, and from Rs 3 to 6 per man-day for irrigated agriculture
activities (minor irrigation scheme in the project area). Seasonal varia-
tions were averaged out by adopting seasonally weighted daily wage rates:
Present Without   Employment        With        Employment
Project          Period        Project        Period
(Rs/man-day)      (months)    (Rs/man-day)   (months)
Slack season                  2.0             3             3.0             3
Intermediate season           3.5             7             4.0             6
Peak season                   5.0             2             6.0             3
Average (year)         3.4                           4.3
Economic wage rates were derived from the financial ones assuming that for
the slack and peak period, the financial wage is a good approximation for



ANNEX 2
-116-                                Page 5
the shadow wage (reservation wage), and that only during the intermediate
season the financial wage overstates the opportunity cost of labor by some
40%. To the weighted average shadow wage rates derived, the SCF (0.8) was
applied, resulting in economic wages of Rs 2.2 and Rs 3.0 in the without
project and with project situations, respectively. When compared to
financial wage rates, this is equivalent to an unskilled labor conversion
factor of about 0.67.
11.       Construction Labor.  The construction of irrigation distribution
system has been traditionally carried out by labor-intensive methods
during the agricultural slack season. The main source of supply of con-
struction labor is landless agricultural laborers and small farmers. It
has been assumed that the opportunity cost of unskilled construction labor
would be equal to the opportunity cost of labor in agriculture.
Agricultural Benefits
12.       Present Situation.  Rice is the main crop in the project area
and accounts for about 60% of the area cultivated in the Bihar part and
over 80% in the Orissa part (Table 8). Present yields are low (1.0 t/ha
of paddy) mainly due to poor farming practices. Farming is limited lar-
gely to the monsoon season. Despite the proximity of urban markets,
agriculture is largely subsistant. Assessment of yields, input levels and
relative profitability of crops was based on (i) farm surveys in the
project area, (ii) yield statistics, and (iii) direct information in the
field.
13.       Future Without Project.  No substantial changes from the present
situation were assumed in the "future without project" cropping pattern.
Yields "without" project based on present agricultural practices were in
some instances adjusted slightly upwards to take account of past produc-
tivity trends (main report, Table 8).
14.       Intermediate Development.  Irrigation water would be first
available from Chandil Dam in the year 1988/89. By that year about 19,300
ha will be ready for irrigation in Bihar and about 4,200 ha in Orissa. In
the initial years the availability of irrigation water per ha of CCA would
be greater than at full development stage (Table 17 in the main report).
A pattern for utilization of surplus water was based on several assump-
tions: (i) allocated additional water during the dry season farmers
initially would prefer a second paddy crop in the hot season; (ii) given
access to credit, inputs and supported by extension service yields of
summer paddy are likely to reach 3.4 t/ha in about 4 years after irriga-
tion is first received; (iii) the capacity of the distribution system
would limit the proportion of the area planted to paddy to about 65%; and
(iv) with some experience in modern irrigation and with the gradual reduc-
tion of water availability farmers would diversify production in favor of



ANNEX 2
-117-                                Page 6
crops (wheat, groundnuts) providing higher return per unit of water. The
direct impact of irrigation during the monsoon season on the net income
per ha would be less dramatic since irrigation supplements rainfall. It
has been assumed that it would take farmers about 7 years to move from
present yield levels of 0.9-1.3 t/ha to 2.2-3.2 t/ha of kharif paddy at
full development (main report, Table 8).
15.       Full Development.  This period refers to the years 1994 and
beyond. The industrial growth and urbanization in the project area could
affect water availability for agriculture. New areas could also be
developed for irrigation (mainly lift-irrigation schemes) and reduce the
quantity of water available per ha. Several alternative cropping patterns
were tested to assess the impact of changes in water availability.
Industrial and Municipal Water Benefits
16.       Industrial and Municipal Water Use.  The water supply for the
industrial complexes and towns is at present seriously defficient espe-
cially during the months of March-May. For now and in the near future the
solution for the I&M users is conservation, rationing and construction of
water storage) tanks on the small tributaries of Subernarekha. In order to
calculate the overall 5RR and NPV the economic value of water has been
estimated at 0.26 Rs/m , based on opportunity cost of water in agricul-
ture. Since the Subernarekha is the only water resource in the area able
to meet the future requirements, the long-term alternative other than the
proposed project would be a single purpose I&M dam.
17.       I&M Water Demand Projections are based on (i) the population
census of 1981; (ii) a 2.4% population growth rate for the area; (iii) an
increase of the per capita consumption from 70 lpcd to 140 lpcd in 40
years; and (iv) a substantial increase in industrial water demand related
to industrial growth in Project area. Future demand projections cover the
principal industrial centers in the Jamshedpur-Adiytapur region, the
Uranium Corportation of India at Jadugada and the copper mines of Galudih.
The projections shown below are detailed in the Project file.

2/ The reservoirs of Chandil and Ichha and the Galudih Barrage would supply
all incremental requirements beginning year 1988/89.
Flood Control Benefits
18.       Flood Damage.  The assessment of flood damage in Orissa was based
on Revenue Department records (Table 2). It was assumed that flood
damage in West Bengal (for which data is unavailable) would
be proportionate to its share of cost allocated to flood protection (8%).
19.       Incremental Benefits of Flood Control.  Several alternatives of
flood Drotection ranging from flood storage to river embankments and their
combinations had been studied by a special committee.l/ The project benefits
assumed in this analysis are limited to flool moderation by:  (i) construction
of Chandil and Ichha reservoirs; (ii) 462 Mm of Chandil reservoir
storage. The difference between the expected damage with and without the
flood moderation component has been estimated at 27.4 RsM in economic prices
annually.
Costs
20.       Allocation of Project Costs.  The investment costs in the
development of water resouces to serve irrigation, I&M water supply and the
provision of flood moderation were allocated as follows:
(i) Irrigation Component. The share of capital costs of Chandil and
Ichha dams for the irrigation component were derived with the I&M
water supply and the flood components storage requirements omitted.
The capital costs of the irrigated distribution network were
similarly adjusted to reflect only the cost to irrigation users.
1/ Report of the Subernarekha Committee available in Project File.



ANNEX 2
-119-                            Page 8
(ii)  I&M Component.  The capital costs allocated to I&M component were
based on incremental storage required for this purpose in Chandil
and Ichha dams and the incremental cost associated with the distri-
bution network, incremental to irrigation.
(iii)  Flood Moderation.  The incremental capital cots to irrigation and
I&M components for the Chandil dam was allocated for this purpose.
21.       Capital cost estimates for each component based on March 1982
market prices and proposed implementation schedules were adjusted by the
CCF: they exclude sunk costs which are negligable and price contingen-
cies.
22.       Land Acquisition and Resettlement Costs.  These consist of three
main components: (i) resettlement costs for property lost to submergence
in the reservoir areas (10,000 and 1,000 families in Bihar and Orissa,
respectively); (ii) compensation costs for areas submerged when reservoirs
constructed under the project are commissioned (about 17,000 ha in Bihar
and 4,000 ha in Orissa; all CCA); and (iii) the compensation costs for
land acquired so that the canal distribution systems can be constructed
(about 9,000 ha in Bihar and 5,000 ha in Orissa).
23.       It is assumed that all cultivated land lost to cultivation as a
result of the project is and would remain rainfed, The net CCA of the
rainfed area has been taken as 5% larger than the net CCA which can be
irrigated after completion of the canal distribution system. Land
acquired for the distribution systems is assumed to be lost to rainfed
cultivation from the year that the project works are constructed.
24.       The economic cost of resettlement is calculated by multiplying
the financial cost by the construction conversion factor (CCF). The
economic cost of land submerged or used for construction of the distribu-
tion system was derived from estimates of the economic value of the
production foregone. The net return per ha (in economic prices) in the
"future without project" situation was assumed to provide an adequate
estimate of the economic cost of land.
25.       Operation and Maintenance Costs.  At present, the financial
costs of 0&M in completed major irrigation projects in Orissa and Bihar
average about Rs 30 per ha. However, it is estimated that about Rs 100/ha
would be required to assure proper O&M. Since O&M involves mainly employ-
ment of unskilled or semiskilled labor, the unskilled conversion factor of
0.67 was used.

Sensitivity Analysis
26.       In addition to the results presented in para 8.05-8.08, the
following additional tests have been conducted both on the composite and
the partial models (see also Table 5 to this Annex).
(i) Price of Paddy. If India would be a net importer of rice the
economic price would be about 5% higher than assumed in the base
calculation, and the ERR would increase slightly to 17.5% for
the composite model and 18.3% for the irrigation model.
(ii) Build-up of Agricultural Benefits I. It was assumed that it would
take farmers about 9 years to reach the projected yields in the
kharif season. An increase in the build-up period by 6 more years
would reduce the ERR of the composite model to 14.5%.
(iii) Build-up of Agricultural Benefits II. If the time for build-up of
benefits in the dry season would be increased from 4 to 9 years
the ERR would decline to 15.9% and 16.6% in the composite and
irrigation models respectively.
(iv) Omission of Kharif Benefits. Taking into account only the dry
season benefits reduces the ERR to 12.3% for the composite model
and 12% for the irrigation model.
(v) Lack of Attention to Block Development. This was tested by
reducing the incremental benefits to the level realized in
tracitionally designed .rrigation projects (a reduction of
about 40%). The cost streams were also adjusted.

areas would be of slightly lower quality. An adjustment factor of 0.93 was applied to
those varieties based on "Relationships Between International Rice Prices" Commodities
