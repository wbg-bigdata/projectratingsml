URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Trends and Issues
Urban Growth
1.01      Lesotho is a small, poor, landlocked country surrounded by the
Republic of South Africa (RSA), on which it depend[s for about 90% of its
trade.  It lies between 28  and 31  south, occupying the highest part of the
plateau of southern Africa at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to more than
3,400 meters; its climate is temperate, with severe winters-and an erratic
pattern of precipitation -- including occasional hail storms -- that are a
major factor in widely fluctuating agricultural production.
1.02      While Lesotho does not yet have urban pressures of the scale found
in most other African countries, partly due to the ability of rural families
to supplement farm income with wages earned in the RSA, its urban growth is
still more than twice the national average (4.8% compared to 2.3%). In 1979
Maseru, the capital, had a population of 59,000 split about equally between
the original town and its peri-urban areas, which together constitute Greater
Maseru. Greater Maseru has been growing at about 7.4% per year, more than
three times the national average. Meanwhile the country's urban population
(9% of a total population of 1.3 million) was estimated at about 117,000
residing in 13 urban centers. 1/ Lesotho is expected to have a population of
about 1.5 million in 1986, of which 168,000 (11%) will be urban.
Employment
1.03      The urban areas, Maseru in particular, hold the major share of
Lesotho's domestic wage employment and productive activity. Nearly half of
all wage employment and GDP is generated by manufacturing, government, tourism
and other services, all primarily located in Maseru. The Government of
Lesotho's (GOL) policy of employment creation in industry and commerce has
encouraged the growth of urban centers.
1.04      In 1976 the country's labor force was estimated at about 560,000
with an annual growth rate of about 20,000, divided more or less equally
between males and females, although female participation is about one-third
that of males. To continue employment at present levels would require about
13,000 new jobs per year, excluding employment of returning mine workers. In
1978 about 42% of Lesotho's male labor force worked in the RSA mines. This
number has begun decreasing with RSA's policy of using less foreign labor and
the outlook for increasing mine employment possibilities for Basotho in the
RSA is bleak. The likely drop in the flow of migrant remittances will greatly
1/   Mission estimates, using definition of urban areas proposed by Physical
Planning Office, Ministry of Interior.



-2 -
affect rural families as they depend more heavily on these income supplements
than their urban counterparts. It is thus likely that significant internal
rural-urban migration will emerge, a phenomenon Lesotho has managed to avoid
so far.
1.05      Formal sector non-agricultural employment in Lesotho, most of which
is located in Maseru including most of the 10,000 Government employees,
probably did not exceed 40,000 in 1978. Informal employment activities in
Lesotho are difficult to quantify, although a recent study 1/ found that in
nine peri-urban areas surveyed in Maseru, 15% of occupations were in the in-
formal sector. These included shoe repair, tailoring, bricklaying, carpentry,
brewing and handicrafts. A further 8% said they were unemployed.
1.06      GOL's employment strategy, stated in the First Five-Year Develop-
ment Plan (FYDP) (1970-1975) and restated in the Second FYDP (1975-1980) is to
maximize domestic employment opportunities. While the First FYDP stressed
small-scale industries, the Second Plan emphasized the manufacturing sector,
local entrepreneurship, the development of labor-intensive works and assist-
ance to the informal sector. Under the draft Third Plan (1980-85) Lesotho's
industrial strategy will continue to stress labor intensive investment.
Incomes and Urban Poverty
1.07      Significant income differences exist, particularly within urban
areas and between Maseru and the rest of the country. According to the Second
FYDP the lowest 5% of Maseru's population received only 1% of income, while
the highest 5% received 26%. GOL's minimum wage legislation has tried to
redress this imbalance by increasing the pay of industrial and commercial
workers, whose minimum wages were raised in March 1978 from M 1.50 to M 2.10
per day. Despite this, absolute poverty is widespread in towns because of the
high cost of food, most of which is imported from neighbouring RSA. There is
little evidence of income/expenditure in kind. A large share of household
income is spent on non-food items, principally shelter and clothing, needed in
Lesotho's bitterly cold winters. Mission estimates show that some 50% of
the population of Greater Maseru and more than 60% in the peri-urban areas
fall below the absolute Urban Poverty Income (UPI) Threshold of M 90 (US$110)
per household per month (January 1980 prices). 2/
Urban Services
1.08      Urban growth in Lesotho has far outstripped the availability of
services, especially in the unplanned peri-urban areas of Maseru, which are
growing at about 16% a year. In these areas only 21% of the residents have
access to standpipes, the rest buying water from neighbors or water vendors,
while 60% have sanitation facilities, (pit and bucket latrines) that are
grossly inadequate. Central Maseru receives the most comprehensive range of
services (piped water to 99% of the population, waterborne sanitation to 50%),

2/   Mission estimate:  equivalent to US$304 per capita per year.  This is not
comparable with the 1978 estimate of GNP per capita income of US$280

rest of the country.



followed by the eight other district towns, for which figures on service
levels are not available. Roads and street lightinlg Outside Central Maseru
are relatively infrequent and poorly maintained as are schools, health clinics
and community facilities.
Housing Policy and Institutions
1.09      The Government, assisted by USAID, has drafted a comprehensive
housing policy for Cabinet consideration. The draf't policy aims at providing
equal housing opportunities for all income groups throughout the country by
mobilizing domestic savings, abolishing housing and infrastructure subsidies,
and pro-viding training and financial assistance for self-help house construction.
1.10      Most houses constructed in Lesotho are built by the informal sector.
GOL's involvement has mostly been limited to providing housing for civil
servants and expatriate technicians. However, during the 1970s, GOL set up
the following institutions to assist in providing housing to all income groups.
1.11      The Building Finance Corporation (BFC) is the only mortgage finance
institution in Lesotho. It began operations in 1977 with funds from GOL and
the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT) to mobilize domestic
savings and promote private investment in housing, especially for middle- and
lower-income groups. It currently lends to middle-- and upper-income house-
holds having monthly incomes of M 400 (US$490) and above, but hopes to lower
the eligibility to those earning M 300 (US$366) per month in the future.
1.12      Lesotho Housing Corporation (LHC) is theoretically empowered to
build housing for all income groups. It has concentrated, however, on the
middle- and upper-income groups, being hampered by lack of staff and access
to financial resources for the poor. LHC has worked on a number of construc-
tion projects using bilateral aid and is currently engaged on one project
with BFC. The target groups have ranged from expat:riate technical staff to
middle-income groups able to afford rents of at least M 75 (US$92) per month
for shelter. The Commonwealth Development Corporat:ion (CDC) has recently
agreed in principle to provide funds of about MI  million (US$1.2 million)
for middle-income housing, with beneficiaries monthly incomes ranging from
M 120 to M 350 (US$146 to US$427).
1.13      Lower Income Housing Company (PTY) Ltd. (LEHCO-OP), was founded
in 1975 as a private company. In practice, however, it has the status of
a parastatal responsible to the Ministry of Commerce. Its job is to provide
housing to lower income households with incomes between M 50 and M 150 (about
US$61 and US$183) per month. LEHCO-OP is the only housing institution that
is operating at the low-cost end of the housing sector, but the scale of its
operation has been inadequate to meet housing demand mainly due to financial
constraints. So far it has built 250 houses in Maseru, and in 1979 contracted
to build a further 1040 (573 in Maseru and the remaining in Rome and in
Maputsoe) under a Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) financed
project. 1/  Implementation is underway.  GOL intends to create a statutory
corporation mandated to implement self-help housing projects nationwide, and
LEHCO-OP is expected to form the nucleus for the proposed corporation.
1/   CIDA's capital assistance is US$2.25 million equivalent.

1.14      Maseru is a town of 59,000 inhabitants of whom 28,000 reside in the
peri-urban areas beyond its official town boundaries set in 1906.  Between
1966 and 1976 the periurban population rose from 4,500 to 199600. Greater
Maseru grew by more than three times thne national average in the decade
1966-76, and more than double the average of other urban areas. Housing
demand is estimated roughly at about 1,200 units per year, consisting of
replacement and growth, but the backlog is at least three times this.
1.15      Most job opportunities have been concentrated within Maseru's
original boundaries, mainly in government, tourism, construction, industry and
the retail trades. There has been relatively little informal business activ-
ity. Income distribution is skewed: more people below the poverty threshold
live in the peri-urban areas (63%) compared to Maseru as a whole (50%). The
Township Authority has been able to do little to provide services to its outer
suburbs, as its revenue base is limited to the original town and is very Low.
Public housing agencies have yet to address the shelter requirements of
Maseru's low-income residents on any significant scale, due to capacity and
legal constraints, such as the land tenure system, as well as insufficient
attention to lower cost housing solutions.
C. Search for Solutions
1.16      The problems of Lesotho's urban sector as a whole, and Maseru in
particular, are not large in comparison with those of some other developing
countries. Nevertheless, GOL is anxious to prevent further deterioration
in urban services and provide better living conditions for the poorer urban
dwellers.  It is aware of the need for new approaches to the planning and
provision of affordable urban services, shelter and employment. It also
recognizes the inadequacy and limited capacity of institutions dealing with
the urban sector. With external assistance, GOL is strengthening these
institutions, training local staff to reduce its dependence on expatriates
and formulating a comprehensive legislative framework to deal with urban
growth.
1.17      To carry out the reform of the urban sector, GOL proposed four
new bills, the most important oL which has already been enacted (Land Act of
1979), dealing with the main issues of: (a) land tenure and transferability
of title; (b) urban institutions with sufficient authority, manpower and
an adequate financial base for managing urban growth; and (c) proper legal
authority to control the orderly development of urban areas.
Land and Related Legislation
1.18      All land in Lesotho i-s vested in the Nation and power to allocate
it vested in the King who had delegated it to traditional chiefs. Residential
plots were allocated to heads of households, and on their death to their heirs.
If the household head moved under the jurisdiction of a different chief or
died without heirs, the plot reverted to the chief for reallocation. For a
number of years GOL had been considering legislation to allow issuance of
legal titles that could be freely transferred in urban and rural areas but
this had met some opposition from chiefs whose powers it would erode.



1.19      1979 Land Act.  A new Land Act was introdiuced by the Government in
1978, and passed in October 1979 by the Parliament. The Act was given Royal
Assent, and gazetted, in December 1979. The act allows individuals leasehold
rights to land for the first time (details, para. 3.09), allows densification
of urban areas (details, Annex 1), and authorizes the Ministry of Interior
(MI) to collect charges for urban development and services and terminate
leases in the event of non-payment. Regulations for its implementation are
being drawn up, and its coming into full force and effect would be a condition
of effectiveness (para 8.01(b)).
1.20      Urban Institutions and Finance.  In order to provide a comprehensive
legislative and executive framework for urban planning and reform, which has
hitherto been lacking in Lesotho, GOL has drafted the following additional
legislation for submission to Parliament.
(a) Urban Government Bill: In 1978 GOL drafted a bill to create
urban authorities. It received technical assistance from
United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA) in
reviewing the draft. The revised draft is currently under
consideration. Assistance will also be needed in implement-
ing its provisions, particularly in helping to create the
Maseru Municipal Council (MMC) to replace the present Township"
Authority.
(b) Valuation and Rating Bill. This Bill provides for assessing
and charging (through rates) of property to raise revenues for
urban services. Existing legislation only covers property
within present town boundaries (unchanged since 1906) and
allows many exemptions from, and reductions in, ratable
value. The new bill is expected to remove these exemptions
and reductions and extend ratings to all urban areas.
(c)l Town and Country Planning Bill. This Bill would create a Town
and Country Planning Board that would undertake land use and
area development planning.
The Borrower has agreed that by April 1, 1982, it will establish MMC with
appropriate powers and responsibilities for the administration of Maseru,
update property and rating lists and introduce efficient planning incentives
(paras 8.02 (h), (i) and (j)). The Government has agreed to introduce appro-
priate legislation for this purpose.
Urban Services
1.21      GOL has embarked on a determined effort to meet the country's needs
for low-income housing and improved urban services by: (a) strengthening the
capability of institutions in the sector, (LEHCO-OP, LHC and BFC); (b) soli-
citing financial and technical assistance from external donors; (c) reducing
design standards and pursuing least cost options; and (d) moving towards full
cost recovery to ensure replicability.
Urban Employment
1.22      GOL's most pressing long-term problem will be to create more employ-
ment in Lesotho. In urban areas it is attempting to address the problem by



- 6 -
providing incentives to foreign companies to locate in Lesotho and to existing
companies to expand their activities. In the medium term, creation of job
opportunities will largely depend on the success of the Lesotho National
Development Corporation (LNDC) in attracting labor-intensive, assembly-type
industries. Also the slow-down in migration could create favorable conditions
for the Basotho Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO) to exploit the
industrial experience, supervisory skills and artisanship of returning
migrants in developing entrepreneurship and expanding small-scale economic
activity.
1.23      The difficult task of drafting employment objectives for the Third
FYDP has not been completed. The Labor Intensive Construction Unit (LCU),
founded in 1977 under the IDA-assisted Second Highway Project, continues to
be successful in providing jobs in the civil construction sector.
D. International Development Association (IDA) Role in Urban Sector
1.22      IDA's involvement in Lesotho's urban sector has been indirect,
mainly through assistance to manufacturing, which is located principally in
urban areas. In 1977 it approved a US$2.5 million Credit 1/ to assist LNDC
and BEDCO in their employment creation efforts, including assistance to
small-scale enterprises and a further Credit of US$4 million to LNDC was
approved in 1980. Under the Second Highway Credit approved in 1977, IDA also
financed a labor-intensive construction unit (LCU), which already employs
over 500 unskilled and semi-skilled workers in civil works, including roads
in urban and rural areas 2/. More recently, in 1979 IDA financed a water
supply project 3/ to improve water supply in seven provincial towns and
strengthen the organization dealing with water and sewerage in urban areas.
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS COST AND FINANCING
A. The Project
Objectives
2.01      The project would assist GOL in strengthening urban sector institu-
tions by putting in place a framework for managing urban growth and expanding
institutional capacity to plan and execute projects. In addition it would
provide affordable shelter and improved services to low-income urban residents
of Greater Maseru by meeting about 15% of the shelter demand and 25% of the
upgrading requirements in the period 1980-1985. To ensure replicability and
the maintenance of project components, full cost recovery of all allocable
costs would be a major goal; in the past cost recovery has been inadequate
and municipal services have been subsidized.

2/   Credit No. 619-LSO.
3/   Credit No. 887-LSO.



2.02      Other objectives would be to upgrade and add to community facilities,
improve health and sanitation conditions, stimulate employment through finan-
cial and technical assistance to the informal sector, encourage the local
production of building materials and construct roads through labor intensive
methods, train manpower and establish adequate routine maintenance of infra-
structure throughout Maseru.
2.03      To achieve the above goals the project would comprise:

Project Description
2.04      The proposed project would include:
(a) Technical Assistance: (i) Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
This unit would coordinate the work of ministries, parastatals
and consultants in implementing the project. As housing is
in short supply in Maseru, three houses would be provided for
the Unit. (ii) Studies. These are required to design the



- 8 -
organizational structure and administrative and financial
management systems for MMC and assess training needs,
Studies for the further development of Maseru and identi-
fication of a possible second project are also included.
Engineering and architectural services are estimated to
cost about M 254,000 (US$310,000) at an all inclusive
professional man-month cost of M 3,600 (US$4,400) for
43 man-months. PCU and the studies are estimated to
cost about M 617,000 (US$753,000) at an all inclusive
professional man-month cost of M 2,900 1/ (US$3,500)
for about 150 man-months. Consultants and professional
staff with necessary qualifications and experience are
available in the Southern Africa Region at this cost.
(b) Site Preparation and Servicing:
(i) Sites and Services: About 500 residential and up
to 25 small business plots would be developed at a
33 ha site at Khubetsoana, about 4.5 km from central
Maseru. The site is about a 5 km walk from Maseru's,
present industrial area, and bus and minibus service
is available. The Khubetsoana site also adjoins an
abbatoir scheduled to open in late 1980 as the nucleus of
a new agro-industries area, which is expected to generate
about 380 jobs over the next four years. Residents would
be given security of tenure and would be able to sell their
property lease. Services would be to a minimum standard
and could be upgraded as resident's income permits.
(ii) Upgrading. Thamaes, a peri-urban area with a population
of about 8,500 would be declared a "selected development
area" for the purposes of upgrading services and
densification (para 3.08). It is some 3 km from
central Maseru. 2The area has about 1,300 plots averag-
ing over 1,000 m per plot. Under the project the area
would be densified by subdividing the existing plots
which are very large by urban standards, even for Africa.
It is estimated that about 1,200 new plots would be created
by subdividing giving a total of 2,500. Of these about 25
would be reserved for small businesses. Existing services
in the area are poor. The project would provide for initial
upgrading to a minimum standard and further upgrading
could be undertaken as residents' income permits. A
preliminary layout is shown in Map IBRD 14359 and design
standards are given in Table IV-1.
(c) Home Construction and Improvement Loans. Loans ranging from
M 244 to M 782 (US$298 to US$954) would be made available to
about 1,700 households. A loan of M 782 (US$954) would enable
a householder to self-build a two roomed house with a latrine.
1/   Housing and office accommodations would be provided for the PCU staff.



- 9 -
Loan amounts would be determined on the basis of plot occu-
pants' ability to repay. All loans would be made through
LEHCO-OP. Borrowers would be free to construct houses of
their own design. A variety of standard plans would, however,
be made available through LEHCO-OP (see paras 4.12-4.13).
Some of the designs are already being used in the on-going
CIDA project (para 1.13) and, if necessary, would be modified
for this project.
(d) Primary Infrastructure. (i) Essential primary infrastructure
would be included in the site and service and the upgrading
areas. For the site and service area, the existing peripheral
road would be upgraded to gravel standard and a through
road paved and provided with street lights with project
funds. Paving and lighting of the peripheral road in the
upgrading area would also be funded under the project.
(ii) Off-site water would be provided by GOL from its own
resources as a part of the water supply extension to the
proposed industrial area at Khubetsoana and the abbattoir.
In the upgrading area, off-site water would be provided
under the existing African Development Bank (ADB) loan.
Extension of the water supply to the Khubetsoana area would
be provided from GOL's own resources to which Cabinet approval
has been granted. (iii) Extension and upgrading of the
electrical network to the project areas would be provided
by the Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) from its own
resources. This was confirmed at negotiations (para 8.02(e)).
(e) Community Facilities
(i) Primary Education. The project would provide 28 addi-
tional classrooms to existing schools to enable full
primary education to be offered in the project areas.
Teachers for these schools would be paid by the Ministry
of Education (ME), which would also bear all associated
recurrent expenditure.
(ii) Multipurpose Community Centers. These would be used for
health, nutrition, child care, and other community activi-
ties. Lesotho suffers from a heavy incidence of gastro-
intestinal, respiratory and endemic diseases.  The
infant mortality rate, according to the Bureau of
Statistics, is 106 per 1,000 live births. Despite GOL
efforts to provide preventive care and health/nutrition
education, facilities continue to be inadequate. The
outpatient service of the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in
Maseru is greatly overstrained. Provision of two health
clinics providing maternal and child health (MCH)
together with nutrition units would serve the needs of
the project areas and reduce overload at the hospital.



- 10 -
Nutrition units are designed to improve nutrition,
particularly of pregnant women and children under
three years of age. MCH Clinic sessions would be held,
including prenatal and postnatal care, under-five clinic,
school health program, nutrition education and demonstra-
tion, child spacing and population education. Basic
first aid, environmental health services, health edu-
cation and the maintenance of health statistics would
also be provided at each health center. Adjacent to
each health center, a multipurpose community hall would
be provided for daycare of preschool children and other
recreational and training facilities. Staff and
recurrent budget for these facilities would be provided
by the Ministry of Health (MH).
(f)  Maintenance and Refuse Equipment.  Maintenance of roads in
Maseru is poor and minimum equipment would be provided in
the project to enable MI (subsequently MMC) to maintain the
town and project roads adequately. Equipment would also be
provided for trash collection. GOL has agreed to provide
sufficient funds and manpower to maintain an adequate level
of service in Maseru and its peri-urban areas. For this
purpose, it has agreed in consultation with the Association,
to prepare an annual road maintenance program for each fiscal
year; the program for 1980-81 was agreed during negotiations
(para 8.02(a)).
(g) Assistance to the Informal Sector. The project includes two
30-stall retail markets and serviced plots for small business
and workshops in the upgrading and site and services areas.
Building material loans to small businesses and workshops for
the construction of shops would be provided under the project
through LEHCO-OP (maximum 50 loans up to M 782 (US$954) each).
Loans for the purchase of machinery, other equipment, raw
materials and working capital amounting to about M 140,000
(US$171,000) would be provided by BEDCO from its normal
resources, which were reviewed during project appraisal by
the IDF mission and were considered adequate to meet the
credit requirements of the informal sector in Maseru.
B. Cost Estimates
2.05      Total project costs including contingencies are estimated at M 5.8
(US$7.1) million with a foreign exchange component of M 3.3 (US$4.0) million
or 56%. Summary cost estimates are given in Table 2.2. Land in Lesotho is
vested absolutely and irrevocably in the Nation. No costs for land were
therefore included in the project, as no financial outlays are involved. Base
cost estimates are at January 1980 prices and are based on (a) preliminary



- 11 -
engineering design for civil/electrical works, (b) suppliers quotations for
equipment and materials, and (c) current costs of consulting services on other
projects in Lesotho. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 15% of
all infrastructure, community facilities and markets. No physical contingen-
cies have been included on home improvement loans, equipment and technical
assistance. Price contingencies are based on estimates of inflation in
Southern Africa and are slightly higher than Bank estimates (for details
see Table II-2 footnote (b)).
C. Financing
2.06      The proposed IDA Credit of US$6.0 (M 4.9) million would finance about
85% of project costs. No duties and taxes are payable on goods and services
for the project imported directly into and purchased within the South African
Customs Union. It is expected that all the goods and services will be procured
within the Customs Union. The Credit will cover 100% of the estimated foreign
exchange of US$4.0 million and about 65% of the local costs.

III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
3.01      Overall responsibility for project execution would lie with the
Ministry of Interior (MI) which has set up a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) within the Ministry. All of PCU's functions would be transferred to
the Maseru Municipal Council (the MMC) when it is established (para 6.05).
A. The Ministry of the Interior (MI)
3.02      This Ministry is responsible for public administration through
the Township, Regional and District offices. MI also includes the Departments
of Land, Survey and Physical Planning, Housing and Urban Development, Chief-
tainship, Immigration and Passports (see Organization Chart attached as Figure
lII-1). Although MI is responsible for most urban and rural housing, the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, through LEHCO-OP, provides housing for the
lower income housing market. Plans to consolidate all housing under MI are
under consideration.
B. Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
3.03      The PCU would consist of a project director, an accountant, muni-
cipal engineer, a sanitation specialist and support staff. A Mosotho Project
Director has already been appointed and has been involved in project prepara-
tion. Appointment of a municipal engineer to oversee all engineering works
(except sanitation), a sanitary engineer to oversee the low-cost sanitation
program and a professional accountant would be conditions of effectiveness
(para 8.01(a)). The PCU would be responsible for overall coordination and
would oversee the implementation of all components being carried out by GOL
agencies. All project funds would be disbursed directly by the PCU.

3.04      During appraisal GOL requested that, as project components are
relatively small, wherever possible GOL agencies be used to design and
construct them. Existing institutions were appraised and would be used where
they can undertake the work described in (a) and(b) below efficiently and
without detriment to their existing programs. However, the Project Director
would have the right to employ consultants/contractors if any of the agencies
prove unable to perform their duties efficiently. Implementation would be
carried out as follows:
(a) Design and Supervision. Consultants would be appointed to design
and supervise the construction of road and water 1/ infrastruc-
ture. LEC would design and supervise electrical works. MW would
design and supervise the construction of community facilities and
markets. The sanitation team would give technical assistance in
designing and constructing low-cost latrines.
(b) Construction. Water reticulation and community facilities would
be constructed through contractors. The Water Supply Branch
(WSB) of the Ministry of Water, Power and Natural Resources
would take over, operate and maintain the water supply works
constructed under the Project; arrangements for this, including
recovery of capital and maintenance costs, satisfactory to
the Association would be entered into by April 1, 1981 (para
8.03(g). Street lighting would be constructed by LEC and all
roads would be built by LCU through force account. LCU has
been successfully upgrading roads and airstrips and has
adequate staff and experience to construct these works
efficiently.
3.05      LEHCO-OP would be responsible for (a) mobilizing community partici-
pation in the upgrading scheme through its community service department,
(b) assisting MI's Physical Planning Office in planning the site and services
and upgrading layouts, (c) providing technical assistance for construction of
self-help houses and sanitation units, (d) administering the building materi-
als loan scheme, and (e) monitoring, in coordination with BEDCO, the
construction and development of business sites.
3.06      LEHCO-OP will acquire additional staff to meet the requirements
of the proposed project. It has been assisting MI in project preparation
since early 1978. LEHCO-OP would provide the full-time services of one
architect planner and all necessary support staff, including its community
development section, during the life of the project. LEHCO-OP's organization
is shown in Figure III.2. The costs of expanding LEHCO-OP to meet the needs
of the project are included in the project costs on the understanding that
GOL will ensure that LEHCO-OP continues to function as a low-cost housing
agency during project implementation and would provide the services necessary
for efficient project implementation. An agreement: acceptable to IDA would
be entered into beween GOL and LEHCO-OP and this would be a condition of
effectiveness (para 8.01(d)).
1/   Since the WSB would take over all water installation and standpipes
constructed under the project, it would be neczessary for the PCU to
have full consultation with it from inception to completion of this
component.



- 16 -
C. Details of Proiect Management and Training
Community Participation
3.07      A major effort would be focussed on community participation mainly
through the use of "pitsos", discussion fora traditionally used by chiefs for
information dissemination and decision making. MI used pitsos in July
1978 to explain the reasons for its socioeconomic survey which were to collect
data for project design. The survey covered income levels, housing standards
and occupations of peri-urban residents. Although preliminary layouts and
engineering designs for upgrading areas have already been prepared, the final
placement of roads, standpipes and other facilities would be decided only
after on-site consultation, again using pitsos, by MI's Physical Planning
Office. Basic options for providing services would be explained, both orally
and by staking, well in advance of construction. Suggestions from residents
would be taken into account in deciding the final placement of the services.
Exact placement of community facilities would also be discussed by LEHCO-OP's
community services department through the pitsos before final decisions are
made.
Densification in Thamaes
3.08      The 1979 Land Act provides for establishing "Selected Development
Areas" to enable town planning, boundary adjustment, upgrading of services
and densification. Densification would be managed by MI, assisted by
LEHCO-OP. Persons whose plots are affected by the redevelopment scheme
could receive substitute rights and/or compensation. Disputes could be
appealed to a special Land Tribunal (for details of densification see
Annex 1). During negotiations GOL agreed to declare Thamaes a "selected
development area" not later than December, 1980 and prepare a development
and a densification scheme in consultation with IDA prior to undertaking any
construction (para 8.02(c)).
Tenure
3.09      The Land Act allows individuals and corporations to hold leasehold
title to property for the first time in Lesotho. Under the Act every adult
Mosotho is entitled to one lease free of ground rent, provided the use made
of that land is for the person's own residence. Additional leases would
be subject to ground rent, renewable every ten years. These leases would
be given for up to 90 years with an automatic right of renewal, provided the
land was not required for public purposes and rental and other conditions
could be agreed. This title would be inheritable and the lessee would have
the right to transfer, mortgage or sublet the land.

Allocation Procedures 1/
3.10      It has been agreed that plots and house improvement loans for both
the upgrading and sites and services site in Maseru would be allocated to
heads of households who:
(a) are citizens of Lesotho;
(b) have regular incomes, not exceeding M 185 per household
per month (January 1980 prices); 2/
(c)  have resided in Greater Maseru for the preceding year; and
(d)  do not already own site or house in Maseru.
During negotiations it was agreed that GOL would use beneficiary selection
criteria and a standard agreement acceptable to IDA, for plot allocation and
payment of all charges, including loan repayments (para 8.02(b)).
Training
3.11      Existing accounting staff in MI's Township Office have little
formal financial training and lack the necessary basic education to permit
training above an elementary bookkeeping level. However, a Mosotho has
recently been recruited with the necesssary qualifications but little expe-
rience who would be a suitable counterpart to the professional accountant
required under the project (para 3.03). Professional accounting training
on a country-wide basis started in 1979 and the first graduates should come
on stream in three to four years, so that in due course the services of expa-
triate accountants could be dispensed with. Technical training is carried out
by the Lerotholi Technical Institute. About 40 engineers in various fields
are being trained abroad. Due to a shortage of engineers in Lesotho no local
engineers were available for the PCU, but GOL plans to make available six
technicians for practical training on this project.
I/   These are essentially the same as those adopted under the CIDA project
with the significant exception that households with monthly incomes of
M 50 and below are not eligible for loans under the CIDA project.
2/   60% of the plots in the site and service area would be reserved for
households below the poverty threshold of M 90 per household per
month (January 1980 prices).

IV. DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
A. Layouts
4.01      Due to the shortage of land and the high cost of providing infrastruc-
ture and s2rvices, G9L has decided to reduce plot sizes for low-income housing
from 350 m  to 200 m . GOL is already subdividing large plots on which civil
servant housing is built and intends to densify peri-urban areas.
4.02      The upgrading layouts would attempt to retain all existing dwellings
and use existing road reserves wherever possible. Plots would have reasonable
access to local streets and accessways.  As 2density increas s, plot sizes are
expected to reduce from the present 1,000 m to about 300 m (see Map IBRD
14359). Adequate open space would be provided for community facilities and
markets.
4.03      The layout of the site and services scheme ensures maximum efficiency
of land use yielding about 60% of the site for residential use and a private
allocable area of 71%. Plots would be about 200 m . All plots would have
vehicular access by either streets or accessways and adequate open space would
be reserved for community facilities. Small business plots would be positioned
along the through road and in other areas where they would be likely to
encourage commercial activities.
B. Infrastructure and Servicing Standards
Infrastructure
4.04      In designing the project, existing conditions and service capacity
were assessed and engineering works necessary to meet additional requirements
worked out. The problem was to provide shelter and services to households
within the poverty group earning incomes of less than M 90 (US$110) per month
at an affordable cost while assuring full cost reccvery of all allocable
investment. Therefore, the designs are low cost, but upgradable in the
future. Design standards. for each service are shown in Table IV-1.
Sanitation
4.05      Materials to construct low-cost latrines would be provided.  A
sanitation team would be created to survey and recommend alternate latrine
types taking into account site conditions and cultural factors. Initially
LEHCO-OP would build models of various types for the CIDA project that would
be closely monitored to get public and plotholder response. Following the



- 20 -
analysis of this response, plotholders will be given technical assistance in
constructing the chosen latrines. Community and health workers would assist
in implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A health education program
would be provided to all beneficiaries. Latrines have a life expectancy of
four to ten years after which they would require desludging which would be
carried out by MI/MCC, the cost of which would be borne by the householders.
Plots would reserve space to allow access for desludging and the installation
of piped services.
Community Facilities
4.06      Primary School Classrooms.  At present not more than 40% of primary
schools have classes up to grade 7. Adding classrooms to approximately 20%
of the existing schools would provide teaching space to allow a full primary
education to be offered for the project areas.
4.07      Thamaes.  Two primary schools exist in this area, Thamaes and
Itekeng, with enrollments of 139 and 341 pupils. The Thamaes school is
located in a former dwelling house. Classes are held in the open air. The
Itekeng school consists of 7 standard classrooms, but there are no latrines
and virtually no furniture or equipment.
4.08      Due to site limitations at Thamaes school, it is proposed to enlarge
Itekeng school by providing 7 additional classrooms (280 places). For similar
reasons it is proposed to add 7 classrooms to the Lithabaneng school, which is
outside the project boundary but within the catchment area. These additions
will meet projected requirements up to 1984.
4.09      Khubetsoana.  The nearby school at Mejametalana (Khubetsoana) will
be expanded by 14 classrooms to provide places for about 560 pupils. These
places will be required by 1984.

4.11      Multipurpose Community Centers.  Two health/nutrition clinics would
be constructed in the project areas, each providing accommodation for an
average of 70 attendances per half day session and consist of a waiting area
permitting health education and nutrition activities, two examination rooms,
a treatment room, a demonstration kitchen, storage and an office for environ-
mental health. There will be a combined registry/pharmacy. Adjoining each
clinic would be a 125 m , simply constructed, community hall, that would also
be available as a daycare center for about 50 preschool children.
4.12      Housing Design.  During project preparation, recommendations were
made for producing soundly constructed single storey housing, designed for
the urban poor with affordability as the principle criterion.
4.13      The smallest room module would require building materials costing
M 257 (US$313). The smallest 2-room house would require materials costing
* 723 (US$882). 1/  Designs permit maximum flexibility to allow phased house
construction and conform with local lifestyle.
4.14      Project beneficiaries would be encouraged to produce building blocks
and instructed in block laying. "Self-help," or reliance on local tradesmen
would reduce overall construction costs and provide jobs for lower income
groups. The project would provide a means of improving simple building tech-
nology skills, the results of which would be monitored and used to produce a
"do-it-yourself" housing construction manual (para 5.08).

4.15      Retail Markets.  Two 100 m  retail markelt structures, with sheet
metal roofs supported by simple lashed poles, would be provided in the
project area. Each would have,approximately 30 stall slabs for retailers.
Latrines and surface water drainage would also be provided.
1/   Beneficiaries would be required to pay a deposit of 5% for these
materials resulting in actual loans of M 244 (US$298) and M 782
(US$954) for one room and two rooms respectively (para 2.04(c)).

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation
5.01      The project would take about four years to complete, including
completion of self-help housing with the aid of building material loans.
Consequently, the project completion date will be June 1984. The imple-
mentation schedule is shown in Chart V-1.
B. Procurement
5.02      MI through the PCU would invite and evaluate all bids and award
contracts in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Since con-
tracts for civil and building works and equipment would be small, 1/ they
would be unlikely to attract contractors from outside southern Africa.
Therefore, competitive bidding using local procedures would be employed.
These procedures are satisfactory to IDA and and would allow international
contractors and suppliers and those from neighboring countries to bid.
5.03      Road works, including contingencies, amounting to M 1.20 (US$1.46)
million would be constructed by LCU using force account. It has carried out
similar works efficiently in the past (para 3.04(b)). Consultants would
supervise force account construction of these works. LEC would design and
construct electrical works by force account amounting to M 0.18 (US$0.22)
million (para 3.04(a)).
5.04      Building material loans for self-help housing, sanitation units and
workshops are estimated at M 1.47 (US$1.7) million including contingencies,
about 50% of which is for blocks, cement and sand. The delivery rate for
these materials must be closely coordinated with the rate of construction of
houses in various locations over a period of three years. To avoid storing
materials for long periods with resultant cost and problems of pilferage, it
is proposed to procure these materials from local sources using local bidding
procedures.
C. Disbursement
5.05      IDA would disburse 85% of the total cost of civil works, community
facilities and building materials, 100% of the foreign cost or 85% of the
total cost of equipment and 100% of the foreign cost or 85% of the total cost
of technical assistance including consulting services. Disbursements would
1/   Water reticulation and building contracts including contingencies amount
to M 0.2 (US$0.24) million and M 0.7 (US$0.85) million, respectively.
Contracts for various equipment including contingencies will total
M 0.56 (US$0.68) million.

be fully documented: for technical assistance and works carried out by
force account disbursements would be made against certificates of expenditure
certified by the Project Director. Documentation for these items would not
be submitted to IDA for review but would be retained by the Borrower and made
available for inspection by IDA during the course of project supervision. An
estimated Schedule of Disbursement is shown in Table V-1.
5.06      To maintain the momentum of project preparation, GOL has requested
approval of retroactive financing to cover project-related expenditures in-
curred after July 1, 1979 including consultant services and operational costs
of the PCU prior to Credit signing. Total estimated expenditure is about
US$120,000 of which about US$100,000 is recommended for retroactive financing.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.07      In view of the manpower shortages prevailing in Lesotho, monitoring
and evaluation would be a modest exercise geared to the gathering of essential
management information and the analysis of practical problems and project
impact on beneficiaries. A special effort would be focused on key features
to form an information base for future projects. The monitoring system would
highlight potential implementation problems to enable speedy remedial action.
5.08      Each implementing institution would be responsible for routine
monitoring of its own activities and would report to the PCU. The PCU would
prepare a consolidated quarterly report for IDA, the format of which was
agreed at negotiations (para 8.02(d)). PCU would report on design, tender-
ing, costs and construction. LEHCO-OP would report on the evolution of its
community development program, densification, housing consolidation and
occupancy. It would also prepare a self-help housing manual in both Sesotho
and English based on the experience of CIDA and IDA financed projects (para
4.14). Agreement was reached at negotiations that on completion of the
project PCU would prepare a project completion report on the basis of an
outline to be agreed with IDA (para 8.02(d)).
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Municipal Organization and Finance
Organization
6.01      The present Township organization in Maseru is part of MI.
Although it carries out a few municipal services such as street cleaning
and refuse and nightsoil collection, it is not an adequate municipal authority.
The township organization consists of 60 positions, of which 12 were vacant,
including the three senior positions of town clerk, engineer and treasurer, on
April 1, 1979. Financial staff, seconded from Treasury, is not part of the
Township organization. The financial staff comprises two graded accountants

and six temporary clerical assistants with little formal financial training.
Manual staff numbers about 200 and appears to be more than adequate for the
services carried out. Manpower needs would be examined by consultants in
reviewing the establishment of MMC and recommendations made on the number of
staff required to administer the Greater Maseru area when it becomes a municipal
council (para 6.05). Funding for studies for this has been included under the
Project's Technical Assistance component.
Finances
6.02      The Township Office's financial systems are typical of a government
cash system, with no control accounts and little information or follow-up on
arrears. An improved cost accounting system, with changeover to accrual
accounting, is recommended as soon as possible. The municipal council,
when formed (para 6.05), would be expected to use the accrual system. The
current financial situation of the Township Office is very weak, with an
inadequate income base derived from property rates and other charges for
municipal services - income and expenditure is shown in Table VI-1. Only
about one-third of Township expenditure is covered by income. Many items
such as the provision of office accommodation and services and the cost
of the Treasury financial staff are not included in this expenditure.

Arrears
6.03      The largest part of income, about 50%, is from rates on property,
but as can be seen from Table VI-2, arrears at the end of FY78/79 represented
nearly one and a half years' charges, with the Township Office managing to
collect only 38% of outstanding arrears in FY78/79. The technical assistance
being provided under the project (including consultants) would carry out a
detailed examination of the arrears problem and recommend solutions.

6.04      The rate charge itself is a low 0.25% to 1% of property values,
which were last assessed in 1972. Furthermore, neither new buildings nor
improvement to existing buildings have been taken into account. In addition
the existing law on rating and valuation allows many exemptions from, or
reductions in, liability for the payment of property rates. IDA would expect
a new Valuation and Rating Bill to come into operation at an early date in the
project cycle (April 1982) and assurances were obtained that GOL would take
all action within its power for the Bill's enactment, gazetting and coming
into operation (paras 1.20 (b) and 8.02(j)).
Proposed Reform
6.05      Due to the lack of a properly assessed mutnicipal tax base and
inadequate institutions to collect taxes, GOL has been hampered in providing
proper municipal services in Maseru and other towns and in undertaking urban
development schemes. It proposes to establish municipal councils starting
with MMC (para 1.20(a)). Technical assistance would be provided in this
project to design the organizational structure, and the technical, administra-
tive and financial management systems and assess training needs. This assis-
tance would include the design of a project monitoring and control system and
financial forecasts of the operations of MMC through 1985/86. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that following the enactment and gazetting of the
Urban Government Bill (paras 1.20(a) and 8.02(h)), MMC would be created with
adequate staff, powers, responsibilities and financial resources to meet the
cost of its operations (para 8.02(i)).



- 30 -
6.06      GOL proposes to obtain an expatriate professional accountant for
the PCU who will, inter alia, (a) assist the Township to improve its financial
management and control and (b) prepare for the creation of MMC, including
assisting the MMC consultants and (c) act as Treasurer to MMC upon its creation.
Terms of reference have been prepared for obtaining such an accountant under
bilateral assistance. Because of the key role of the accountant in the pro-
ject, his/her appointment would be a condition of effectiveness (para 8.01(a)).
6.07      PCU will maintain separate accounts of all income and expenditure.
Annual statements of account will be prepared within six months; audited by
auditors satisfactory to IDA and submitted to IDA within twelve months of the
end of the fiscal year.  Agreement on this was reached during negotiations
(para 8.02(f)).
B. Cost Recovery
6.08      The following principles of cost recovery are to be applied to
the various elements of the project:
(a) those costs which are normally recovered by public
authorities in the form of user charges or tariffs
would be similarly recovered (e.g., off-site infra-
structure for water, electricity and roads);
(b) all site development costs for on-site infra-
structure, home construction and improvement loans,
design, engineering and supervision would be borne
directly by the beneficiaries in respect of private
plots.   Costs relating to public areas such as schools
and community facilities would be borne by MI/MMC.
(c) Urban services to be provided by MI/MMC would be recovered
by a monthly service charge collected by BFC. With the creation
of MMC these services will be recovered by municipal rates
and charges (e.g., garbage collection, street lighting,
cleaning and maintenance).
6.09      Cost recovery for project components would be as follows:

/a   Allocable costs include price and physical contingencies, and administra-
tive (LEHCO-OP) costs.
6.11      Past low-cost housing projects have been subsidized with GOL recover-
ing about 60% of allocable costs. Under the project, however, all allocable
costs would be recovered directly from beneficiaries. A total of 72 percent
of project costs would be recovered directly through development charges, loan
charges, service charges/municipal rates and tariffs. Twenty-eight percent of
project costs would be unallocable to project beneficiaries, being recovered
from general revenues. These include multipurpose community centers, schools,
PCU, staff housing, and studies. Agreement on levels of cost recovery was
reached during negotiations (paras 6.16 and 8.02(b)).
6.12      Under the Land Act 1979, GOL would declare the Thamaes area a
selected development area so a scheme could be drawn up to upgrade services
and reallocate plot boundaries with a view to densification. Under this
Act plot owners would be levied development charges on a per square meter
basis so that larger plots would have to pay higher charges; this should act



- 32 -
as an incentive to reduce plot sizes through densification. Under the scheme
all existing titles would be extinguished, and substitute rights granted. The
Commissioner of Lands would assess plot values before and after the completion
of the scheme with an appropriate financial adjustment for any difference in
value. The cost of land aquisition for the new, smaller, plots to be created
by densification would be passed on by MI to beneficiaries receiving them, and
deducted from the development costs of plots retained by subdividers. As the
cost of plot aquisition is expected to be less than that of upgrading, there
would be no outflow of government funds for this component. The anticipated
aquisition costs of new plots would be affordable by an estimated 90% of the
project's potential clientele (Table VI-4).
6.13      A downpayment of 5% of the development charges and materials loans
would be required from beneficiaries, except for existing lessees in Thamaes
who accept substitute plots and who do not require a building materials loan.
The amount of the material loans would vary according to the beneficiary's
ability to pay the combined monthly development and service charges and loan
repayment. The cost of materials to be issued would be limited to a ceiling
of M 823 (Loan M 782 plus deposit of M 41), which would be adequate to pur-
chase materials to construct a two-room house and latrine unit. Development
charges and loan repayments would be recovered through monthly installments at
9% over 20 years. These charges would be collected through BFG which has the
necessary expertize and is willing to do this as it does for the CIDA housing
project. An agreement acceptable to IDA to this effect would be entered into
between BFC and MI and this will be a condition of effectiveness (para 8.01(c)).
6.14       The Government had initially agreed to charge 4-5% under the ongoing
CIDA-supported low cost housing project, but subsequently agreed to raise this
to 9%, and charge the same rate under the proposed IDA project. While this
rate is not now positive in light of recent inflation projections, its doubling
shows an important recognition by GOL of the need to move toward positive real
interest rates. This interest rate would be reviewed every five years from
the data on which the first payment falls due and would be fixed at 2% per
annum below the prime lending rate of BFC at that time. 1/ BFC would further
collect a service charge averaging about 1%. Recent and projected future
inflation rates are shown in the following table:

6.15      The monthly service charge would cover the cost of services pro-
vided under the project and be based on the known value of each property
as an interim measure, pending the introduction of the Valuation and Rating
Act (para 6.04). Property value would be assessed on the basis of on-site
infrastructure cost plus the cost of building materials used to build houses
plus 60% of the materials cost as the estimated cost of labor. A charge of
3% per annum of this assessed value, to be recovered monthly by BFC along with
development charges and building loan repayments, would be adequate to meet
the recurrent costs of the two project areas. The financing plan would be
reviewed by consultants in preparing for the creation of MMC (para 6.05).
6.16      Allocable plot costs are shown in Table VI-5.  Charges for plots,
building loans and service charges are summarized in Table VI-4 which also
shows the levels of affordability at different income levels. Project cash
flows are detailed in Table VI-6, which shows a satisfactory cash position
with beneficiaries paying plot and building loan charges of M 280,000 and
service charges (rates) of M 126,000 in the year 1984/85. By comparison
current annual charges are only M 65,000 due to the many exemptions from and
reduction in ratable charges. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with GOL on the calculation of charges for recovering costs from the project
beneficiaries (para 8.02(b)).
C. Income Distribution and Affordability
6.17      Design standards for the proposed project are quite modest and this
has been reflected in the relatively low unit costs of various plots. Per
plot costs are greater in the upgrading area than in the site and services
area because plot sizes are much larger in the former, resulting in high
infrastructure costs per plot. Household budget data suggests that low-income
households can afford up to 20% of their income on shelter and related services.
Based on this information, which is considered reasonable, minimum charges for
sites and services and upgrading plots are affordable by approximately 75%
of the poor of Greater Maseru. Minimum plot options including sanitation
substructure, plus a construction loan to self-build one room, would be
affordable by about 60% of Maseru's poor population (see footnote Table VI-5).
Income distribution and affordable monthly charges are given in Table VI-7.

D. Project Replicability
6.18      The project demonstrates the feasibility of providing affordable
services to low-income households and recovering costs without overstraining
GOL's already stretched budget. However, the replicability of the project is
very much dependent on the successful collection of development and service
charges, loan repayment and the institutional capacity to execute the project.
The project would meet only about 25% of the upgrading requirements and 15% of
the shelter demand of Maseru to 1985. The cost of upgrading the remaining 75%
and meeting the backlog of Maseru's low-cost shelter demands is estimated at
M 26 (US$32) million. Because of financial and capacity constraints it would
take about 16 years to meet the demand to 1985 at the present rate of invest-
ment, including this project. The project includes studies that should result
in future low-cost housing projects.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Benefits
7;0 i     The project will have an important impact on the urban sector,
being the GOL's first major effort to put in place the institutions capable of
responding to the demand for basic and affordable infrastructure services in



- 38 -
Maseru's peri-urban areas. It will also continue GOL's efforts, started with
the CIDA-financed low income community development project, to provide low-cost
site and services housing in Maseru. Direct benefits of the proposed project
would be seen in (a) the provision of essential services at least cost in the
site and servicesand upgrading areas to benefit a population of about 20,000
by 1985; in the upgrading area 63% have incomes below the absolute urban
poverty threshold while in the site and services area 60% of sites would be
reserved for people below this threshold; (b) the improvement in sanitary
conditions affecting the population of Greater Maseru, but mainly directed
towards the poorer sections of the community; (c) the employment stimulated by
the provision of markets and business plots, labor intensive road construction
and use of locally manufactured building materials; and (d) the provision of
improved access to and supply of water.
7.02      The project would have important demonstration effects, particularly
regarding the policies it would introduce in: (a) cost recovery of all
allocable costs; (b) least cost solutions for services provided; (c) improve-
ment of the tax base of Maseru; (d) reduction of plot sizes and densification
in the upgrading area; and (e) provision of low-cost sanitation units.
7.03      In the longer term, benefits would arise from the institutional
support given by the project, particularly the (a) establishment of MMC and
training of its staff; (b) extension of progressive property taxes through-
out Maseru to recover the costs of improved urban services and to augment
the resources of the town; and (c) strengthening of LEHCO-OP's capacity
to provide low-cost affordable houses for the urban poor.
B. Rates of Return
7.04      The economic rate of return for the sites and services and the up-
grading scheme components, which represent almost 60% of total project costs,
are estimated at about 22% for each. Rates of return were not computed for
other project components due to difficulties in quantifying their benefits.
Qualitative assessment of the economic merits of these components are dis-
cussed in paras 7.07 and 7.08.
Site and Services and Upgrading Scheme
7.05      The valuation of benefits in the site and services and the up-
grading areas is based upon estimates of increases in property values brought
about by improvements made under the project. Rental values in the project
areas and areas with similar location characteristics were based on surveys
carried out during project preparation. The following estimates of rental
values were used for calculation of benefits:



- 39 -
VII.1 Rental Values
(Maloti Per House Per Month)
Without      With
Project     Project
Site and Services Area: /a  1 Room Without Sanitation    --             10
1 Room With Sanitation        --          14
2 Rooms With Sanitation       --          25
Upgrading Area:               1 Room Without Sanitation    12           16
(Thamaes)                    1 Room With Sanitation         16          20
2 Rooms With Sanitation        30         35
/a   It is expected that, after completion of construction and community
settlement, there will be an upward adjustment of rental values in line
with those prevailing in other serviced peri-urban areas, such as Thamaes.
7.06      The following project costs were included i.L the analysis:
(a) site development costs, including design and supervision,
on-site infrastructure, allocable primary infrastructure
and physical contingencies;
(b) the cost of building materials and estimated cost of labor
for house construction and improvement; and
(c) annual operating and maintenance cost, estimated at 3% of
total development costs, including the cost of labor.
If costs increase by 10% and benefits are 10% less than estimated, the rates
of return would fall to 16% in the site and services and upgrading areas.
Assistance to the Informal Sector
7.07     The provision of 60 market stalls, 30 each in the site and services
and upgrading areas, would provide jobs for about 75 persons at an average
capital cost of M 744 (US$908) per job. The market areas would act as a
focus for commercial activity in the project sites. Adjacent to each market
area 25 plots would be designated for shops. BEDCO, through its normal credit
and technical assistance to small enterprises, would assist the enterprises
that locate on these plots. Total cost of such assistance is estimated at
M 140,000 (US$171,000). Average incremental cost per job is estimated as
follows:

Other Benefits
7.08      Non-quantifiable project benefits of the project include, inter
alia, improvement in the quality of Maseru's physical environment through the
garbage collection, drainage, water supply and public sanitation components
of the project, and in MI/MMC's ability to maintain these services through
the reorganization and re-equipment of its technical services department.
The addition of classrooms and health clinics should significantly improve the
levels of education and health and nutrition services in the site and services
and upgrading areas.
C. Project Risks
7.09      As IDA's first urban project in Lesotho and GOL's first major
attempt to address the low-income housing needs of Maseru's population on
a full cost recovery basis, the project has a number of new features which
are subject to risk. GOL has expressed itself willing to initiate these
features which it sees as being closely linked with legislative and admin-
istrative reforms being carried out within the country. Three main areas
of risk can be identified:
(a)  institutional arrangements, discussed in para 3.01 to 3.07
would require efficient management and close coordination
among different executing agencies, given the multi-sectoral
nature of the project. The PCU, staffed using project funds,
should minimize the risks involved;



- 41 -
(b) cost recovery mechanisms described in Chapter VI are essential
to the success and replicability of the project. However,
failure to collect may result from political unwillingness to
enforce collection of all charges. This would result in poor
maintenance of services, inability to meet debt repayment
obligations and a need for subsidy from GOL. The risk is
considered worth taking due to the expressed willingness of
beneficiaries to pay for improved services and GOL's intention
not to subsidize urban development; and
(c) densification of Thamaes may not take place as rapidly as planned
due to political considerations. GOL is, however, aware of the
need for reducing plot sizes in urban areas and has already taken
steps in this direction; the Land Act also provides the legal
instruments necessary to ensure densification.
The above risks have been discussed with GOL, which has expressed its willing-
ness to carry out the necessary legislative and administrative reforms to
ensure the project's success and has already enacted and gazetted the most
important of these, the Land Act of 1979. Design standards for the site and
services and upgrading areas have been determined after detailed analysis
of a range of alternatives and are officially acceptable, affordable by the
beneficiaries and conform to the needs of the target population. Monitoring
by PCU should ensure that any major problems are flagged as soon as possible
and necessary remedial action is taken.
D. Urban Poverty Impact
7.10      The upgrading and site and services components of the project will
benefit about 20,000 people in need of shelter and related services in Maseru.
In 1985, approximately 60% of the beneficiaries in the site and services and
63% in the upgrading area would be below the urban poverty threshold. This
represents about 28% of Maseru's total urban poor. In addition, the improve-
ment in municipal services would have a broad impact on the urban poor. An
estimated 62% of total project costs would directly benefit the urban poverty
group. Thus, of the total project cost of US$7.0 million, US$4.4 million is
attributable to the urban poor. Of the US$6.0 million Credit amount some
US$3.7 million is urban poverty lending. For details see Annex 3.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The following would be conditions of effectiveness:
(a)  The appointment of a municipal engineer, a sanitary
engineer and an accountant for the PCU acceptable to
the Association (para 3.03);



- 42 -
(b) The Land Act of 1979 is in full force and effect (para 1.19);
(c) GOL's entry into a formal agreement with BFC acceptable
to the Association for the collection of all charges
from project beneficiaries (paras 6.13);
(d) GOL's entry into an agreement with LEHCO-OP, acceptable
to the Association, to ensure the latter's provision
of services necessary for efficient project implementation
(para 3.06).
8.02      The following covenants would be included in the Development Credit
Agreement:
(a) GOL, in consultation with the Association, would prepare an annual
road maintenance program for the satisfactory maintenance of
roads in Maseru and its peri-urban areas; the program for
1980/81 was agreed at negotiations (para (2.04(f));
(b) That GOL would use beneficiary selection criteria (para 3.10)
and a standard agreement acceptable to IDA for plot allocation
and payment of all charges including loan repayments. These
charges would be calculated in accordance with paras 6.08-6.16;
(c) GOL shall, not later than December 31, 1980, declare Thamaes
a "Selected Development Area" under the provisions of the
Land Act of 1979, and prepare a development and densification
scheme for this area in consultation with IDA prior to under-
taking any construction (para 3.08);
(d) PCU will prepare quarterly progress reports in accordance
with a format agreed at negotiations and, that, upon completion
of the proposed project, a Project Completion Report would be
prepared by PCU on the basis of an outline to be agreed with
IDA (para 5.08);
(e) GOL will not later than December 31, 1980 enter into an agree-
ment with LEC that LEC would upgrade off site electrical
service to the Thamaes project area and extend the service
to the Khubetsoana project area (para 2.04(d));
(f) That separate project accounts would be prepared within six
months of each fiscal year, that these would be audited by
auditors acceptable to the Association and submitted to the
Association within 12 months after the end of each fiscal
year during the project implementation period (para 6.07);
(g) GOL would make arrangements satisfactory to the Association
for vesting responsibility for the operation and maintenance
of the Project's water works in WSB by April 1, 1981, and

URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Densification
Background
1.        Under the Land Act of 1979 the Ministry of Interior (MI) has the
power to designate areas as "selected development areas" for the purposes of
development, including town planning, provision and upgrading of services,
adjustment of boundaries and densification. In a declared "selected develop-
ment area" all existing land rights of allottees are extinguished and substi-
tute land rights granted. Where MI fails to provide substitute rights it must
pay compensation. An allottee will not be bound to accept a substitute plot
whose developed value is less than the value of his/her former plot and can
claim compensation in lieu. Where he/she accepts such a plot, he/she shall
be entitled to payment of any difference in value. Where the value of the
substituted plot is higher, the allottee will pay the difference in value.
The method of assessing compensation has been stipulated in the Act as the
value: (a) "which the property might have been expected to realize if it had
been sold on the open market by a willing seller at the time of publication of
the declaration notice 1/ and (b) to the expenses incidental to any necessary
change of residence or of place of business." If the claimant is dissatisfied
with the amount of compensation offered, he/she can pursue his claim before a
tribunal.
Densification in Thamaes
2.        Under the proposed project MI will declare Thamaes, the project
area to be upgraded, as a "selected 2development area." Thamaes has about
1,300 plots averaging about 1,000 m and 2.3 households per plot. Plots,
even by African standards, are very big. Since buildable land in Maseru
is in short supply and infrastructure costs are high, GOL wishes to increase
density by subdividing existing plots. MI, through its Physical Planning
Office, with the assistance of LEHCO-OP, will prepare preliminary layouts
showing the location of urban services and possible subdivision of plots.
These layouts will be discussed with and explained to the residents through
"pitsos" (discussion fora).
3.        Residents will be informed of the cost of upgrading and the monthly
charges they will have to pay. Since monthly charges/rates will be levied
on a per square meter basis, this will act as an incentive to subdivide. All
1/   i.e. when an area is declared a selected development area.

residents with plots suitable for subdivision will be offered the option to
subdivide, resulting in a lower monthly charge. They will, however, not be
forced to subdivide. 1/ Although existing allottees will have the right to
sell all or part of their plot to any person, to avoid speculation MI will
try to acquire all new plots created by densification and allocate them
using the same criteria as used for site and services (para 3.10).
4.        Thamaes is a mixed residential area with some large properties and
many rental units. Preliminary indications are that about one-half (700)
of all plots (1,300) will not be subdivided. On these plots there may be an
increase in the number of households per plot (including rental units) as a
response to increases in monthly charges/rates. The remaining 600 plots are
likely to be divided by three giving a total of 2,500 plots. The size of the
subdivided plots (after deducting approximately 15% for 2unbuildable areas,
accessways and oth r services) will average about 300 m , although many will
be as low as 200 m . The net result will be an increase in the density of
the population and consequently larger number of low income families will get
access to services.
5.        The cost of land acquisition for the new, smaller, plots to be
created by densification would be passed on by MI to beneficiaries receiving
them, and deducted from the development costs of plots retained by subdividers.
As the cost of plot acquisition is expected to be less than that of upgrading,
there would be no outflow of Government funds for this component. The antici-
pated acquisition costs of new plots would be affordable by an estimated 75%
of Maseru's urban poor (Table VI-5).
1/   During the last 9 months, 5% subdivision has taken place.
