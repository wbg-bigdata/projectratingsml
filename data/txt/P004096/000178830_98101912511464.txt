1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Since the early 1960s, the industrial sector, and more specifi-
cally manufacturing,/1 has been the engine of growth of the Korean economy.
Over the period 1974-78, the manufacturing sector has grown at an average of
17.5% p.a. in real terms compared to an average 11% growth of aggregate GNP.
In 1979, the growth rate of the manufacturing sector slowed to 10.6%, still
higher than the 7.1% growth of real GNP. The share of manufacturing in total
GNP has increased from 25.2% in 1974 to 32.7% in 1979. In 1975, for the first
time the share of manufacturing in total real GNP exceeded that of agricul-
ture; by 1979, agriculture accounted for only 18.8% of GNP compared to 32.7%
for manufacturing. In 1979, seasonally adjusted manufacturing employment
reached 3.1 million /2 and accounted for 22.9% of the total employed
population compared to 15.9% in 1973. Over the five-year period 1975-79,
approximately 1.1 million jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector;
this represented 53.6% of total net employment creation during that period.
1.02      Export Orientation and Export Dependence.  Korea's success in
economic development is largely based on a strategy of export promotion with
emphasis on manufactured exports. Total commodity exports just exceeded US$10
billion in current prices in 1977 but reached US$15.1 billion in 1979. The
volume of Korea's exports doubled between 1975 and 1978. The growth rate of
commodity exports slowed in real terms to about 15.8% p.a. over the
period 1977-78 compared to an average of 32.7% p.a. over the period 1972-76.
In 1979, the nominal value of exports reached $15.1 billion, 18.4% higher than
in 1978; in real volume terms, however, this represented a 0.9% decline over
1978.
1.03      Manufactured products, which accounted for about 52% of total
exports in 1964, have gradually increased their share and have remained at
about 90% since 1976. Gradual changes have taken place in the structure of
manufactured exports over the past three years: light manufactured products
including textiles have declined in relative terms from 52.7% of total exports
in 1977 to 50.4% in 1979; heavy industry products have increased their share
from 32.8% in 1977 to 38.6% in 1979. However, some of Korea's traditional
light exports such as footwear and clothing have remained buoyant. The
changing composition of Korean exports reflects the significant changes which
have taken place in recent years in the structure of the manufacturing sector.
1.04      It is estimated that export expansion contributed about 35% of the
growth in manufacturing output over the period 1975-77 against 74% for
/1   In 1979, manufacturing alone accounted for 96% (in 1975 prices) of total
value added in the industrial sector (i.e. mining and manufacturing).
/2 Compared to 4.9 million in agriculture.



-2-
domestic demand./I The real growth rate of the manufacturing sector was
higher than that of exports in both 1978 and 1979, which, to some extent,
reflects the growing demand for manufactured goods in the domestic market.
Domestic demand has been expanding very rapidly in the past few years as a
result of sharply rising incomes. A major investment boom, particularly in
housing and manufacturing, started in 1977 and was an important element of the
growing domestic demand. Excessive demand in the domestic market relative to
the supply of goods increased inflationary pressures in 1978-79 and encouraged
domestic sales in preference to exports. The erosion of the competitiveness
of Korea's exports resulting from inflationary pressures coupled with a
weakness in external demand contributed to a substantial deficit in the 1979
balance of payments. In the long run, however, rising domestic demand may
prove a favorable development considering that, until 1977,the export
dependence of the manufacturing sector had been growing faster than planned.
The ratio of manufactured exports to output reached 26.9% in 1977 with
considerable variations in the dependence ratio of the various subsectors./2
Structural Changes in Manufacturing
1.05      The growth of the manufacturing sector has been accompanied by
significant adjustments in the importance of the various component subsectors
as shown in the following table:
/1 Import substitution made a negative (-9%) contribution.
/2 The export output ratio reached a level of 67% for wood and furniture and
91% for some miscellaneous products in 1977.

1.06      The composition of manufacturing shows a marked shift in favor of
heavy industry whose share of total manufacturing value added exceeded 50% for
the first time in 1978. The most significant gains have been registered by
the machinery sector. The rate of growth of chemical industries, however,
lagged behind so that the sector declined from about 30% in 1970 to 22.5% in
1978. Light industries have declined steadily since 1970. The sharpest
declines were recorded in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. Textiles
have been maintaining their 16-17% share of total manufacturing value added.
The changes in the structure of manufacturing reflect a deliberate policy to
shift production gradually from Korea's traditional light industrial
production towards more skill- and technology-intensive types of production.
Geographic Distribution
1.07      The 1975 population census showed that approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Busan; the province of
North Gyeongsang in which Taegu, the third largest industrial city is located,



accounted for another 14%.  The following table shows that the regional
distribution of manufacturing enterprises and employment is skewed in favor of
Seoul and Busan.

While Seoul and Busan remain the largest industrial centers, marginal improve-
ments have taken place between 1974 and 1977 in the redistribution of indus-
trial employment outside these areas. This may be the first sign that
government policies aimed at a better distribution of employment are having
an impact. Government policies aiming at reducing the congestion of Seoul and
Busan include severe restrictions on industrial expansion in these two cities,
a program of financial assistance for the relocation of industries, the
promotion of new industrial estates such as the Pohang, Ulsan and Yeosu
complexes and the Saemaeul Movement, initiated in 1971, for creating off-farm
employment in rural areas.
Factor Use and Efficiency
1.08      The main elements which have contributed to the rapid expansion of
the manufacturing sector are (a) a high rate of investment and (b) efficiency
in factor use, both capital and labor.
1.09      Gross Fixed Capital Formation.  Real fixed investment increased
sharply by an average of 33% p.a. over the two-year period 1977-78 and slowed
down to 9.6% in 1979. As a result, the ratio of gross fixed capital formation
to GNP rose in real terms from 25.9% in 1976 to 37.1% in 1978 and edged up
further in 1979 to 38%. Housing and manufacturing were the leading investment
sectors. Manufacturing investment increased by a phenomenal 63.4% in real
terms in 1978 and a further 17.4% in 1979. As a share of total fixed
investment, manufacturing reached 38% in 1979 compared to an average of 21.9%
over the period 1975-77. Within manufacturing, a major part of investment was
directed towards fulfilling ambitious government targets for heavy industry.
Heavy industry accounted for 78.9% of total manufacturing investment in



- 5 -
1977-79. Investment in light industry accounted for the remaining 21.1% and
lagged significantly behind the Fourth Plan targets. Investment in heavy
industrial projects with long gestation periods did not lead to an immediate
increase of productive capacity and contributed to aggravating the imbalance
between domestic demand and supply. Indications are also that investment in
heavy industries has exceeded in some instances the levels dictated by market
size, financing capacity and technical capability. Overinvestment is already
apparent in certain branches of industry. In view of these structural problems
and of the overheating of the economy to which investment in some heavy
industries contributed, the Government has taken steps to delay, scale down or
cancel several investment projects. An Investment Project Coordinating
Committee was set up in 1979 to review investment priorities and projects and
to pursue rationalization steps.
1.10      Factor Efficiency.  Efficiency in factor use has contributed to the
high performance of the Korean manufacturing sector. Calculations of incre-
mental capital to output ratios (ICORs) with a one-year lag show a gradual
decline over the three consecutive periods 1961-66, 1966-71 and 1971-75,
indicating increasing efficiency in the use of capital investment. Inclusion
of data for 1976 and 1977 raises the ICOR estimate to 1.012/1 for the period
1971-77 compared to 0.977 /1 for the period 1971-75. This may reflect the
higher capital intensity of manufacturing investment in recent years because
of the larger share of the heavy and chemical sectors. Efficiency in capital
utilization is also evidenced by the rapid growth in industrial capacity
utilization over 1971-77; over the past two years, however, excess capacity
has appeared in some branches of industry. Labor productivity measured by the
ratio of value added per employee has also been increasing in all manufactu-
ring subsectors over the period 1970-76 and was sufficient to absorb wage
increases. Over the period 1977-79, however, productivity gains have lagged
behind the rapid growth in real wages. Rising labor costs have contributed to
the decline in the competitiveness of Korean exports in 1978-79.
Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.11      The tight controls exercised by the Government on credit allocation
by financial institutions have enabled the direction of investment patterns
according to national priorities. The system of preferential credits has also
encouraged excessive credit demand and has resulted in the very high indebted-
ness of manufacturing enterprises. The average aggregate debt/equity ratio of
manufacturing enterprises which stood at 2.7:1 in 1973 following the financial
measures of 1972, has increased steadily and reached 3.7:1 in 1978. The long-
term debt/equity ratio, however, reached only 1.5:1 in 1978, reflecting an
excessively large share (58%) of short-term borrowings in total debt. The
1979-80 economic recession has induced greater reliance on short-term borrow-
ings to finance inventory build-up. The average aggregate debt/equity ratio
of manufacturing enterprises is now estimated at about 4:1. The average
interest rate paid on borrowings, short- and long-term, ranged from 12% to 13%
over the period 1976-78. Profitability measured in terms of net income to
total assets has declined marginally from 3.2% in 1976 to 2.7% in 1978 but
remained satisfactory.

-6-
Industrial Policies
1.12      The phenomenal growth of the manufacturing sector was, to a large
extent, made possible by efficient and pragmatic government policies.
Incentive packages have been developed and adjusted over time to fit evolving
priorities for industrial development. With variable emphasis, policies have
aimed at the promotion of export industries, import substitution, assistance
to small and medium enterprises, geographic dispersal of industry and in the
last few years, promotion of skill-intensive sectors with a higher
technological content. Export promotion has been the major objective since
the early sixties. Subsidies on exports have continued to increase in
absolute terms over the period 1975-78 but were insufficient to compensate for
the loss of competitiveness induced by Korea's higher prices relative to its
major trading partners. As a result, the real effective exchange rate
deteriorated sharply for Korean exporters over that period.
1.13      Export Incentive System.  Government incentives to exporting
industries include tax exemption, accelerated depreciation allowances, refund
of import duties on raw materials used for export production, deferred payment
of tariffs on equipment and access to subsidized credit. These incentives are
administered within the framework of an export targeting system whereby
exporting firms set for themselves certain export targets in agreement with
overall government objectives. A monthly conference is held to review and
adjust targets as well as government policies affecting their implementation.
1.14      While the emphasis has clearly been on export promotion, key import
substitution industries have received substantial government support in the
form of partial tax and tariff exemptions, as well as protection from
competing imports. Production for the domestic market, however, has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes, and interest charges on borrowings. In
1977-78, the Government relaxed a number of import restrictions as part of an
import liberalization program to be implemented over a four-year period.
Banned items have been abolished; since January 1, 1979, 69% of all import
items are subject to automatic approval, 31% are "restricted"./l Tariff
adjustments have also been introduced to improve the competitiveness of import
substituting industries. The simple average tariff rate has been reduced from
36% to 25%.
Recent Performance
1.15      The rapid growth of the Korean economy during 1977-78 was followed
by a recession in 1979. Real GNP growth rate slowed in 1979 to 6.4%, compared
to an average of 10.9% p.a. over the period 1977-78. Exports stagnated and a
large deficit of $4.2 billion was recorded in the current account of the
balance of payments. Over-expansion of the economy in the period 1976-78
linked with international recession and protectionism may be the root cause of
/1 In early 1978, 54% of all items were subject to automatic approval,
41% were restricted and 5% were banned.



the lackluster performance of 1979. The overheating of the economy resulted
from expanding incomes and excessive domestic demand, particularly investment
demand. In order to quell inflationary pressures, the Government implemented
in 1978-79 an import liberalization and stabilization program which included
tight monetary and fiscal policies. The resulting slowdown oL the economy was
sharper than expected because of the continued stagnation of exports and high
level of inflation. Further economic adjustments were made in January 1980:
the Won was devalued by 16.4% relative to the US dollar, interest rates were
raised by 6 percentage points and domestic energy prices increased
dramatically.
1.16      The industrial sector provided the major impetus to GNP growth over
the period 1977-79. The growth of the manufacturing sector reached an average
of 17.5% in real terms over the period 1977-78 but slowed down to 10.6% in
1979. Industry was hard hit by cost-push inflation and by the economic
recession of 1979. Seasonally adjusted industrial output in the final quarter
of 1979 was 4% below the first quarter level. Tightness in the labor market
pushed up unit labor costs by over 20% p.a. during 1977-79 and real wages by
16% p.a. Real wage increases have substantially outstripped productivity
gains in recent years and caused an erosion of Korea's comparative advantage
in the labor-intensive manufactures which still dominate its exports.
Prospects
1.17      The latest Economic Management Plan of the Government estimates GNP
growth rates of 3% and 7.5% in 1980 and 81 respectively. Over the same
period, industrial sector growth rates are expected to be 2.8% and 9.1%.
Overall investment is projected to decline by 8% in real terms in 1980.
1.18      In spite of the current difficulties, Korea's long-term growth
potential remains favorable. Continued stimulation of exports at about
12% p.a. over 1980-81 is crucial for recovery in the economy. At the same
time, some restructuring of the economy, particularly in the industrial
sector, seems desirable to improve efficiency. Korea's shift from labor-
intensive towards skill-intensive industries ought to be pursued but
investments in heavy industry need to be carefully reviewed and rationalized
to avoid overinvestment and excess productive capacity.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
2.01      The unparalleled expansion of Korean industry since the early 1960s
was made possible by an ambitious investment program coupled with pragmatic
financial sector policies. The financial system effectively supported the
growth of industry by mobilizing the necessary foreign and domestic savings
and by efficiently channeling these resources toward industrial investment.
As a result, Korea's financial sector and institutions have expanded rapidly.
From the outset, however, financial institutions and funding mechanisms have
been kept under tight government control to ensure the allocation of resources



- 8 -
to predetermined priority areas. The system has worked well in the past
decade; there is, however, some concern about its ability to respond effi-
ciently and flexibly to the requirements of an increasingly complex and
sophisticated economy.
Financing Gross Domestic Capital Formation
2.02      The rapid growth of manufacturing investment over the period 1977-
79 was made possible by an equally rapid growth of long-term loans /L extended
by Korean financial institutions to the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing
fixed investment increased by an average of 45% p.a. in current prices over
1977-79 and net term lending /2 by an average of 52% p.a. The rapid growth of
debt financing suggests that financing patterns have remained substantially
unchanged over the past three years and that Korean industries have kept a
high level of indebtedness (para. 1.11). Recent Bank surveys of the financing
of industry in Korea indicate that, on average,self-financing by Korean
enterprises accounts for only 30% of investment /3 and the remainder is
covered by borrowings. This financing pattern stems largely from the
availability of debt financing at a low cost relative to other types of
funding.
2.03      Current price fixed investment in manufacturing amounted to W 2,174
billion in 1979. Assuming that self-financing accounted for 30%, external
debt financing provided the balance, namely W 1,522 billion. External finance
was in the form of borrowings from domestic financial institutions and from
noninstitutional sources (capital markets, borrowings from abroad and
unorganized money market). In 1979, incremental term lending by Korean
financial institutions to the manufacturing sector amounted to W 1,067 billion
or 70% of the external financing estimated above. Noninstitutional sources
provided the balance of W 455 billion, of which about half was generated
through issuance of corporate debentures in the securities market and the
other half from foreign commercial loans and suppliers' credits./4
2.04      The above figures indicate that approximately 50% of manufacturing
fixed investment in 1979 was financed by Korean financial institutions, while
self-financing accounted for 30% and noninstitutional sources for the
remaining 20%. The relative importance of the various Korean financial

/4  This breakdown is highly tentative and based on the assumption that long-
term fixed investment is financed out of long-term resources; in fact,
the high short-term indebtedness of Korean industry suggests that short-
term debt is used in part to finance fixed assets and rolled over.

The Korea Development Bank (KDB) is the single largest source of term finance
for industry. Commercial banks come next, having in certain years provided
in aggregate more funding with a maturity exceeding one year than KDB.
However, term lending by the commercial banks is usually for working capital
rather than equipment financing and for shorter maturities than KDB's (four to
five years on average compared to eight years for KDB). The General Banking
Act limits the maturity of commercial bank term lending to ten years. The
Korea Exchange Bank has also become an important source of term finance for
export industries. The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC), however,
has seen its contribution gradually erode from 14% in 1974 down to 4% in 1979
(Annex A, Table 1).
2.05      While commercial banks are an important source of funding with a
maturity exceeding one year for industry, their main activity is the supply of
short- and medium-term working capital funds. In fact, term lending by
commercial banks has remained through the 1970s well below the potential
afforded by available term resources such as time and savings deposits (TSD)
and equity. Extensive rollover of short-term loans de facto increases term
lending but is somewhat less suitable for financing fixed investment.
Incremental short-term loans of commercial banks to manufacturing reached
W 2,761 billion in the period 1977-79 compared to W 530.2 billion for
long-term loans. Looking at the aggregate short- and long-term resources
flowing to industry over 1977-79, commercial banks accounted for 60%; KDB was
the next largest supplier with 14.8% (Annex A, Table 2).

Institutional Sources of Funds
2.06      The institutional set-up of the Korean financial sector can be
divided into (a) banking (or monetary) institutions which accept deposits from
the general public and (b) nonbank financial institutions. Banking institu-
tions /1 comprise conventional commercial banks, including branches of foreign
banks, and six specialized banks./2 The operations of commercial banks are
directly supervised by the Bank of Korea (BOK) while specialized banks are
under the control of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
2.07      Annex A Table 3 shows the assets structure of the Korean financial
system. Over the period 1975-79, some deepening of the financial sector has
taken place as reflected by the growing importance of nonbank institutions.
The share of nonbank financial institutions in the total gross assets of the
financial sector reached 26.2% in 1979 compared to 23% in 1975. This sign
of maturity notwithstanding, the banking system including BOK still
accounted for 73.8% of the sector's total assets in 1979; BOK and the
commercial banks together accounted for 51% of total financial sector
assets.
2.08      The Commercial Banks.  The commercial banking sector in Korea comr
prises: (a) five government controlled commercial banks with a nationwide
network of branches; (b) ten private banks with operations localized in each
province; and (c) branches of foreign commercial banks. Commercial banks
are subject to the provisions of the General Banking Act. In aggregate, the
assets of commercial banks accounted for 38.9% of the total assets of the
financial sector in 1979, up from 37.7% in 1975; the 1979 component ratio of
38.9% could be broken down into 31.5% for the five nationwide banks, 4.1%
for the ten regional banks and 3.3% for branches of foreign banks. The
commercial banking group remains by far the largest source of funds for the
manufacturing sector, but its importance has been slowly declining over time
in relative terms. The commercial banks accounted for 54.7% of the increase
in outstanding loans to the manufacturing sector in 1979 compared to 73% in
1974. Their operations, however, are heavily skewed towards short-term
lending, in part, because they lack the expertise required to carry out
the appraisal of long-term investment proposals. In 1977, short-term loans
accounted for approximately 97% of the increase in the total commercial
banks portfolio; in 1979, the ratio was still as high as 70%.
/1   Also referred to as "deposit money banks" (DMBs).
/2 The Korean Exchange Bank for foreign trade; the Small and Medium Industry
Bank for SMI; the Citizens National Bank for consumer finance and SSI;
the Korea Housing Bank for housing finance; the National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation for agricultural credits and the National Fisher-
ies Cooperative.



- 11 -
2.09      Deposits represent the major source of funds of commercial banks.
In 1978, demand and savings deposits together accounted for 54.3% of
total aggregate liabilities (including equity). This ratio was substantially
lower than the 71.1% reached in 1970. Demand deposits had marginally
increased their share of total resources to 21.4% in 1978, but time and
savings deposits had declined steadily from 52.4% in 1970 to 32.9% (Annex A,
Table 4). This sharp decline could be related to the 1972 reduction in
interest rates and the negative real deposit rates which resulted.
2.10      Specialized Banks.  The six specialized banks were created by
the Government in the 1960s to service particular economic sectors. The
specialized banks were established under separate legislation. They are not
subject to the General Banking Act and lie outside the jurisdiction of the
Central Bank-s regulations. Their operations are supervised directly by
MOF. Their aggregate assets accounted for 22.6% of the total assets of the
financial sector in 1979, down from 23.6% in 1975. The Korea Exchange Bank,
which was established in 1967 to take over the commercial foreign exchange
transactions of BOK, accounts for more than half the total assets of
specialized banks. Demand and savings deposits represent the main source of
funds of specialized banks; they accounted for 58% of total liabilities /1 and
equity at end-1979.
2.11      Nonbank Financial Institutions.  The declining share of the monetary
system, i.e., specialized banks, commercial banks, and BOK /2 in the total
assets of the financial sector reflects a certain deepening of the financial
system and the growing importance of nonbank financial intermediaries. The
average annual growth rate of the assets of nonbank financial institutions,
reached 17.2% in real terms over the period 1975-79 compared to an average of
13.7% for the financial sector as a whole. Their share of total assets
consequently increased from 23.2% in 1975 to 26.2% in 1979. Nonbank financial
intermediaries comprise: (a) four development banks /3; (b) the trust account
of the Bank of Seoul and Trust; (c) life and nonlife insurance companies; (d)
short-term finance companies (STFC); (e) mutual savings and finance companies;
(f) postal savings accounts; and (g) securities firms. Of the seven types of
nonbank intermediaries, development banks constitute the largest group,
accounting for 59% of the total assets of nonbank financial intermediaries in
1979.
/1 Excluding guarantees issued and outstanding.
/2 BOK-s share of financial sector assets declined from 15.5% in 1975 to
12.4% in 1979.
/3 The Korea Development Bank; the Korea Development Finance Corporation;
the Korea Export-Import Bank; and the Korea Land Development Corporation,
formerly the Land Bank.



- 12 -
2.12      The Bank Group is associated with the two development banks which
are active in the industrial sector: KDB and the KDFC./1 The Government-
owned KDB is the largest financial institution in Korea. As the principal
agent of government long-term funding programs, it deals primarily with large
public and private sector enterprises in power, transportation and
manufacturing. The privately owned KDFC also finances relatively large
industrial enterprises but only in the private sector.
Noninstitutional Sources of Funds
2.13      Noninstitutional sources of funds include (a) the unorganized money
market (UMM) which is primarily a source of short-term resources; (b) direct
corporate borrowings from outside Korea; and (c) the Korean capital market.
Estimates of the importance of the UKM are made difficult by the very nature
of the transactions undertaken and by the fact that a substantial part of the
lending operations of STFCs actually utilize "recycled" UMM resources. Among
foreign sources of funds, medium-term suppliers' and buyers' credits provide
substantial resources for Korean industries (Annex A, Table 5). These direct
borrowings from abroad are classified as a noninstitutional source of funds
but their availability is usually dependent upon a counterguarantee from a
local financial institution.
2.14      Other noninstitutional sources of funds comprise direct foreign
equity investments and the securities market. Direct foreign investments
are restricted by the Government to specific sectors; they amounted to US$124
million in 1979. The stock and bond markets, particularly the latter, have
developed over the past few years into important sources of finance for the
manufacturing sector. The importance of the stock market as a source of
term finance has fluctuated during the 1970s. Stock market activity expanded
rapidly through the mid-70s as a result of government incentives to induce
firms to go public. The main incentive was in the form of a 13% tax differ-
ential between closed and listed firms. This differential has been reduced
to 5% in 1978. New listings increased by 10% only in 1978 and the number of
listed companies actually declined to 355 in 1979. Trading also declined and
the stock price index plummeted from 207.2 at end-1978 to 169.1 at end-1979.
Funds raised by manufacturing enterprises on the stock market amounted to
W 141.1 billion in 1978 and W 107.3 billion in 1979.
2.15      Since 1977, the corporate bond market has been supplying more
resources /2 to the manufacturing sector than the stock market. The value of
new bond issues has been increasing at an average of 80% p.a. over 1977-79.
/1 The Bank has also made three loans to SMIB and a first loan to CNB in
1980. Both institutions are considered as deposit money banks because
they accept deposits from the general public. However, a substantial
part of their operations is, in fact, development financing.
/2 On the basis of gross offerings; no information is available on
redemptions.



- 13 -
New offerings reached W 465.2 billion in 1979. The effective yield of
corporate bonds varies from 33.5% to 36.6% p.a. for a 2-year maturity
following the January 1980 reform of the interest rate structure. The rapid
growth of the bond market is, to a large extent, due to the favorable tax
treatment granted to bond buyers.
Government Control and Direction
2.16      The development of Korea's economy over the past 20 years has been
directed by comprehensive governmental planning designed to influence private
sector decisions and to provide the means, including finance, for their imple-
mentation. Strict control over the financial system has thus been viewed by
the Government as an efficient tool for enforcing tactical decisions within
the economic development strategy. The operations of the financial sector are
characterized by close government controls on the day-to-day management of the
institutions, on their funding and on their allocative function. The Govern-
ment directly owns controlling participations in the share capital of four of
the five nationwide commercial banks and indirectly controls the fifth one.
The Government also has majority holdings in the six specialized banks and is
in full control of the Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank. The
top management of these institutions is usually appointed directly by the
highest authority on the basis of recommendations by the Minister of Finance.
Altogether, the BOK, the five commercial banks, the six specialized banks, KDB
and Exim Bank account for more than 80% of the assets of the financial system.
KDFC is the only major development institution which is wholly privately
owned.
2.17      Government controls on fund mobilization by the financial sector are
exercised in various ways: (a) the Government is the main participant in the
share capital increases of commercial and specialized banks; (b) the
Government supplements DMB and KDB resources with funds earmarked from the
budget and from special funding programs such as the National Investment Fund
(NIF);/2 (c) BOK has opened rediscounting facilities for DMBs, the main one
being short-term export credits; and (d) the Government administers interest
rates on deposits and other instruments of mobilization such as bonds and
debentures. The administrative controls extend beyond government-owned
institutions as nonbank financial institutions such as KDFC and the short-term
finance companies are expected to "follow" the interest rates set for DMBs.
Numerous controls also exist on the operations of the securities market.

redemptions.
/2 Annex C provides a detailed description of the NIF program; para. 2.22
gives a summarized analysis.

2.18      Directed Credit.  Government controls are pervasive in the area of
fund allocation. The administrative guidelines on Uses of Funds in the
Financial Sector" issued by the Monetary Board in 1958 have increasingly been
replaced by specific directives to DMBs and KDB regarding not only the alloca-
tion of government funds but also the allocation of their own resources to
specific priority sectors, subsectors and sometimes individual projects or
firms. The system of directed lending which is administered by BOK and MOF
provides financing at government behest to recognized prime borrowers and,
therefore, severely limits the discretion exercised by financial institutions
in fund allocation. The proportion of Government-directed lending has been
estimated at about 40% of total DMB lending./l
2.19       Subsidized Credit.  An important feature of directed credits is the
low interest rate charged on most of the loans, a notable exception being the
small industry loans of commercial banks. At least half of the directed loans
of DMBs are at concessional rates (i.e., below the normal rate for nonpriority
borrowers)./2 Export credits and the NIF program are the main components of
subsidized lending by the DMBs and KDB. A rising share of DMB subsidized
lending (from 40% in 1971 to 56% in 1978) is for short-term export financing.
NIF lending had also increased from 9% of DMB subsidized lending in 1975 to
20% in 1977 (Annex A, Table 6). NIF loans accounted for 38% of KDB's loan
portfolio at end-1979 up from 29% at end-1977.
2.20      Export financing is given the highest priority by the Government
because export growth is crucial to the Korean economy. The availability of
concessional loans for exports is viewed as equalizing the position of Korean
exporters with international competitors. These loans are channelled through
the commercial banks and can be rediscounted with BOK for 80% of their value.
Handling banks receive an interest spread of 5 percentage points. The final
lending rate of 9% p.a. was raised to 12% in January 1980 and will increase
to 15% p.a. by end-1980. By comparison, the prime lending rate for short-
term loans was raised to 24.5% p.a. in January 1980.
2.21      Operation of the NIF started in 1974 (Annex C).  Total NIF loans
outstanding reached W 1,228 billion ($2.5 billion) at end-1979. Contributions
by banking institutions out of their deposit resources supply approximately
75% of total NIF funding. NIF loans are available primarily for financing
equipment purchases with a maximum maturity of 8 years. The NIF program
aims at supporting the restructuring of the industrial sector and therefore
places emphasis on assistance to heavy and chemical industries. The
commercial banks, the specialized banks and KDB allocate NIF loans; at
end-1979 they accounted respectively for 18.2%, 15.9% and 65.9% of outstanding
NIF loans. Final lending rates were raised in January 1980 to 21-22% compared
to a nonconcessional rate for term loans of 24.5-25.5%. Handling banks

operate with a positive spread of 0.5% to 1.5%; the interest rate subsidy is
absorbed by the Government.
Efficacy of the Control System
2.22       The efficacy of government controls over the financial system must
be judged in terms of (a) impact on financial intermediation; (b) efficiency
of resource allocation by institutions; and (c) internal efficiency of
intermediaries. These three elements are obviously interrelated.
2.23       Financial intermediation is dependent upon the mobilization of
sufficient savings. The ratio of aggregate savings to GNP exceeded 25%
through most of the period 1970-79, reaching 35% in 1979. Korea's savings
performance has been high by most international standards. The ratio of time
and savings deposits to GNP, however, dropped from 23.3% in 1973 to 21.3% in
1974-79. Equity resources and term deposits are the main source of term
funding for the commercial and specialized banks. The slow growth of TSD,
therefore, affected the capability of these institutions to function as
efficient financial intermediaries. TSD interest rates are determined by the
Government and have, in real terms, been close to zero or negative since 1972.
Low interest rates on financial instruments have caused some financial
disintermediation in the household sector whereby household savings have been
diverted from deposits into real estate acquisition. The January 1980 upward
adjustment of interest rates partly remedied this situation and was followed
by a sharp increase in aggregate TSD. Another element of government control
on financial intermediation has been the push toward lengthening the
maturities of loans by Deposit-Money Banks to expand capital formation.  As a
result, term lending by commercial banks has increased in absolute and
relative terms through the 1970s but has apparently failed to reach the
potential afforded by available term resources.
2.24       The allocational efficiency of the system of directed lending has
been satisfactory in terms of aggregate flow of funds toward the priority
areas of export and heavy industry. It appears, however, that the magnitude
of interest subsidies has resulted in excess demand for debt financing and may
have led to some misallocation of funds within the too broadly defined
priority areas. Favored access to financing for ill-defined priority
borrowers may have led to suboptimal investment decisions with respect to
product choice, scale of production and capital intensity. Excessive credit
expansion has also fueled inflation and has encouraged a high level of
indebtedness in the corporate sector. The high indebtedness of Korean
industry appears to be worrisome owing particularly to the high proportion of
short term debt resulting from easy access to cheap export credits.
2.25       The combination of excess loan demand and government-directed
lending has had a detrimental impact on the internal efficiency of intermedi-
aries. The ability of banks to undertake adequate appraisals and to exercise
proper business judgment has been restricted. Competition among financial
institutions has been severely limited. As a consequence, the transaction



- 16 -
costs of commercial banks are high and bad loans are reportedly kept at an
artificially low level through reschedulings, refinancing of arrears and
rollover of debt.
2.26      Critics of the operations of the Korean financial sector recognize
that the system has, in the past, contributed to the phenomenal growth and
transformation of the industrial sector in accordance with national
priorities. On the other hand, the system was responsible for excessive
credit expansion and inflation. Directed lending also has encouraged high
debt/equity ratios in the corporate sector and has contributed to excessive
investment in some branches of heavy industry. Doubt has been expressed by
the Korean authorities themselves about the desirability of maintaining the
rigid system of centrally directed lending because of the growing complexity
of the economy. The need for fine tuning of investment decisions cannot be
flexibly accommodated under the present system. It is recognized that
directed and concessional lending should not be discontinued but should be
reduced in scope and size to clearly defined priority sectors and branches of
industry. At the same time, some liberalization of the operations of the
financial sector, particularly of commercial banks, seems desirable and
timely.
Reform of Financial System
2.27      Bank surveys of the Korean financial system have led to a number of
specific recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of the financial
sector. The main recommendations are summarized below:
(a) interest rates on time/savings deposits and lending rates
should be maintained at a positive level in real terms to
encourage a reliable flow of term resources into the DMBs;
(b) the proportion of directed lending made for specified purposes and
borrowers at government behest should be reduced relative to total
lending;
(c) the share of directed lending which commands concessional interest
rates, primarily export credits and NIF, should be reduced in scope
and volume and the extent of the interest subsidy ought to be reas-
sessed;
(d) as directed concessional lending is reduced, institutional
arrangements for delivery of funds, particularly NIF, ought to be
rationalized. Concentration of NIF lending in the specialized banks
and KDB is recommended since these institutions have the necessary
expertise in term lending. Commercial banks would be freed to meet
other credit needs including export financing;
(e) more operational discretion in management and operational decisions
should be given to the commercial banks to increase efficiency and
competition;



- 17 -
(f) harmonization of foreign currency lending rates and interest
spreads ought to be improved;
(g) monetary and credit control instruments available to the BOK
ought to be broadened and made more flexible; and
(h) the bill market, securities market and housing finance ought to be
further developed and encouraged through a comprehensive set of
incentives.
2.28      The Government is aware of the shortcomings and inefficiencies of
the Korean financial system. A policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on these matters has been initiated and will be pursued.  Interest
rates have already been raised in January 1980 with the intention of
maintaining real rates at a positive level. A move towards liberalization of
the sector has also been announced which, over time, would provide greater
autonomy to financial institutions. As a first step in this direction, the
Long-Term Credit Bank Law was enacted in November 1979. The purpose of this
legislation is to encourage the establishment of a new type of financial
intermediaries operating outside the Government's system of directed lending.
Long-term credit banks would be privately-owned institutions raising a major
part of their resources from the domestic capital market and focusing on
long-term lending for industry. In June 1980, KDFC changed its legal status
and became Korea's first long-term credit bank.
Lending Rates and Inflation
2.29      The continuing high rate of inflation has been a serious problem in
Korea for the past two decades. High inflation has led to a worsening of
Korea's terms of trade and to a loss of real income in relation to real
production. Despite recessionary tendencies in 1979, wholesale and consumer
prices rose by over 18% during the year compared to 12-14% during 1978.
Following the January devaluation of the Won and the dramatic increase in
domestic energy prices, inflation worsened in early 1980. In the first
quarter of the year, the consumer price index increased by 12.1% and the
wholesale price index by 22.2%. Annual increases in the consumer price index
have been projected at 25.4% and 14.8%, respectively, for 1980 and 1981;
actual increases may be higher.
2.30      Domestic Currency Lending Rates.  The January 1980 upward revision
of the interest rate structure (Annex A, Table 8) brought nonconcessional
lending rates for prime borrowers to 24.5% p.a. for working capital and 26.5%
for equipment loans with maturities exceeding eight years./l While the
adjustment of domestic currency interest rates to a positive level in real
terms is a step in the right direction, additional adjustments seem justified
with respect to foreign currency lending rates.
/1 Working capital loans to nonprime borrowers carry a 25% lending rate and
equipment loans a rate of 25.5% for 3-8 years and 24.5% under 3 years.



- 18 -
2.31      Foreign Commercial Borrowings.  Until June 1980, the lending rate
for foreign currency loans funded with Eurodollar commercial borrowings was
fixed by MOF at LIBOR + 1% to LIBOR + 1.25% depending on maturity. KDFC was
authorized to charge a slightly higher rate of LIBOR + 2%. With six-month
Eurodollar rates currently at about ' % p.a. (down from 20% in April 19RO) a
spread of 1.25% over LIBOR was equivalent to a 15.25% p.a. charge on a
dollar-denominated loan. Over the ten-year period 1971-80, the average annual
depreciation of the Won vis-a-vis the IJS dollar was about 6% p.a. In Won
terms, a Eurodollar borrowing therefore carried an interest rate of about
21.25% p.a. for the final borrower, compared to the normal rate of 26.5% p.a.
on Won borrowings. Admittedly, the same computation in April showed a cost of
about 27.25% p.a.; it seems, however, that on average, over a period of
several years, access to foreign commercial funds did provide an element of
subsidy to the borrower. Given this context, there was little rationale for
keeping the interest spread accruing to the financial intermediaries at about
0.5% /1 which was much lower than the 2% spread allowed on foreign borrowings
from official sources and was insufficient to cover handling costs. The lower
interest spread on foreign commercial borrowings effectively represented a
disincentive to more mobilization of resources. In June 1980, an interest
spread of about 2% was authorized by the Government as a means of reducing the
subsidy to the final borrower and lessening the reliance of financial
intermediaries on official sources of funds.
2.32      Foreign Official Borrowings.  The effective cost to subborrowers of
foreign resources raised from official agencies such as IBRD and ADB is more
difficult to estimate in W4on terms because of the variable currency mix of
disbursements. KDFC has carried out a detailed analysis of the cost of funds
under three of the loans it received from the Bank. UJnder Loan 1145-KO
the nominal borrowing rate from the Bank was 8.5%. In accordance with the
standard practice imposed by the MOF, funds were onlent with an interest
spread of 2% and the foreign exchange risk passed on to the subborrowers. The
nominal onlending rate therefore stood at 10.5% p.a. Disbursements of "hard"
currencies (Yen, Deutsche Mark and Swiss Francs) which appreciated against the
US dollar reached 61% of total disbursements. As a consequence, the effective
rate, in dollar terms, for the subborrowers reached 19.5% p.a./l The average
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Won reached about 7% p.a. over the
loan disbursement period, thus bringing the effective lending rate in Won
terms to 26.5% p.a./2   By comparison, KDFC-s standard lending rate for
domestic currency equipment loans stood at 20.5% p.a. until January 1980 and
has since been raised to 26% p.a. Other official loans to KDFC and other
financial intermediaries in Korea, including KDB, had a similar effective cost
and therefore do not appear to impart any sizeable interest subsidy to the
recipients by comparison with Won-denominated loans and with foreign
commercial loans.
/1 Assuming a borrowing cost for the intermediary of LIBOR + 0.75% and an
onlending rate of LIBOR + 1.25%. KDFC has been allowed a margin of 1.25%.



- 19 -
2.33      Onlending practices for foreign official borrowings, however, do
create some distortions in final lending rates due to the government policy of
requiring that these loans be onlent with a uniform spread of 2%. With sub-
stantially different lending costs over time and between lending agencies,
subborowers from the same institution, at the same time, ostensibly similar in
essential characteristics, obtain funds on different terms. It was agreed at
negotiations that each financial institution would be allowed to commingle its
official foreign resources and that a spread of 2% be applied to the weighted
average cost of these funds./3 This results in a uniform onlending rate
subject to adjustment as new lines of credit are mobilized from official
sources.
Bank Lending Strategy
2.34      Bank lending to Korean industries is effected primarily through
specialized long-term financial intermediaries. This type of lending was
initiated 12 years ago with a first loan to the Korea Development Finance
Corporation (KDFC). The Bank has now established a solid relationship with
four Korean Development Finance Companies (DFCs) which, in aggregate, supplied
over 50% of the increase in medium and long-term loans extended to the
manufacturing sector in 1977-78. The Bank has helped meet the financial needs
of medium and large-scale firms primarily through KDB and KDFC./4 The finan-
cial support of smaller-scale enterprises by the Bank was initiated in 1975
through a first loan to the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) and to the
Citizens National Bank (CNB) in 1980.
2.35      The Strategic Role of KDB and KDFC.  The long association of the
Bank with KDB and KDFC has had a very positive impact in terms of (a)
overall resource transfer to the vitally important industrial sector; (b)
the building up of large and efficient development finance institutions; and
(c) developmental impetus in the financial and industrial sectors.
2.36      KDB and KDFC through the complementary, though distinct nature of
their operations occupy a central position in the financial sector and serve
as the two major conduits of resource flows to the priority manufacturing
sector. Over the period 1974-79, KDB and KDFC jointly supplied 37.5% of all
term loans to the manufacturing sector. Bank financial support of KDB and
KDFC's operations was instrumental in enabling the two institutions to assume
an increasing role in the transfer of resources to the industrial sector.
/1  On average over the period 1976-80.
/2  Similar calculations for earlier loans show an effective lending rate in
Won terms of 18.5% for Loan 705-KO and 17.4% for 905-Ko.
/3  Weighted by the amount of funds available for future lending.
/4  Seven Bank loans aggregating $320 million have been made to KDFC and
three loans for a total of $252.5 million to KDB.



- 20 -
2.37      The financial and technical support supplied to KDB and KTFC through
the Bank's lending operations in the past few years has also had a substan-
tial impact on their efficiency and quality as financial intermediaries.
KDB and KDFC have gradually developed into the most efficient intermediaries
on the Korean financial scene, and both now rank among the best DFCs with
which the Bank is associated worldwide. This is reflected not only in the
appropriateness of their operational procedures but also in the quality of
their portfolio and in their success at mobilizing foreign currency resources
from commercial sources.
2.38      Finally the Bank's support of KDB and KDFC has had an impact which
extends beyond the two institutions to the industrial and financial sectors.
The developmental role increasingly assumed by the two intermediaries has led
to a more balanced sectoral and geograpic distribution of industries in Korea
and has helped to deepen the structure of the financial sector. Both KDB and
KDFC have sponsored the establishment of several specialized financial
institutions including leasing companies, investment banks, merchant banks and
short-term finance companies as a means of increasing the range of financial
services available in Korea.
2.39      Satisfactory as this performance and impact on the overall economy
might be, an analysis of the operations and efficiency of both KDB and KDFC
shows a number of shortcomings stemming, in part, from the financial
environment in which they operate. The Bank now proposes to use its lending
operations to KDB and KDFC as a vehicle for addressing with the Korean
Government the general financial sector issues which affect the efficiency of
individual institutions.
2.40      The recent Economic Report prepared by the Bank /1 indicates that
inefficiencies have surfaced in the structure and operations of the
industrial sector in Korea and may have contributed to the lackluster
performance of the Korean economy in 1979. Furthermore, the Economic
Report also recommends that the Government consider undertaking a
comprehensive reform of the financial system. Such a reform would play an
important complementary role in improving the performance of the industrial
sector. The Government has informed the Bank in a series of discussions over
the past few months that it is in general agreement with these policy
recommendations and is committed to undertaking a major reform of the
financial system.
2.41      The inefficiencies identified in the Bank-s review of the indus-
trial and financial sectors transcend individual financial institutions.
While past DFC lending has been efficient and has helped reach lending
objectives, the changed circumstances facing the economy and the expanding
demands placed on financial intermediaries suggest that the Bank's
involvement in financial issues needs to be broadened from the narrow
/1 "Current Developments and Policy Issues," dated May 20, 1980.



- 21 -
project focus of the past. The Bank has acquired detailed knowledge of the
workings of the financial system and is in the process of developing, in
collaboration with the Korean authorities, the blueprint of a scheme designed
to make the system more responsive to the needs of a rapidly maturing
industrial sector which operates in an increasingly competitive international
environment.
2.42      Bank lending for industry should now be tailored to accommodate
these broader sectoral objectives. While the format of industrial lending
will retain the past DFC lending approach, these operations will be used as a
springboard for reaching other important objectives beyond resource transfer
and institution-building objectives. Taking advantage of the simultaneous
need to replenish the long-term foreign exchange resources of KDB and KDFC,
the Bank invited the Government to negotiate both loans at the same time as a
vehicle for discussing further the financial sector policy recommendations. A
common understanding was reached at negotiations regarding Korea's longer-term
strategy for improving efficiency in the financial sector. As a first step, a
package of specific policy measures and supplementary studies to be implemen-
ted by the Government and KDB over an appropriate time frame was agreed upon
which would provide a linkage between financial sector issues and the proposed
KDB and KDFC operations. The proposed projects would support the first stage
of a comprehensive reform of the financial sector. At negotiations, agreement
was reached with the Government on a "Statement of Korea's Financial Sector
Policy Improvements" expressing the broad objectives of the financial sector
reform and outlining a number of policy measures to be implemented in an
agreed time frame. Other financial sector issues, requiring further study
will be discussed with the Korean Government in the context of forthcoming
Structural Adjustment Loans and future financial sector loans.

3. THE KOREA DEVELPMENT BANK
KDB's Role in the Industrial and Financial Sectors
3.01      KDB was established in 1954 as a wholly government-owned institution
to implement, on behalf of the Government, post-war rehabilitation of industry
and to finance economic development. Since then, KDB has been used by the
Government as one of its primary agencies for the execution of the Five-Year
Plan's industrial policies. At present, all major government-directed
programs for industrial financing are, at least in part, being channelled
through KDB with the exception of the short-term export credit program. In
addition to supporting industry, KDB is called upon to finance major projects
in the transportation and power sectors./l Only large-scale /2 enterprises
are eligible for financial assistance from KDB./3 KDB's financing, however, is
not confined to public sector projects; loans to the private sector have
increased as a share of KDB's loan portfolio from 38% at end-1975 to 52% by
end-1979. However, a major proportion of KDB's lending to the private
sector is absorbed by large industrial conglomerates involved in priority
activities with the full backing of the Government. At end-1979, KDB's
portfolio comprised 561 clients; the 50 largest accounted for 86% of KDB's
total portfolio.
3.02      KDB is the single largest financial institution in Korea and the
largest source of term financing for industry. At end-1979, its total
assets 14 reached W 6,624 billion and accounted for 14.2% of the total
assets of the financial sector. As of December 31, 1979, KDB's loan portfolio
amounted to W 2,138 billion with the manufacturing accounting for 49.8%. KDB
alone contributed about 18% of the increase in total outstanding loans (both
short and long term) to the manufacturing sector in 1979 compared to 55% for
/1 At end-1979, the non-manufacturing sector accounted for 50.2% of KDB's
outstanding portfolio and the crucially important power sector for about
25%.
/2 i.e. enterprises employing more than 300 persons and with total assets
exceeding W 500 million.
13 Smaller enterprises (employing less than 300 persons or with assets
lower than W 500 million) receive financial assistance from the Small and
Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) or from the Citizens National Bank (CNB)
when employment is under 100 persons. Both institutions are
government-owned.
/4 Including guarantees outstanding for W 3,722 billion.



- 23 -
the group of 15 commercial banks. KDB's lending is geared primarily towards
long term financing of equipment purchases; working capital loans accounted
for only 17.5 % of KDB's aggregate commitments over 1976-79. Over the same
period, KDB contributed 31.7% of the increment in outstanding term loans to
the manufacturing sector compared to 27.4% for commercial banks. In 1979,
KDB's loan commitments totalled W 955.7 billion ($1.97 billion) of which 21%
was in foreign currency. Loan guarantees extended during the same year
reached W 1,142 billion with 94% in foreign exchange. KDB is less active in
equity investment and subscription to debentures;/l its outstanding invest-
ment portfolio, however, amounted to W 332 billion as of December 31, 1979.
Institutional Aspects
3.03      A detailed analysis of KDBs legal set-up, organization, operations
and financial performance is provided in Annex B. This description shows that
KDB has gradually built up its institutional capability to a very satisfactory
level and that its financial structure and performance are sound. The salient
institutional features of KDB are summarized below.
3.04      Scope of Operations.  KDB is authorized to provide its clients with
a comprehensive range of financial services including (a) domestic and foreign
currency lending for equipment purchases; (b) working capital finance;
(c) equity participation; (d) purchase of debentures; (e) issuance of loan
guarantees; and (f) foreign exchange transactions. However, KDB's
activities are focused primarily on equipment financing and issuance of
guarantees. In these two areas, KDB has become the most active financial
institution in Korea.
3.05      Branch Network.  KDB's geographic reach outside the Seoul area is
ensured through its ten branch offices. KDB has a branch office in the
major cities of each of the eight mainland provinces and two other branches
in the industrial areas of Ulsan and Changwon. About 15% of KDB's total
professional staff of 584 was assigned to the branch offices at end-1979.
Including nonprofessional staff, KDB employed a total of 1,960 persons at
end-1979.
3.06      Appraisal and Supervision.  The institution building impact of Bank
lending to KDB over the past five years can best be gauged by the quality of
KDB's project appraisal and supervision work as well as the soundness of its
procurement and disbursement procedures. KDB's appraisal standards and
procedures are quite satisfactory for projects funded from its own resources
or from foreign official sources of funds including IBRD. The appraisal of
projects funded with government resources tends to be less refined. Increas-
ing emphasis has been placed by KDB in recent years on economic analysis and
particularly on the employment impact of the projects it finances. Economic
Rates of Return (ERR) are now calculated by KDB for projects funded from
/1 In 1979, total investments reached W 58.7 billion; equity participations
accounted for 46%.



- 24 -
official borrowings and requiring financing of more than $750,000 and for all
other projects whose cost exceeds W 2 billion. KDB is well equipped to carry
out extensive economic and industrial sector research having a Research
Department comprising close to 70 professionals. KDB-s project supervision
work is thorough and effective as reflected in the good quality of its
portfolio.
3.07      KDB's procurement and disbursement practices are sound.  ADB and the
Bank have helped KDB strengthen its procedures. Procurement methods comprise
international competitive bidding, limited competitive bidding and proprietary
contracts when justified./l Procedures are generally designed to ensure a
reasonable degree of competition and the appropriate use of funds.  Further
details regarding KDB's procurement procedures may be found in Annex B,
para. 2.09.
Financial Sector Development
3.08      The preceding paragraphs provide an analysis of KDB-s role in the
industrial and financial sectors through its resource transfer function and
provide an insight into its institutional strengths and quality. A third
measure of KDB-s importance as a development institution is the impact it has
achieved in developing and deepening the structure of the Korean financial
system by sponsoring the establishment of several specialized financial
institutions.
3.09      A leasing company, wholly owned by KDB was established in 1973 to
lease industrial machinery to firms, particularly small-sized, which cannot
afford outright purchases for lack of collateral. In 1977, KDB participated
jointly with foreign financial institutions in the share capital of a new
Korean merchant bank.  A second merchant bank was established in 1979 with
minority holdings by KDB. Finally, KDB has established two subsidiary
investment banks outside Korea, one in New York (1977) and the other in Hong
Kong (1979). The impetus thus given by the KDB to the diversification of
the Korean financial system through the establishment of specialized nonbank
financial institutions has widened the range of financial services available
in Korea. The increased overseas representation of Korean financial institu-
tions should also facilitate the resource mobilization efforts of Korean
financial and industrial enterprises in foreign capital markets.
Resource Allocation
3.10      The following paragraphs aim at evaluating KDB's efficiency as a
financial intermediary in terms of (a) its performance as an allocator of
funds to productive projects in Korea, and (b) its ability to mobilize
/1 ICB was applied for 56% of all procurement contracts under the third
Bank loan (1570-KO) in 1979; limited competitive bidding accounted for
17% of all procurement contracts and proprietary contracts for 27%.



- 25 -
resources, domestic and foreign, commensurate with the requiements of industry
in Korea.
3.11      As indicated in para 3.01, KDB functions as the bulwark of the
Government's system of directed and subsidized credits./1 KDB's allocation
of funds, by virtue of its 100% government ownership, is largely subject to
government direction not only with respect to sectoral lending targets but
also with respect to allocation by term, by currency and, at times, by
individual firms.  Resources raised by TMDB from foreign official sources of
funds (IBRD, ADB, et al) are also allocated to priority sectors but KDB
enjoys adequate autonomy in its allocational decisions at the project level.
3.12      KDB's performance in directing resources to government-defined
priority areas is impressive: about 50% of its outstanding loan portfolio
at end-1979 was in manufacturing; power and transportation accounted respec-
tively for 25% and 17%. Lending patterns within manufacturing follow
government priorities closely: heavy and chemical industries accounted for
77% of KDB's outstanding loans to manufacturing in 1979.
3.13      Loan guarantee operations are also subject to government directions;
as of December 31, 1979 about 76% of KDB's outstanding guarantee portfolio was
with government-owned entities or companies designated by the Government./2
3.14      Directed Lending.  KDB administers three types of directed lending
which jointly represent approximately 75% of its loan portfolio.  The degree
of government directives imposed on KDB's fund allocation varies in each
case. The source of funding also varies in each case although some projects
can be financed with a mix of the three types of resources. First, KDB is
used by the Government as a channel of budgetary allocations to specific
public sector entities in industry and infrastructure. Typical examples are
the Korea Electric Co. (KECO) and the Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO)
which, taken together, accounted for as much as 39% of KDB's total loan and
guarantee portfolio at end-1979. Funding of these operations is about half
from budgetary appropriations and half from National Investment Fund (NIF)/3
resources. In the administration of budgetary resources, TODB acts merely as
a conduit of funds; individual allocations by firm are predetermined by the
Government and therefore not subject to independent review by KDB.
/1 For an analysis of the system of directed and subsidized credits see
paras. 2.19 through 2.22 above.
/2 Guarantees issued by KDB to government-owned and designated enterprises
are covered by a blanket counterguarantee (GRA) of the Government.
/3 The NIF is analyzed in detail in Annex C and a summary description is
given in the following paragraph.



- 26 -
3.15      The second type of directed/subsidized lending administered by KDB
(and the DMBs) consists of several special government funding programs for
financing industry. The NIF is the largest of these special funds /1 (para.
2.22).  The NIF is managed by BOK and MOF.  BOK is primarily responsible for
funding the program while MOF directs allocational decisions. Specifically,
MOF determines allocations at the broad sectoral level among power, heavy and
chemical industry, food and small-scale industries. Allocation at the firm
level is decided by the NIF Council which comprises representatives of EPB,
MCI, BOK and KDB. About 82% of the 1980 NIF allocations were for preselected
firms. The discretionary powers of handling banks in allocational decisions
could be exercised fully on the 18% balance. In general, for NIF and other
special funding programs, KDB-s input in project formulation and appraisal
comes late in the decision-making process, at times too late to have a
meaningful impact on investment decisions. The somewhat negative implications
of this situation should, however, be tempered in the light of the thorough
scrutiny to which government agencies such as EPB /2 subject investment
proposals for large-scale priority projects. The need for a rationalization
of the operations of the NIF program was discussed at negotiations. It was
agreed that KDB and the Government would jointly undertake a study to evaluate
the NIF program. Further details relating to this agreement may be found in
paras. 4.08-4.09.
3.16      A third type of directives is imposed by the Government on KDB's
allocation of funds from resources raised independently from the Government-s
budgetary and special fund appropriations. These resources consist of
deposits, proceeds of KDB bonds and foreign currency borrowings. KDB is
expected to allocate these resources in accordance with government priorities
defined in the 1953 KDB Act and its Enforcement Decree, i.e., power, coal
mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel, semiconductors, marine and air
transportation. Project-by-project allocation is determined by KDB within
global sectoral lending targets fixed annually in KDB-s Operational Program
with the agreement of MOF. In practice, only foreign loans funded from
official borrowings are immune from strict government directives but the
priority manufacturing sector does absorb a large proportion of the funds.
Government-directed lending accounts for about 60% of the resources raised
independently by KDB./3
/1 The NIF was established in 1973 in replacement of the Industrial Ration-
alization Fund (IRF) initiated in 1972; other programs include the
Special Long-term Fund of 1972 and the Tourism Development Fund (TDF)
which is onlent by KDB to the commercial banks.
/2 EPBRs Project Evaluation Bureau employs 40 persons specialized by sector.
/3 Excluding foreign official funds; loans funded with resources raised
independently by KDB accounted for approximately 37% of the end-1979
loan portfolio.



- 27 -
3.17      The following table shows a breakdown of KDB's outstanding loan
portfolio in 1977-79 by source of funds. Government-funded loans /1 accounted
for approximately 55% of KDB-s loan portfolio during that period. The supple-
mentary directives imposed by the Government on the allocation of resources
raised independently by KDB brought aggregate directed policy loans to about
75% of KDB's end-1979 loan portfolio.

3.18      Quality of Portfolio.   Despite government controls and intervention
in lending decisions, KDB has retained enough autonomy in its allocative
decisions to select creditworthy borrowers and maintain a satisfactory quality
of portfolio. At end-1979, 89.8% of KDB's total loan portfolio was
outstanding with companies operating profitably;/2 companies in difficulty and
operating at a loss accounted for 8.7% and companies in liquidation for 1.5%.
At the same date, the principal of loans affected by arrears over three months
amounted to W 149 billion or 7% of the total outstanding loan portfolio. In
1979, KDB rescheduled a number of overdue loans with an aggregate outstanding
balance of W 160 billion or 7.5% of the end-of-year portfolio. In total,
14.5% of KDB's total portfolio was either rescheduled or in arrears in 1979.
Comparative figures for 1978 were 2.9% for principal affected by arrears over
three months and 3.3% affected by reschedulings, or a total portfolio affected
of 6.2%.
/1 i.e., with Government special funds and budgetary resources.
/2 In 1978 the ratio was 93%.



- 28 -
3.19      While the year 1979 was marked by a deterioration of the financial
health of some of its borrowers, KDB's loan portfolio remained very sound.
Actual arrears of interest and principal (in excess of 3 months) remained at a
very low level of 0.5% of total portfolio at end-1979./1 The higher level of
principal affected (7%) reflected the high exposure of KDB in the companies it
finances either because individual loan size is large or because several loans
are outstanding with a single borrower. The still satisfactory quality of
KDB's portfolio indicates that KDB does operate as an efficient allocator of
funds. The deterioration in the financial performance of some KDB borrowers
does not appear to be linked to the system of government-directed/subsidized
lending but is rather a reflection of the sluggish economic performance of
industry in 1979.
3.20      The system of directed/subsidized lending, however, does have a
negative impact on KDB's exposure in individual firms. Although it is KDB's
stated policy not to provide financial assistance in excess of 65% of the
total assets of a borrower, at end-1979, the limit had been exceeded for 15
large government-owned or government-supported firms. As much as 57% of KDB's
aggregate loan, investment and guarantee portfolio was outstanding with these
15 firms. A system of guarantees and counter-guarantees granted to KDB by the
Government /2 effectively protects KDB from the financial risks caused by such
overexposure. Despite this protection given to KDB, government pressures to
increase financial assistance to some borrowers are clearly conducive to high
debt/equity ratios in industry and help maintain an unsound financial struc-
ture. In order to improve the financial structure of its subborrwers and its
own exposure in individual firms, an understanding was reached during negotia-
tions that only enterprises whose total debt/equity ratio (including the
proposed subloan) was not greater than 5:1 would be eligible for financing
under the proposed Bank loan.
3.21      As indicated above, subsidized lending, because of the artificially
cheap cost of credit, may also be conducive to excessive loan demand, inade-
quate pricing of capital and suboptimal choices of technologies. At end-1979,
91% of KDB's outstanding domestic currency loans carried subsidized lending
rates. KDB being the main agent of the system of directed/subsidized lending
has not always been granted by the Government enough autonomy in its alloca-
tional decisions to mitigate through careful appraisal work the negative
effects of inadequate pricing of capital for priority industries.
Resource Mobilization
3.22      The ability of a financial institution to mobilize adequate amounts
of resources is another indicator of its efficiency as a financial interme-
diary. KDB's performance at mobilizing financial resources through direct
borrowings and indirectly through issuance of loan guarantees, has been

very impressive, particularly in the past four years. The increase in KDB's
outstanding borrowings and guarantees over 1976-79 amounted to W 3,945
billion or approximately 50.4% of the cumulative current price fixed
investment in manufacturing and power.   Out of the aggregate W 3,945
billion, net increase in borrowings accounted for 43% and guarantees for
57%.
3.23      KDB's outstanding liabilities have grown at an average of 48% p.a.
over 1977-79 and reached the equivalent of $4.64 billion by end-1979. The
following table shows the composition of KDB's borrowings and loan portfolio
over the period 1975-79.

3.24      The share of domestic currency resources in KDB's total borrowings
has declined from 75.1% in 1975 to 64.3% in 1979. Foreign currency commer-
cial borrowings have grown very rapidly in absolute and relative terms; this
rapid growth accounts for the increasing share of foreign currency re-
sources in KDB's total resources. The above tables also show that the demand
for domestic currency funding, as reflected in the size of the domestic
currenty loan portfolio, substantially exceeded the level of domestic
resources available to KDB through its own mobilization efforts and through
government appropriations. In order to suplement its otherwise insufficient
domestic currency resources, KDB has been mobilizing foreign currency
resources substantially exceeding its foreign currency lending and has
converted part of the commercial borrowings into Won resources to finance
the higher demand for domestic currency funds. Foreign currency borrowings
from official sources have not been converted into domestic currency
resources. Their long maturity relative to foreign commercial funds makes
foreign official borrowings particularly attractive to an institution like
KDB whose function is to finance a number of large priority projects having
a long gestation period. Because of the floating interest rate attached to
foreign commercial borrowings and the foreign exchange risks associated with
conversions into Won, KDB onlends these funds at an interest rate which is
revised quarterly and takes account of past foreign exchange fluctuations./l
/1 For the second quarter of 1980, the lending rate was fixed at 13.6% for
priority industries and 17.1% for nonpriority projects.



- 31 -
The magnitude of conversions into domestic currency is reflected in the
15.1% share of foreign loans outstanding in KDB's total portfolio compared
to the 36% share of foreign borrowings in total borrowings.
3.25      Domestic Currency Resource Mobilization.  Budgetary appropriations
and special government funds provide the bulk of KDB's domestic currency
resources. Their combined share of KDB-s total domestic resources has
increased from 77.1% in 1975 to 82.5% in 1979 because of the slower growth of
other sources of domestic resources, i.e., deposits and domestic currency
debentures. Budgetary funding and special fund resources are allocated to
KDB by the Government when finalizing the annual Operational Program. KDB's
independent mobilization efforts consist of deposit taking and issuance of
debentures. By law, KDB is authorized to take deposits from its corporate
borrowers only. Unlike DMBs, which take deposits from the general public,
KDB-s deposits therefore account for a minor part of total domestic currency
resources.
3.26      Issuance of domestic currency Industrial Finance Debentures (IFDs)
is viewed by KDB both as a means of raising additional resources and as
contributing to the lengthening of maturities in the securities market. KDB
issues discount debentures with maturities of one to three years and coupon
debentures with a five-year maturity. Over the past few years, KDB has
issued increasing amounts of debentures; the face value of new issues has
risen from W 50 billion in 1977 to twice that amount in 1979. Redemption of
previous issues reached an average of 46% of new issues over 1977-79; net
outstanding debentures have consequently risen from W 79.5 billion at
end-1977 to W 143.2 billion at end-1979. These amounts are far from negli-
gible but represent no more than 6-8% of KDB-s total borrowings during the
period 1977-79.
3.27      KDB's limited reliance on debenture issues to cover its domestic
resource requirements is due to the high cost of this type of funding.
Since January 1980, nominal yields on KDB debentures range from 17.8% to 24%
and effective yields reach 27.88% to 29.13%./l By comparison, KDB-s highest
lending rate is 26.5% p.a. for nonpriority borrowers. Onlending the
proceeds of debentures therefore implies a negative interest spread of about
2 percentage points. In practice, KDB has been onlending part of these
resources to priority borrowers at concessional interest rates, thus
increasing the negative spreads.
3.28      The yield on KDB bonds is subject to MOF approval and appears
adequate given current interest rates on time and savings deposits./2 Since
Korean authorities rightly feel that KDB should continue and increase its
/1 Because interest is payable semiannually at front.
/2 Twenty-five to 26% p.a.



- 32 -
issuance of domestic currency debentures, at negotiations it was agreed that
the Government would take the action necessary on its part to enable KOB to
onlend the proceeds of its domestic debentures with a positive interest
spread. A possible means of achieving a positive spread would be to allow KDB
to increase its effective lending rate to about 30% p.a. by charging interest
in advance. This practice is widespread among other Korean financial insti-
tutions and would be in line with the method of interest payments on IFT)s./l
3.29      Foreign Currency Resource Mobilization.  KDB has been extremely
successful in mobilizing increasing amounts of foreign currency resources over
the past few years, both from official and commercial sources. The following
table summarizes KDB's borrowing performance on a commitment basis through
1979.

3.30      KDB's first $25 million commercial borrowing was contracted in
1970. Since then, KDB has been mobilizing increasing amounts of foreign
commercial resources and has issued foreign currency debentures (eurobonds).

very favorable terms./2 Another "jumbo" loan of $600-700 million is

contemplated in 1980.  KDB's reliance on official sources of funds which
reached 75% of total foreign borrowings over the period 1966-73 has rapidly
declined to 22.7% over 1974-79. A further reduction is contemplated in
coming years.
3.31      Official sources of funds (ADB, IBRD and KfW) provided a total of
$380.3 million in 1975-79; this covered about 44% of KDB's total foreign
currency commitments over that period. Aggregate commercial borrowings of
$1,297.4 million (in 1975-79) covered the resource gap and provided excess
funding of about $800 milion. As indicated in para. 3.30, excess commercial
borrowings have been converted into domestic currency to support KDB-s Won
lending operations.
3.32      KDB's practice of utilizing part of its foreign commercial
borrowings to finance domestic currency operations results from a conscious
policy decision endorsed by the Government. The reasons for this practice
are twofold: (a) opportunity cost of foreign capital versus domestic
capital; and (b) balance-of-payments support.
3.33      The mix of floating rate dollar borrowings and fixed rate Yen
borrowings brought the average cost of KDB's outstanding foreign commercial
funds to 14.46% in the second quarter of 1980. Alternative sources of
domestic currency resources consist primarily of domestic currency IFDs
which have a cost to KDB of 28-29% (para. 3.27). Given comparative costs,
it seems that, at present, KDB's conversion of commercial borrowings into
domestic currency is based on good financial management. The conversion
by KDB of part of its foreign commercial borrowings into won through
deposits at BOK has also provided effective support to Korea's balance of
payments. In the longer run, however, increased domestic savings are
desirable for the country and KDB should be encouraged by the Government to
mobilize more domestic resources by issuance of domestic IFDs. It would
therefore make good economic sense to improve the attractiveness to KDB of
IFD funding.
3.34      Despite the increased exposure of the Korean commercial banks in
Eurocurrency markets, the bulk of the commercial banks foreign exchange
resources is supplied by the central bank. Initially, KDB was expected to
onlend part of its $600 million commercial borrowings of 1979 to other
Korean financial institutions with little or no credit standing in the
Eurodollar markets. This apex mechanism did not materialize because of
pressures on Korea's balance of payments. Part of the funds /1 was credited
to the BOK to finance, in part, the current account deficit in the balance of
/1 $200 million has been deposited with BOK. The Monetary Stabilization
Bonds issued by BOK against this deposit can be repurchased by KDB at
a future date to finance its lending operations.

payments. In effect, KDB has raised commercial foreign exchange resources not
only for its own purposes, but also for meeting the general needs of the
economy. A similar mandate has been given by the Government to the Korea
Exchange Bank in 1979 and 1980.  A portion of the $600 million commercial
borrowing which KDB plans to raise in 1980 may also be earmarked to cover part
of the projected $6.0 billion deficit in the balance of payments. This new
mandate imposed on KDB by the Government gives it two separate functions: (a)
the provision of development finance for the industrial sector, and (b)
borrowing agent for the Korean Government in international capital markets.
The apex concept might be revived in the future since the Government feels
that the system of permitting only a limited number of institutions with good
credit standing to borrow abroad avoids an unnecessary competition for funds
which could otherwise lead to less advantageous terms.
Conclusion
3.35      The preceding description and analysis of KDB's role and institu-
tional efficiency in the industrial and financial sectors shows that KDB
qualifies as a well managed and operated financial institution. A more
detailed review of KDB's operations and performance is given in Annex B.
Shortcomings have been identified which relate primarily to: (a) insufficient
domestic currency resource mobilization; (b) KDB's insufficient contribution
to the efficient allocation of resources for operations funded by the
Government; and (c) the negative impact of the system of directed/subsidized
lending on the financial structure of the corporate sector.
3.36      These issues transcend the narrow institutional framework of XDB
and raise more fundamental questions about the efficiency of Korea's financial
system. These issues have been elaborated upon in Chapter 2. It is expected
that the proposed loan would set the basis for a continuing exchange of views
with the Government on broad financial sector issues and would provide an
opportunity for specific measures to be adopted by the Government as a first
step toward improved efficiency in the sector.

4. TTHE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
A. Objectives of the Proposed Loan
4.01      The proposed $100 million loan to KT)B would have the the following
four major objectives: (a) resource transfer to the industrial sector; (b)
continued upgrading of the institutional capability of TRIB to operate as an
efficient financial intermediary; (c) improvement in the operations of the
financial sector as a whole; and (d) improvement in the financial structure
of the corporate sector.
Resource Transfer
4.02      Despite the satisfactory level of domestic savings in Korea,
continued reliance on foreign savings to which the proposed loan would
contribute is essential for pursuing the structural transformation of
industry. To the extent that "DFC" type projects are quick disbursing, the
proposed loan would also contribute substantially to reducing the heavy
balance-of-payments deficits expected in the next few years.
4.03      The proposed $100 million loan would be the fourth lending
operation of the Bank to KDB. The proposed loan would cover a minor portion
of about 10% of KDB-s projected aggregate foreign currency loan commitments
over the two-year period 1981-82./1 The relatively small contribution of
the Bank loan to KDB s resource requirements is justified by KIDMVs
increasing ability to mobilize foreign resources from commercial sources.
KDB's reliance on foreign official borrowings has declined in the past few
years and is expected to decline further. However, the average maturity of
the subloans made by KDB is about 8 years at present and KnB therefore tends
to limit its mobilization of commercial borrowings to lines of credit having
an 8-10 year maturity. Under the proposed loan, the Bank would agree to fit
the amortization of its funds around shorter-term market borrowings for
subprojects co-funded with commercial and Bank resources. It is expected
that this dovetailing of repayments would allow KDB not to limit its
commercial borrowings to resources having a maturity of at least P years;
the proposed feature would allow the use of shorter-term (4-5 years)
commercial resources in the financing of long-term loans thereby increasing
the availability of long-term resources in the economy. The increase in the
flow of commercial funds would help reduce the share of official resources
in KDB-s total foreign borrowings.
4.04      Interest Spread on Commercial Borrowings.  Until June 1980, the
maximum interest spread which financial institutions could charge for handling
official and commercial foreign resources was fixed by the Government at 2%
/1 Foreign currency loan commitments are projected at $987 million over
1981-82.



- 36 -
and 0.5% respectively. This aiscrepancy effectively discriminated against
increased mobilization of foreign commercial resources and did not take into
account the magnitude of administrative expenses of financial interme-
diaries./l During negotiations, Government representatives pointed out that
as of June 1980, an interest spread of up to 2% on foreign commercial
resources was authorized by the Government. It was agreed that this measure
would become effective for KDB no later than March 1, 1981.
4.05      The higher interest spread on foreign commercial borrowings and the
proposed adjustment of repayments to the Bank for cofunded subloans is
expected to reduce substantially KDB's reliance on official sources of funds.
A complete phasing out of Bank lending to KDB, however, does not seem feasible
nor desirable in the the near future. Although KDB has mobilized foreign
commercial resources totalling $1,300 million over the period 1975-79 compared
to foreign currency loan commitments of only $900 million, it had to rely on
additional borrowings from official sources of about $400 million. The reason
for this apparent contradiction /2 lies in the longer maturity of official
borrowings./3 KDB is currently unable to mobilize other resources, domestic
or foreign, with a maturity exceeding 10 years. An increasing number of
projects in the priority areas of heavy industry however, have a long
gestation period and therefore require a loan payback period exceeding 10
years./4 To a large extent, Bank resources have been earmarked for funding
such projects./5 The restructuring of the Korean manufacturing sector toward
/1 Approximately 1% of average assets.
/2 Aside from the need for KDB to fund part of its domestic currency lend-
ing operations from the proceeds of foreign commercial borrowings
(para. 3.30).
/3 Up to 15 years.
/4   Over the period 1977-79, KDB's total commitments of loans with a matur-
ity exceeding 10 years reached about $529 million, or approximately 167
of total loan commitments during this 3-year period.
/5   The weighted average maturity of subloans financed by KDB under Bank
loan 1574-KO was 11.4 years compared to an overall average of 7.9
years.



- 37 -
heavy industry will be pursued in coming years thus necessitating the
continued availability of long-term resources. Until such long maturity
funding is available from commercial sources, some reliance on foreign
official resources will be required.
Institution Building
4.06      Institution building is a major objective of DFC-type operations.
In this instance, the Bank has already had, through previous loans, an effec-
tive impact on improving the administrative and institutional capacity of KDB.
This impact, however, was primarily focused on financing operations involving
the use of Bank resources. The proposed project would support increased
efficiency of KDB in channeling Bank and other resources. Specifically the
project would aim at strengthening KDB's role as the agent of the Government
for industrial lending programs including the National Investment Fund. The
concentration of NIF lending within the specialized banks and KDB which was
agreed upon during negotiations and is further explained in paras. 4.08-4.09
would ultimately aim at more than a simple rationalization of lending
mechanisms. KDB has agreed to establish within its present organization a
special unit in charge of monitoring the impact of NIF lending. The objective
would be to build up KDB's capability to assist the Government in evaluating
the efficiency of its lending programs and to help formulate/adjust lending
policies and financing patterns accordingly.  It is also expected that, over
time, KDB would be given increased latitude to apply the same selection
criteria in fund allocation under government programs as it currently does for
Bank-funded subprojects.
Financial Sector Objectives
4.07      The Government is fully aware of the shortcomings of the Korean
financial system and has indicated its firm intention to move gradually toward
restructuring the sector. The Government's long-term objective is to liberal-
ize the operations of financial institutions, particularly commercial banks,
in order to induce more competitition and efficiency in the financial sector.
Increased reliance will be placed on flexible tools of financial management as
opposed to the present rigid system of directing fund allocations and tightly
controlling financial institutions. The Government has specifically expressed
its intention to: (a) keep real interest rates at a positive level; (b) to
reduce the scope of concessional directed lending; and (c) to liberalize the
operations of commercial banks. The proposed loan provided the Bank with an
opportunity to agree with the Government on a set of specific policy measures
which represents a first step toward achieving the longer-term objectives
described above. The preceding review of the Korean system of long-term
industrial financing (Chapter 2) and of the role played by KDB as the largest
financial institution operating in that system (Chapter 3) suggests three
areas of action: (a) rationalization of the system of government directed
lending through a reorganization of its major component (for which KDB is the
main agent), i.e., the National Investment Fund program; (b) enhanced
mobilization of domestic currency resources by KDB; and (c) rationalization of
foreign currency lending rates.



- 38 -
4.08      The National Investment Fund.  The operations of NIF are described
in Annex C. As KDB administers a major part (two thirds) of NIF lending, it
was considered appropriate to discuss the rationalization of the NIF program
with the Korean Government in the context of the fourth loan to KDB. The
major deficiency of the program stems from its availability for a number of
too broadly defined priority areas including heavy industries, export
financing and the purchase of domestically manufactured machinery. Both the
Bank and the Government recognize that it is necessary to better define and to
restrict priority sectors eligible for NIF's subsidized resources. In light
of this mutual understanding, it was agreed during negotiations that the
Governmet would undertake an evaluation of the NIF program which would include
detailed industrial sectoral and subsector studies designed to redefine
priority areas for NIF lending. By narrowing the focus of NIF lending to
clear priority industries identified through these sectoral studies, a
reduction in TNIF lending relative to total industrial lending would occur.
This would reverse the trend of past years towards larger NIF operations which
impose an increasing burden on government finances because of the interest
subsidy on NIF loans.
4.09      As the extent of NIF lending is reduced, there would also be a need
to restrict its administrative scope to institutions directly controlled by
the Government, i.e. the specialized banks and KDB. The commercial banks
which currently handle only 20% of NIF lending could be freed from this type
of government-directed lending which would be in line with the Government's
stated objective of liberalizing the operations of commercial banks. In this
regard, the Government agreed at negotiations to gradually reduce, and even-
tually cease the provision of NIF resources to the commercial banks. A
further understanding was reached during negotiations that given the enhanced
role of KDB in NIF lending, KDB would establish a special unit to monitor the
overall impact of NIF lending and to administer KDB's own lending activities
under the program.  This unit would also provide support to the Government's
evaluation of the NIF program. Further discussion on the supplementary
analytical work the Bank feels is necessary to support the rationalization of
the NIF program over time is presented in Annex C. The terms of reference of
the detailed study oL the NIF program to be implemented jointly by the
Government and KDB are to be furnished to the Bank by March 31, 1981, and the
study is to be completed by December 31, 1981.
4.10      Mobilization of Domestic Currency Resources.  KDB has been issuing
considerable amounts of domestic currency debentures over the past years but
has been compelled by government interest rate regulations to onlend the
proceeds with a negative interest spread (para. 3.27). Increased issuance
of domestic currency debentures has, therefore, been limited by the sizeable
losses incurred by KDB in onlending IFD proceeds. Debentures are prac-
tically the only source of domestic currency resources for KDB, aside from
the Government's special funds and budgetary resources; net issuances of IFDs,
however, provided no more than 22% of the domestic currency funding needs of
KDB over 1977-79./i Insufficient domestic currency resources have compelled
/1 Net of lending operations funded by special funds and budgetary
allocations.



- 39 -
KDB to convert part of its foreign commercial borrowings into Won in order
to cover its shortage of domestic currency resources (para. 3.33). This
recourse is questionable and a more satisfactory long-term solution was dis-
cussed and agreed upon with the Government during negotiations. The
Government will now take the actions necessary to enable KT)B L O onlend the
proceeds of its domestic debentures with a positive interest spread.
4.11      Rationalization of Foreign Currency Lending Rates.  As indicated in
para. 2.34, the current practice of imposing a uniform interest spread of 2%
on the cost of foreign official borrowings results in unjustified distortions
of final lending rates. The suggestion made during negotiations that each
institution apply a spread of 2% to the weighted average cost of its
borrowings was agreed upon.
Corporate Financial Structure
4.12      The high indebtedness of Korean enterprises results in part from
excessive short-term borrowings and insufficient capitalization. KDB is in
a position to make its financial assistance conditional upon higher equity
contributions by project sponsors and to assist in strengthening the
financial structure of its borrowers. An objective of the proposed loan
would be to limit access to Bank and other resources to enterprises which
are committed to improving their financial structure and qualify under a
specific total debt/equity ratio. As discussed in para. 3.20, eligibility for
financing under the proposed Bank loan would be limited to enterprises whose
total debt/equity ratio does not exceed 5:1.
B. Benefits
4.13      The principal justification for the proposed loan is the expected
beneficial impact of the selective policy measures described above on the
operations of the financial sector as a whole. The loan would also provide
a vehicle for initiating discussions between the Bank and the Government on
a comprehensive reform of the financial sector. The policy dialogue would
be continued during supervision of the proposed loan and formulation of
subsequent industrial sector loans. The package of policy measures linked
to the proposed loan would constitute the first phase of a comprehensive
reform of the financial sector.
4.14      The proposed loan would be disbursed through KDB to qualifying
subprojects in the industrial sector. Experience with previous lending
through KDB shows that the projects financed with Bank resources have
yielded substantial economic benefits. Sample ERR calculations show a range



- 40 -
of 13% to 46%. The subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan are
expected to yield similar economic benefits. The proposed loan does not
entail any unusual risk.
C. Main Features of the Loan
4.15      Purpose.  As with previous Bank loans to KDB, the proposed lQan
would be used to finance (a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly
imported goods and services and (b) 60% of the cost in domestic currency
(representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of locally
manufactured or procured machinery and equipment. Procurement would be in
accordance with KDB's standard procedures which are satisfactory. The
procurement procedures of KDB are designed to ensure a sufficient degree of
competition and reasonable costs. The Bank is satisfied with the
performance of KDB in dealing with procurement matters under previous Bank
loans.
4.16      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have an adjustable composite amortization schedule
reflecting the aggregate amortization schedules of the subloans made by KDB.
4.17      The proposed loan is expected to be fully repaid within 15 years
including a grace period of three years. Individual subloans (with the excep-
tion of cofunded subloans) would have a maximum maturity of 13 years including
a grace period of three years. As indicated in para. 4.03, the Bank would
encourage the use of its funds as a catalyst for increased mobilization of
medium-term foreign commercial borrowings. It is therefore expected that some
of the subloans would be co-funded with Bank resources and with shorter-term
(4 to 5 years) commercial borrowings. In the case of co-funded subloans, the
Bank would agree to fit the amortization of its funding around the (earlier)
maturities of commercial funds. Normal Bank practice is to require approxi-
mately equal installments of principal for each subloan./l For co-funded
subloans earlier repayments by the subborrower may be assigned in full to the
amortization of commercial funds and repayments to the Bank may start
thereafter, thus implying a grace period of up to 5 years on Bank funds. A
disbursement schedule for the proposed loan is provided in Annex B, Table 26.
4.18      Free Limit.  Under the third Bank loan to KDB, the free limit for
subloans not requiring prior Bank approval was set at $2.5 million. The
standards of operations of KDB would justify a complete waiver of the free
/1 Or equal installments of principal and interest.



- 41 -
limit. KDB, however, finds some merit to the exchange of views taking place
through Bank reviews of subloans above the free limit. It is recommended that
the free limit be increased to $5 million. This limit is expected to result
in approximately 40% of the proposed loan being allocated to subprojects
requiring detailed review by the Bank prior to approval.
4.19      Subloan Ceiling.  To ensure that the proceeds of the previous Bank
loan to KDB were spread over a relatively large number of projects, a ceiling
of $7.5 million was imposed on individual subloans. A subloan ceiling of $10
million is recommended under the proposed loan in view of the size of some of
the heavy industry projects financed by KDB.
4.20      Debt/Equity Limit.  Previous Bank loan agreements impose, since July
1979, a limitation of 10 times on the ratio of KDB-s debt /1 relative to
equity. This limit is considered adequate and no change is therefore
proposed.
4.21      Relending Rate.  The relending rate will be based on the weighted
average cost of foreign currency resources available for future lending,
including the proposed loan. A 2% interest spread will be added to that
average cost in determining the final lending rate to subborrowers. The
Bank's practice to disburse a mix of US dollars and other currencies brought
the effective cost in Won terms of Bank funds for the subborrowers (who bear
the foreign exchange risk) to 17.4-26.5% p.a. for previous Bank loans to KDFC
(para. 2.33). The effective cost to the subborrowers of Bank funds channelled
through KDB under previous loans was in the same range. Assuming that past
trends in foreign exchange fluctuations remain unchanged, and the effective
lending rate in Won terms also remains unchanged as a consequence, the
effective cost of Bank funds would be in line with that of foreign commercial
resources and with the domestic currency lending rate. The effective lending
rate would be positive in real terms and the proposed relending rate formula
therefore appears adequate.
D. Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
4.22      During loan negotiations, the following agreements were reached with
the Korean Government:
(a) the Government would formulate a "Statement of Korea's Financial
Sector Policy Improvements." The statement would express the broad
objectives of the financial sector reform and specify a number of
policy measures to be implemented over time (para. 2.43);
/1 Debt being defined as including long-term debt (with a maturity exceeding
one year) and outstanding guarantees net of the portion for which the
Government has issued a counter guarantee.



- 42 -
(b) a specific time frame was discussed and agreed upon for
completion of the financial policy measures and studies listed in
the "Statement of Korea's Financial Sector Policy Improvements";
(c) the package of policy measures linked to the proposed loan
comprises (i) a reduction in the scope of priority activities
qualifying for financing under NIF (para. 4.08); (ii) a
restriction in the administrative scope of NIF lending to the
specialized banks and KDB (para. 4.09); (iii) authorization for
KDB to onlend the proceeds of its domestic currency debentures with
a positive interest spread (para. 4.10); (iv) harmonization of
lending rates for foreign currency funds raised from official
resources (4.11); (v) a higher interest spread of up to 2% for
onlending foreign commercial borrowings (4.04); and
(d) a detailed study of the NIF program would be undertaken jointly hy
KDB and the Government and completed by December 31, 1981
(para. 4.09).
4.23      In addition, the following agreements and/or understandings were
reached with KDB.
(a) the final onlending rate for subborrowers is to be based on the
formula agreed upon with the Government (para. 4.22(c)(iv) above);
(b) KDB will establish within its present organizational setup
a specialized unit in charge of monitoring the performance
of NIF borrowers at a subsectoral and branch of industry level
(para. 4.09);
(c) Bank funds will be allocated to enterprises which are committed
to improving their financial structure and qualify under a specific
debt/equity ratio (para. 4.12);
(d) the amortization schedule of subloans co-funded with commercial
foreign borrowings will be adjusted (para. 4.17);
(e) the free limit on subloans will be raised to $5 million
(para. 4.18);
(f)  a ceiling of $10 million would be applied to individual subloans
(para. 4.19); and
(g)  a long-term debt/equity ratio of 10:1 will be maintained by KDB
(para. 4.20).
4.24      Recommendation.  A Bank loan of $100 million for a term of 15 years
including a grace period of 3 years is recommended to he made to the Korea
Development Bank.

THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
1. KDB's ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
KDB in Perspective
1.01      KDB is, by far, the largest financial institution in Korea.  Its
outstanding loan portfolio reached W 2,138 billion ($4.41 billion) as of
December 31, 1979, or 19.2% of total institutional credit outstanding at
end-1979. KDB's outstanding guarantee portfolio amounted to $7.4 billion.
Disbursements for loans and investments in 1979 represented about 10.5% of
total gross fixed capital formation in Korea during the year.
1.02      KDB's operations encompass (a) domestic and foreign currency
lending; (b) equity investments; and (c) issuance of loan guarantees.
In 1979, loan commitments totalled W 956 billion ($1.97 billion) with 79%
in domestic currency and the balance in foreign currency; a ratio of 78:22
reflected the split between equipment and working capital financing.
New investments in equity and debentures amounted to W 35.9 billion
($74 million) and new guarantees W 1,142 billion ($2.35 billion). KDB's
clients fall into three major categories: large public sector enterprises
in the energy, transportation, social infrastructure and manufacturing
sectors;/l large private industrial conglomerates such as Dae Woo Heavy
Industries and Sam Sung whose capital requirements are so large that only
KDB, among the development banking institutions in Korea, can accommodate
their needs;/2 and finally, a more diversified clientele consisting of
relatively large-sized private enterprises. The first two categories of
borrowers account for a large share of KDB's loan portfolio although the
number of enterprises is small./3 KDB-s clients are often associated with
smaller firms through subcontracting arrangements.  But only large
enterprises, employing more than 300 workers and with assets of more than
W 500 million are eligible for financial assistance by KDB. Financial
assistance to smaller enterprises is supplied by the Small and Medium
Industry Bank (SMIB) and the Citizens National Bank (CNB).
/1 Public enterprises (62 companies) accounted for 47.7% of KDB's
outstanding loan portfolio at end-1979; 4 companies alone accounted for
34% of KDB-s portfolio.
/2 Loans to five large private companies accounted for 11% of KDB's
portfolio at end-1979.
/2 About 2% of KDB-s borrowers (public [4] and private [5]) account for 45%
of its portfolio, while 98% by number account for the remainder.

KDB's Role in the Government's Industrial Strategy
1.03      KDB plays an important role within the framework of the Govern-
ment's development strategy, as the executing arm of the Government's
industrial policies. KDB's Research Department also carries out special
studies of industry at the Government's request.
1.04      KDB as Executing Arm of the Government.  In accordance with its
charter, KDB provides financing to priority industrial projects in
conformity with government policies. KDB's support of government objectives
is embodied in an annual Operational Program which incorporates sectoral
lending targets and earmarks financing for specific projects sponsored by the
Government. In addition to allocating the resources it raises independently
from the Government, KDB also operates as a conduit for channelling budgetary
allocation and special government funding programs /1 to specific projects of
national importance, such as Korea Electric Company (KECO), Korea National
Railroad or Pohang Integrated Iron and Steel Company. In 1979, KDB received
W 83.3 billion in budgetary allocations from the Government representing
7.5% of the Government's capital expenditures for the year. It also
received W 310.8 billion from the NIF, representing about 67.9% of total NIF
allocations in 1979.  The above two sources together constituted about 35%
of the total resources raised by KDB in 1979. KDB allocates these
resources, as well as the funds it raises independently, in accordance with
government priorities. The priority order in KDB's 1980 Operational Program
was: (a) government projects for which budgetary funds had been earmarked;
(b) equipment financing for priority industries as defined in the KDB Act,
i.e. power, coal, iron and steel, air and marine transportation; (c)
equipment financing in heavy industry and chemicals; and (d) equipment
financing in other industries, and (e)working capital.
1.05      Input into Government Industrial Policies.  KDB has helped
formulate government policies in the industrial and financial sectors by
assisting in government-sponsored studies and participating in a number of
consultative groups sponsored by the Government. KDB carries out research
studies, which are often used by the Government as an input in formulating
industrial plans and policies. In 1977, KDB started a major study on
industrial rationalization in Korea. The study considered the mix of
industrial policies needed to sustain economic growth as Korea becomes a
more open economy. The study covered 27 industrial sectors and used a number
of cross country comparators. Studies undertaken in 1978 included a review
of policies for overseas investment, a proposal for improved management
efficiency in banking institutions, and an analysis of the impact of the
value added tax on different income groups. In 1979, KDB carried out
/1 Particularly the National Investment Fund (NIF) program described in
Annex C.

surveys of promotional measures for the machinery industry; of the economic
impact of foreign-investment in Korea, and of the benefits of import
liberalization for selected items.
1.06      Since its establishment in 1954, KDB has been actively involved in
the preparation of the industrial sector's Five-Year Plans. KDB relies on
its Research Department to conduct these surveys. Committees on which KDB
is represented include the Economic Cabinet Committee, the Foreign Capital
Inducement Deliberation Committee, the Advisory Committee for Economic
Planning, and the NIF Management Council.
Economic Impact of KDB's Lending
1.07      Scale of Output and Value-added.  In 1979, KDB approved 703
projects with a total cost of W 1,431 billion; these investments are
expected to generate an incremental annual output of W 2,532 billion and
incremental annual value-added of W 461 billion.
1.08      Employment Creation.  As of December 31, 1979, KDB's clients
employed a total of 1 million persons, 80% in the manufacturing sector. The
average cost per job for subprojects financed under the latest Bank loan
was about $35,000. This relatively high cost per job reflects KDB's primary
role as a promoter of large capital intensive projects in the priority
sectors of power, shipbuilding, basic metals, and machinery. Although KDB
finances a high proportion of capital intensive projects, it carefully
reviews employment impact in evaluating project merits.
1.09      Export Orientation.  Exports by KDB borrowers totalled US$6.6 bil-
lion in 1978 or about 52% of all Korean exports. Exports were expected to
account for about 50% of incremental sales of projects financed by KDB in
1978-79.
1.10      Sectoral Distribution.  The sectoral distribution of KDB-s lending
operations is shown in Table 6. The share of capital goods industry in
KDB's annual commitments has remained relatively constant over the last three
years at around 30%-35%. In 1978, loan commitments to the machinery sector
represented 9% of total commitments to the manufacturing sector;/l the
comparable figure for 1979 was 12%.
1.11      Economic Rate of Return Analysis.  Table 8 shows the economic
indicators of all the projects financed by KDB under IBRD Loan No. 1574-KO
and economic rates of return (ERR) of projects which received loans
exceeding US$750,000. All projects had ERRs in excess of 10% and 18
exceeded 30%. The weighted average economic rate of return was about 30%.
/1 On average, commitments to the manufacturing sector reached about 55% of
total loan commitments during last three years.

Influence on Project Design and Technical Assistance
1.12      KDB's influence on project formulation is often limited since
project sponsors approach KDB after basic investment decisions concerning
product mix, technologies and location have already been taken. Neverthe-
less, KDB-s appraisal staff does contribute to improving the design of some
of the investment proposals. KDB, for instance, encourages companies to
locate in industrial estates. When new technologies are considered, KDB
staff urge project sponsors to enter into technical collaboration agreements
with foreign companies. KDB also provides consulting services to clients
facing acute difficulties, and may at times assign some of its staff to help
borrowers on a temporary basis.
Promotional Activities
1.13      In addition to the promotional activities pursued directly
through its financing operations, KDB has also made significant contribu-
tions to the development of the Korean financial system by helping establish
several specialized financial institutions. These include a leasing
company, two merchant banks, and two overseas investment bank.
1.14      Korea Industrial Leasing Company, Limited (KILC).  KILC was estab-
lished by KDB as a joint subsidiary in December 1972 and started operations
in March 1973. As of December 31, 1979, KILC's paid-in capital was W 3
billion with 50% owned by KDB, 45% by the Manufacturers Hanover Leasing
Company and the remaining 5% by the Korea Exchange Bank. KILC-s objective
is to lease industrial machinery, principally to smaller firms which cannot
afford outright purchase. As of December 31, 1979, KILC has written 496
lease contracts amounting to W 79.6 billion. A total of $17.5 million had
been earmarked from previous Bank loans (Nos. 1338-KO and 1574-KO) to KDB
for use by KILC. Eligibility was restricted to enterprises with assets of
less than W 600 million or projects with a maximum cost per job of $15,000.
Utilization of this component has been satisfactory. As of December 31,
1979, $17.5 million had been committed and $14.7 million disbursed.
1.15      Saehan Merchant Banking Corporation (SMBC).  KDB was instrumental
in establishing SMBC in 1977. SMBC is a joint venture between Korean (50%)
and international shareholders (50%). KDB is the largest shareholder with
30% of the W 6 billion equity at end-1979; Samuel and Company held 20.5%.
SMBC performs the dual function of mobilizing foreign commercial resources
and developing the securities market in Korea.
1.16      Korea Associated Securities Inc. (KASI).  KASI is an investment
bank registered under the corporate laws of the State of New York. The
principal purpose of KASI, which was established in 1977 is to raise foreign
currency capital for Korean enterprises and to attract US and other foreign
investments in Korea. KDB held 50% of the $6 million paid-up capital as of
December 31, 1979 with the remainder almost equally distributed among six
other Korean banks.

Page 5
1.17      Korea International Merchant Bank (KIMB).  KIMB was established in
1979 to raise foreign commercial resources and develop the financial market
in Korea. As of December 31, 1979, KDB and the Korea Exchange Bank held
respectively 10% and 40% of its W 5 billion share capital. Fc:eign
shareholders held the balance of 50%.
1.18      Korea Associated Finance Ltd. (KAF).  KAF was established in Hong
Kong in 1979 as a merchant bank. KAF's objective is to raise foreign
capital for Korean companies. As of December 31, 1979, KDB held 7.5% of
KAF's paid in share capital of $5 million.
Resource Mobilization
1.19       KDB-s resource position is analyzed in paras. 4.10 to 4.12.  As of
December 31, 1979, KDB had total resources short and long-term, of W 2,848
billion equivalent. Borrowings from the NIF remain the single largest
source of funds (28.4%) followed by equity with about 17%. In addition to
its share capital which is subscribed by the Government, KDB depends for
about 45% of its total resources on funds provided by the Government. In
recent years, however, KDB succeeded in mobilizing additional resources in
its own name to supplement government funding.
1.20       On the domestic currency side, KDB has issued industrial finance
debentures (IFD) with a maturity of 2 to 5 years /1 and an aggregate value
of W 277 billion since 1975. Outstanding IFDs accounted for about 5.0% of
KDB-s total resources at end-1979. The present structure of the domestic
capital market does not permit KDB to issue bonds with maturities over 5
years. However, KDB-s lending for equipment financing would require
resources having maturities exceeding eight years. As a result, KDB
continues to rely on other sources of long-term domestic currency funds
primarily from the Government and the NIF.
1.21       On the foreign currency side, KDB has raised $1,422 million from
commercial sources over the period 1970-79 /2 to supplement the $492 million
obtained from official sources (IBRD, ADB, USAID, and KfW). This success in
mobilizing foreign commercial resources is very impressive.
/1 Of the bonds issued, 48% had a maturity of two years, 50% a maturity of
three years and 2% a maturity of five years.
/2  Of which $1,063 million in 1978-79.

2. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Legal Framework, Organization and Staff
2.01      Legal Framework and Ownership.  KDB was established in 1954 as a
wholly government-owned institution to finance the postwar rehabilitation of
industry. KDB's operations, broad policy framework, scope of activities,
administration and capitalization are governed by the KDB Act. The Act was
last amended in December 1977, in part to increase KDB's authorized capital
from W 300 billion to W 600 billion. As of December 31, 1979, KDB-s paid-in
capital was W 331.8 billion.
2.02      Management.  In accordance with the KDB Act, the Minister of
Finance supervises KDB's operations. A full-time Board of Directors
(Appendix 1) comprising the Governor, Deputy Governor and seven Executive
Directors, conducts KDB's operations. KDB's Governor is appointed by the
President of the Republic on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance;
the Deputy Governor and Executive Directors are appointed by the Minister of
Finance. The term of office for Board members is three years and is
renewable. Mr. Yeung Ki Hah, former President of the Korea First Bank, was
appointed Governor of KDB in July 1980. The quality of KDB's senior and
middle level management is satisfactory.
2.03      Organization.  KDBs head office comprises 21 departments grouped
according to broad functions; each group reports to one of the seven
Executive Directors. KDB's organization chart is appended. The Head Office
is responsible for all projects in the Seoul area. The 10 local branch
offices outside the Seoul region have the authority to approve working capital
loans;/l other types of loans are appraised at the branch level and forwarded
to the Head Office for further analysis and approval. The branches are also
responsible for the supervision of projects in their area. In addition to its
domestic branch offices, KDB has representative offices in London, New York,
Tokyo, Kuwait, Singapore, Hong Kong and, more recently, in Frankfurt. The
main focus of these offices is foreign currency resource mobilization.
2.04      Staff.  Table 3 shows the breakdown of KDB-s professional staff.
Over the past few years KDB-s total staff size has not changed signifi-
cantly. The total number of staff currently stands at 1,961 of whom 584 hold
a position of Deputy Manager and above./2 The quality of KDB-s professional
staff is satisfactory. Staff turnover for professionals has declined from
14% in 1977 to 5.5% in 1979. In the past, KDB lost some of its better
professional staff to other Korean financial institutions and to industry.
The reduction in the staff turnover rate in recent years reflects, to an
/1 W 30 million to W 110 million depending on the branch.
/2 Based on academic and work experience, the number of professionals is
591.

extent, the slowing down in the rate of growth of the Korean economy. KDB
continues to attract new recruits of acceptable quality, including college
graduates. KDB provides adequate in-house and external training for all its
staff. A number of officers are also sent to various financial institutions
abroad for further training; in 1979, 73 officers were sent abroad for
on-the-job (63) and academic (10) training.
Operational Policies
2.05      KDB's operations are governed by the KDB Act and Enforcement Decree,
KDB's By-Laws, Operating Manuals and Policy Statement (Appendix 2). KDB has
also formulated a Statement of Development Strategy (Appendix 3) for the
period 1980/82, highlighting its specific short-run developmental objec-
tives. KDB's Policy Statement incorporates financial prudence guidelines
and limits applicable to KDB's equity participation, collateral coverage and
total financial assistance to any single enterprise. With respect to equity
operations, the Policy Statement stipulates that KDB should not normally
make equity investments in excess of either 15% of its own equity or 50% of
the paid-in capital of the enterprise. Excluding the Readjustment
Corporation,/l KDB had exceeded these limits in three cases as of December 31,
1979.  Its financing to these companies amounted to W 192 billion (58% of
KDB's total investment portfolio).
2.06      The Policy Statement also provides that KDB shall not normally
extend financial assistance to any single entity        in excess of either 25%
of its own equity or 65% of the total assets of the enterprise. As of
December 31, 1979, KDB had exceeded these limits in 15 cases amounting to W
3,555 billion and representing 57% of KDB's aggregate loan, investment, and
guarantee portfolio./2 The W 3,555 billion portfolio comprised 71% in the
form of guarantees,/325% in loans and 4% in equity investments. Finally,
the Policy Statement provides that KDB shall require a collateral coverage
of at least 125% for loans and 120% for guarantees. At end-1979, KDB has
exceeded these limits in 21 cases /4 representing about 43% of the outstanding
loan portfolio and 63% of the outstanding guarantee portfolio.  The large
size of the Government-owned and government designated enterprises to which

proportion of "exceptions" in KDB's portfolio.
/1  A full subsidiary of KDB in accordance with Article 53 of the KDB Act.

Project Appraisal and Supervision
2.07      Project Appraisal.  KDB's appraisal standards and procedures remain
satisfactory for projects funded out of its own resources (including foreign
official borrowings). The latitude given KDB to exercise its independent
judgement is however severely curtailed for project financed out of government
resources. KDB undertakes reasonably thorough economic analyses. Economic
Rates of Return (ERR) are calculated for projects funded from official
borrowings and requiring foreign exchange financing of more than $750,000 and
for all other projects whose cost exceeds W 2 billion. KDB's appraisal
analyses also include an assessment of the environmental impact of the
projects it financesn
2.08      Project Supervision.  KDB's project supervision procedures are
generally satisfactory. Follow-up work, however, is not entrusted to a
separate department; it is carried out by the loan appraisal officers, either
at Headquarters or at the branch level, or jointly. Compliance by clients in
fulfilling quarterly reporting requirements is satisfactory. Audited
financial statements are required for all foreign currency loans, and for
domestic currency loans exceeding W 100 million. KDB frequently assigns its
own staff to problem projects to serve in a managerial capacity or appoints a
representative on the Board of Directors. Overdue or insufficiently
collateralized loans are transferred to the Special Loan Department which
works closely with the Business Control Department. Foreclosures are
transferred to the Readjustment Corporation.
Procurement and Disbursement
2.09      KDB's procurement and disbursement procedures are designed to ensure
a reasonable degree of competition in procurement and the appropriate use of
funds. Procedures were changed in 1978 to include three methods of
procurement: international competitive bidding (ICB); limited competitive
bidding; and negotiated contracts. ICB is the most frequent and accounted for
56% of all procurement contracts under the third Bank loan. In cases where
the estimated procurement is less than $1 million, limited competitive bidding
is followed. Suppliers' bids from at least five countries are required. In
1979, this method accounted for 17% of all procurement contracts.
Occasionally, when patent rights, compatibility with existing equipment or
unique specifications make it necessary, KDB accepts negotiated contracts with
a single supplier. In 1979, 27% of all procurement financed by KDB was made
under the negotiated contract method. The final procurement contract is
always subject to KDB's approval. Disbursements are monitored and authorized
in accordance with progress in project implementation.

3. OPERATIONS
Scope of Operations
3.01      The KDB Act allows KDB to undertake working capital and equipment
financing, issuance of bonds, borrowing of foreign capital, and transactions
in foreign exchange.  Some of these operations,/1 however, are restricted to
enterprises which have already obtained term loans or guarantees from KDB.
The annual volume of KDB's operations is guided by its Operational Program
which is subject to approval by the Minister of Finance. The Operational
Program sets out quantitative targets for KDB's financing on the basis of
available resources.
Volume of Operations
3.02      KDB's financing operations fall into three broad categories: (a)
lending in foreign and domestic currency for equipment purchases and working
capital; (b) investment in equity and corporate bonds and debentures; and
(c) issuance of loan guarantees, in foreign and domestic currency. The
volume of KDB-s operations particularly in domestic currency has often been
constrained by the non-availability of sufficient resources. Over the past
few years, however, KDB has been able to expand rapidly its foreign
commercial borrowings. Conversion of a part of the foreign commercial
resources into Won and issuance of domestic currency IFDs have enabled a
reasonable growth of domestic lending. KDB's loan, investment and guarantee
operations for 1976-79 are shown in Tables 4, 9 and 11 and are summarized
as follows:
/1 Working capital finance, demand deposits, dealings in foreign exchange.

3.03      KDB-s loan approvals amounted to W 957.8 billion in 1979, an
increase of 63% over 1978.  Since 1977, domestic currency lending has
increased at an annual average rate of 57%, and foreign currency lending at
123%. As a share of KDBIs total lending, foreign currency lending has
increased from 12% in 1977 to 21% in 1979. Over the past three years,
working capital loans averaged 20% of total domestic currency loans. As of
December 31, 1979, KDB-s outstanding loan portfolio reached W 2,138 billion,
more than twice the 1977 level.
Characteristics of Lending Operations
3.04      Tables 5 and 6 show an analysis of loan commitments during 1977-79
and of outstanding loans as of December 31, 1979. Outstanding foreign
currency loans have risen from 10.4% of KDB-s total loan portfolio at end
1977 to 15.1% at end 1979. The share of the private sector in KDB-s
outstanding portfolio has also increased from 46.4% at end 1977 to 52.3% at
end 1979. New projects accounted for 30% of KDB-s commitments in 1979. The
average maturity of equipment loans has increased from 6.0 years in 1977 to
7.9 years in 1979; in the case of working capital loans, the average
duration has declined from 20 months in 1977 to 13 months in 1979.

3.05      The geographic distribution of loans has remained more or less the
same over the last three years with Seoul and Busan, the predominant
industrial areas, absorbing about 50% /1 of all loan commitments in 1977-79.
The manufacturing sector accounted for 57.4% of loan commitments in 1979
compared with 60.1% in 1977. The share of capital goods industries has
remained relatively constant at 33% over the last three years while the
machinery industry accounted for about 8%.
3.06      Loans Made at Government's Behest.  KDB extends financial assis-
tance to public sector companies at the behest of the Government, without
undertaking independent appraisal. As of December 31, 1979, outstanding
loans to such companies amounted to W 721.3 billion /2 or 34% of KDB-s
outstanding loan portfolio. Under the second Bank Loan to KDB, the Government
agreed to relieve KDB of the financial risks pertaining to such loans.
Investment Operations
3.07      Table 9 gives a summary of KDB's investment operations for 1976-79.
Total investments approved during 1979 amounted to W 35.9 billion and KDB's
investment portfolio stood at W 332.2 billion at end-1979. Equity investments
accounted for 90% of the total investment portfolio; the remaining portfolio
comprised bonds and debentures.
3.08      As of December 31, 1979, 75% of KDB's outstanding portfolio was
invested in public sector companies. Manufacturing industries accounted for
75% of total portfolio (Table 10).
Guarantee Operations
3.09      As of December 31, 1979, KDB's guarantee portfolio stood at
W 3,722.2 billion (Table 11). About 96%.of all outstanding guarantees
were in foreign currency. Domestic currency guarantee commitments have
increased marginally from 6% in 1977 to 12% in 1979.  Guarantees issued to
the public sector declined from 42% in 1977 to 30% in 1979. The KDB Act
sets a ceiling of 10 times its paid-in capital and reserves on KDB's
guarantee operations. As of December 31, 1979, that ratio was 8.1 times its
equity.
/1 This percentage is somewhat misleading, as it includes substantial
lending to KECO whose head office is in Seoul.
/2 Korea Electric Company - W 536.8 billion; Korea National Railways -
W 167.3 billion; Korea Coal Corporation W 11.6 billion; and Korea Highway
Corporation - W 5.6 billion.

Utilization of Bank Loan No. 1574-KO
3.10      As of March 1, 1980, KDB and KILC had committed $95.6 million and
$9.6 million respectively of the proceeds of the latest IBRD Loan ($110 mil-
lion). Disbursements reached $67.6 million. Table 8 presents an analysis
of the subprojects financed under Bank Loan No. 1574-KO. KDB-s subloans
ranged in size from $300,000 to $7.5 million with an average of about
$2.2 million; KILC-s average lease amount was $235,000. As of December 31,
1979, machinery, metal and chemical industries accounted respectively for
19%, 9% and 12% of KDB-s total approvals under Bank Loan No. 1574-KO.  KDB
contributed about 43% of total project costs. The 43 projects financed by
KDB under this loan are expected to generate export sales of $292 million
and to create 6,700 new jobs at an average cost per job of about $35,000.
Financial rates of return range from 10% to 37% with an average of 22%; the
average ERR is about 30%.
4. FINANCIAL CONDITION, PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCE POSITION
Financial Condition
4.01      Assets.  KDB-s asset base has been growing at an average of 37%
p.a. during the period 1977-79. Total assets reached W 2,869 billion
($5.9 billion) at end-1979. Over the period 1977-79 the shares of KDB-s
loan and investment portfolios in total assets averaged 72.3% and 14.5%
respectively.
4.02      Liabilities and Equity.  As of December 31, 1979, KDB-s total
assets were financed by short-term debts (12.1%), long-term liabilities
(70.8%) and equity (17.1%). KDB-s equity base has declined in relative
terms from 25.7% at end-1977. Foreign currency borrowings have increased
from about 24% of outstanding long-term resources in 1977 to 40% in 1979 as
a result mainly of KDB-s success in raising foreign commercial funds.
4.03      Liquidity Position.  As of December 31, 1979, the current ratio
stood at 1.8:1 as against 1.2:1 at end-1978; this improvement, however, is
due to a different presentation of the balance sheet in 1979. KDB-s debt
service ratio is satisfactory and amounted to 1.3 in 1979 as against 1.4 in
1978.
4.04      Debt/Equity Ratio.  The KDB Act limits KDB-s outstanding guaran-
tees and IFDs to ten times its equity; as of December 31, 1979, the ratio
stood at 8.1. The long-term debt/equity ratio stood at 6.3:1 at end-1979,
and was well within the contractual limit set with the Bank at 10:1./1
/1 The original 5:1 limit was increased in July 1979 to 10:1.

Page 13
Financial Performance
4.05      Table 16 shows KDB's financial performance between ,976 and 1979.
KDB-s gross interest spread has declined from 3.9% in 1977 to 3.0% in 1979,
and its administrative expenses have increased marginally /1 from 0.7% of
average total assets in 1978 to 1.0% in 1979. As a consequence, KDB's net
income to average total assets declined from 2.2% in 1976 to 1.5% in 1979.
Since the Government made no additional capital contribution in 1979, the
return on KDB's average net worth increased from 7.5% in 1978 to 7.9% in 1979.
Portfolio Quality
4.06      Loan Portfolio.  Tables 17 and 18 show the status of KDB-s portfolio
for the years 1976-79.  KDB's arrears situation, although still satisfactory,
has deteriorated in 1979 owing to the recession which affected the economy as
a whole and the tight monetary policy enforced by the Government; KDB, how-
ever, considers this deterioration to be temporary.  As of December 31, 1979,
arrears of principal and interest (in excess of three months) reached
W 9.8 billion/2 or approximately 0.5% of the total loan portfolio compared to
0.3% at end-1978.  Principal affected by arrears reached 7% of total portfolio
at end-1979 as against 2.9% in 1978.  The amount of rescheduling relative to
the loan portfolio has likewise increased from 3.3% in 1978 to 7.5% in 1979.
Total portfolio affected by reschedulings and arrears (over three months) has
jumped from 6.2% in 1978 to 14.5% in 1979. On the other hand, transfers to
the Readjustment Corporation (RAC), KDB's collection agency, have decreased in
1979. Despite a perceptible deterioration in 1979, KDB's loan portfolio
remains reasonably sound, and its collection performance (97.4%) satisfactory.
4.07      Guarantee Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1979, KDB's outstanding
guarantee portfolio comprised 139 companies for a total of W 3,722.1 billion
of which 72.7% was covered under the Government-s Guarantee Release Agreement
(GRA)./3 Seven clients, all in the private sector, were in default on
guarantees affecting about 1.4% of KDB's guarantee portfolio /4 compared to
0.2% in 1978. Payments made by KDB in 1979 on defaulted guarantees amounted
to W 6.9 billion as against W 2.3 billion in 1978.
/1  The increased administrative expenses mainly resulted from an exceptional
increase in retirement allowances.
/2  Data quoted in this paragraph are based on audited accounts and differ
substantially from the figures supplied by KDB in Tables 17 and 18.
/3  Under the GRA, the Government assumes the financial risk for all foreign
guarantees issued to government-controlled enterprises and priority
enterprises as defined in the KDB Act.
/4  Of which 59% was covered under the GRA.

Page 14
4.08      Equity Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1979, KDB had outstanding
investments of W 300 billion in 37 companies, most of which were operating
satisfactorily; only three companies, accounting for 6.2% of total invest-
ments, were experiencing losses. The dividend yield on KDB's investment
portfolio has increased marginally, but the overall return including capital
gains declined from 5.6% in 1978 to 4.5% in 1979. The profitability of
KDB's investments is low because of the large share in the portfolio of
public and semi-public entities which distribute little or no dividends.
However, KDB's equity portfolio is sound.
4.09      Provisions.  The government guarantee (GRA) which covers most of
KDB's guarantee portfolio is satisfactory and alleviates the need for spe-
cial provisions. KDB's provisions against its loan and investment portfolio
reached only W 300 million at end-1979 or 0.01% of the total outstanding
portfolio. The level of provisions made by KDB is based on writeoffs in
preceding years. Actual writeoffs can be kept at an artificially low level
and this procedure therefore appears inadequate. KDB's financial statements
have been audited by Sam Poong Company in 1979. While recognizing that KDB
is required by law to set aside special equity reserves to cover exceptional
losses, the auditors recommended that KDB set aside additional provisions at
1% of outstanding portfolio. Provisions of W 24.7 billion have been
recommended.
Resource Position
4.10      KDB's resource position as of December 31, 1979 is shown in Table
19. As of this date, KDB's total resources amounted to W 2,848.7 billion
equivalent of which 71% had been moblized in domestic currency and 29% in
foreign currency. By comparison, the currency mix of KDB's outstanding
portfolio (loans and investments) at the same date was substantially
different since the domestic currency component reached 87% (domestic
currency loans and investments) and the foreign currency component reached
13% only. The larger share of domestic currency operations (87% as against
71%) reflected the greater demand for domestic currency funding relative to
available domestic currency resources. KDB suffers from insufficient
domestic currency resources and to cover this gap, KDB has converted a
substantial portion of its foreign commercial resources (approximately 60%)
into Won to finance its domestic currency lending.
4.11      As of December 31, 1979, KDB's total uncommitted long-term
resources amounted to W 216.2 billion ($446 million). In addition, avail-
able short-term domestic currency resources amounted to W 78 billion. KDB's
total loan commitments are projected at about $1,940 million in 1980, or
approximately three times the size of the resources available for commitment
at end 1979.



-73-                             ANNEX B
Page 15
4.12      KDB's principal sources of domestic currency funds are budgetary
allocations and borrowings from government funds. Together, these two sources
accounted frr about 65% of KDB's total long-term domestic resources /1 as of
end-1979. The National Investment Fund (NIF) has become KDB-s single
largest source accounting for 43.9% of KDB's total long-term domestic funds
at end-1979 followed by equity resources with 26.7% and budgetary
allocations with 16.9%. Domestic currency long-term resources raised by KDB
independently from the Government comprise deposits and Industrial Finance
Debentures.  These two sources together accounted for less than 8% of KDB's
total long-term domestic currency resources at end-1979.
4.13      Industrial Finance Debentures (IFDs) - To augment its domestic
currency resources and to stimulate capital market development, KDB issues
discount debentures with maturities of one to three years and coupon
debentures with a five-year maturity. Issuance of debentures requires the
approval of the National Assembly, since the KDB bonds are guaranteed by the
Government. KDB's domestic resource constraint has been solved in the past by
converting some of KDB's foreign commercial borrowings into domestic currency.
A more satisfactory long-term solution lies in the issuance by KDB of
increasing amounts of IFDs with a gradual lengthening of maturities. Through
end-1979, KDB had raised an aggregate of about W 374 billion through debenture
issue; W 143.2 billion were outstanding at end-1979, representing 7.8% of
KDB's total long-term domestic resources. The issuance of domestic IFDs has
been encouraged by the Korean authorities as a means of lengthening maturities
in the capital market.  So far, however, KDB has been able to issue five-year
debentures in limited amounts only, except in 1977, when they accounted for 8%
of the total amount issued.  Since the January 1980 upward adjustment of
interest rates in Korea, IFDs are issued at nominal interest rates of 17.8% to
21.8% for the one to three-year category and 24% for five year debentures.
With prepayment of interest, however, their effective cost to KDB is between
28% and 29%. Given KDB-s maximum lending rate of 26.5% for capital loans, the
use of these funds implies a loss of about two percentage points. In fact,
KDB has been onlending part of its IFD proceeds to priority borrowers at
subsidized interest rates (i.e., lower than 26.5%), thus increasing the
negative spread.
4.14      Foreign Currency Resources.  KDB has been very successful during
the past few years in its efforts to supplement its foreign borrowings from
official sources with funds raised from commercial sources. Foreign
commercial borrowings accounted for about 75% of KDB-s total foreign
currency resources at end-1979. In 1979 alone, KDB was able to mobilize a
total of $755 million from commercial sources comprising (a) $43.9 million
through the issuance of Euro-Bonds denominated in Kuwaiti Dinar; and (b) two
syndicated loans of Yen 28 billion and $600 million. A $200 million
/1 Excluding funds raised in foreign currency and converted into Won, but
including equity resources (i.e., W 1,842 billion).

Page 16
portion of the latter loan has been temporarily invested in BOK's Monetary
Stabilization Bonds. A swap arrangement with BOK gives KDB adequate
protection against any foreign exchange risk and allows repurchase of the
funds for future lending operations. During 1980, the Government intends to
encourage XDB to raise an additional loan of $600 million from the
international capital market.
5. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Operational Proj ections
5.01       In the past, KDB's growth has been limited by the availability of
funds rather than loan demand. As a consequence, KDB usually prepares its
operational projections on the basis of the estimated availability of funds.
KDB expects its loan operations to increase by 18% in 1980 on an approval
basis, and an average of 14% for the 1981-83 period. Higher levels of
operations are projected in 1980 following the Won devaluation. Overall,
these projections seem rather conservative in light of the 47% growth rate
which KDB experienced during 1976-79. The share of foreign currency loans
in total commitments is projected to increase to 20% as against 17.5% in the
period 1977-79. The projected share of working capital financing at 20% of
domestic operations is in line with previous years, but represents a decline
from the fairly high level of 27.3% in 1979. The year 1979 was marked by
very tight liquidity for Korean firms and an exceptional increase in KDB's
lending for working capital. KDB's investment and debenture portfolio is
expected to increase annually at the historical rate of 21%. KDB expects to
issue guarantees averaging $ 1.9 billion annually; this would result in an
increase in its guarantee portfolio of 10% p.a. over the period 1980-83.
5.02       A summary of KDB's projected operations is shown in Table 21.
KDB-s total loan commitments are expected to increase from W 955.7 billion
in 1979 to W 1,668.4 billion in 1983. The share of domestic currency loans
in total commitments would remain unchanged at about 79%. Given KDB-s past
performance, its projected level of operations appears to be somewhat
conservative. However, as in the past, the actual operational level will be
largely determined by resource availability.
Resource Requirements
5.03       To meet its projected commitments, KDB plans to borrow an
aggregate of about W 4.8 billion ($8.2 billion) between 1980 and 1983, of
which 63% would be in domestic currency. The lower 63% share of domestic
currency resources in total borrowings relative to the 79% share of domestic
currency lending in total commitments suggests that KDB will continue to
rely on the conversion of foreign commercial borrowings to finance its
domestic currency operations. KDB expects budgetary funding and NIF

Page 17
allocations to remain its principal sources of domestic resources,
accounting for about 63% of total domestic currency resource mobilization.
Domestic currency IFDs would provide the remainder. KDB's projected
borrowing program for 1980-83 is shown in the following table. KDB plans to
raise W 1,100 billion through issuance of domestic IFDs over that period.

5.04      During the 1980-83 period, KDB intends to raise from official
sources only 8.5% of its total $3.1 billion foreign currency borrowings.
The international capital market is expected to supply the remaining 91.5%.
The mobilization of this very substantial volume of foreign commercial
resources will depend on Korea's continued creditworthiness and conditions
in the international capital markets. It will also depend on the amount of
foreign commercial funds which KDB is allowed by the Government to raise in
any given year, within the framework of overall capital inflows into Korea.

Financial Forecasts
5.05      KDB's projected income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow
statements for the years 1980-83 are shown in Tables 22, 23, and 24. A
gradual decline is expected in KDB's gross interest spread from 3.0% in 1979
to 2.4% in 1983; net return on average assets would consequently decline
from 1.5% to 1%, a level which KDB considers satisfactory for a government
institution. In gross terms, however, KDB's annual net income would
increase from W 36.5 billion in 1979 to W 58.0 billion by 1983.
Administrative expenses are projected to remain at the satisfactory level of
about 0.9% of average total assets over the projection period. The debt
service coverage is also expected to remain satisfactory, not falling below
1.2 times. Total assets are forecast to increase at an average annual
growth rate of around 24% and to reach W 6,900 billion ($11.9 billion) in
1983. A decline is expected in KDBIs current ratio from 1.8 to 1:1; the
long-term debt/equity ratio, which stood at 6.3:1 the end of 1979, is not
expected to exceed 8:2:1 until 1983, still within the contractual limit of
10:1 agreed with the Bank.

THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
Policy Statement
(Approved by Board of Directors on April 4, 1975)
Economic Role of KDB
1.        The KDB shall assist in the economic development of Korea in
conformity with its purpose as stated in the Korea Development Bank Act (KDB
Act) enacted December 30, 1953, as amended, its By-Laws enacted February 16,
1954, as amended, and the other regulations governing its operations.
Operations
2.        The KDB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and banking principles and practices. It shall endeavor to
specialize in extending capital funds to such industries as are designated
by the Government's economic plans or decrees as priority industries as well
as other major basic industries which form the substructure of the economy.
KDB may also make equity investments, provide working capital loans and
render managerial and technical assistance to its Borrowers when the need
arises. KDB will also extend guarantees on behalf of client enterprises.
KDB, however, will not compete with other financial institutions in lending
and administering industrial loans to assist major industries.
Project Selection
3.        It will finance enterprises which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation to be
viable. Following sound banking practices, the projects will be analyzed
taking the following factors into consideration before making a commitment
of financial assistance: (a) national economic benefits; (b) technical
feasibility; (c) financial soundness and profitability; (d) marketability;
and (e) quality of management.
Criteria for Selection of Borrowers
4.        In its operations, preference will be given to the following
major industries:
(a) Generation, transmission and supply of electricity;
(b) Coal-mining;
(c) Ship-building;

Appendix 2
Page 2
(d) Iron and steel manufacturing;
(e) Electronics;
(f) Export industries, designated by the Government to produce
export commodities;
(g) Import-substitution industries and industries producing raw
materials necessary for export and import-substitution;
(h) Indigenous industries and labor intensive industries; and
(i) Such other industries as may be designated by the Government's
economic plans or decrees as priority industries.
Qualifications for Eligible Borrowers
5.        Eligible borrowers for KDB financing must meet the following
qualifications:
(a) Borrowers must be financially sound;
(b) Borrowers must possess management and technical capacity for
implementing the projects being financed;
(c) Borrowers should not have defaulted on any of their outstanding
obligations to KDB.
Maximum Investment and Assistance
6.   (a)  KDB shall not subscribe to and/or underwrite stocks (including
investment certificates) if the paid-up amount of the stocks
so held by KDB will exceed KDB's own paid-up capital;
(b) KDB shall not normally make equity investments in any single
enterprise in excess of either:
(i) fifteen percent (15%) of the total unimpaired paid-up
capital, surplus, and free reserves of KDB; or
(ii) fifty percent (50%) of the paid-up capital of the enter-
prise.
(c) KDB shall not normally extend financial assistance (loan,
investments and guarantees) to any single enterprise which
exceed either of the following ceilings:
(i) twenty-five percent (25%) of KDB's total unimpaired
paid-up capital, surplus and free reserves;

Appendix 2
Page 3
(ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of the total assets of the
enterprise.
Foreign Exchange Risk
7.        As a general policy, KDB shall cover itself adequately against
foreign exchange risks in the conduct of its operations. However, in using
"revolving funds" generated in the case of some foreign borrowings, KDB may
assume the exchange risk temporarily. Also in using some funds provided
under the Industrial Rationalizaton Fund Scheme, KDB may be exposed to the
exchange risk. To cover the risk in the latter case, KDB will make
provision amounting to 1.5% of such funds outstanding from time to time.
Exchange losses exceeding the provision made by KDB, will be reimbursed by
the Government.
Security Arrangements
8.   (a)  In accordance with normal business practices, KDB will
obtain adequate security for its loans and guarantees. In
extending a loan to an enterprise, KDB shall require such
enterprise to provide security the value of which shall
be not less than 125% of the amount of the loan. In the
case of guarantees covered by a Government counter-
guarantee the value of security shall be not less than
the amount guaranteed, and in all other cases of guarantees,
shall be not less than 120% of the principal amount covered
under such guarantees.
(b) KDB may waive any of the foregoing requirements in cases
where the credit or the guarantee is extended in favor
of those enterprises enumerated in para. 2, Article 10 of
the Operating Manuals of KDB as of the date of this Policy
Statement, provided, however, that in such cases KDB will
endeavor to secure a guarantee or counter-guarantee from the
Government or from a suitable bank or banks to cover the
credit or guarantee granted.
Technical Assistance
9.        KDB will endeavor to provide its subborrowers with the necessary
technical services including assistance for upgrading production efficiency
and solving complicated technical difficulties. It will observe the
operation of its subborrowers and will, whenever necessary, promptly make
available to them constructive and remedial advice on the operation of the
project. When considered necessary, KDB will also dispatch its own staff
to the project companies.

to assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects, KDB
will maintain an effective organization and an adequate staff, including
financial and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy, marketing and
legal services.
Share-Holding Fund
11.       KDB shall administer the Share-holding Administration Fund (the
Fund) pursuant to the provisions of the KDB Share-holding Act (Act No. 2128,
enacted August 4, 1969) as a separate and distinct account in KDB's official
books, the Fund will be treated as segregated from the other transactions
and resources of KDB in accordance with the provisions of said Act.
Financial Policies

the KDB Act. It shall endeavor to match the maturity of its liabilities
with those of its assets. It will continually review the charges it levies
for the financial assistance it provides to ensure that it receives an
adequate "spread" to cover all its expenses including provisions for
doubtful loans and investments, and to enable it to build reserves as
required legally and as considered necessary by the management.

mestic currency loan accounts immediately after making a commitment.  Consequently do-
mestic currency commitments are equal to disbursements in all the years. The amounts
not drawn down by the sub-borrowers from their respective loan accounts are shown under
"Credit Control Account" - a current liability item.

ANNEX C: THE NATIONAL INVESTMENT FUND
Establishment of the National Investment Fund
1.        The National Investment Fund Law was enacted in late 1973 and the
National Investment Fund (NIF) commenced operations on January 1, 1974. The
purpose of the Fund is to channel a part of Korea's domestic savings into long
term financing of investment in priority sectors. Prior to the establishment
of the NIF there was little long-term domestic currency financing available
in Korea as commercial banks were averse to making term loans. Consequently,
business enterprises had either to rely on frequent roll-over of short-term
loans or to borrow long-term foreign currency resources domestically or
abroad. The NIF was set up to fill this obvious gap in the financial system
and has become the major source of domestic currency long-term funds in the
economy. As of end 1979, NIF funded term loans accounted for a very large
share (30.5%) of all outstanding equipment loansjl made by KDB and the DMBs
(Table 1).
Organization
2.        The annual financing and operations program of the NIF is determined
by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) although administrative matters are handled
by the Bank of Korea (BOK). Disbursement of NIF loans to qualifying borrowers
is administered by all banking institutions except the Citizens National Bank,
the Korea Housing Bank and the foreign commercial banks. The legal
administrator of the Fund is the National Investment Fund Management Committee
(NIFMC) which is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises several cabinet
members including the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the BOK, the
Governor of KDB and three representatives from the private sector. The NIFMC
establishes the operating criteria of the Fund, the annual financing and
operations program and approves its financial accounts.
Funding
3.        The NIF is funded through the issuance of National Investment Bonds.
The magnitude of annual sales of NIF bonds and the financial regulations
pertaining to the issuance of NIF bonds is determined by the MOF. The
ceiling on the total value of bonds issued annually is subject to the
approval of the National Assembly. The maximum interest rate payable on the
NIF bonds is equal to the interest rate payable on one-year time deposits
i.e. 24% since January 1980. NIF bonds are not sold to the general public.
/1 In domestic and foreign currency.

ANNEX C
Page 2
The major subscribers to NIF bonds are banking institutions, savings
associations and non-life insurance companies. By law, banking institutions
have to invest, on a monthly basis, a given percentage of the net increase
in their time and savings deposits in NIF bonds. When the NIF program
started banking institutions /1 were required to invest 20% of the net
increase in their deposits in NIF bonds. This percentage was later lowered
to 15% and currently stands at 13%. Nonlife insurance companies are
required to invest 50% of their net insurance premiums in NIF bonds. In
addition to the forced contribution of banking institutions, public funds
are also allocated to NIF. Banking institutions, savings associations and
nonlife insurance companies accounted for 59.0%, 13.4% and 5.5% respectively
of the 1979 increase in NIF funds (Table 2)./2 The remaining 22.1% came
from public funds./3 The comparable figures for 1978 were 65.9%, 8.6% and
7.8% respectively with public funds accounting for 17.7%.
Lending Rates
4.         In early 1980, NIF loans for general purposes /4 with a maturity
of up to three years carried an interest rate of 21% and loans with a
maturity of 3-8 years carried an interest rate of 22%. Comparable lending
rates for nonpriority borrowers were 24.5% and 25.5% respectively in the
case of equipment loans financed with resources other than NIF. The NIF
loans made by commercial banks could be rediscounted with NIF at rates of
19.5% for less than 3-year maturities and 20.5% for 3 to 8-year maturities.
Applicable rates for rediscounting of NIF loans by KDB were respectively
20.5% and 21.5%. The spread accruing to the commercial banks on NIF loans
was consequently 1.5% but was only 0.5% for KDB. The difference between the
11 Excluding the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation and the
Central Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives.
/2 Excluding repayments from previous NIF loans which are carried forward.
/3 Public funds comprises resources from government municipalities, Public
officers pension funds, Veterans Pension Fund and Export Insurance Fund.
/4  As opposed to loans for agriculture, exports and shipbuilding whose
lending rates are more heavily subsidized.

yield payable on NIF bonds (24%) and the rate at which the proceeds are
onlent to the financial institutions (19.5% to 21.5%) constitutes a negative
spread of 3-4%./l This interest rate differential represents, aside from
other administrative expenses, the cost to the Government of operating the
NIF program.
Institutional Allocation of NIF Funds
5.        NIF loans are channelled through the nationwide commercial banks,
the specialized banks /2, the local banks and KDB. As of December 31, 1979,
81.8% of NIF loans outstanding had been channeled through the specialized
banks and KDB /3, 16.0% through the commercial banks and 2.2% through the
local banks (Table 3). KDB was by far the most important lender of NIF
resources accounting for 65.9% of all NIF loans outstanding as of end 1979.
The Korea Export-Import Bank came next and accounted for 4.8% of NIF loans
outstanding. Tables 2 and 3 show that there is no one to one relationship
between the contribution of individual financial institutions to funding the
NIF and their allocation of NIF loans. In some instances, institutions
contributing to NIF are not permitted to allocate NIF funds as is the case
with the Citizens National Bank.
Sectoral Allocation of NIF Funds
6.        The allocation of NIF funds among broad economic sectors is deter-
mined by the MOF while the allocation of loans within sectors often at a
firm specific level is directed by the NIFMC. Some loans are preallocated in
terms of both specific borrower and amount while in other cases only the
borrower is designated. Total NIF loan allocations in 1980 are expected to
amount to W 538 billion. Of this amount, 72% (W 387 billion) have been
preallocated to specific borrowers with a predetermined loan amount while
10.6% (W 57 billion) have been preallocated to specific borrowers only. Con-
sequently, only 17.4% of all NIF loans in 1980 can be allocated at the full

represents a total annual subsidy of about $85 million which is financed
out of budgetary allocations.

Agricultural Cooperatives (4.4%), Small and Medium Industry Bank (2.9%),
Korea Exchange Bank (2.7%), and the Fisheries Cooperatives (1.1%).

discretion of the financial intermediaries. In the majority of cases, when
the borrower and amount has been predetermined the financing institution
does not carry out an independent project appraisal but mere_v operates as a
conduit for channeling NIF funds. Given the magnitudes involved, the allo-
cating mechanism employed is crucial to the success of the NIF program.
At present, relatively little is known about how specific borrowers are
identified and how the magnitude of individual loans is determined by the
NIFMC.
7.        In terms of sectoral allocation, heavy industries and power
accounted for 63% and 26% respectively of NIF loans outstanding as of end
1979. The remaining 11% went to finance exports by deferred payment (4.8%),
food production (4.2%), Saemaeul factories (1.4%) and fishing and mining
(0.6%). Heavy industries are clearly a major recipient of NIF funds. The
support provided to these industries by NIF takes many forms: NIF loans to
specific heavy industries can be made for financing factory construction and
for the production of capital goods; NIF loans can also be made to other
industries in order to finance the purchase of the same machinery.
Proposed Modifications of NIP
8.        There is no doubt that with NIF outstanding loans accounting for
as much as $2.5 billion or 30.5% of all equipment loans by DMBs and KDB at
end-1979 and with annual appropriations reaching over $1 billion in 1980,
the NIF Program has achieved a substantial transfer of resources to the
industrial sector. In fact, the very size of this subsidized lending
program which should normally be earmarked for priority activities seems
questionable. It is doubtful that as much as 30% of all industrial
investment really needs to be subsidized. Indications are that the
availability of subsidized financing has sometimes led to overinvestment in
certain branches of industry. At present NIF provides loans to various
sectors for a variety of purposes. On the one hand, NIF loans finance the
production of goods in priority sectors while other NIF loans are used to
finance the purchase of, conceivably, the same goods. In addition, a
significant proportion of NIF funds are preallocated and there appears to be
no clearly defined allocation criteria.   Priority sectors eligible for NIF
subsidized funding are too broadly defined and, as a consequence, NIF
lending accounts for too large a share of total term lending. For these
reasons, it is proposed that, over time, the scope and magnitude of NIF
lending be reduced so that the program be better focused in terms of both
the type of projects financed and the type of financing provided.
9.        A redefinition of priorities is needed with a view to reducing the
sectoral scope and magnitude of NIF lending and giving the program a better
focus. Having reduced the sectoral scope of NIF, it is also recommended
that the institutional scope be reduced. To this end, NIF funds should be
channeled through specialized banks and KDB only. An additional benefit of

ANNEX C
Page 5
this concentration of NIF lending would be to free the commercial banks of
NIF operations and of the attending government dictations. The commercial
banks would then be in a position to allocate their own funds on market
oriented criteria. The specialized banks and KDB would be in a better
position than commercial banks to allocate NIF funds as they already have
well developed project appraisal/supervision capabilities for term lending.
Resource allocation to individual projects is therefore likely to be more
efficient particularly if accompanied with a reduction in the extent of
government directed allocations at a firm specific level. In addition to
project appraisal, KDB which is the main handling bank for NIF should be
asked to undertake specific sector/subsector studies with a view to better
defining and restricting specific priority subsectors for NIF funding.
10.       The NIF program can be confined to KDB and the specialized banks
without reducing its present geographical reach. Although their branch
network is not as developed as that of the commercial banks, KDB and SMIB
together have a very wide branch network. KDB currently has 10 branch
offices with at least one KDB office in each of the provinces. SMIB has an
extensive and expanding branch network with well over 100 branches. Under
normal conditions, the larger NIF clients would go to KDB while small and
medium industries would apply to SMIB. If, however, a large client were
unable, for geographical reasons, to work with KDB directly then KDB might be
permitted to ask SMIB or another specialized bank to handle NIF funds on its
behalf. Alternatively, KDB might request a conveniently located commercial
bank to operate as a conduit for NIF funds. On a priori grounds, however,
such instances are likely to be limited.
11.       The "one bank" tradition in Korea provides an argument against
removing NIF operations from commercial banks. It seems however that the
main bank to which the client firm's collateral is pledged could issue a
guarantee to the institution from which NIF funds are being borrowed to cover
the amount of the NIF loan considered. Conceptually, this procedure would be
similar to the one currently adopted when a firm "graduates" from small to
large /1 and therefore has to change its source of finance from SMIB to KDB.
Further Study of NIF Program
12.       In order to help restructure the NIF program, some further informa-
tion is required on the existing program and on some key related issues.
Some areas of further study are mentioned below:
(a) asset size of NIF clients;
(b) number of loans/clients financed by the specialized banks, KDB,
and commercial banks and extent of clientele overlap;
/1 i.e. when employment reaches 300 employees and assets exceed W 500
million.

(c) regional spread of clients;
(d) level of arrears on NIF funded loans by commercial, specialized
banks and KDB;
(e) administrative costs of processing NIF loans by commercial,
specialized banks and KDB;
(f) processing time taken by the commercial banks, specialized banks
and KDB;
(g) maturity structure of NIF loans by commercial banks, specialized
banks and KDB;
(h) based on subsectoral priorities and comparative advantage of
Korean firms, need for and magnitude of the interest subsidy, if
any, that needs to be provided on NIF funds; and
(i) proportion of the net increase in time and saving deposits which
will have to be invested in NIF bonds by banking institutions
given the decision to reduce the magnitude of the program and
given the growing volume of funds generated by repayments of
earlier NIF loans.
13.       Detailed terms of reference of an NIF study would be discussed at
negotiations. The study could be undertaken jointly by KDB and other
government agencies concerned with the NIF program.
