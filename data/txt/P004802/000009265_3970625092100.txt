Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project
Environmental Assessment
Executive Summary
Introduction
I The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) of Thailand promulgated new clean
fuels standards in late 1992 to cope with severe poUution in Thailand. In order to meet
the new specifications, certain modifications in the Bangchak Petroleum refinery are
required. Bangchaks consultant completed optimum process redesign in March 1993.
The proposed Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project would provide the
additional refinery facilities required to meet Thailand's new clean fuel standards prior
to year 2000 in addition to upgrading safety and environmental operations.    The
project scope is to add an FCC unit for improving gasoline product quality, a deep gas
oil hydrodesuifirization unit for improving diesel product quality and associated
facilities including enviromnental controls.
2 New gasoline standards. The city of Bangkok currently experienced high pollusion
from automobiles; therefore a new specification for gasoline has been promulgated.
The specification will require reduction of aromatic content to 35% by volume.
Benzene content will be probably reduced further. Leaded gasoline will be eliminated
totally by the end of the 1990s.
3. New diesel fuel standards. The sulfur level of diesel must be reduced to 0.25% by
weight initially by 1996, and to 0.05% by weight by the year 2000. Since heavier
hydrocarbons do not burn as completely as lighter fractions, in order to reduce the
particulate emissions from diesel engines, the boiling range and specific gravity of diesel
will also be reduced.
Project Description and Analvsis of Alternatives
4. The Bangchak refinery is located in Bangkok, 25 km upstream from the Gulf of
Thailand on the east side of the Chao Phya river. The land is undeveloped on the other
side of the river. Along the northwest the refinery borders a Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT) terminal, and to the northeast lie some low density housing area. To
the east of the facilitiy there are army barracks. A plywood factory lie to the south of
the refinery.
5. The refinery consists of two hydroskimming plant called Plant No. 2 and Plant No. 3
of total capacity 105,000 barrels per calendar day. Crude oil is shipped to the refinery
via ship and railway. Products are shipped out of the refinery via tank truck, railway
and pipeline. There are five piers along the riverfront on the west side of the refinery
operated by Bangchak. A newly commissioned pipeline will transfer some of the



products to|a terminal in the north replacing heavy tank truck traffic. Products are also
transferred to PTT terminal adjacent to the refinery.
6. Bangchak completed a major restructuring project in May 1993. Revamping of
Plant No. 3 was completed in 1989. Plant No. 2 which was a renovated plant was
completed in May 1993. Under the project, the refinery facilities were rehabilitated and
mechanical reliability was restored to a level meant to exceed international safety
standards In addition, refinery operations were brought up to Thailand environmental
standards. Prior to the construction, environmental impact assessment of both projects
were prepared and submited to Thai government authorities for approval.
7. After NEPO promulgated the new clean fuel standards in 1992, Bangchak engaged
a consultant to identify the most economical and cost effective as well as
environmnentaly appropriate option to meet the clean fuels requirements.  The four
processing configuration were studied. Finally, FCC unit together with gas oil deep
hydrodesufrization unit was selected based on their superior economic and
environmental benefits.   Bangchak has then embarked on the Environmental
Improvement and Clean Fuels Project to install the facilities including vacuum gas oil
distillation unit, fuel gas treating unit, sulfur recovery unit, FCC unit, flue gas
desulfurization unit, gas oil deep hydrodesulfurization unit. .  The project would
include additional emissions and effluents control and treatment process equipment
required to handle additional loadings from the added refinery process equipment, as
well as upgrading current pollution control facilities.
Baseline Data
8. After the completion of restrucuring project in 1993, Bangchak has monitored
ambient air quality, water quality, workplace exposure, emissions and effluents
according to Thai regulations. The environment monitoring plan currently carnied by
Ban,chak is shown in Table 1.
9. Ambient air quality monitoring around the refinery area performed by the Pollution
Control Department indicates the level of SOx is in the range of .009-0.10 mg/cu.m.
which is lower than Thai standard at 0.3 mg/cu.m. Other parameters monitored
included carbon monoxide (CO), oxide of nitrogen (NOx), and particulates. One year
average monitoring data indicates that ambient air quality around the refinery area is
within Thailand standard limitations and World Bank guidelines.
10. Water qualitv and ecology of the Chao Pha river. The Chao Phya river flows
north to south past the refinery. The Thailand Environmental Board classified the
section of the Chao Phya river in the area of the Bangchak refinery (7-62 km. from the
river mouth) as class 4. Class 4 water is descnbed as water source used to receive
discharned water from various activities, usable for industrial and consumption purpose
subject to prior sterilization and special treatment, for the quality of water is below the
standard. Water quality monitoring carried by Bangchak indicates a high level of
sewage and possibly industrial pollution: coliform and fecal counts are comparable to
untreated sanitarv wastewaters, conductivity and chlorides are high, and dissolved
oxygen levels are below those which would support fish. There is little difference in
2



terms of pattem of pollution, between the stations upstream and downstream of the
refinery.
11. Performance of existing envirornmental control. Air emissions and wastewater
effluent monitoring indicates the existing refinery is currently operating within Thai
standards and World Bank guidelines.
12. Air emissions monitoring Emissions from the refinery stacks are monitored by
Bangchak- Parameters monitored include carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, oxides
of nitrogen, oxide of sulfur and particulates. One year's monitoring data indicates that
Bangchak is operating within Thailand emission standard limitations. Thailand air
emission standards set a limnit of 1,000 parts per million (ppm) on sulfur dioxide (SO27).
The standards are set by concentration only, and not by mass loading; however,
dispersion modeling were used in the permitting process. Bangchak refinery is
targeting 400 ppm as emission goal. Against a standard of 400 ppm, the emission
measured from the refinery sources is between 16-437 ppm.
13. Effluent monitoring. Sample analyses are conducted by Bangchak laboratory.
Samples are taken in the three guard basins once a week except in the dry season. The
guard basins are equipped with skimming weirs and are the points of discharge into
surface water. One year of effluent monitoring data indicates the Bangchak facility is
currently meeting effluent standards.
14. Occupational Exposure monitorin2. Workplace exposure monitoring was carried
out for carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur. particulates,
organic lead and 1,-1,1-TCE. Identified workplace areas are monitored for noise levels
and heat. Staff with potential exposure to lead are tested for blood and urine lead
levels. Complete physicals are given once each year, including hearing and respiratory
system checks.
Environmental Impacts and Mitigation
15. A summary of the existing refinery and Clean Fuels Project ennronmen:al impacts
and mitigation plan is shown in Table 2.
16. Air emissions control. The new units will have emissions control equipment and
facilities such as flue gas desulfurization unit, electrostatic precipitator for FCC unit,
sulfur recovery unit, tail gas treating unit. , designed to meet both Thailand and World
Bank standards. The Thailand emissions standard for S02 of 400 ppm would be used
as process design criteria. The World Bank emissions standard for SPM of 100
mglcu.m. would be used for design criteria of the ESP unit for FCC unit. In addition,
Bangehak has been using combination of sweetened fuel gas (90% of total usage) and
low sulfur(0.5% by weight) fuel oil (10% of total usage). The S02 emission from
these sources are low.   Dispersion modeling for the existing refinery was performed
in the Envirornental Impacts Assessment report of the restructuring project. The
results indicated that the highest average concentration of S02 in one year period
based on SO2 loading of 6.4 tons per day was 13.23 microgram/cu.m which was
3



below Thailand standard of 100 rnicrograx/cu.m. and the World Bank standard of 50
microgram/cu.m.
17. New dispersion modeling of the refinery after installation of the new units will be
performed as design parameters of the new project units are finalized. The dispersion
modeling report for the Clean Fuels Project will be sent to the World Bank for review
by August 15, 1994. It is preliminary estimated that SO2 loading of the future refinery
will be about 5.9 tons per day which is lower than the World Bank criteria of 500 tons
per day.
18. Water quality.  The flow of the existing refinery wastewater effluent is about
0.05 cubic meter per second compared to the flow of the Chao Phya river which varies
between 500 and 1000 cubic meter per second. The refinery is currently operating
within Thailand effluents standard limitations. All new wastewater treatment system to
be added along with the additional refinery units in the Clean Fuels Project will be
designed to exceed current Thailand standards for effluents. In addition, wastewater
from the guard basin receiving the effluent flow will be partially recycled within the
refinery. Given these factors, the impacts of the refinery effluent are considered to be
the minimal, and ecologically insignificant
19. Planned exMansion to the Wastewater Treatment System. The planned expansion
would include oily surface water drains from the new units, and an additional oily storm
water pond. Bangohak plans to install another dissolved air floatation unit. Another
activated sludge system is planned which would operate in parallel or series with the
current system and a sand filter will also be installed before the guard basin for total
suspended solids remnoval. The second activated sludge system would be added in
order to target phenol as well. Phenol is not currently a problem in the refinery's
effluent. However, the additional crackdng unit would increase phenol concentrations
in the effluent. The target phenol concentration in the effluent would be 1 milligram
per liter.
20. Impacts on land use. Since the Clean Fuels Project will be implemented in the
existing refinery area and there is no expansion of land use, the project will not affect
the community land use area
21. Impacts on transporation. After the completion of the Clean Fuels Project, there
wil be a net increase of 0.7% of products from the refinery. Considered that the
products will be partially transferred by the new pipeline connected to Bangchak
terminal in the north, the transporation of products will be decreasing and this will not
much affect transporation.
22. Impacts on community Surveys and interviews conducted on governmental
officials and communities around the refinery were done for the restructuring project in
1991.  The survey showed that about 63.4 per cent of the population agreed that
Bangchak expand the capacity of the refinery while 25.8 per cent did not agree and
10.8 per cent had no idea. The survey also showed that 8% of the total population in
the area was disturbed by smell of oil, 28.6%Me of the population was concemed with
accident which might occur from the refinery. In the survey, it was suggested that the
refinery should plan its transporafion period so that it would not cause trafEc jam, the
it



refinery should check its loading and unloading equipment regularly to prevent any
accident.
23  Occupational Health and safety    From the survey study related to public
occupational health, it was indicated that this issue has been taken care by Bangchak,
by public hospitals, by private health centers, etc awid this will not affected by the
project.
Industrial Hazard
24. Risk assessment. A risk assessment was performed for the Bangchak refinery
before the emergency plan was made. Another risk assessment would have to be
completed before plant expansion. A consultant will be contracted to perforn the
assessment.   The new units will be designed to include control and safety system
similar to the existing plants to prevent any hazard, fire or explosion. Safeguarding
systems for process facilities especially FCC and Gas Oil HDS unit will be designed to
ensure that the integrity of the facilities is maintained.
Environmental Management and Traiging
25. Bangchak established an Occupational Health, Environment and Safety Commitee
to establish corporate policy with respect to occupational health, enviromnent and
safety. Safety team was also set up to review safety conditions in the refinery in
addition to functional group of safety in Bangchak organization. All works in the
refinery are subject to prior approval and checldng of flammable gas or vapor around
the working area Alarm and plant control system are connected to the centrol control
room where any unit can be shutdown in case of emergency. Emergency plan, spill
prevention control and countermeasure plan has been prepared for use in case of
emergency or accident in addition to operating procedures prepared according to
international standards. Bangchak- has fire suppression systems designed according to
international standards such as NFPA.    Bangcbak also cooperates with other oil
companies in an organization to control spill. Training of operators with respect to
operations of the plant and safety are regularly conducted.

Policy and Legal Frame Work
1.1  Overview
The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) of Thailand promulgated new clean fuels
standards in late 1992 to cope with severe environmental problem resulting from
increasing economic growth. Specifications of gasoline and diesel will be changed to
mitigate the adverse impacts on enviromnent. Time frame for changes of product
specifications is shown in Table 1.1. In order to meet the new fuel specifications, certain
process modifications in the Bangchak refinery are required. Bangchak's consultants
completed process identification and optimization study together with a conceptual
design with unit capacities in March, 1993. Bangchak has embarked on Environmental
Improvement and Clean Fuels Project in order to install additional process units to
improve product qualities to meet expected standards before the year 2000. The
project scope is to add an FCC unit to facilitate the production of gasoline of the
required specification, a deep gas oil HDS unit to comply with the diesel specifications
and associated facilities including environmental controls.
New gasoline standards: The city of Bangkok currently experiences high pollution from
automobiles; therefore a new specification for gasoline has been promulgated. The
specification will require reduction of aromatic content to 35% by volume. Benzene
content will be probably reduced further. Thailand refineries are now required to
eliminate lead (0.013 mgliter) totally by the end of the 1990s.
New diesel fuel standards: The sulfur level of diesel must be reduced to 0.25 wt.
percent initialy by 1996, and to 0.05 wt. percent by the year 2000. Since heavier hydro-
carbons do not bum as completely as lighter fractions, in order to reduce the particulate
emissions from diesel engines, the boiling range and specific gravity of diesel will also
be reduced.
1.2  Preparation of Environment Impact Assessments and Mitigation Plans
Thailand regulations require Bangcbak to perform an environmental assessment (EA)
for the facilities to be added to the refinery. In order to obtain govermment approval, it
has to be established that emissions from the new as well as existing facilities will not
result in an increase in ambient concentrations of pollutants beyond levels set by the
appropnate Fnviromnental agencies and also that emissions will not exceed established
permissible levels.
Emission standards are regulated by Ministry of Industry. Prevailing standards are
shown in Table 1.2 - 1.4. Ambient air standards regulated by Pollution Control Depart-
ment, Ministry of Science, Technology and Energy is shown in Table 1.3. Industrial
effluents standards is shown in Table 1.4.

Proiect Desisg ODtimization and Description
2.1  Introduction
The Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project (ICP) has as its objective to
provide the equipment and processing facilities needed to meet the Royal Thai govern-
ment's clean fuel specifications. The EICP follows the just completed refinery restruc-
turing project, which included major modifications to the refinery, including expansion
of refinery capacity from 65,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd) to 105,000 bpcd. A
complete Environmental Impact Assessment was done for the refinery restructuring
project in 1992. The EA for the proposed EICP is an extension of the work done for
the restructuring project. This EA is based on design work done up to now on the EICP
and will be reviewed and revised as appropriate when the detailed design work is
completed.
2.2  Analvsis of Alternatives and Design Optimization
The clean fuel specifications mandated by the Royal Thai Government (RTG) will have
wide-ranging impact on the refinery's products. The primary specification changes
involve elimination of lead and reduction of aromatics and benzene levels in gasoline
and reduction of sulfur and boiling range of diesel oil. Bangchak engaged Chiyoda
Corporation to identify the most economic and cost-effective as well as environmentally
appropriate option to meet the clean fuels require-ments. The four processing,configu-
rations were considered:
(i)  Deep gas oil hydrotreating, which reduces the sulfur content of diesel oil from
1.00 wt % to 0.05 wt %;
(ii)  a hydrocracker, which would convert low value vacuum gas oil to primarily
premium quality high value diesel oil with neglegible sulfur (c 2 ppm), with a
deep gas oil hydrotreater to reduce the sulfur content of straight-run gas oil;
(iii) a fluid catalytic cracker (FCC), which would convert low value vacuum gas oil to
high quality gasoline, and some middle distillates and LPG together with a deep
gas oil hydrotreater; and
(iv) a reduced crude catalytic cracker (RCC), which could convert residual fuel oil to
products similar to that from a FCC but of lower yield and quality, together with a
deep gas oil hydrotreater.
2.3  Except for the FCC and RCC options, the other two require the import of FCC quality,
high octane, low aromatics and benzene gasoline, which are virtually unavailable on a
long term basis in large quantities. The RCC has an inherent deficiency - it would
produce about 5 tons per day (tpd) of spent catalyst compared to 1 tpd from the FCC.
Hence the final comparison was confined to the Deep Gas Oil Hydrotreater (DIGHT),
the Hydrocracker with a DGHT and FCC with a DGHT. Tables 2.1 to 2.3 which follow
indicate the relative merits of the three options. Based on this comparison the FCC
with the DGHT was selected, both for their superior economic and environmental
benefits.

Proiect Description
2.4  The proposed Environmental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project (EICP) would
provide the additional refinery facilities required to meet Thailand's new clean fuels
standards, in addition to upgrading safety and environmental operations in order to
meet expected standards into the year 2000. The Bangchak refinery is located in
Bangkok, along the Chaophraya river. The land is undeveloped on the opposite bank.
Along the northwest the refinery borders Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
products terminal, and to the northeast lie some low density housing areas. To the east
of the facility there are arrny barracks. Industrial facilities lie to the south of the refinery,
(see site location map, figure 1).
2.5  Crude oil is shipped to the facility via ship and railway. Product is shipped out of the
refinery via tank truck, railway and pipeline. The railway loading racks and piers are
located along the west side of the facility, and the truck loading racks are located in the
southwest corner. There are five piers along the riverfront on the west aide of the
facility operated by Bangchak. A newly commissioned pipeline will transport some of
the product out of the facility, replacing the heavy tank truck traffic. The existing
pipelines will continue to deliver products to the PTT terminal adjacent and rorth of the
Bangchak Refinery.
2.6  The existing refinery comprise the fbllowing:
1 x 40 kbd     crude distillation unit
1 x 80 kbd     crude distillation unit
2 x 7 kbd      catalytic naphtha reforming units
1 x 18 kbd     gas oil hydro-desulfurization unit
I x3 kbd       LPG merox unit
1 x 10 kbd     Kerosene merox unit
Associated off-site and utilities
91 Bulk storage tanks for crude oil and products
3 LPG spheres
6 LPG Bullets
2.7  The proposed project will include the following principal process facsl::ies
I x 16,000 bpsd    FCC
I x 24,300 bpsd    DGHU
Fuel gas desulfurization unit
Sulfur recovery unit
Waste water and other effluent treating facilities.
2.8  A.block flow schematic showing unit capacities and production at design capacity are
given in figure 2; charge and products are presented in Table 2.4 for the overall refinery
(including new facilities) and finished products specifications are given in Table 2.5.
Material balances are also provided for the following:
- Vacuum distillation unit (VDU)           (Table 2.7)
- Fluid catalvtic cracking (FCC) unit      (Table 2.8)
- Flue gas desulfurization section in FCC unit  (Table 2.9)
- Gas oil deep HDS unit                    (Table 2.1 0)

- Existing gas oil HDS unit              (Table 2.11)
throughput and capacities are shown in Table 2.5 and products quality in Table 2.6.
2.9  Utility consumption is summarized in Table 2.12. Refinery energy requirements are
supplied by three types of fuels; refinery light hydrocarbon gas, residual fuel oil and a
mix of the two liquid and mixed fuels. Mixed fuels are in the following mixng ratio
based on their heat.
Mixing ratio

2.10 Overall Utlity Balance for the Refinery: Utility balance including corsumption and
production in process, uaility, offsite and miscellaneous facilities is presented in Table
2.14. Capacity of utility facility is given in Table 2.15.
2.11 CaRacitv of New Utilitv Facilitv
Additional electric power demand is only 0.7 MW. A Gas turbine generator is
proposed to be installed at 5 MW rated to satisfy the demand and reduce electric power
import. The fired boiler operates only to generate steam for process usage. A 580
Nm/lhr air compressor system is provided.
2.12 Bulk Products Movements
Bangchak imports the majority of its crude oil from the Middle and Far East to Sriracha
on the eastem coast in large tanklers and then transferred to the refinery by 3,000-7,000
DWT barges. About 6.5 tripspby barge are required. This is well within the capacity of
the wharf

Base Line Data
3.1 PROJECT LOCATION
This project is located at 210 Sukhumvit 64, Bangchak, Phrakanong District, Bangkok,
(Figure 3-1). The total area of the refinery covers 480 rai, of which 462 rai will be appor-
tioned to the refinery and 18 rai to wharf. The refinery borders the following sites:
Northern end : Bangchak canal and Petroleum Authoriry of Thailand's oil tenrinal
Southern end : Bang Oh canal and the Thai's plywood factory
Westem end  : the military's compound, Soi Sukhumvit 64 and Express way
Eastern end   Chao Praya River
3.2 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES
3.2.1 Meteorological Conditions
(A) General Meteorological Conditions
Being located in Bangkok City, the project enjoys the central-region tropical rainy climate.
South-western monsoons blow accross the Kingdom from February to September (a total of
eight months). From October to January, the country is affected by monsoons from the
northeast (a total of four months). The central-region of Thailand is influenced by three distinct
seasons. The summer starts from mid February, ending in the middle of May. From mid May
until half the month of October is the time for the rainy season after which comes the cool
season. Considering that the project is located very close to Bangna air-monitoring station, it
thus uses the data, for a thirty year-period (1959-1988), gathered by the Climatology Division,
The Meteorological Department and distributed from that particular station.
From this study, data could be summarized as indicated in Table 3-1.
 The highest average temperature was 35 C. The lowest temperature averaged at 21C. The
year-round temperature had an average of 28.4C.
*  The degree of rain fall peaked in September (345.6mm). January had the lowest amount of
rain (8.0 mm). The year-round average rain fall was 1498.7 mm.
Looking at wind direction and windspeed, southern winds blew accross Thailand from
February until May which was during the south-western monsoon season. Between the
month of June and September, the country received most winds from southwest. A
frequent north-eastem and eastern wind occurred mostly in January during the time of the
north-eastern monsoon season. In each month, windspeed averaged from 1-4.9 notches.
The windrose diagram (Figure 3-2) at the Bangkok air-monitoring station indicates that in
March, the wind was the most calm (18%/6). October was the month in which the wind was
the least calm (44%).
(B) Meteorological Conditions. A Variable in the Dispersion of Polluted Air
Detailed and accurate meteorological data are necessary when calculating the dispersion of air
pollution: the average of wind direction and windspeed during each hour, atmospheric stability,
the temperature and polluted air mixing height.

located within the project site or in the area closest to the project site. In this case, Bangna
station and Donmuang station would be two fuindamnental sites. On the other hand, the
calculation using a mathematical model has employed surface data collected from the Bangkok
station in 1990. The latest data disseminated from Meteorologocal Department Radiosonde
data were also collected from the Bangkok air-monitoring station.
3.22 CarrentAir Qality
The objective of conducting a study on air quality presently is to determiine the level of air
quality during the time which the refineries are in operation: producing oil at 68,000 barrels per
day. Data have been continuously collected from the observations of air quality since 1989.
Both ambient air quality and air quality at the funnels are being monitored. Table 3-2 illustrate
the index used and the frequency of the measuring process. Table 3-3 shows the method
employed in collecting data and the analyzing procedure. The results of each and every
measurement have been compared and displayed in Tables 34 and 3-5. The following could be
concluded:
(1) Air Quality in Ambient
The production process in use today consists of process heaters and boilers. From the first
stage of evaluation, pollutants could be emitted into the atmosphere within the range of 1-2
kilometeres during normal conditions. Under windy conditions, pollutatns could be dispressed
into the atmosphere as far as 5 kilometers. Seasonal wind direction plays an important role
when chosing the sampling location: the north-eastern monsoon, South-western monsoon and
the south wind. The slightly populated conununity and several schools with approximately a
little over 1000 students situated in the areas directly surrounding the refinerv have the highest
risk of being affected by the pollutants. Therefore, the following four sampling location have
been designated as the major locations used to measure air quality:
Site Al - Somthavin School
Site A2 - Wat Bangna Nok School
Site A3 - Ban Ubakekha Detention Center
Site A4 - Pipattana School
These sites are situated above and below wind direction based on the different s
*  Al and A4 would be above the wind direction during the months of No; ember and
January. Between April and July, these two sites would be under the * ind d:. e: :on
A2" and A3 would be above the wind direction in April and JulY They would bc below the
wind direction November and January.
Air Quality Index
Pollutants which are being monitored and measured according to the regulations made by the
Office of National Environment Board (ONEB) are: total suspended particulate (TSP), sulfur
dioxide (S02) and nitrogenoxide (NO2).
Measuring Results
Air quality which has been monitored and measured in all four sites since April of 1993 in five
periods (Table 3-4). The results could be concluded as follows:

Ubakekha Detention Center (averaging at 0.379 mg/m3) and A2-Bangna Nok School (average
in at 0.219 mg/m3). The highest level of TSP was recorded in July of 1993. The average was
0.563 mg/m3. In general, the level of TSP measured at sites located above the wind direction
is lower than that measured at sites situated below the wind direction.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2): Every samples taken for sulfur dioxide in all four sampling loca-tions is
below air quality standard requlated by ONEB (the standard was set at 0.300 mgf m3). The
highest level of S02 was found at site Al-Somthavin School (averaging at 0.047 mg/m3).
Nitrogendioxide (NO2): Environmental impact assessment (EIA) conducted previously at each
site indicates that the level of N02 in ambient is lower than the regulated standard and more
over, the record did not seem to significantly change over time. NO2 was measured to be at its
highest level in January and lowest in April of both years.
(2) Air Quality at Chimneys
Presently, the refinery has five main stacks namely:
* TPU which is 56 meters high, has a diamneter of 2.5 meters and a flow of air at the rate of
47,800 Nm3/h.
*  CRU which is 26.9 meters high, has a diameter of 1.0 meters and a flow of air at the rate
of 18,900 Nm3/h.
*  Boiler which is 50 meters high, has a diameter of 2.5 meters and a flow of air at the rate of
10,980 Nm3/h.
*  Comnmon stack which is 70 meters high, has a diameter of 4.8 meters and a flue gas flow
rate of 259,668 m3/h.
*  Gas Oil hydrotreating unit which is 23.5 meters high, has a diameter of 10.4 meters and a
flue gas flow rate of 19,080 m3/h.
Table 3-5 shows the results of air quality measured at stacks of which the following could be
concluded:
* TSP: The level of TSP emitted from TPU CRU and Boiler is much lower than the
standard permitted by the Ministry of Industry. Similarly, the level of TSP emitted from
GO-HDT and common stack which has been measured since November 1993 is lower
than standard. Today, the level of TSP emitted from all stacks (except common stack)
significantly decreases from previous years.
*  SO2: The level of S02 measured at stacks was reported to be lower than the standard set
by the Ministry of Industry. The most recent measurement indicates that the level of SO0
emitted into ambient has decreased tremendously, particularly S02 emitted from Boiler
and common stack.
  N02: The level of NO2 measured at stacks was also reported to be lower than the
standard set by the Department of Industrial. The latest result measured in April 1993
displays that the amount of NO, emitted from the stacks was only 2.4-1.6 mg/m3 (the
standard was set at 470 mg/m3)_
*  CO: Similar to TSP, SO2 and NO2, the level of CO emitted into ambient is very
insignificant, particularly when compared to current standard level (1,000 mg/m3).

In conclusion, the level of pollutants namely TSP, S02, N02, CO and HES emitted from the
refinery's stacks: TPU, Boiler, CRU, GO-HDT and common stack is much lower taan the
standard.
3.2.3 'he Hydrology of the Chao Phraya River
The section of the Chao Phraya River that runs through the project area is said to be in the
lower part of the river, which starts from Chainat Province and runs southwards through the
Province of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Nonthaburi and Bangkok into the Gulf of Thailand in
the area of Muang District, Samut Prakan Province, the length of which part is approximately
241 kilometers.
The estuary area would be influenced by the tides of the sea, especially in January to May,
which would give rise to the pressure of the sea water into the river for a long distance, and in
order to prevent the invasion of the brine, water must be discharged from Bhumiphol Dam in
the upper part of the Chao Phraya River basin zone at a rate exceeding 75 cubic meters/
second, which would keep the depth of the river at such a level that permits navigation. So the
flowing of the current in the Chao Phraya River would be controlled by Bhumibhol Dam and
Chao Phraya Dam. From the data showing the rate of the flow of water between 1985 - 1988,
provided by the Water Quality Subdiv .. nL, Environmental Quality Standards Division, office
of the National Environment Board, it is found that the lowest flow rate is in the period of
April to June, which is approximately 50 cubic meters/second, and in the period of August to
December which is the period of prevailing rainfall, the flow rate would rise, the highest rate
being approximately 4,000 cubic meters/second, and on average the normal flow rate of the
Chao Phraya River is approximately 1,000 cubic meters/second.
When the character of the section of the Chao Phraya River that runs through the project area
is considered, it is found that its character is that of a bend of a river. Added by the alterations
of the flow of water, it works favorably in ermns of the economics of navigation in that there is
no need to dredge or maintain the water channel for navigation purposes in this area. This is
why the water level in the area of Bangchak Wharf has a sufficient depth for navigation
throughout the year; and from a water-depth-sounding survey by the Ports Authority of
Thailand in 1986, which also covered the area in front of the wharf of Bangchak Company as
shown in Figure 3-3, which shows the character of a river bed with a depth contour of 10
meters from the lowest ebb-tide level in the parrallel direction and close to the landing line of
WTharf No. 2 (Wharf 1 SD), the width of the water channel for a depth contour of 10 meters is
approximately 150 meters The landing area of Wharf No. 3 provides the character of a basin
about 14 meters deep from the lowest ebb-tide level, and with an average area of 25 x 280
meters, which is usable as a basin for turning back vessels. In addition to this, the river bed
area continuing from Wharf No. 3 to Wharf No. 6 (Wharf 1SA) is a deep water channel about
25.50 meters wide and 13 meters deep from the lowest ebb-tide level. Such character gives
rise to local erosion due to the influence of the current near the river bend, which would
usually lead to the erosion of the bankl of the inwardly curved portion of the river bend.
3.2.4 The Quantity of Deposits in tle Chao Phraya River
Almost all of the deposits in the lower part of the Chao Phraya River are from the water
receiving areas of the upper part, while those deposits generating from the river banks or
mixing with waste water from industrial works are in a small quantity. The deposits in the

river are in the fbrm of suspending sediments, consisting of silt, clay and colloidal particles, and
some sand deposits may be found in the estuary area. In a year cycle a quantity of
approximately 4.7 million tons/year of deposits are carried along frr:m the north. The major
part of the deposits, approximately 4.5 mnillion tons, are carried along during the rainy season
between August and October, while in the dry season only 0.2 million tons of deposits are
carried along. Of the total quantity of deposits, about 0.5 million tons would settle between
the mouth of the Chao Phraya River and Km. 52 from the river mouth, and about 0.7 million
tons of deposits would settle in the portion between Km. 52 and Km. 112.
As for the density of deposits, it is found that during the dry season the density of deposits
averaged throughout the depth of water varies between 178 per million at Km. 52 and ?49 per
million at the month of the Chao Phraya River, while in the rainy season the density of deposits
in the said portion of the river does not vary significantly, i.e. having a value between 327 and
336 per million.
3-2.5  The Quality of Water ofthe Chao Phraya River
The quality of the water of the lower part of the Chao Phraya River would depend mainly on
the manner of land use in the area of the Chao Phraya River basin, which may be devided into
different zones according to utilization as follows:
(1) The Agricultural Zone
Covers the areas of four provinces, namely Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Pathum Thani,
Nonthaburi and Bangkok Metropolis; various wastes discharged into the river generate from
housing and farming in large part.
(2) The Community Zone
Is the area of Km. 40 from the river month to Km. 60. The Rama VI Bridge area is an area in
Bangkok that is densely populated; there are small-scale industrial works in lare part. Almost
all of the waste waters from these communities and industries would be discharged into the
Chao Phraya River through various canals.
(3) The Industrial Zone
Is the area of Km. 40 from the river mouth downwards, e.g. the areas of Ratburana District,
Phra Pradaeng District, Muang District, Samut Prakan Province. Industrial works in this zone
are numerous and large, and so the quantities of water discharged into the Chao Phraya River
are significant.
As a result of the said maimer of land use, the index of quality of the river varies with the
distance from the oriainating source of pollution to the river mouth, and from the conduct of
an "inspection of the quality of water throughout a distance of about 380 Kilometers of the
Chao Phraya River by the Office of the National Environment Board in 1988, it was found that
the lower part of the Chao Phraya River from the river mouth in Samut Prakan Province up to
Nonthaburi Province had an oxygen dissolution level lower than 2 milli-gram per liter, which
was lower than the prescribed minimum standard of 2 milligram per liter. Particularly in the
portion from the Memorial Bridge to Bangkok Port, which is the critical spot of the quality of
the water of the Chao Phraya River, th eoxygen dissolution level was very low, i.e. lower than
I milligram per lier; while the portion of the lower part of the Chao Phraya River from
Nonthaburi Province up to Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, which was designated as a
3-14



water source of the third category, and the portion of the upper part of the Chao Phraya River
from Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province up to Nakhon Sawan Province, which was
designated as a water source of the second category, were found to have oxygen solution level
lower than the standards of the two categories of water sources prescribed at not lower than 4
and 6 milligrams per liter respectively.
The level of contamination in the form of BOD had a rising trend every year in the portion
from the river mouth up to Nonthaburi Province, a level not exceeding 4 milligrams per liter,
while in the portion of the lower part of the Chao Phraya River from Nonthaburi Province up
to Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province up to Nakhon Sawan Province the BOD level was
within the standard.
As regards the quantity of coliform bacteria, it was found that there was also a rising trend.
Particularly in the lower part of the Chao Phraya River from the river mouth up to Nonthaburi
Province there was a quantity of coliform bacteria higher than 50,000 MPN  per 100 milliliter,
while in the upper part of the Chao Phraya River from Nonthaburi Province up to Nakhon
Sawan Province there was a quantity of coliform bacteria from 2,900 - 20,0007PN per 100
milliliter. However, it was found that in the upper part of the Chao Phraya River, the quality
of which was regarded as being at a positive level, in 1985 - 1988 there was a quantity of
coliform bacteria higher than the prescribed maximum standard of 5,000 MPN per 100
milliliter.
As for the quantities of heavy metals, e.g. mercury, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, chromium
and toxic substances like cyanide in the whole of the Chao Phraya River, it was found that they
were within the standard, while compounds of the organochlorine catego-ries of insecticides
were found to exist in a very small quantity and not to be dangerous to lives in the water.
The results of the analyses of the quality of water on the average in the Chao Phraya River
from 1981 - 1988 are shown in Table 3-6, with changes in the quantity of oxygen dissolved in
water and changes in the BOD quantity of the Chao Phraya River from 1935 - 1988 being
shown in Figures 3-4 and 3-5.
3.26  Water Qualit Anaysis in the Chao Phraya River and in Guard Basins
The quaIity of water of the Chao Phraya River in the project area which is at of Kms. 23 - 25
from the river mouth is classified to be in the industrial zone and standard of water of the
fourth category. From the.regular checking of the quality of water of the Chao Phraya River in
the project area by Bangchak Petroleum Public Co., Ltd., with such sample collection spots as
shown in Figure 3-6, i.e. the collection spot No. 1 in the area of the mouth of Bangchak canal,
which is an upstream of the project area; the collection spot No. 2 beside the project area; the
coRlection spot No 3 in the area of the mouth of Bang-oh canal; the collection spot No. 4 in
the area in front of Thai Plywood Factory, which is downstream of the project area. The
analysis of Chao Phraya River water and refinery wastewater in the past one year are
illustrated in Table 3-7 and Table 3-8 respectively. The following conclusions was made:
(1) Oil and Grease (FOG)
While the concentration of oil and grease in treated wastewater has values ranging bet-ween
0.6-10.0 mg/litre, the concentration of oil and grease in Bang Oh canal and in Bang-chak canal
has values which ranges from 0.5-2.8 and 1.0-2.6 respectively. The concentra-tion of oil and
grease in the Chao Phraya River has values ranging from 0.6 - 2.8 mg/litre.

(2) Suspended Solid (SS)
While treated wastewater emitted from the refinery has suspended solid dissolved in the
amount of 8-34 mg/litres, suspended solid measured in Bangchak canal and in Bang Oh canal
has values ranging from 15-270 and 14-315 mg/ltre respectively. Part of the Chao Phraya
River which flows through the refinery has suspended solid with a value of 14-285 mg/itre.
(3) Total Disolved Solid (TDS)
While the total disolved solid in treated waste water emitted from the refinery has values
ranging between 634-4,776 mg/litre, that in Bangchak and Bang Oh canals has values of 394-
10,528 and 392-11,024 mg/litre respectively. The total disolved solid in the Chao Phraya River
is in the range 392-11,024 mg/litre. It is interesting to observe that the amount of the total
disolved solid measured during the month of April 1993 has the highest value.
(4) BOD5
While BOD5 in treated wastewater has a value of 3-10 mg/litre, BODS measured in Bangchak
and Bang Oh canals has values between 6.8-21 mg/litre and 5.2-15.6 mg/litre respectively.
BOD5 in the Chao Phraya River clostest to the project has a BOD5 of 6.8-19.0 mg/litre..
(5) Lead
While the amount of lead measured in treated wastewater has a value of 0.001-0.020 mgditre,
the amount of lead found in Bangchak and Bang Oh canal, as well as in the Chao Phraya River
has values between 0.010-0.052 mg'iitre, 0.006-0.051 mg/litre and 0.009- 0.048 mg/litre
respectively.
This analysis shows that wastewater which has been treated and drained into the Chao Phraya
River has various quality indexes very similar to water quality in the Chao Phraya River.
Obviously, treated wastewater does not have a serious impact on the quality of water in the
Chao Phraya River.
3.3 ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Major bio-environmental resources in this project study are the eco-system in the Chao Phraya
River, but since in the current situation the Chao Phraya River has been faced with the problem
of water pollution due to the discharge of wastes into the river, the quality of the water of the
Chao Phraya River worsens: Particularly in the period of months in which the flowing rate of
the water is low, the severity of water pollutants would be significant, and from the quality
classification of water services in the Chao Phraya River by the Office of the National
Environment Board, the water source in the area of Kms. 7-62 from the mouth of the Chao
Phraya River is classified to be a water source of the fourth category, which is a water source
used to receive discharged water from various activities, usable for industrial and consumption
purposes subject to prior sterilization and special treatment, for the quality of water is below
the standard. Such quality of water will certainly affect the sustenace of animated beings in the
water source. So in the water source of this area no major eco-system of aquatic animals is
found existing.
This study will deal with plankton and cash fishes in the Chao Phraya River which may be
expected to be directly affected by the project in the event of any leak-ages of oil into the river
by means of data from organizations having conducted studies in the most recent year.



Plankton
From the collection of plankton samples in the Chao Phraya River by Southea.t Asia
Technology Co., Ltd., the Environmental Specialist Firm in April 1986 for supplementinig to a
study of the environmental impact of Bangchak rehabilitation project and by the wharfs in June
1988, which collected plankton samples at five spots in the Chao Phraya River, namely stLtions
1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 from the head end of the tide at the Port Authority of Thailand to the area of
the tail end of the tide at the Naval Ordnance Department, and collected samples in the areas cf
Khlong Bangchak and Khlong Bang-oh at Station 3 and 5 respectively, the study results in
detail are shown in Annex 2, which contains a report on the discovery of plant planktons and
animal planktons of various kinds, in summary as follows:
- Plankton in the Chao Phraya River in the vicinity of the project area there are 22-26
families, of which those in the diatomaceous group (Phylum Chrysophyta) were found in the
largest quantity, with a factor of abundance of 67-79%. The family found to be highly
abundant was melosira; the plant plankton group second in abundance was Phylum
Chlorophyta. The level of abundance of plant planktons in the Chao Phraya River in the
Vicinity of the project area averaged 6.3 x 106 - 15. 1 x 106 cells/cubic meter.
- Animal planktons : 3-11 families were found, with a highly varying factor of abun-dance.
No plankton of any kind was found at every sample collection spot. The level of abundance
of animal planktons was between 19 x 103 - 77 x 103 cells per cubic meter.
Cash Aquatic Animals
Rachadabhorn and company from the National Institute of Freshwater Fisheries carried out a
study of the number of kinds and the quantity of fish in the Chao Phraya River from the area of
Pakkred District, Nonthaburi Province, down to the river mouth in Samut Prakan Province
during the period of February to December 1990. They found that the majority of cash aquatic
animals belonged in the fish group, consisting of 36 kinds (Table 3-9). The estimated total
quantity of aquatic aninals was approximately 38.97 tonslyear. However, it was found that
for the time being, particularly in the zone from Muang Nonthaburi District southwards there
was a very insignifcant degree of fishing since the state of poUution of the Chao Phraya River
caused the kinds and the quantity of aquatic animals to decline significantly in comparison with
the past.
3.4   HUMAN USE VALUES
3.4.1 Land Use
Based on surveys and studies conducted on town-planning maps coupled with land use maps in
areas 100 square kilometers surrounding the project, land use in such areas could be divided
into three categones: community compound, agricultural land and other land (see detail in
Table 3-10 and in Figure 3-7).
(1) Community Compound
73 percent of the area being studied could be categorized as a community compound which
consists of residential, commercial, governmental, and industrial activities. In addition, there
are several academic and religious institutions located in the compound: 92 schools, 30
temples, I christian church and four mosques. Land use in the community compound could be
summarized as follows:

(A) Residential Area - could be divided into three categories based on the types of
use value:
*  Residential and conmmercial areas: the largest type of land use(56 percent of the total
studied area), located mainly along the streets and small roads and has a ribbon
development characteristic.
*  Slum area: usually situated on private, governmental and on public land with the largest
area being close to the north-eastern side of the Klong Toey Port. "Slum Klong Toey" is
the home of blue-collar workers at the port and in various industrial plants operating in
that area. Other slum areas are located not very far from Wat Tai, Soi Wat Rat Sathathum,
Phrakanong Vittaya School, Vachirathum Sathit School, Tanin Industrial Company, Soi
Rung Ruang, Wat Bangna Nai and Pet Product Company. The total slum area is 1.8
percent of the total area being studied.
a  Home Garden: a traditional style of home building along the right-hand side of the Chao
Phraya River usually known as 'Bang Kra Chao", Amphur Pra Pa Dang in Samut Prakarn
Province and along the Phrakanong Canal. For the past ten years, most home gardens
have been constructed very closed to one another. Today they are starting to decay and
single homes have declined while apartments and town houses are spurring up. This type
of residential area composed of only four percent of the total land area in the study.
(B) Industrial and Warehouse Area
The industrial and warehouse area used up 5.7 percent of the total land in the study. Located
mainly on Pu Chao Sanming Pry Road, Amphur Pra Pa Dang and along the left bank of the
Chao Phraya River, industries in these areas are of all sizes with the majority requiring the
benefits of water transportation. For example, Bangchak Refinery, Thai Ply Wood Factory,
Chao Phraya Agricultural Product Company, Saha Thai Paper Factory and Thai Scott Paper
Factory. Small factories are scatterly located.
(C) Governmental Agencies and Transporting Stations
Governmental agencies which provide local public services are located scatterly in the area
with the two most significant agencies being the Naval Ordnance Department and the
Meteorological Department Research Center. The transporting station in the area is the Port
Authority of Thailand. This type of landuse takes up 5.7 percent of the total land area in the
study.
(D) Agricultural land
Agriculture is a very important character of land use in Samut Prakarn Province particularly in
the Bang Kra Chao area where the majority of land is used for fruit plantations such as mango,
banana, areca-nut, coconut and jack-fruit. The total area covers approximately 3 -10 rais.
These are distinctly old orchards which lack attendtion. The new younger generation of the
villagers oftenly migrate into the city, seeldng for jobs in factories, leaving their orchards
unattended and abandoned. The other area which is being used for agficulturing is Na Dum
(the eastem side of the total area being studied), which adjoins between Prakanong District and
Amphur Muang in Samut Prakarn. It is projected that such area would significantly change in
the near future due to the effects of the construction of the Patanakarn Road. Agricultural land
could be found about 20.4 percent of the total land in the study. However, beside agriculural

activities, land in both areas is also used for residential purpose but not so much for industrial
purpose based on the economic and social conditions of the community: half rural and half
urban.
(E) Other Land Area
6.5 percent of the total land area included in the study is labeiled as 'other land". This type of
land could be found along the water basin and along different canals. The Chao Phraya River
which flows through this type of land demarcates Bangkok and Sanut Prakarn.
3.4.2 Transportation
Although the Chao Phraya River and the canals plays a very significant role for the community
and commerce in the past until today, ground transportation is increasing becomring very
important for public transportaion and importing and exporting of goods and resources. The
acceleration of road construction creates a whole new network of ground transporation which
owes its popularity to the convenient, efficient and speed in getting from one place to another.
Nonetheless, in rural areas or in the local community, water transportation is still the main
vehicle despite the fact that it is not as efficient as ground transportation. Through water
transportation, a mass amount of goods and people could be transported at the same time.
Collected data on ground and water transportations could be summarized as follows:
(A) Ground Transportation
The project could be accessed, through ground transportation, using Sukhumvit 62/1, 64 or
64/1, or by using Na Krom Road which parallels the Chao Phraya River. Sanpavute Road is
also another option (Figure 3-8, Image 3-1).
The survey on traffic density was conducted by Aggie Consult Company Limited on May 1,
1990. Samples were taken from five points (Figure 3-9) three times a day. The ways which are
being used by Bangchak's employees to get to work and the ways used for transporting of raw
materials and finished products have also been surveyed as follows:
- Sukhumvit Road
- Na Krom Road - paralleling the Chao Phraya River
- Suklhumvit 64 - the most direct way to reach the project site
Samples for traffic survey conducted on al three roads were taken between the hours of 8.00 -
9.00, 12.00 - 13.00 and 16.00 - 17.00. The results are displayed in Table 3-8. From the survey,
it was found that the proportion of cars coming in and out of the project site through
Sukhumvit Road is 3.3 percent compares to the total numbers of vehicles on Na Krom Road,
the majority of which are motorcycles (1.4 percent).
The hours between 8.00 - 9.00, the proportion of vehicles coming in and out of the project site
is only 0.8 percent comparing Sukhumvit as a whole. Most were sedans, pick-up trucks and
jeeps (0.5 percent). The numbers of cars using Na Krom Road is 3.3 percent higher than those
using Sukhumvit Road when comparing the total numbers of car on Na Krom Road. Again,
most are motorcycles (1.4 percent).
From 12.00 -13.00, the proportion of vehicles coming in and out of the project site is 1.6
percent when comparing the numbers of car on Sukhumvit Road as a whole and 3.5 percent
when compared with the numbers of car on Na Krom Road, most of which are sedans, pick-up
trucks and jeeps.

Between the hours of 16.00 - 17.00, the proportion of vehicles entering and leaving the project
site is 1.9 percent compared to the numbers of cars on Sukhumvit Road as a whole and 1.9
percent when comparing with the numbers of vehicles on Na Krom Road which are mainly
sedans, pick-up trucks and jeeps.
Obviously, the results of the survey indicate that the proportion of vehicles entering and
leaving the project site is much lower than vehicles traveling on Sukhumvit and Na Krom
roads. Also, a higher proportion of vehicles uses Na Krom Road to get to the project site than
Sukhumvit Road.
When traffic density is to be converted to passenger car unit (PCU) for the purpose of
calculating traffic peak volume capacity, as shown in Table 3-1, with a standard value of V/C
ratio or a value which displays the level of traffic that each road could bear per lane per hour as
follows:
V/C < 0.7 meaning the level of traffic is much lower than the roads' capacity;
V/C between 0.7 - 1.0 meaning there is a slight level of traffic and the roads are not being
used to their fillest capacity;
* V/C between 1.01 - 1.5 meaning the level of of traffic is very closed to the roads capacity,
V/C > 1.5 meaning the level of traffic congestion is very high and the roads are being put
to used to their fullest capacity.
From the calculation, it was found that the survey points on Sukhumvit and Na Krom roads
which are the two main access to the project site, have a VIC ratios of 1.04 and 0.9
respectively. This shows that the level of traffic on Sulcurrvit Road is very closed to the road
capacity and the level of traffic on Na Krom Road is very slight and the road is not being put
into its fullest use.
Basically, the majority of vehicles entering and leaving the project site are sedans, pick-up
trucks and jeeps. There are only a couple of trucks and motorcyc]es. When converting, the
value of PCU fbr the numbers of vehicle entering and leaving the project site throueh
Sukhumvit Road, there are approximately 142 vehicles per day and about 174 vehicles per day
on Na Krom Road.
Importantly, the expansion of refinery unit 2's production capacitv would not in any way
substantially increase the transporting of raw materials and products through the use of trucks.
(B) Water Transportation
Beside traveling by automobiles, trucks and motorcycles, the project site could also be easily
reached by water transportation. This type of transportation is the heart for transporting of
products and raw materials. The Chao Phraya River is the main river used for transportation
and transfering of goods within the country. it also plays a noteworthy part in the public's
everyday life.
3.4.3  Draining System and Flood Control
(A) Project Area
The project site is situated along the plain on the estuary of the Chao Phraya River where land
on the eastern side is mainly used for industrial and commercial purposes while the western
side is used for agriculture.

Several kIongs are very beneficial in draining water and preventing flood. The important ones
are Prakanong canal, Jek canal, Bangchak canal, Bang Oh canal and Bangna canal. Watergates
and pumps control the draining of water. Table 3-12 illustrates the total numbers and the
capacity of pumps. Prakanong canal which is the largest canal within the area drains water into
the Chao Phraya River 24 hours a day by pumping water out when the watergate is closed.
During a crisis, Bangehak canal Jelk canal, Bang Oh cana and Bangna canal would maintain
the water level in the canals at 34.50 meters (the normal sea level is 35.03 meters). In case
when the level of water in the Chao Phraya River is lower than the water level in these canals,
water in the canals would be drain into the river by leaving the watergates opened. On the
contrary, if the water level in the river is higher than the level in the canals, watergates would
be closed and water would be drained into the river with pumps. During the dry season when
there is not much water, watergates would be opened to receive water from the river, at the
same time, drain water in the canals into the river as a way to change the water quality. During
the rainy season, water in the canals would always be maintained at a constant low level.
High and low tide system is used to drain water in the area on the western end. Several
important canals are: ong Pae canal, Rua-bin canal, Yai-ed canal and Wat Bang-nam-pueng
canal. Usually, in the area known as Bang Kra Chao is flooded everyday during the time when
the tide is high for approximately 2 -3 hours. The water would be drained auto-matically when
the tide is low. During the rainy season when sea level rises and water from the north flows
into the city, that particular area would be flooded for long periods of time. The Department of
Public Works is presently in the stage of conductiAng a research on the means to control the
problems of flood in such area.
(B) WharfAreas
Draining on each wharf is done by means of the slope of the wharf and through drain channel
in the curb area down into the Chao Phraya River (only wharfs Nos. I SA and I SD, see Figure
3-10) Elsewhere, water is drained into a slop tank and there is a slap slopirg to the back side
of the whar( draining it into an empty space of the wharf area so that it will permeate through
earth. The wharfs using this manner of draining are Wharfs Nos. 18B, 18C, 1SF and Wharf
No. 18E. As regards draining inl the wharf areas, it is done by means of the permeation of rain
water through earth to dry automatically. This will help the absorption of oil that may
adulterate in the wharf areas, keeping it from getting into the Chao Phraya River directly, but
there may be some obstacles. In case of heavy rain, slow draining may lead to flooding from
part to part in the wharf areas. The officials in charge of the wharfs would provide pumps to
drain water into the public draining channels on Na Krom Road from time to time.
With respect to prevention of floods in the wharf areas, presently throughout the front lines of
the wharfs of Bangohak Refinery concret3 embanlanents have been built to prevent floods and
erosion. There are walcways on the ridges of the embankments raised about 50 centimeter
from the ground level, about 1 meter wide and running throughout the whole lengths of the
whars, while the respective wharfs would be from +1.46 meter to +184 meter above mean
sea level.
3.4.4 RFzter Sources
The survey conducted at governmental agencies located within one kilometer radius around
the refinery, indicates that consumption water sources are city water (68.52%). underground
water (16.67/o), water from rivers and canals (5.56%). rain water (3.70%) and water from
other sources (5.550/a). Potable water sources. on the other hand, come mainly from city water
(53.85%). The rest comes from bottle water (lS S0%). underground water ( 1.9S%). rain
water (6 92%) and water from other sources (345%).

Interviews with community leaders shows that possible water sources in Amphur Prapadaeng
are underground water (100.00%) for consumption pruposes. Portable water in the area comes
from rain water (90.00%) and underground water (10.00%) (see more detail in Table 3-13).
In Bangkok, consumption water has several problems such as brackish (33.33%), odorous
(26.67%), hazy (20.00%) and it has lees and a rusty color (20.00%). Fortunately, the people in
Bangkok City do not have to face the problem of water shortages whereas underground water
is usually inadequate during the dry season and city water supplied during rush hours (6.00 -
8.00 am) does not have a constant flow. Similar to consumption water, potable water faces
certain problems most of which are that it has taste ofchlorine (43.48%), hazy (391 3%/o) and it
has lees (17.39%o). Again, there is not problem in terms of the quantity.
The problems of the quality of consumption water in Amphur Prapadaeng are: haziness
brackish and odorous. Except during the dry season, there is sufficient amount of water for
consumption throughout the rest of the year. As for potable water, the persisting problems are:
the taste, the brackishness, sand and lees and nrst Similarly, water is scarce during the dry
season. Community leaders try to solve the problem of insufficient consumption water during
the dry season by digging more wells. The lack of potable water is alleviated with botte water.
Water for agricultural uses, on the contrary, comes from the rivers and the canals which has
the capacity to serve farmers all year long. A few problems such as the problem of
bracldshness and the problem of oil stains mixed with the water, create anno-yance to
localities.
Unlike bottle water, the quality of potable water is improved before the actual drinking by
using filters or strainers, by boiling after sedimentation.

3.5.1 Economic andSocial Conditions and Perspective
(1) Boundary and the Study Area
(A) The Boundary of the Study Area
Surveys were conducted in a prospective area which is anticipated to be affected by the Plant 2
Expansion Project The two most likely areas were located approximately 2 kilometers away
from the project (see Figure 3-1 1):
*  The Bangkok City area namely Bangna district, Bangchak district, Prakanong district
Klong Toey distict, Suan Luang district and Pravet district.
* The Pra Pa Daeng area in Samut Prakarn Province specifically in Tambol Bang-kor-bua
and Tambol Bang-nam-pueng.
(B) The Scope of the Content
Interviews relating to the issues of the economic and social conditions in the above mentioned
areas have been conducted on community leaders and governmental officials who lived
approximately 2 kilometers away from the project site. The purpose of these interviews is to
inquire about educated people's perspectives on the project in order to compare them with the
impact of the project on the local population.

The interviews have been conducted on sample groups consisting of governmental agencies,
state enterprises and community leaders lived and located within the vicinity of Prakanong
district, Bangna district, Bangachak district and Suan Luang distrct as follows:
Pipattana School                6 samples
Poonsin School                  6 samples
Prakanong Court                 3 samples
Thai Ply Wood Factory          10 samples
The Excise Department           2 samples
The Battery Organization        7 samples
The Glass Organization         12 samples
Wat Bangna Nok School           7 samples
Prakanong Pitayalai School      6 samples
Bangna Post Office              3 samples

Ruag-Ruang-Vitaya School        6 samples
Ban-U-Bakeka Detention Center    9 samples
Bangna Police Station           2 samples
Interviews have also been conducted on the same type of sample groups in Tambol Bang-kor-
bua and Tambol Bang-nam-pueng:
Bang-kor-bua Health Center                  1 sample
Bang-nan-pueng Health Center                1 sample
Village Headman in Tambol Bang-kor-bua      1 sample
Vice-Vilage Headmen in Tambol Bangkok-Bua   5 samples
Out of 100 samples distributed, 93 were received back. It is also important to notice that the
surveys have been conducted on 10 percent of governmental officials who actually live in the
area closed to the project site.
(2) Economic and Social Conditions
(A) Banzna district, Bangchak district, Prakanong district and Suan Luang district retain a
"city1' characteristic composing of residential areas, commercial areas, industrial areas and
several governmental agencies. Today, industrial and commercial activities have grown
abundantly in these areas. The nmber of population in each district are: 94,506 people in
Bangna district, 101,659 people in Bangchak district, 79,249 people in Prakanong district and
95,515 people in Suan Luang district. The majority of the population are of worling- age.
Most are employed in companies and factories, have a private buslness, work for state
enterprises and work fbr the government respectively. The average income ranges between
10,000-40,000 Baht per year. These characteristics, however, differ from those in Tambol
Banko.k-Bua and Tambol Bang-nam-pueng.
(B) Tamnbol Bangkok-Bua and Tambol Bang-nam-pueng which is located in Amphur Pra-pa-
daern, Samut Prakarn Province, in contrast to the other districts, are more of a 'rural
community"
The governing stnucture of Tambol Bangkok-Bua was divided into 13 villages all of which
are being overseen by the Organization of Provincial Administration. The total population
is 7.4:5. The total area is 2,768 rai (4.42 square kilometers). The population density is
1,680 people per I square meter. Mlost.villagers are between the ages of 18 -50 years old
or 343 per cent of the total population. The second dominant age group is between 14 -

18 years old or 24 percent of the total population. The majority of the people have
completed at least elementary or secondary school. The villages are neither rich nor poor.
- Formerly, almost everybody eam their living with agriculturing. However, due to the
impact of sea water, planting fields would be flooded for 7-8 months per year. Villagers
have to build dams which in turn, increased their production cost. For this reason, many
left their fields and seek employment in factories, governmental agencies and state
enterprises outside their villages. Nonethe-less, thie total area in Tambol Bangkok-Bua is
2,768 rai. Of this total land, 2,055 rai or 74 percent of the total land was alloted to
agricultring. There are 455 households most of which are structured in the form of half
rice filed and half garden.
Tambol Bang-Nam-Pueng divided its governing structure imo I 1 villages. The total land
in Tambol Bang-nam-pueng is 2,968.75 rai (4.75 square meters) of which 1,672 rai is used
for agriculturing. Out of the 777 households, 310 households are owned by fanners. 2,848
people or 72.7 percent of the total population of 3,918 are between the ages of 18 -50.
These are middle to upper income fimiiGes who are govermnental and state enterprises
employees, fictories workers and firmers. Orginally, the majority of the people lived on
income from agricultuing. Today, many work in factories, governxnental agencies and
state enterprises, leaving their fields abandoned and decreasing the agriculturing
workforce. The reason is similar to the sitation in Bangkok-Bua- Flood was the major
problem. Farmers had to spend a lot of money investing in dams which was not cost
effective compared to their produce sold.
(3) Views and Perspective on the Project
Surveys and interviews conducted on sample groupswithin the study area depict these people's
views and perspective concerning the project as follows:
(A) In the past, 51.6 percent of the sample group was disturbed by the activities of Bangchak
refinery. 19.3 percent was disturbed by the smell of oil, 14.6 percent by the smoke, 5.2 percent
was concerned that they would be affected by accidents which might occur form the refinery.
12.5 percent was concemed by other reasons.
(3) From the survey conducted on the same sample group, there were 36.6 percent in the
sample group was disturbed by the project 8.0 percent was disturbed by the smell of oil,
occasionally but such smell was not strong. 28.6 percent was concerned that accident would
occur due to various reasons (note: the reason that a lot of people was concerned with
accidental fire is because the survey was conducted during the time which a tragic accident had
just occured - a LPG tank truck exploded on the New Petchburi Road).
Evidently, the results of the survey show that the level of disturbances which the people and
institutions located around the project site used to have relating to the activities of Bangchak
refinery have decreased, particularly for the direct disturbances such as smell of oil and smoke.
(C) Views and Perspective which the sample group has on Bangehak Refinery:
-13 percent felt that Bangchak refinery does not benefit anybody.
79.50 percent felt that the refinery is very beneficial.
7.5 percent showved no idea or comment.
For the people who recognized the refinery as being beneficial gave the following reasons:
;36.0 percent felt that it creates employment and stable income and raise the level of the
country's economv



* 27.5 percent felt that the refinery in beneficial to other industries.
.  19 percent felt that it helps create a balance in intemational trade.
*  17.5 percent felt that the refinery helps develop and expand the community.
These given reasons demonstrate that the majority of the people in the sample group regarded
that Bangchak refinery is advantageous to both the local and the national level.
(D) Interviews and surveys conducted on the sample group regarding their views and
perspective on the impact of Bangchak refinery on the country's social and economic
conditions could be concluded as follows:
62.4 percent felt that the refinery has more advantages than disadvantages.
22.6 percent felt that the refinery creates advantages as much as disadvantages.
* 15 percent felt that the refinery has more disadvantages than advantages.
(E) The transporting of raw materiat products and labor would have an impact on both ground
and water transportation and would affect 34.4 percent of the lives of the people who lived in
the area. The rest, 66.7 percent would not be affected. In the case where such transportation
affects the local people, problem occurs in terms of raw materials and products transportation
by vessels which had caused on oi spifl and troubled the houses along the nver. Ground
transportation also caused trouble due to narrow street.
(F) Being directly and indirectly disturbed by the problems related to the refinery's activities,
the sample group has given several suggestions and preventive solutions:
* The refinery should improve theefficiency of its equipment to get rid of the smell of oil,
particularly during the transfering of oil and during the cold season.
. Safety measures relating to accident such as fire must be stnct and effective because they
have a considerable impact on the local's mentality. The refinery should provide
information and hold campaigns about the production processes and safety measures being
undertaken in the refinery to promote clear understanding among the local people. This
could eventually decrease the public's concerns.
*  Procedures in trasferring oil and gas and in getting rid of oil stain should be stan-dardized
and secured.
* Trucks used in trasporting raw materials and finished products should be arranged to
depart the refinery at specific time in order to avoid traffic jam during rush hour.
*  Ard Narong Road which is in front of the reinery should be expanded and rail tran-
sportation should be used more frequently.
(G) 63.4 percent of the sample group agreed that the refinery should increase its capacity by
revamnpin its Plant 2. Only 25.8 percent disagreed with the project, while 10.8 percent did not
express their opinions.
For those who agreed with the project gave the following suggestions:
a The refinery should well plan its ground transportaion in order not to increase traffic jam.
*  Regular monitoring should be carried out for trucks and transporting facilities.



Considered that Bangchak refinery is installing pipe lines to transfer oil from Bangehak- to
Don Muang, this could help lessen traffic jam tremendously.
3.4.2 PAblic Health
(1) Public Health Center
Several health centers located within Amphur Pra-pa-daeng are: Bang-kra-chao Health Center,
Bang-nam-pueng Health Center and Bang-kor-bua Health Center. Those located in the vicinity
of Bangkok are: Pralanong District Health Center, Pravet District Health Center and Klong
Toey District Health Center. Table 3-16 shows a list of health centers operated by the
government, the private sector and by the Public Health Service Center.
Beside health centers mentioned above, local people also prefer services provided by other
health centers not in the survey, of which are both governmental and privately own as shown in
Table 3-17.
(2) Medical and Public Health Personnel
Table 3-18 provides detail on medical and public health personnel active in three health centers
located in Amphur Pra-pa-daeng. Table 3-19 gives information on medical and public health
personnel working in hospitals and certain private health centers in the surveys which are
located in Bangkok City.
(3) Admitted Patienti Statistic
Interviews with local people who lived in the area being surveyed indicate that when ill, most
prefer to be treated at health centers located closed to their residents and at public health
centers and hospitals in Bangkok
Tables 3-20, 3-21 and 3-22 Illustrate that between 1989-1987, the statistic of out-patients used
to be admitted in the three health centers were RI due mainly from respirtory related diseases
(although the symptoms were not very clear), from accidents, from poisonous substances, from
skin diseases, from infectious diseases and from worn related diseases.
1984-1989 statistics show the percentage of patients in all three health centers admitted
because of respiratory related diseases which is the number one cause of illness in all three
districts as follows:
Health Centers            1984- 19 t 1986            1987 -1988        1989
Bang-kra-chao            39.54    44.85    44.18    44.85    38.29    43.73
Bang-namn-pueng          47.82    37.94    41.78    41.08    40.32    50.12
Bang-kor-bua                      41.81    38.93    44.95    50.45    42.93
(Data between years 1984 - 1985 was provided by SEATEC Company Ltd.)
Evidently, the statistics illustrate that when compare respiratory related diseases within a six
year period, the percentage of patients admitted does not vary substantially within the district
and berween the districts.
Table 3-23 displays data relating to patients who were admitted at the nine health centers and
only those who were admitted for respiratory diseases from 1987 - 1 984

The number of out-patients in the survey and the percentage of ill patients in Bangkok between
budget years 1987 -1989, as shown in Table 3-24, indicate that when comparing the
percentage of ill patients, the number one cause of Miness every year is respiratory related
diseases follow by digestible disease, mental disease, skin disease and sldn cancer respectively
in three years as shown in Table 3-25.
3.5.3. OccupationalHeathandSafety
(1) Air Quality in the Workplace
Air quality was assessed in refinery Plant 3. Several substances were evaluated, specifically the
level of CO, HES, NO.,, SO2, SPM, 1,1,1-Trichloroedhane and organic lead compound. There
substances were analyzed by the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn Univeristy. The
results of the assessment are demonstrated in Table 3-24.
(2) -Noise Pollution
Normally noise evaluation was conducted only in refinery Plant 3 when the plant was in
operation. Several places within the refinery which were deemed to be sources of disturbing
noises had been designated as the sampling stations, namely, areas next to machines' motors,
areas by the operating pumps and the maintenance unit. Noises resulting from the activities and
operations of the refinery were heard continuously. Evaluation relating to the level of noise in
the workplace was done by a group of experts from Aggie Consult Company Limited. The
following detail has been provided:
(A) Distances in Measuring the Level of Noise
Equipment used in measuring and testing noise density from each source was a noise
measunng machine set up by using a 1.5 meter camera stand (Image 3-2). The machine
represented a refinery worker within a hearing zone distance. The level of noise was also
measured in places where workers were actually present by setting up a noise measuring
machine in an opened area away from the sources of noise together with a noise rebounding
wall within the radius of 3.0 meters. This could eliminate any unwanted noise 7-c-c*: -.
(B) The Trimig of Each Measurement
Since the majority of the sources which produce a lot of noise are mo:ors gcnr:_.:;.n steadv
noise, the level of noise were measured five minutes twice consecutively for each source The
level of noise was recorded every minute. Leq. was then calculated according to safeny
standard (for the level of noise) in the workplace regulated by the Department of Labor, The
Ministry of Interior. Noise level is always being measured when the machines are in operation.
(C) Equipment used to Measure Noise Level
A Sound Level NMetter, prod-ced by Bruel and Kjaer, Model 2226, was the main equipment
used to measure the level of noise within the refinery. This equipment complies with the
product standard set by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) type2. Before the
equipment was put to use, it was tested for precision with a precision testing machine. In
addition, during the operating of this equipment, a wind screen was utilized in order to
decrease the impact on the environment such as suspended particulate matters, etc. around the
area.

Picture 3-13 illustrates the sampling stations where the measuring took place. Table 3-26
shows the results o' the measurement. It was found that the areas which produce the highest
level of noise, higher than the standard on environment in the workplace legislated by the
Ministry of Interior, are the Utility Unit located next to the AC Generator and in the area
where the Turbine is located.
(3) Heat
The following areas had been designated as the points where heat level would be measured:
areas next to machines which could generate heat in refinery unit 3, electricity generating unit
and the repairing unit (Inage 3-3). The measuring of heat level was conducted by experts from
Ackee Consulting Company (Picture 3-3). A Wet BulbGlobe Temperature (WBGT) machine
was used for this type of operation and it was based on heating standard in the workplace
approved by the American Conference of Govemmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGEli). The
results of the level of heat measured in the workplace are shown in Table 3-28.
(4) Accidents Statistics
Bangchalc Petroleum Public Company Limited has recorded and collected statistics on every
accident occured. Details are shown in Table 3-29, Bangchak Company's recorded accidents
statistics from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1993.
(5) Special Health Check-ups for Workers
Special health check-ups provided to workers aim to regularly assess health conditions of
workers who have to fahce specific kinds of exposure. For example, once every year, workEers
whose work is related to lead are diagnosed for the level of lead in the blood and urine. The
diagnosis were carried out by Surnrong-kan-pad Hospital of which the results are shown in
Table 3-30.
Furthermore, once every year, for workers who work in areas prone to high level of noise, a
check-up is provided relating to the hearing capacity. The check-up is provided by the Office
of Occupational Health within the Department of Health, the Msinistry of Public Health. The
results are depicted in Tables 3-31.

Environmental Impacts
4.1 Phvsical
4-1.1  Water Pollution
Waste water in the existing refinery consists of oil-contaminated water from
processes and non-oil contaminated water. The estimated total amount of waste
water from Plant 2 and 3 is about 182.4 m3/hr. In case of raining, the total
amount of waste water from plant 2 and 3 wIl be about 977.4 m3/hr. Sources
and flow rate of waste water are shown in Table 4-1 and 4-2. The waste water
are treated in Waste Water Treating unit as shown in Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2
The waste water treatment system is divided into physical separation and
biological treatment techniques as shown in Simplified Wate Water Treatment
Flow Diagram, Figure 4-1. Oily waste waters are collected in an oily water pond
and cycled through a conrugated plate separator (CPI) and then dissolved air
flotation (DAF). Tank drains are sent through oi separators and the oily water is
sent to the oiy water pond for physical separation at the beginning of the waste
water treatment process. Sour water and spent caustic are combined in an
equaliztion tank and sent to a tilted plate separator (TPI) and to the activated
sludge process. The effluent from the dissolved air flotation is also sent to the
atvated sludge process. The activated sludge process consists of an aeration
tank and a clarfier flocculator. The effluent from the clarifier is discharged
Through a flow measurement flume.
Estimed quantity and qualities of waste water from new process units are
shown in Table 4-3. The existing waste water treating unirt flow scheme has been
preiminarily reviewed and the required modification due to an increase of waste
water quantity is shown in Figure 4-3 Process flow Diazram of waste water
treating unit. Equipment required for new waste water trea::n; s.s:e- is as
follows:
(1) Oily storm water tank
Capacity             500 m3
Material             Carbon steel with tar-epoxv coazing

4.1.2 Air Polution
A dispersion modelling study of air quality was performed for enviromnental
impact assessment of the existing refinery. The study in the model included sulfur
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) and particulates (TSP). A mathematical
model was used to calculate the concentration of emissions at ground level
covering area in the distance of 10 km from the refinery. The mathematical
model was accepted by United States Environmental Protection Agency
(US.EPA) to be used for calculation of concentration of emissions in the
ambient. The software program used for the study was UNAMAP Version 6
which had been used since November 1985. The program consists of 33 models
for various characteistics. The mathiematical model used for the study was
Industrial Source Complex Short-Term (ASCOTS) Model which is Advanced
Gaussian Plume Model and is appropriate for project in the plain area. The basis
for the calculation of dispersion is shown in Table 4-4
The results of the study are as follows:
Sulfur dioxide (S02)
In the existing refinery, fuel gases from Plant 2 and Plant 3 are sent to
Fuel Gas Amine Treating Unit to remnove sulfur and then sent to fired heaters in
Plant 2 and Plant 3 to be used as fuel. Another process which help reduce SO2
is Sulphur Recovery Unit which can remove hydrogen sulfur from acid gases up
to 98% by weight. Therefore, emissions from heater stacks have low S02 than
the standards. It was estimated that the total SO2 emission from the existing
refinery would be about 6.4 tons per day. Based on the calculation of S02 at
4-8



ground level in every 1 square kdlometer around the project site in the distance of
10 km., the results of the study are as follows:
The highest concentration of S02 in 24-hour period was 59.53
micrograms per cubic meter which was below the standard of 300 micrograms
per cubic meter set by Thailand's National Environmental Board (NEB). The
highest concentration was found at the distance of 1.5 kilometer northeast of the
refinery. The isopleths in Figure 4-4 shows that the concentration of S02 is
high in the northeast area at the distance of 1-2 kilometer from the refinery.
The highest average concentration of S02 in 1-year period was 13.23
micrograms per cubic meter which was below the standard of 100 rmicrograms
per cubic meter for annual average. The highest concentration was found at the
same location as 24-hour period and is in the northeast area of the refinery. The
estimated highest concentration in each location is shown in Table 4-5. The
isopleths in Figure 4-5 shows that the dispersion of SO2 is in the northeast region
of the refinery.
The actual data of ambient air quality around the existing refinery are
shown in Chapter 2 and the highest average concentration of S02 is lower than
47 microgram per cubic meter in 1-year period.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO)
The concentration of NO2 was calculated same as SO2 and the results
are as follows:
The highest concentration of NO2 in 1-hour period was 15.21
micrograms per cubic meter which was below the standard of 320 micrograms
per cubic meter set by NEB. The highest concentration was found at the distance
of 1.5 kilometer northeast of the refinery. The isopleths in Figure 4-6 shows
that the dispersion of N02 is high in the northeast region of the refinery.
The highest average concentratikr, of NO2 in 1-year period was 0.80
micrograms per cubic meter. Though there is no standard for N02 in Thailand,
the highest concentration was far below 1 eL, microgram per cubic meter which
was the standard set by US.EPA for 1-year average. The isopleths in Figure 4-7
shows that the dispersion of NO2 is not far from the refinery.

Total suspended partculate (TSP)
The concentration of TSP was calculated same as S02 and the results
are as follows:
The highest concentration of TSP in 24-hour period was 19.06
micrograms per cubic meter which was below the standard of 330 micrograms
per cubic meter set by NEB for 24-hour average. The highest concentration was
found at the distance of 1.5 kilometer northeast of the refinery. The isopleths in
Figure 4-8 shows that the dispersion of TSP is not wide as SO2 and N02.
The highest average concentration of TSP in i-year period was 3.91
micrograms per cubic meter which was below standard of 100 microgram per
cubic meter set by NEB. The isopleths in Figure 4-9 shows that TSP was
dispersed in a short distance from the refinery.
In the new project which includes FCC unit, Flue Gas
Desulphuization Unit, Gas OI HDS unit, Fuel Gas Treating Unit and Sulphur
Recovery Unit, it is estimated that there would be total SO2 emission of 5.9
tons per day based on sulfuir content of 0.5% in reduced crude used for burning
as shown in Table 4-6 and Table 4-7. Dispersion model of the refinery including
new racilities in the project wil be performed when detailed design is available.
4.1.3  Solid effluents and spent catalyst
Solid effluent from FCC complex is presented in Table 4-8. Catalyst fine
entrained into flue gas stream from Regenerator (Combustor) is presented as the
total quantity. Almost all the amount of catalyst fine will be caught upto FGD,
and the solid is separated with filter press. The rest of the catalyst fine is caught
in Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to meet Thai governmtenf s environmental 3V
regulations.
On the other hand, a catalyst fine entrained from Disengager is routed to FCC
bottom product of HCO+SLO. The solid in the stream can be removed by
Separator, e.g. GULFTRONICS, to less than 100 wt-ppm.
With respect to spent catalyst from FCC unit which will be about 1 2 ton per day,
the catalyst will be sent either to cement plant to produce concrete blocks or
transported to land fill..

4.2 Imnacts on H:umnan use Values
4.2.1 Land Use
Since the Project will be implemented in the e:isting refinery area and there is no
expansion of land use, the project will not affect the community land use area.
4.2.2  Tranportation
Since FCC unit to be installed in the project is conversion unit, there wiJl be net
increase of products about 700 barrels per day or an increase of 0.7% from
current operation. Increasing transporttion of products will be about 3,600
barrels per day LPG and 9,000 barrels per day of gasoline and decreasing
transportation of fuel oil by about 12,000 barrels per day. LPG will be
transported by 700-ton tankers and tank trucks. Gasoline will be mainly
transported by newly-installed pipeline to BCP tenninal in the north. Totally, the
tansportation of products will be decreasing after the completion of new pipeline
in mid 1994.
4.2.3  River water
Increasing transportation of LPG by tanker as well as cunrent loading and
unloading of crude and products at piers might have impact to the river water,
especially in case there is oil spill or accident.
Oil dispersion modeling in the river in case of spill was performed in 1988 using
mathematical model taldng into account flow of river and tide. The scope of
study covered the distance of 12 km. from the pier which is 25 km. from the
mouth of Chao Phya River as shown in Fifure 4-10. The modeling was
performed in 4 cases of spill volume, 10- , 1, 100 and 5,000 cubic meter. The
results of study indicate that in one-day period the minimum dispersion will be
15.4 knm or cover area of 6.05 square kilometer and the maximum dispersion will
be 28.2 Ikm. or cover area of 11.08 square kllometer as shown in Table 4-9.
Area and thickness of oil remaining after 24 hours of spill is shown in Table 4-10

However, BCP had installed spill prevention facilities at piers by installing
containment curbing and spill slop tanks below the hose comections, ranging in
volume from 2,500 liters to 10,000 liters. Blind flanges are bolted to the hoses
when not in use. The manifolds are equipped with check valves. A perimeter
ditch surrounds the onshore manifolds, and is lead to waste water treatment
eystem Spill containment booms are deployed to encircle the entire ship for
each loading operation. Waming signs and the fire emergency plan are posted,
and there is a wind sock at the control room.
BCP has spill control equipment maintained at the control room which include 25
drums of freshwater oil dispersant, skimmer and suction pipe for diaphragm
pump, suction truck, absorbent, suction hose, backpack dispersant sprayers,
portable diesel driven sprayer, mobile wagon dispersant sprayer to be run off fire
hydrant system, a workboat with boom spreader and dispersant sprayer. Three
spare oil contaiment booms are kept at the ficiUity .
Nevertheless, it has been recorded that there is no accident or oil spill at piers
for years and according to monitoring data of Chao Phya river quality at the
project area during 1-year period, oil and grease content was in the range of 0.6-
2.8 mg(iter as shown in Table 3-7.
42.4  Water Consumption
Curntly, water consumption in the refinery is about 5,500 m3/day for power
plant and heat exchange in the process and for off-sites.
Raw water is obtained from underground through 5 wells These wells are 170-
200 meters deep. After the project is completed, the refinery will increase
consumpton to about 7,200 m3i/day. City water, on the other hand is being used
at 250 m3/day. To improve the quality of deep-weU water to be in used in the
x boilers, an ion exchange system is applied. Chenicals are added to cooling water
to adjust pH level and decrease organisms.
4.2.5  Enerav Consumption
The refinery currently needs 15 MW of electricity and wil increase to 23.4 MW
after the project 17 MW will be generated in the refinery and the remaining
requirement will be purchased from the Metropolitan Electricity Authority
(MEA). A gas turbine generator of 5 MW capacity will be installed in the
project.

4.2.6  Drainage and Flood Prevention System
The refinery improved its drainage and flood prevention system in 1988. Water
from vafious areas and rain water will be drained into a guard basin before
discharging to outside. Additional oily suriface drain from process units will be
installed in the project Flooding is not anticipated to occur within and outside the
refinery's compound.
4.2.7 Occupational Health and Safetv
Currently the refinery is undertaldng precaution activities in many areas such as
industial healtb, safety, emergency fire protection and prevention and oil spill
prevention which details has been depicted in Chapter 3.

Environmental MitiEation Plan and Monitoring Plan
5.1   Mitigation Plan
Bangchak revamped its refinery unit in 1987 and expanded the refinery capacity in
1989. Prior to construction, an environmental impact assessment rep.art which
included preventive and mitigation plan and monitoring plan was required for
approval by authorities according to Thai laws. Mitigation plan were taken into
account during the design and monitoring has been performed. -  Similarly for
Enviromnental Improvement and Clean Fuels Project, preventive and mitigation
plan has been considered and to be included in the design and implementation of
the project in order to meet Thai standards descrnbed in Chapter I as follows:
5.1. 1 Water Oualitv
A new waste water treating unit will be installed in addition to the existing
unit and new oily surface drain from process units will be extended as
described in Chapter 3.
5.1.2  Air Oualitv
The following facilities will. be installed to meet Thai emission standards:
a) Flue gas desulfurization unit and electrostatic precipitator for  FCC
unit.
b) Sulphur recovery unit and tail gas treating unit.
c) Special bumers to reduce NOx
5. 1.3 Water consumption
Air fin coolers wil be installed to reduce water consumpticn .   sA_.. on
use of river water instead of well water will be percrrt bef3re design
Bangchak also plans to recycle water collected in 3 grwd bas;ns *ar usaze
instead of discharge into the local surface water
5.1-4  Others
Preventive and mitigation plan for revamping project and plant expansion
project as mentioned above and summarized in Table 5-1 wiUl be utilized or
extended in order that effluents and emissions will meet Thai standards
requirements and not impact the environment.
5.1.5 Design of the new units
Safeguarding system will be designed for FCC unit and Gas Oil HDS unit
The fo'llowing are the major systems for the safeguarding:



a) Safeguarding of system of the FCC unit
i) Emergency shutdown system
a) Feed failure safeguarding system
b) Reactor and regenerator safeguarding system.
To prevent reverse flow of hydrocarbon feed to pass into the regene-
rator.
To prevent reverse flow of oxygen containing gas to pass into the
reactor/stripping and the fractionator section.
c) Low air flow to regenerator safeguarding system (Air blower)
Emergency steam is injected into the regenerator to keep the catalyst
bed fluidized.
d) Cat. cooler tube rupture safeguarding systerm
e) Wet gas compressor safeguarding system (General failure)
ii) Others
a) Emergency depressuring system
b) Interface with other sections
Relief facilities on upstream and downstream sections should be
capable of coping respectively with the back-flow and failure of the
interface barrier.
c)  Overpressure protection by safety valves.

Industrial Hazard Assessment
6.1  Primarv Hzrd Analysis
6.1.1  Introduction
Accidents which might occur in the refinery such as oil or gas leakage, fire
and explosion are important items which Bangchak has taken into account in
the design of the refinery and can be described as follows:
a) Hazardous Area Classification
Major hazard assessment in the refinery was perforned based on "The
Fire and Explosion Index System" (particularly the fifth edition) which
classifies hazardous areas into 6 areas according to probable risk as
follows:
i)  Process Area
Including area of all process unit i.e. Topping Unit, Naphtha
Pretreating Unit, Catalytic Reforming Unit, LPG Treating Unit, Gas
Oil Hydrotreating Unit, Sulfur Recovery Unit etc. These areas are
classified as hazardous area.
i)  LPG Sphere Area
Including area of 6 buUets with capacity 185 million Eitre (105
MTON) each; and 2 sphere tanks with capacity 1,830 million litre
(1,043 MlTON) each. This area is classified as hazardous area.
iii) Light Product Tank Areas
Including tank areas that containing light products (flash point below
135°F) such as gasoline, kerosene and jet fiel. These areas are
classified as hazardous areas.
iv) Utilitv Area
Including area of power plant, steam generator and boiler. This area
is classified as intermediate hazardous area.
v) Heavy Product Tank Areas
Including tank- areas that containing heavy products (flash point
higher than 1350F) such as diesel and fuel oil. These areas are classi-
fied as low hazardous areas.



vi) OtherAr
Including offlice building, canteen, maintenance building, control
room, laboratory, fire brigade and areas that are not classified in
abovementioned areas. These areas are classified as low hazardous
areas.
b) Cause of Hazard in the Refinery
i)  Human Error: Hazard may be caused by misoperation, negligence,
misunderstanding and so on Table 6-1 shows details of human error.
ii) Phvsical Error: Hazard may be caused deficiency of material or
equipment, corrosion, leakage, etc. as detailed in Table 6-2.
c) Safety Equipment
i)  Alarm System
Alarm system currently used in the refinery is DCS console which
can warn of a risk by alarm display, graphic display and signal to
operating group display.
ii) EmergencyrShutdown and Interlock Svstem
This system is the cortrol system for safe emergency shutdown of
the plant. It was installed both in Plant No. 2 and Plant No. 3 which
functions as follows:
a) Load Shedding System
Electricity used in the refinery comes from 2 soures; refinery
power plant and Metropolitan Electricity Authority. This system
wiil measure the electricity from the two sourves. If there is any
failure of supply this control system will automatically shut
down the plant temporarily.
b) Emergency Plant Shutdown
In case of fire or emergency, Plant No. 2 and Plant No. 3 can be
shut down simultaneously from the control room which has
reserved power supply for the control system.
c) TPU Crude Charre Selection Interlock System
There are 3 pumps for crude charging to each plant, 2 in opera-
tion and I for spare. The spare pump will automatically start
worldng in case of failure in any operating pump.
d) NPU Operation Mode Selection Interlock System
The operation of NPU in Plant 2 and Plant 3 require hydrogen
gas in a certain quantity. If there is any shortage of supply. this
system will warn the operator by conventional console in the
control room

capacity by emergency valves.
f) F-101 Shutdown System
This system will control operation of fired heater in TPU. In
case of emergency, fuel charge system of the heater will be cut
off by emergency valves.
g) F-I01 Off Gas Buming Interlock System
This system controls the separation of acid gas to bum at flare
so that fuel gas can be used in the heater, otherwise fuel gas will
cause corrosion in the heater.
h) Emergencv Valves of CRU Furnace

iv) Er .ergency Motor Operated Valve
Motor operated valve wil be installed in pipeline for feeds or
products which can easiy evaporize or have temperature higher than
260°C to protect any retention or build up of pressure. The motor
operated valves are fireproof and their switch are kept at safe
location.
v) SnuffEng Steam for Fired Heater
In case there is explosion or fire in heater, snuffing steam will be
injected to the fire to control heater temperature.
Since the heater is normally operated at high temperature snuffing
steam facilities are installed 15 meters away from the heater.
vi) Safety Shower
Safety shower will be installed in process unit area and located in the
following unit

vii) Combustible and Toxic Gas Detector Svstem
Combustible and toxic gas detector system installed are as follows:
- LPG detector : to detect leakage of LPG from the area such as
LPG sphere area and LPG pump at LPG merox unit.
- Toxic gas detector: to detect toxic gas such as hydrogensulfide
in the area of fuel gas treatment unit, sulfur recovery unit and gas
oil hydrotreating unit.
6.2 Hazard and Onerabiitv Study
6.2.1 Introduction
In the refnery, safety equipment or facilities for monitoring of the operation
and/or any irregularity are installed as follows:
- Fail-Safe : to check operation of equipment. If the operation deviates from
the set point or fails, the back-up system which is called fhil-safe will
operate immediately. Fail-safe will work in the following situation:
* failure of air system or power system
- falt of control signal of equipment
* failure of temperature measurement
Basically, fail-safe system are designed for equipment and facilities in the
refinery.
6.22  Alarms
Alarm system will warn the operators when the operation of the process unit
deviates from the set points such as temperature, pressure, level and flow
rate.
The set points will be established from the limitation of each process unit. For
example, as a process unit which is operated at temperature of 2000C, the set
point for operating range will be set at 150°C and 2500C. The temperature
control system vwill adjust the operation within this range. However, if this
control system fails, the alarm system will work immediately. In Bangchak
Refinery, there are two kinds of alarms, alarm by siren and indicating ight in
the control room.
Moreover, there are alarm system for vibration of rotating machincs
especially pumps, compressors, fans and steam turbines generator. The alarm
system will work- when the vibration of the machines is abnormal.



6±3. Remote Emeryencv Shutdown System
In case of emergency, the process unit will be shutdown. The basic concept
of emergency shutdown is to cut off all power distribution system, reduce
quickly temperature of the unit as low as possible, and reduce fuel in the
system. Remote shutdown system which is operated at control room are as
folows:
a) Remote Shutdown of Heaters
This is the first step for emergency shutdown in the control room. Fuel
supply will be reduced and snuffing steam will be injected to prevent fire.
b) Remote Stop of Pumps and Comnressors
When the heater stops working, pumps and compressors will be shut off
in the control room.
6.2.4 Flammable Gas Detectors
The detectors will detect flammable gas and chemicals or hydrocarbon. The
detectors are installed in the following area:
- high pressure process unit
- around fired heaters'
- connection of equipment
There are 2 Idnds of detector. The first ldnd is to deteca gas in high pressure
process unit and around fired heaters at which alarm level is set at 500 vol.
ppm., the second kind is to detect gas at specific area at which alarm level is
set at 0.45 vol.%.
6.2.5  Backup Svstem for Instument Air and Electricitv
In case power failure or instrument air supply failure. this s. s:e-. A,!: supplv
for a period of time during which the failure will be rene.d:ed
In case of nitrogen supply pressure (normally at 6.5 kIgcrn2g) for gas oil
hydrotreating unit which is operated at high pressure is inadequate, the
backup system will increase pressure to the unit within 20 minutes. Similarly,
in case of power supply failure, all the process unit will be emergency
shutdown and power back up system will be utilized. The power backup
system is supplied from battery which can supply power to the unit for 20
minute and to the control room for all the time. This power back up system is
called "CVCF".
6.2.6  Pressure Relief Svstem
This system will prevent equipment from higher pressure than normal.
Function of this svstem can be described as follows:



- Safetv Valve and Relief Valve
These valves are operated by on-off  spring according to pressure.
Normal position of valves are closed. But if pressure is increased to the
set pressure, valves will be automatically opened. Safety valves will be
used for gases; on the other hand, relief valves will be used flor liquid.
Normally, relief valves for toxic liquid will be connected to receiving
storage for discharged toxic liquid. But for nox-toxic liquid or water,
liquid will be drained to surface. Safety valves will released gas to stack
or flare.
6.2.7 Rupture Disk
Rupture disk is a thin diaphragm equipped to flanges to reduce pressure
Rupture disk is normally used for equipment which pressure can be increased
rapidly where safety valve and relief valve is not applicable.
6.3 Risk Assessment
Area in the refinery can be classified according to risk as follows:
63.1  LPG Sphere
There are 2 iypes of LPG storage in the refinery. One is bullet and the other
is sphrere tank. There are 6 bullets of capacity 185 million liters (50 MTON)
each numbered D-91 1, D-912, D-913, D-914, D-915 and D-916. There are
2 spheres of capacity 1,830 nilion iiters (1,043 MTON) each numbered T-
950 and T-974. Normally, LPG will be stored in sphere. Bullets will be used
for temporary storage of LPG which will be transferred to sphere. Risk
assessment was performed for sphere as foLows:
a). Operating Limit ofLPG Sphere
The highest level of LPG in the sphere will not be more than 11.40
meters (800/a of sphere capacity), therefore maximum capacity of sphere
is 1,464 million lter (834.4 MION). Risk assessment in case of fire or
explosion of LPG sphere accroding to Hence' equation is as follows:

L       =  3498.896 = 1,066.48 = 1.07 km.
Note In case of any leakage, the control system of LPG sphere will
release LPG to flare, quantity of LPG and pressure of sphere will
be tremendously decreased and consequently decrease the value
of L.
c) Risk Assessment
LPG sphere in the refinery has a complete safety control measure such as
safety valve, cooling water system, gas detector, remote block valve,
level and pressure control, etc. In an emergency situation, a safety valve
will release gas to prevent explosion. Cooling water will be automatically
dispersed to cool down the sphere. A gas detector will signal to the
control room. In addition, a remote block valve which is located 15
meters away from the tank wili cut off the flow of gas.
Furthermore, LPG is controlled to contain RVP at lower than 100 psi
which is less than standard regulated by the Ministry of Commerce (140
psi) and is probably lower than other refineries in general. Whereas
Bangchakls LPG sphere aloawable working pressure is 250 psi. It is- &
certain that accident such as fire or explosion is improbable.
In the worst situation, if LPG sphere explodes or catch fire, building
structure within a 44 meters range will be damaged; building components
within an 89 meters range wil be damaged; and people within a 487
meters range will be affected as shown in Table 6-3 and Figure 6-2. If
there is fire or explosion, it will impact structure, building components
and people at the distance of 615, 1,065 and 1,885 meters respectively.
Nonetheless, it is the least likely that LPG sphere will explode or catch
fire because the refinery has measures as follows:
i)  Sphere Design
To get maxinum safety, the refinery had taken into account LPG
sphere design as follows:
- Safety valves are equipped on spheres and bullets which shal
release LPG if there is fire.
- Cooling water system. In case of fire, cooling water will be
sprayed to the surface of sphere to protect deformation of metal
and prevent explosion.
- Gas detectors wvil signal to the control room if there is any gas
leakage.

- In case of gas leakage, remote block valve which is installed away
from sphere 50 feet minimum will cut off gas flow from sphere.
- Fire extinguishers and hydrants are available for immediate use i
near LPG spheres and bullets.
- Level and pressure control instrunent will signal to the control
room if level and pressure is higher than set point.
ii) Training for Personnel
Operators in the refinery have been trained with respect to gas
operation and safety in-house and from govenment agencies.
iii) Saitv Meaure
Prior to doing hot works in the refinery, permit must be obtained
from authrorized personnel and flammable hydrocarbon must be
detected around the workplace.
In additions the refinery has safety committee and safety teams to
review and monitor safety conditons in the worling place.
6.3.2. Crude Tanks
Presently, there are 14 crude tanks 5i the refinery of capacity from 90,500-
350,000 barrels. Risk assessment was performed for crude tank capacity
350,000 barrels. According the following calculation, the radius of fire will be
about 166 meters as shown in Table 6-4 and Figure 6-3.

However, prevention and control of fire had been taken into account in
the design and operation as follows:
a) 2 sets of level alarm instrument were installed independently at two
levels. If level of crude goes higher than the set levels, the instru-
ment will alarm to the control room. In addition, foam line system are
installed on crude tank-s: tank seals and roofs have been regularly
inspected to prevent any leak-aze of vapor.

L      =    179.30 = 54.65m.
To prevent the hazard, the refinery has measures as follows:
i) Floating roof tanls are used for gasoline.
ii) Fire fighting system and fire extinguishers are equipped around tank
storage area.
iii) Cooling water will besprayed if there is any fire.
iv) Operators have been trained with respect to operations and safetv.
v) Other safety measures are similar to crude tanks.
6.3.4  Gas Oil HIDS Unit. Fuel Gas Treatment Unit and Sulfur Recoverv Unit
Risk assessment was perfonned for each unit. Calculation of impact in case
of fire using "Jet Fire" calculation and dispersion of hydrogen sulfide if there
is any leakage using "Plume Model" was performed. Results of the study are
as follows:
a) Gas Oil HDS Unit
In case there is a fire in this unit, heat flux of 12 KW/m2 or about 4,000
BTUthr-ft will cover the distance of 29 meters which will only affect the
nearby process unit. In case of hydrogen sulfide leakage, the maximum
concentration at ground level will be about 5.67 x 103o ppm at the
distance of 196 meters.

maximum concentration at ground level wil be about 1.27 x 1O ppm.
and will flow to a distance of about 87 meters.
c) Sulfur Recoverv TJnit
The dispersion study of hydrogen sulfide from SRU was perfonned by
plume model. The result indicates that if there is any leakage of
hydrogen sulfide, the maximum concentration at ground level will be
- about 525.3 ppm at the distance of 132 meters from the source of
leakage.
6.3.5 Preventive Measures
To Prevent fire and dispersion of gas, the following measures had been
considered:
a) Desisn of Process Unit
In the process units, safety valves are installed to control temperature
and pressure and to cut off flow or release pressure.
b) Fire Fighting and Foam Pipeline
Fire fighting facilities are instaUlled in the nearby area and available for
immediate use.
c)  Gas Detectors
Gas detectors are installed at the area where there is potential of risk.
d) Trainiinz of Personnel
Operators have been trained for safe operation and safetv practices.
6.3.6  Mitioation Measure
Bangchakl refinery has prepared Accident Prevention Plan for the refinery
including the pier area. The plan is composed of 3 main plans as foUows:
1. Emergency plan
2. Coordination and co-operation plan with other organization.
3. Migration plan
Preventive measures and mitization plans are described in Chapter 5

Enviromnental Saet Group (IESG) comprised of 10 memoer companies. The
IESG has a wrien agreement to cooperate on cleanup of spills The response
capablties are tiered according to size of spil, (see Figzure 7-3). Bangchak has
the capability to clean up an oil spill of 'tier one" volurme, that is, up to 200
barrels. Lager spills would require government assistance and the assistance of
TARC from Singapore (also a coopeative group). The ESG has a stockpie of
equipment for oil spil cleanup on the east coas: of the Gulf of Thailand at
Sriracha. IESG capabilities for "tier two" spills cover up to 5,000 barels. Tne
IESG manual covers contacts and member companies, the government, TARC
and equipment lists for each company.
7.2  Svill Prevention Control and Countermeasures M-CQ Plan
Bangchak's SPCC plan is the responsibliity of the Transportation Division. Since 1987,
spill conmainment booms have been deployed during every loading operabon at the river
jetty. With this precaution, if a spill occurs, thre is time to deploy skimmers and
absorbants- The Emergency Plan for the refinery includes firefighting, oil spi cleanup
and evacuation. Emergency Plan for fire prevenfion and extmnuishing is detailed in

Appendbi 3. Before the Emegecy Plan was prepared, a risk assessment was perfomed
for the refinty and included in the Environmental Impact Assessment Report for the
Plant 2 expansion.
7.2.1  Spill Control Provision at the Piers
Bangehaks piers have containment curbing and spill slop tanks below the hose
connections, ranging in volume from 2,500 liters to 10,000 liters. Blank flanges
are bolted to the hoses when not in use, with bolts in every other hole. The dates
of pressure testng are usually displayed on the hoses. The manifolds are
equipped with check valves. A perimeter ditch surrounds the onshore manifolds,
and is lead to the waste water treatment system. Spill containment booms are
deployed to encircle the entire ship for each loading operation. There is lighting
for night-time operations at the piers. Warning signs and the fire emergency plan
are posted.
7.2.2  Communications Eauimnent
Communications equipment maintained at the pier control room includes marine
band walde - talkies for communications with the oil companies and port
authority. A fire alarm is connected to the fire brigade location and the refinery
control room. The trwansrs are made with radio communication between the
pier and the tank farm pumphouse.
7.2.3  Soil! Conl Eudment
Spill control equipment mantained at tht control room includes: 25 drums of
(EXXON) feshwater oil dispersaz, sEmmer and suction pipe for diaphragn
pump; suction trucl; 3M absorbent (100 pc); suction hose; backpack dispersant
sprayers; portable diesel driven sprayer, mobile wagon dispersant sprayer to be
rum off fire hydrant system; and a workboat with boom spreader and dispersant
sprayer. Three spue oil containment booms are kept at the facilitv warehouse.
7.3 Safetv
7.3.1 International Standards used in Operaons
American Petroleum Intitute (API) engineeing standards were used in the
design of the jetty faihlities at Bangchak. Intemational standards have been used
for guides in operation of the jey fciities:
A. ISGOTT International Safety Guide for o0 Tankers and Terminals, OC]MF
International Chamber of Shipping Oil Companies, Interational Marine
Forum, intemational Association of Ports and Harbors, 1991.
B. Liquefied Gas Handling Principles, On Ships and In Terminals, McGuire and
Whize, SIGTTO, Bermuda, 1986.
C. OCDME, Tanker Safety and Polution Prevention, 1993.
Bangchak- Refinery has developed operating procedures for their own use and
onshore bulk liquid transfer operations. These docurnents include a Ship/Shore
Checklist for Jetty Operation. including instructions and an operation manual to
be completed in the first quarter of 1994.
7-s



An international safity standard guide is used for the following:
A. Forms for Transfer Operations,
B, Contingencv Plan for Spills and Fire,
C. Hose Certification and Hose Testing
D. Service Recommendations for Hoses,
E. Safety Checklist for Coastal Tanker Facilities,
F. Advance Information Forms for Lightering Operations.
Followup' on accidents is the responsibility of the SOT, that is, the Safety
Opeations Team. The coordinator for folUowup is the safety engineer, who is
responsible for collectng data and reporting to the government
7.3.2  Training
Traning programs are held each year in safety, firefighting emergency,dill and
hazardous materials handling. In addition, a safety orientation course and
firefighting course is given to every operator (according to Thai law, only 40
percent of the operators are required to have frefighting training). Last year at
Bangchak, 100 percent ofthe employees had firefighting training.
7.3.3  Supemsion of Work-Permits
Four kinds of work permits are issued to contractors at Bangchak Refinery 1)
cold work, 2) hot work, 3) vessel entry, 4) X-Ray. Each work pennit is
searated into categories. A checklist and attachm ents are provided for each
category. The work permits are prepared by the field engineer and che&ed and
accepted by the area supervisors. Ilspections and audits are carried out by the
Safey Promotion Team and Safety Foremen to countercheck the area authority.
If unsafe conditions are uncovered, work is stopped immediarely. Each permit is
good for only 8 hours of work. Work commenced on holidays and at niguh
requires special consideration by the operation learn because the support
functions are not available at the refinery. Therefore, this type of work permit is
avoided when possible or special precautions are taken after review by
management Contractors are required to have safety officers or safety engineers
to counter control with Bangchak safety engineers.
7.3.4  Contingencv Plans
The Bangchak Refinery Contingency Plan has been revised and reviewed and
updated twice this year. The Contingency Plan is regularly updated only once per
year. A meeting for orientation of supervisors is called on contingency drils,
once each year. BCP employees are given fire training and have completed the
highest level of training by a U.S. epert consultant course given in Thailand. Six
drils per year and classes and drills in respirators, firefighting technique are given
to Bangchak employees. Safety teams conduct safety equipment checks,
inmcluding foam, floating tardc seals, etc. besides the firefihtng equipment itselE
The Safety Engineer coordinates compliance with new Thailand safety laws.
Safery posters and safety awards are part of the safety management technique.

7.3.5 Ftre Suplression Svstems
The fire suppression system design was checked by Japanese and British
petroleum experts and modified according eo their recommnendauons. The
standards used in the fire suppression system are the NFPA or better.
Fire water for the fire suppression systemn is obtained from the river through
redundant pumps, both electric and diesel. There are three main fire water lines.
The pressure in the line is automatically controlled and set by jockey pumps. The
jockey pumps are all electic. The firewater pumps can be operated by the
control roonm remotely. The large firewater pumps are both diesel and electric.
In addition, the facity maintains several fire trucks, one foam truck two large
fire trucks, and two small fire trucks, plus an ambulance. Bangchak has recently
placed an order for a telescoping platform and rescue truck. The order is
expected to be filled within 10 months. The order would include rescue
equipment.
7.3.6  Tnnk1ann
The LPG spheres are equipped with water deluge systems. In addition, the tak
rm is equipped with a foam chamber and a foam truck. Hydrants for foam and
water and fire monitors are located throughout the plant and tank farm. All of the
bulk storage tanks are surrounded by dikes with ipervious (plastic liners topped
with asphalt) bases. The dikes surrounding the legt fuels have recently been
raised in order to contain the fill volume of the enclosed tanks.
7.3.7  Sft    neerin
The control room of the Bangchak Reflnery includes a fire alarm system and
automatic feed cutoffs for the processing units. The fire alarm system is
displayed on a site plan board and includes both fire alarms and gas leak
detectors. The fire pumps are automatically started and the system can be started
from the control room as well. The system is checked once each week. The
control room itself is an explosion proof bulding, and is protected with a halon
fire protection system.
A computerized control system in the refinery operations control room allows for
automatic shutdown of individual unit feeds and unit process operations in the
entire plant. Video monitors in the control room are tied to video cameras
located throughout the plam  The monitors are normally focused on the Bares
and the plant operation areas. The view field of the remote cameras can be
contmroled from the operations control room.
7.3.8  Preventive Maintenance of Equipment
Equipment in the Bangchak refinexy is subject to preventive maintenance as
described in Appendix 1.

Fire Prevention and Extinmshine Plan
Bangchak refinery has prepared emergency plan to prevent and extinguish fire which might
occur in process area tank farm area, tank truck loading area, railway loading and
unloading area, office buildings, laboratory, mainteace and warehouse. This plan will be
used in case of fire.
Fire prevention and extinguishing facilities in the Bangchak refinery consist of fire water
pumps and pipelines, fire-engine, hydrant system, mobile dry-chemical extinguisher, mobile
foam unit, wheeled foam generator, fixed water monitor, sprinker system and other
supporting facilities.
Bangchak refinery has a fSerstaion which is equipped with equipment, chemical for fire
extinguishing, personmel protection equipment and ambulance. Fire briades are on 24-
