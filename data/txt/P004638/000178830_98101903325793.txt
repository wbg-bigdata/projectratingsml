i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Public
Utilities Board (PUB) of Singapore consisting of the expansion of the
electric power distribution system for the three-year period 1969 through
1971. A Bank loan of US$20.5 million equivalent has been requested to
cover part of the foreign exchange cost of the project, the total cost
of which is estimated at US$43.3 million. The PUB has obtained suppliers'
credits to a value of US$5.6 million. The balance of the foreign cost
together with the local costs will be financed by the PUB from its own
resources.
ii.       The Borrower would be the Public Utilities Board which is an
autonomous, statutory corporation of the Government of Singapore. Four
loans have been made to the PUB: Loan No. 337 SI for US$15.0 million
equivalent for power in 1963; Loan No. 405 MA for US$6.8 million equiva-
lent for water supply in 1965; Loan No. 473 SI for US$10.0 million equivalent
for power in 1966 and Loah No. 503 SI for US$23.0 million equivalent for power
and water in 1967.  Experience with these loans has been satisfactory.
iii.      The project is technically sound; cost estimates are realistic
and construction arrangements are satisfactory.
iv.       The expected erowth of demand justifies the PUB's estimated ex-
penditure on distribution development during the three years covered by
the nroiect. and a ratp of return of about 130 can be exnected on the
project.

APPRAISAL OF PUBLIC UTILITIT BQARD
SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project which consists of
the distribution development program of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) of
Singapore for the three-year period 1969 through 1971, excluding the carry-
over from 1967/68 the foreign cost of which is covered by Bank Loan 503 SI
(see paragraph 1.03). The estimated cost of the project is S$130 million
(Us$43.3 million) and the Bank has been asked to make a loan of US$20.5
million to cover part of the foreign exchange cost.
1.02      The project would entail the installation of 430 Mva of primary
and 650 Mva of secondary distribution transformers, about 250 miles of
primary and secondary cables, switchgear and ancillary equipment for primary
and secondary substations.
1.03      The Borrower would be the PUB and the Guarantor would be the Govern-
ment of Singapore. The PUB has received four loans previously: US$15.0
million equivalent in May 1963 (Loan 337 SI) for the foreiga exchange cost
of the first stage of the Pasir Panjang "B" thermal stations USOP10.0 million
eauivalent in October 1966 (Loan 473 SI) to finance most of the foreign
exchange cost of the second stage of this station; US$6.8 million equivalent
in February 1965 (Loan 405 Ma) for the foreiqn exchange cost of the Johore
Water Supply Project, and US$23.0 million equivalent in June 1965 (Loan
503 ST) for the foreign exchange cost of the electric distribution expansion
program for 1967 and 1968 and a second water supply project.   The Pasir
Pnnjiano "B" thermnl stair.nvn anrd the *Tnhorq water Siinnlv proiet. were both

are proceeding satisfactorily and on schedule.   In the case of the distri-
bution developmPnt progrnm, funds covered by the loan Twzere fully committed
by the end of 1968, but some equipment will be installed during the early
part of 1969 anrd some final payments will fall due during 1969=  Tn tbis

2. THE POWER, WATER AND GAS SECTORS
2.01      The Republic of SingaDore is situated on a small island and some
40 adjacent islets, located just off the southern tip of the Malay penin-
sula (see map). Singapore is essentially a city-state, with an area
(including the islets) of some 225 square miles:   64 square miles of city
and urban development, 63 square miles of agricultural land. 24 square
miles of marsh and swamp, and 74 square miles of other land which has not
vet been fully develoned. The population is about two million, of' which
about 74% are Chinese, 14% Malay, and the remaining 12% principally of
Indian oriLin.
2.02      The economr has long been based mainly on trading; indeed-
Singapore is still basically a trading community even though a structural
change iS in progress, .^Tith manufactrwing both for home and export markets
being the leading growth sector.   Manufacturing output has developed at
an increais:ng rate durir.g the 1lat 1 ,  --s  an         s e   J +-nr indicatio vir4 . n
that load growth in this sector should very rapidly compensate for the loss
of demand which can. be ar.ticipated as a result of the phased withdr-awal of
the British forces on the island during the next three years. The per

two of which, located on adjacent islets, have a planned expansion program
over the next two or three years, and at least one additional large refinery
is scheduled to go into production by 1972.   These refineries are presently
theW ILT U  S largest, corisuri.ers of-L e1ect-rJJciDLy-
2.04'     The large industrial loas such as those described above and
other large industrial development which can be expected should have a
significant effect on the future increase in demand for power (see
paragraph 5.02).
2.05      The PUB is the sole authority in Singapore responsible for the
generatLon and distribution of electricity and for the operation of the gas
and water undertakings,
Facilities of the Electricity Department
2.06      The electricity system of the PUB is well designed andof a size
and extent adequate to supply existing demands. The present installed
generating capacity is 464 Mw consisting entirely of thermal plant which
includes a 22 Mw gas turbine installation and a 27 Mw free piston instal-
lation, the balance being conventional oil fired steam plant (Annex 1).
Since the PUB serves a metropolitan area comprising the city and its environs
located on the island of Singapore, there is no significant transmission
system. Until a few years ago power was transmitted at 22 kv from the
generating stations to main step-down substations for distribution over
the 6.6 kv primary distribution system. With the increase in load and load



-3-
density this arrangement became inadequate and a 66 kv network to connect
the main distribution centers with the generating stations was developed.
The 22 kv system was then largely converted to primary distribution purposes,
supplementing the 6.6 kv system. Future development envisages an increasing
emphasis on 22 kv primary distribution. The secondary distribution system is
400/230 volts. Industrial loads are supplied from the 22 kv and 6.6 kv or
the secondary distribution system depending on size and location.
2.07      The distribution system is underground except for some overhead
6.6 kv and secondary distribution serving rural development on the outskirts
of the city and outlying parts of the island. At the end of 1968 the PUB
had in service approximately 135 miles of 66 kv and 1,250 miles of 22 kv and
6.6 kv underground mains, 512 Mva of 66/22 kv and 600 Mva of 22/6.6 kv
primary distribution transformer capacity and about 675 Mva of secondary
distribution transformer capacity.
2.08      The Electricity Department's expansion program for the next three
years includes the commissioning of a further 240 Phi of generating plant at
the new Jurong thermal station which is mainly financed with suppliers' credits
together with the distribution development which includes the nroposed project.
Facilities of the Water Denartment
2.09      Thp maior nart. nf Singanorr' wanter supnlv rnmpg frnm thp Statp of
Johore in Malaysia where there are two catchment areas supplying water to
the Gumnong Pulai treatment. works plus three river supply sources without
storage (Tebrau, Scudai and Johore). An agreement with the Government of
J.ohore nprmits Johore to take over the Gunong Pulai works and tributary catch-
ments on four years' notice to Singapore. On Singapore island there is one
group  of thr ee adjo;--g   --+.n=en. areas  . ,+ wesrvroi rs which suplwae
to two treatment plants and there is also a small groundwater source on the
i        J.&1 -  Tbe com,.bined rel e yi - J1J-eld obt4i 4-LU,able thro,-ughL 44 intgae  op - r at ion
of all these sources is about 115 IMgd and is expected to increase to about
110 TMgd in 1969 when the ne-w Seletar reservoir and epnsion of the Woodleigh
treatment plant on the island (both financed under Loan 503 SI) are completed.
2.10      The wJater system includes about 1,100 miles of transmission and
diLsr.LbLLJUti.Lon1 IRILAL1. *  There are about C 4.U, V0  metered -wartc.e;r ser.-FrVcLOe conrLectiOnS
on the island of Singapore and about 2,000 metered public street hydrants.
The P'UB also m,takes bulk water sales to foreignl mRlitar-y establishUments in
Singapore and to the State of Johore.  An average of about 100 IMgd is pumped
froUmL the above sources (maximum about 110 'I-gd) and treated water distributed
averages about 95 IMgd.
2.11      It is expected that sales will increase approximately 3 to 4% an-
nually during the next three years and thereafter by approximately 5 to 676.
The slowrer rate of increase initially is due to the planned withdrawal of
the British Armed Forces during that period.



2.12      During the period 1969 through 1972, the Water Department's ex-
pansion program is estimated to cost S$93 million. This includes new dis-
tribution reservoirs and mains, and improvements and extensions to existing
treatment, storage and distribution facilities all being partly financed
under Loan 503 SI (the closing date of which is March 31, 1972). The logical
next step in expanding the water supply system would be the second stage of
the Johore River Project. However, as a means of reducing the island's re-
liance on water from Johore, the Government and the PUB appear to be more
inclined to first continue to develop the sources and storage of water on
the island of Singapore itself. Preliminary cost estimates indicate that
such project would be more costly than the second stage of the Johore River
works, requirina an investment of S$ 7 million instead of S$26 million.
Although operating costs of this island source are not known, unit costs
will be higher than those of water from Johore. The financial projections
assume that this island source project will be built during the coming
four years.
Facilities of the Gas Department
2.13      GnA is produced from fuel oil and production to meet thp present
demand averages about 4.5 million cubic feet per day. This is approaching
the effective capacity of the pnt. -Nrew plant is schedledi to go into pro-
duction in 1969/1970 which will increase the effective capacity to 6.5
nllincubicfet per day.        Thn e gas systerm has about 80,000 cons on ers and
about 450 miles of distribution mains.
2.14      It is anticipated that sales will increase at an annual rate of
aroud 8n for the next two yea-s, falling to 6% by 1973    nd that ouut w
reach about 6.5 million cubic feet per day by 1973.



3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The PUB is an autonomous public corporation responsible for the
electricity, water and gas utilities of Singapore. It was established on
May 1, 1963 by the Public Utilities Ordinance of 1963. Under this Act the
electricity, water and gas undertakings together with all related functions,
services, assets, liabilities and associated matters were transferred from
the Singapore City Council to the PUB. It is established as a single finan-
cial entity but is required to keep separate accounts for electricity, water
and gas.
Organization and Management
3.02      The Board is comiosed of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven
other members who are appointed by the President of the Republic for periods
not exeeeding thnrpe yearq- The Glovernment has suggested that members should
be increased from nine to twelve. At the present time the Board comprises
the Chai-man, Deputy Chair.mnn nnd six other members wThich leaves four vacan-
cies to be filled if the increased membership is approved by the President.
Board vnembez- are eligTibla for-e rep-nnnint-men-t.
3.03      The PUB is rq    r       wh the,- approval of the Government, to appoint
and employ a General Manager who shall, subject to the direction of the Board
on mat-ters of po-Lcy, be c1larged With th  directin of the business of the
PUB, its administration and organization, and the administrative control of
its employees.  It is also requ-red, wth the approval of the Governmvent
to appoint and employ a Chief Financial Officer and Chief Engineers for the
ElectriciLy, Water- and Gas Depar-tL-ments.  The Government consults i^rith the
Public Service Commission before granting approval of appointments to any
of the above posts.  In additlon, the PUB is required, pursuant to agree-
ments with the Bank in connection with the previous loans, to consult with
the Bank (and has done so) prior to making appoin4ments to the posts of
General Manager, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Electrical Engineer and
Chief water Engineer.
3.04      The PUB may appoint such other staff as it cons-iders necessary to
carry out its functions. The appointment, dismissal and disciplinary con-
trol of these employees are vested in the PUB, but the Governrment, after
consultation with the Public Service Commission, may require that for cer-
tain posts or classes of posts the FuB exercise such functions on the advice
of the Commission.
3.05      The organization, duties, responsibilities and powers of the PUB
as prescribed in the Ordinance were established in consultation with the
Bank prior to the first power loan. The provisions of the Ordinance are
generally satisfactory. The Government exercises its power with respect
to the PUB with due consideration to the desirability of giving the PUB
a high degree of autonomy in the conduct of its affairs.



3.06      To initially fill the posts of Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Engineers of the Electricity, Water and Gas Departments in 1963, City Council
officers holding corresponding posts were transferred to the PUB. The existing
staff of the Electricity, Water, Gas and Finance Departments were also trans-
ferred to the PUB. This enabled the operation of the utilities to continue
without interruption but as all departments of the City Council were short
of experienced senior staff, the PUB was faced with a staff shortage which
to date has not been fully solved.
3.07      On establishment of the PUB a person suitable for the position of
General Manager was not available and a senior civil servant was appointed
in an acting capacity as a temporary measure. This proved unsatisfactory
and the Bank expressed its concern and delayed consideration of Loan 473 SI
until a General Manager acceptable to it was appointed in 1966. Prior to
this the Chairman and the Board were assuming overall administrative respon-
sibilities and with this new appointment, it was hoped they would allow the
General Manager to exercise his duties and responsibilities as defined in
the Ordinance. However, this has not taken Dlace due to the Board's lack
of confidence in its General Manager. The extent to which the Chairman and
the Board still carry out the functions of management remains one of PUB's
main organizational problems.
3.08      Notuithstanding the management situation described in the preceding
paragraph, the PUB is presently operating   n a    sn-ly satisfactory man-
ner. However, there are indications of poor staff relations and lack of co-
ordination between the different dep-artments much of Iwhich is the result of
lack of close and effective management. This situation could deteriorate
and unfavorably affect the efficient operatnon of the PUB if'f npprrnriate
action is not taken quickly.   The contract of the present General Manager
-L-       - e   iJly 196°, a.d bhe hass .d.1nica  that. _he  rl no  ua..t it red
The first essential step therefore would be the appointment of a new General
Manager with wide management experience in a public utility.    In the meantime
vacancies on the Board should be filled with men of wide business experience
and the non=policy matt2rs at present han.dled by the Boad should be pro-
gressively assumed by the General Manager.
3.09      These matters were discussed during negotiations and the Chairman
em,phasized his and the Board' s -wish to ensure that a''  functions of management
should be assumed by the General Manager as soon as a suitably qualified man
can be obtainied Ior tlis appoirtument.  Action has already been taken to ad-
vertise this appointment on an international basis. The Chairman also said
that ithe Government may decide not to proceed with i's intention t-o increase
Board membership from nine to twelve; in the meantime he was hoping to obtain
a man with wide business experience and preferably with an engineering back-
ground to fill the existing vacancy on the Board.
3.10      The PUB engaged the services of a management consulting firm (R. W.
Beck and Associates of the USA) early in 1965 to make a comprehensive study



-7-
of its organization and to prepare recommendations aimed at improving its
efficiency. The consultants' report was submitted in October 1965, and in
accordance witn Loan Agreement 473 SI, the PUB has consulted with the Bank
from time to time on the actions it proposes to take on the recommendations
contained in the report. Organizational changes have been slow, due initially
to the absence of a General Manager but more particularly to a shortage of
experienced staff. Lately the PUB has been making some progress, but the
staff shortage persists and the situation is aggravated by the need to staff
new sections such as the Planning and Load Dispatch Sections and the new
Jurong thermal station which is scheduled for commissioning in 1969.
3.11      The PUB experienced difficulty in recent years as the result of
the replacement of expatriates by not fully qualified local personnel in
many senior and supervisory posts. This led to the introduction of a program
for training engineers, electrical technicians and power station operating
staff. The program which includes the training overseas of some supervisory
and specialist staff is beginning to yield results and the situation is gra-
dually improving. In the meantime. however, PUB's exDanding power operations
require the appointment of the following specialist staff:
(a) Commercial Engineer who should be widely experienced in the com-
mercial oneration of an electricity authority to train the com-
mercial staff in the economics of large power supplies and to
sunervise the introduction of the proposed new j
(b) Plqnning and Development Engineer to take chr ge of the new Plnning
and Development Section.
(c) Load Dispatch Engineer who should be widely experienced in the
opneratio-n of &n intearC -- ec +ed -yster to 4-ke charge of tbe toadI
Dispatch Section and train the staff when the Jurong thermal

Chief Financial Officer to which the Bank would have no objection.
3.13      The additional officers listed in paragraph 3.11 were discussed
Uur.Lg negot.ations and the Chairman of the PUB has since given a written
undertaking that immediate steps will be taken to appoint a suitably qual-

to promote from PUB's existing staff, a suitably qualified engineer to head

Tariffs
3.14      The PUB has authority to set tariffs without reference to the
Government though in practice tariffs are not varied without consulting
it.
3.15      Under the terms of the Ordinance and the existing loans, the
PUB is required to maintain tariffs for the sale of electricityv water
and gas and for the hiring of appliances which will produce revenues suf-
ficient: to cover onerating   YnRneAR  innlnriirting tfqs=  if any; tn nrovide

anud pertMit an adequate contribution by each department to the finan-
cial resources of the PUB. The overall rate of return covenant of not less
than 8% on the average value oI totai net fixed assets in operation nas been
repeated for the proposed loan.
3.17      The tariffs for water yield an average at present of S$1.06 per
thousand imperial gallons sold (US$0.29 per thousand US gallons), an increase
of about 30% over the tariffs in force before the 1966 increase. The gas
tariffs bring an average of about 3.95 cents Singapore (US cents 1.3) per
unit which represents an increase of about 6% and the electricity tariffs
listed in Annex 2 yield an average of 7.00 cents Singapore (US cents 2.3)
per kwh sold.
Electricity Tariff Structure
3.18      Although more than adequate for the purpose of reachingthe required
level of revenue the electricity tariffs were obviously designed for appli-
cation during the earlier years when electricity usage was more widespread and
less intensive. Asaresult,the tariff pattern now shows anomalies and dupli-
cations and is inadequately spread over the whole range of consumers (see
Annex 2). Hence there is a case for re-casting the tariffs and establishing
a simpler and more rational structure. This was recognized by the Bank mis-
sion which appraised Loan No. 503 SI and assurances were obtained from the



- 9 -
PUB at that time that consultants would be engaged to review the
tariff structure. Electrowatt of Switzerland was subsequently engaged,
and this firm submitted its report and recommendations in April 1968 (see
Annex 2).
3.19      Electrowatt's recommendations have been examined by the PUB but
no action has yet been taken on these apart from the application of a
single meter tariff to new hotels when these are connected to the supply.
3.20      Action should be taken as soon as possible on the consultants'
recommendations and cost related tariffs should be introduced for-the
large commercial and industrial consumers without delay in view of the
expanding to-m.fmTerJial and industrial load.  It is also considered desirable
that tariffs which require separate meters for lighting and power should
be replaced as soon as possible.
3.21      These ratters were discussed during negotiations and the PUB has
undertaken to introduce revised tariffs substantially in accordance with
Electrowatt's recommendrzat ons within three years from the date the loan
agreement is signed.
Accounting System
3.22      In accordance with the requirements of the existing Loan Agreements,
the PuB carried out a reorganization of its accountirng system. assisted hby its
external auditors, Messrs. Turquand, Youngs and Company. The annual report
for 1966 presented the accounts for the first tim.e on a comrmnercial basis,
properly reflecting operating costs and depreciation charges. Further re-
finements were introduced during 1967. 1fMaunagemuent reporting has greatly
improved and the recent appointment of a Budget Officer should result in
more meaningful budget control and a further Improvement Ln the m.anagemen
of the PUB's affairs. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations
that independent auditors satisfactory bo the B-nk will continue to be
employed.
3.23      The PUB keeps separate accounts for each of the Trading Departments
(Water, Gas, Electricity), the Transport Center and the Service Departm,ents
(General Manager's, Architects, Finance, the latter includes such services
as billing and collection). The total cost of the Service Departments andu
Transport Center are charged to the three revenue producing departments.
Water, gas and electricity meters are read monthly by the same readers and
one bill is sent out for the three services. Non-payment of a bill results
in prompt cut-off of one or more of the services. This procedure works
well and there is no problem concerning uncollected accounts!/. Accounts
1/ The PUB also collects the Oovernment's sewage fee and the recently
instituted surtax of 10% on all utility bills in excess of S$20 (bills
below S$10 are exempt and bills between S$10 and S$20 carry a 5% surtax).
Both the sewage fee and surtax are included in the utility bill, but
not shown in the income statements.

receivable and payable are kept for the PUB as a whole and consequently are
not shown on the separate balance sheets for the Electricity, Water and
Gas Departments. The cash balance or deficit shown for each department is
a theoretical figure only, the actual balance being that shown for the PUB
as a whole.
Past Earnings and Present Financial Position
3.24      Actual (and projected) income statements, cash flow statements
and balance sheets for the Electricity Department and for all departments
on a consolidated basis are shown in Annexes 3 through 8.
3.25      The following table summarizes the return on average net fixed
assets in opertionn fnr PAcGh nf the- tradinp denartrments and the PUB as a
whole for the period 1964 through 1967 (actual) and 1968 (preliminary):

1964          11.3%          6.4%     10.6%        9.6%
1965           6.1          6.%48159

1968 (prel.) 12.4%          10.9%      8.2%       11.5%
The table clearly shows that after the return had sharply dropped in 1965
due to new tax measures of the Governmenrt, the PUB was put on a sounrd finran=
cial footing again by the tariff increases of November 1966 and the removal
of the tax on fuel in thiat. year.  TLhe PUB's debL servJce coverage averaged
2.1 times during the period 1964-1968.

3.28      The loans subject to sinking-fund requirements were trans-
ferred from the former Singapore City Council. The terms of these loans
vary from 20 to 40 years, the last maturing in 1985; interest varies
between 3% and 5%. Most of the Singapore Government loans made since
1963 have a 20-year amortization period without grace (one loan of
S$10 million has a five-year period) and carry an interest varying from
5-3/4% to 6½!.
3.29      Until recently about 50% of the sinking-fund contributions
were invested in sterling securities and the remainder in Singapore
bonds. Sterling devaluation resulted in a net loss of S$5.3 million
in the value of the sinking-fund's sterling investments. In addition,
the interest income on the sinking-fund investments fell short of the
anticipated 5%. In order to ensure that accumulated funds will be
sufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due, the annual sinking-
fund contribution was increased by about 30% effective January 1, 1968.
3.30      At the request of the Singapore Government all sterling invest-
ments held by the sinking fund as at May 1, 1968, were transferred to
the Government at par value in exchange for Government bonds of equivalent
nominal value with similar repayment terms and interest rates. The
sinking-fund's financial position was not affected by the conversion
except that any future change in the parity rate of sterling will have
no effect on the fund's investments. The PUB has assured the Bank that
the sinking fund will continue to be managed on a sound basis so as to
ensure that funds invested will be sufficient to meet the liabilities
in resnect of the loans as thev fall due. A renort of the external
auditors, dated March 3, 1969, on the operation of the sinking fund was
satisfactorv.

3.31      Under the existing Loan Agreement with the Bank, the PUB is not
to incur any long-term indebtedness without the Bank's agreement unless
net revenues oover the maximum debt service requirements at leas 1.5 tLimes.
Under these covenants debt is defined as being incurred when it is drawn
down. This covenant has been maintained in the new Loan Agreement.
3.32      In 1964-1965 the PUB had tenporarily incurred some short-term debt
and a covenant had been introduced under Loans 473 and 503 SI, limiting such
debt to S$12 million unless the Bank would otherwise agree. The PUB elimin-
ated this short-term debt in 1966. Agreement has been reached with the PUB
on a more flexible covenant limiting short-term debt to a maximum of 15% of
the PUB's operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of the previous year.

4. THE PROJECT
L.Oi      The estimated cost of the PUB's total capital program during the
period 1969-1971 amounts to S$302 million. During the three-year period
estimated canital exnanditure on the develonment of water facilities will
amount to S$64 million (paragraph 2.12); the Gas Department's capital
program (paragnrh 29 1' is ei m etlA tno amnmt to about S$9 million: and
the Electricity Department's capital program for the development of genera-
tion And distribution facilities is rneCted e    at o  imo nto about S$207
million. The capital program also provides for S$22 million to be expended
on the developmen^ t of a^.inistrativre facilities innuding the new office

4.03      The generating facilities would be installed in Jurong Power
Station. The first stage of Jurong (comprising two 60 Mw generators)
which has been partly financed by suoDliers' credits is nearing completion
and is scheduled for commissioning during the latter part of 1969. A
contract for the second stage comprising a further two 60 Mw generators has
been placed and this is scheduled for commissioning in 1970/71. As in the
case of the first stage this is also to be nartlv financed by suppliers'
credits. The station is designed for ultimate expansion to a planned
capacit.y of 480R Mwi wwi;th the third stpag  of eonstruction comnrising two
120 Mw generators. The first of the 120 Mw units is scheduled to commence
operation in 1973 hut no orders have vet been placed for this plant and

4.09      The plaL  ng and design of the expansion of the electric dis-
tribution system is being carried out by the Electricity Department of the
PU'B, which seeks the advice of consultants (Merz & McLellan, London) -with
respect to particular problems. Following normal PUB practice, the bulk
of tne power distribution construction work and the installation of equip-
ment will be carried out under PUB supervision. The remainder of the work
will be carried out by PUB' s own staff. These arrangements are satisfactory.

recommended that consultants be engaged to carry out a study of the
basic distribution development program, to report on this,  and to

additional work recommended in the report. Assurances were received during
negotiations that the PUB would submit to the Bank any further recommenda-
tions made by the Montreal Engineering Company Ltd. in its final report on
the development of the electricity system and would consult the Bank about
any proposed action on these recommendations.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      The PUB's distribution development is a continuing program.  Much
of the material which is required is specialized equipment and it is neces-
sary that orders should be placed some 12-18 months ahead of the time this
equipment is scheduled for installation to ensure deliveries on time.
4.14      The work scheduled during early 1969 will principally comprise
the carry-over from 1967A968 which is being partly financed frcm Bank Loan
503 SI. To a large extent equipment in stock would be used for the balance
of the 1969 program.
4.15      The PUB has traditionally purchased equipment on the basis of
international competitive tendering and specifications for equipment re-
quired for the project have been prepared with this in view. Procurement
actions which have been taken bv the PUB are in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines.
4.16      To ensure continuity of its program the PUB invited tenders
during the latter nart of 1968 for much of the equipment which will hb
required during 1969 and 1970 and to take advantage of favorable prices
it is the PHTR  intpntion to Pvtond the quantities where appropriate to
include also equipment required during 1971. Offers in response to these
tenders have now bhen receive    and it ic atcmated that equipmr,ent to t-he
value of about US$13.0 million is involved.



- 17 -
4.17      mi cases where it has not been possible to extend the validity of
tenders or where deferring the order would have jeopardized the continuity
of the distribution development program the PUB has managed to obtain
suppliers' credits. Orders for equipment to the value of about US$5.6 million
which will not be reimbursable .from the Bank loan have been placed on this
basis. An extension of validity of tenders received has been obtained in
respect of the balance of the equipment which is involved and orders for this
equipment will be deferred until after the loan is approved.
4.18      Disbursements would be made against presentation of the usual
documents evidencing expenditure of foreign exchange for equipment, materials
and services. Since this is an ongoing program, it is nroposed that if any
savings materialize on the project as presently defined, they be used for
the purchase of equipment required for the early part of 1972.



5.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Market for Power
5.01      The market for power comprises the domestic, commercial and
industrial sectors and street lighting. The number of consumers at the
end of 1968 was about 226,000. New connections have been growing at the
rate of about 11.0% per annum for the past six years. There is no indi-
cation that this rate is likely to fall appreciably in the foreseeable
future. Sales by the Electricity Department during the period 1964-1968
increased at an annual rate of just over 15%. Sales in 1968 amounted to
1,h47 million kwh. Annex 10 gives details of actual sales for the period
1964-1968, and a forecast for the period 1969-1973 under the different
consumer categories.
5.02      PTBts forecasts show An average gretf*h rnte of about, 16% for the
next 3 bears, falling to about 15% by 1972 and to 11.55) by 1973.

would be attributable to the large new commercial and industrial loads
expected du-ring the ne-xt+ three or fou years  These forecasts have taken
into account the effect of the phased withdrawal of the British armed
forces and of the new .0%surta     intex (paragraph 3re r -i

to 1974. Future large commercial and industrial loads, for which allowance
ruut be made, are based on trends in the establishment of new industries,
information given by the Economic Development Board, and on known new
potentiaI consumers. Experience has generally shown a lag in load build-up
for this type of consumer; often the establishment of an industry forecast
two or three years anead is either deferred for a year or so or never
materializes. This factor has been recognized by using two maximum demand
curves;, the lower curve has been used for revenue forecasts and the upper
curve for planning system development.
5.04      The larger loads referred to above cause a considerable distortion
in the growth pattern, and it is probable that in the longer term the growth
rate will suffer some regression as the incidence of new large loads becomes
smaller.  This has been recognized in the forecast sales of energy (Annex 10)
which shows the annual increase in sales falling to 11.5% in 1973 (see
paragraph 5.02).
The Development Program
5.05      The expansion of the 66 kv and 22 kv primary distribution systems
is necessary to meet the developing industrial load. Expansion of the
66 kv primary distribution system is also necessary to interconnect the
main thermal stations when the new Jurong thermal station is commissioned



In 1969, a7 d  to transmit Vte increa8ed output (initially 120 Mw) to the
existing and new substations included in the program. xpawnsion of the
dAstribuotian system (6.6 kv and under) is necessary to meet the normal
system load growth.
Rate of Return
5.06      An attempt has been made to determine the rate of return on
the PUB's distributian development program for the three-year period
(1969 through 1971) covered by the project. The method adopted is shown
in Annex 12.
5.07      Since it was not possible to quantify the total benefits
accurately, calculations were limited to measuring the increment in net
revenues attributable to the proposed investment, valuing output at cur'
rent tariffs. On this basis the rate of return on the total cost of the
distribution development program for the period 1969 through 1971 is
expected to be about 13%.
5.08      In order to examine the effect of uncertainty in the assumptions
which necessarily had to be made, the estimates of costs and revenues were
subjected to variations of Dlus or minus 10%. On the basis of this tvne of
analysis  the rate of return wjould be within the range of 9d to 16%.

6.02      During the four-year period the PUB would cover L7% of its
total capital expenditures by funds generated during this period. The
PUB will also use utn cash reserves to the extent of $A II, million during
the period.  In total, therefore, the PUB would cover 56% of its capital
expenditures with its own funds.

6.05      The PUB's debt service coverage as forecast is satisfactory
and although expected to drop from 1.9 times in 1969 to 1.8 in 1970 and
1971, it should improve to 2.3 times in 1973.
6.06      The PUB's future financial position as forecast is satisfactory
and the estimated overall debt/equity ratio would improve from 49:51 in
1969 to 38:62 in 1973, Annex 8 gives the consolidated balance
sheets for the PUB for the period 1964 through 1973; separate balance
sheets for the Electricity Department are shown in Annex 7.

6.07      The existing covenants regarding the maintenance of an overall
return of 8% (paragraph 3.16), sound management of the sinking fund
(paragraph 3.30). and limitation of long-term debt (paragraph 3.31) are
adequate and have been repeated in the new Loan Agreement.  The PUB has
also agreed on a more flexible short-term debt limitation covenant
(paragraph 3.32).

7,.0      The Board is stilu assuming functions of management, but it
is hoped that this situation will improve with the appointment of a
suitably qualified General Manager to replace the present holder of this
post whose contract expires in July 1969 (paragraph 3.09).
7.06      The financial position and prospects of the PUB are satisfac-
tory and a rate of return in excess of the agreed 8% should be achieved
during the period 1969 through 1973 (paragraphs 6.04 and 6.06).
7.07      During negotiations the following assurances were obtained:
(a)  That action will be taken to recruit specialist staff
listed in paragraph 3.11.
(b)  That revised tariffs substantially in accordance with
the recommendations contained in Electrowatt's report
will be introduced within 3 years from the date the loan
agreement is signed (paragraphs 3.20 and 3.21).
(c)  That the PUB will consult with the Bank in regard to the
actions it proposes to take on Montreal Engineering
Company's recommendations -on ne-tlTork development (para. 4.12).
(d)  That short-term debt will be limited to a maximum of 15%
of the PUB's operating costs (paragraph 3.32).
7.08      The covenants adopted in Loans No. 337-SI, 405-MA, 473-SI

The Electric Power Rates
The existing electricity tariffs which are detailed hereunder
are divided into eight tariff groups each comprising kwh rates only and
none charging for maximum demand.   The tariff groups are dist-inagished
by consumer category and by consumption per consumer. The groups are
classified under letters A to H in ascending order of energy consumption,
but lighting loads of any size come into the same group (A). The four
lower grouns (A-D) speinefy the electricity usage for ligh.ting (domestic
and non-domestic), domestic power, lifts and commercial/industrial power.
The four higher groups (E-H mre for application to large commmercial and
industrial supplies and incorporate a minimum monthly consumption feature
in the design of the tariff.   Special tariffs similar in natu-e to the
non-domestic lighting tariff are available for amusement parks, cinemas,
street lighting     +.- traffic Si gryn .

All tariffs are subject to a minimum monthly charge clause, and
tariffs F, G and H are additionally subject to a fuel cost variation clause
and a Power Factor and Load Factor clause. Tariffs G and H are also res-
tricted hour tariffs in that the consumer must agree, if so required, to
curtail his load to one-third normal load in the case of Tariff G, and one-
half normal load in the case of Tariff H during peak hours.



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 5 pages
The tariffs are of two basic forms:
(a) Block rate tariffs (A, C, D, E and H) in which successive blocks
of kwh consumed per month carry different rates.
(b) Flat rate tariffs (B. F and G) in which all kwh consumption carrias
the same rate.
Although more than adequate for the purpose of raising the required
level of revenue these tariffs were obviously designed for application during
the earlier years when electricity usage was less wide spread and diverse.
As a reullt, the tnriff nattern now shows anomalies and duplication, and is
inadequately spread over the whole range of consumers. Some of the more
obvious anomalies are showxn hereunder:
(a)  All excpnt. lA-g  commercialn and industrial consumers have senarate
tariffs for lighting and power. This means double metering for
most consu-mers, and more costly  installation rosts.
(b)  Tariffs A.2 and C -re identical and revenue wll-d be the same if
these were combined.
(c) Duplication is also presented in Tariffs B and D where revenue is
identical up to 5,000 kwh per month.
(d)  The domestic lighting tariff is non-promotional in that the second
block of kwh at 18 cents per kwh is higher than the first block at
12 cents per kwh.
(e)  Half the available tariffs cater for a small minority of 30 or 40
consumers and the minimum consumption conditions of Tariffs G and
H are set so high that currently no consumer can fulfill them.
(f) There are no voltage related tariffs.
The emphasis of the electricity charges on energy consumption
e no longer reflects the modern cost structure of an undertaking in
i the system power demand and the voltage dependent distribution losses
ie growing importance, and while the existing tariffs may be adequate
,amote the required revenue today, this may not necessarily be the
in the future.
The consultants (Electrowatt of Switzerland) who were engaged by
UB to review the tariff structure have formulated a simple and more
ial structure in which all tariffs have stepped energy rates depending
) incremental supply costs at the various load factors to which the
energy blocks correspond, with the lowest follow-on rate reflecting the
marginal production cost. Briefly the consultants recommend the replacement
of the existing eight tariffs with four tariffs (two low voltage block rate
and two high voltage two part tariffs). A change in the special tariff for
application to cinemas, amusement parks, etc. is also proposed, but no change
is proposed in the street lighting tariff.

The tariffs which are recommended and which are detailed hereunder
are of sophisticateA desiA-i and the "rate have 'ben Aoer"minoA ton bhrina in
the same levels of revenue as the existing tariffs.
The consultants' recommendations include a range of alternative
running charges for each of the five main tariffs and sufficient material
is provided in their Supplementary -Report to allow tariff rates to be se-
lected and adjusted in accordance with the Board's wishes. The following
rates show the consultants' preferred alternatives.

Method and Assumptions Made to Determine the
Incremental Rate of Return on the Project
The works covered by the proposed project constitute the Distri-
bution Development Program for the period 1969 through 1971 excluding work
carried over from 1968, which is partly financed from Bank Loan 503 SI. All
calculations were done over the period of the life of the assets covered
by the project, which was taken as 30 years. Solely for the purposes of
calculating the incremental rate of return, it has been assumed that power
is distributed by a hypothetical entity separate from the generating func-
tion and that this distributing entity, being solely responsible for dis-
tribution, would buy the energy.
Costs of the Project
The capital cost of the project is estimated to be approximately
S$130 million. Operating costs consist of two elements: distribution costs
and generating costs. Distribution operating costs were calculated in terms
of cents per kwh sold; these were estimated to hold approximately constant
for the first five years but have been increased by 3% per annum over the
rest of the asset life because of expected increases in operation and main-
tenance costs. Generatine operating costs include an 8% return on the gen-
erating system and the total generating costs to be borne by the distri-
bution function was calculated at about 1.8 SingaDore cents per kwh sold
during the first year, falling to 1.6 Singapore cents per kwh sold by the
fifth year but increasing somewihat thereafter due to exnected increases in
total generation operating costs.
Revenue from the Project
In order to estimate the incremental revenue attributable to the
project as distinct from. tha attributable to the eyisting distribution
system, it was estimated that about 20% of the year's increase in revenue
could be attributed to the project for     first  ear, about [0% of the
first two year period's increase for the second year, about 50% of the
first three year period' s increase lfor l-hLAe thn i rd year, anbout 6A(v of' the
first four year period's increase for the fourth year and about 75% of the
fi.r-st t-ve year period'ls irc,-rease fLo,- the fifQhvt year and thereanftner-.
iie bhigbh pr-oportion. of- incremer,tal rever.-ue at tributable to +he
project is due to the large proportion of capital expenditure directly re-
laied to supply-ing new large industrial and commercial consumers.
Althougn total reveaue wvas assumed to increase from. the fifth
year onwards, the income per kwh sold was held steady throughout the period
of the calculations on the expectation that the natural tendency for the
average revenue per kwh to decrease due to the increasing industrial sales
would be offset by increases in tariff levels to maintain an acceptable flinan-

Incremental Rate of Return
Taking account of the time streams of capital and operating costs
of the project together with the-revenues attributable to the project, all
in the manner described above, an incremental rate of return of about 13%
is obtained. To examine the effects of uncertainty in the main assumptions
the estimates of capital costs were first reduced by 10% whilst the estimated
operating costs and attributable revenues were increased by 10%. Secondly,
the estimated capital costs were increased by 10% whilst the estimated op-
erating costs and attributable revenues were reduced by 10%. This gave a
limiting range in the incremental rate of return of about 9% to 16%.
