KHAO LAEM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal indigenous sources of energy in Thailand are hydro-
power, limited petroleum and lignite, large but as yet uneconomic oil shale
deposits, wood fuel, charcoal, paddy husk and bagasse. Hydro potential
(excluding that of two international rivers, the Mekong and the Salween) is
estimated at about 9,300 MW of which 910 MW are now in operation; 2,200 MW
in 9 projects are under construction or programmed for implementation
before 1990; 870 MW in 15 projects are in the prefeasibility or feasibility
study stage and about 1,900 MW in 12 projects have been selected by EGAT
for conceptual studies (further details are given in Annex 1). The remainder,
3,420 MW in about 93 sites have only been potentially assessed by the
National Energy Administration (NEA). The Mekong river, which forms the
border between Thailand and Laos and then flows through Kampuchea and Viet
Nam, and the Salween river in Burma, have together a total hydro potential
in nine projects of about 24,000 MW with an annual energy output of 144,000
GWh about 12 times Thailand's electricity consumption in 1978 and 3.5 times
the forecast electricity required in 1990. The Mekong's development is
governed jointly by Thailand, Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea but serious
resettlement problems exist. The Salween's development is dependent on
Burmese cooperation and Thailand has proposed sending a high-level delegation
to pursue the matter. Thailand's proven petroleum reserves total about
1 million barrels in the Fang province of Northern Thailand. Production
at present is less than 20,000 tons a year, about 0.2% of total domestic
petroleum consumption. The total lignite (low-grade coal) reserves in
Thailand were estimated at about 235 million tons of which about 110-130
million tons are proven. A recent estimate indicated that lignite reserves
might be as high as 650 million tons in total and may ultimately be capable
of supporting 2,000 MW of generating capacity. EGAT has plans to utilize the
known reserves for power generation by adding two units of 150 MW (Nos. 4 and
5) at the Mae Moh thermal plant in Northern Thailand. The Bank recently
appraised a project for the expansion of lignite mining for use by the fourth
unit which is expected to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
There are extensive oil shale reserves (about 2,500 million tons), mainly in
the remote areas of Tak province but oil production from shale is still
uneconomic.
1.02      Intensive exploration for oil and gas is currently being carried
out in the Gulf of Thailand and in the North-east. Two promising gas fields
have been discovered in the Gulf: structure "A", about 425 km offshore, is
owned by the Union Group; and structure "B", about 595 km offshore, by the
Texas Pacific Group. The proven gas reserves of these two fields are 1.6
trillion cubic feet (tcf) of good quality gas and 1.3 tcf of lower quality
gas. Probable gas reserves are estimated at a further 4.7 tcf. The Bank has
made a loan (S-10-TH) to the Natural Gas Organization of Thailand (NGOT) /L
for the first phase of development of Thailand's natural gas potential by
financing the foreign exchange cost of the project management, engineering
/1   NGOT was recently taken over by the petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT).

services and other related studies required prior to construction of the
pipeline which would carry the natural gas to the Bang Pakong pcwer station
under construction about 60 km southeast of Bangkok, and also to the Bangkok
area by 1982. The pipeline project has been appraised and a loan proposal is
expected to be put to the Board in FY80. The substitution of natural gas for
imported oil would reduce the demand for fuel oil for power generation.
1.03      An energy study is being undertaken by NEA financed by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), with ADB as the executing agency. The
objectives of this study is to define a program to meet Thailand's energy
requirements up to the year 2000. The study is expected to be concluded by
end 1981. The Bank will be closely associated with the study.
1.04      Total energy consumption in the FY70-78 period increased from
about 7.4 million tons of oil equivalent (77.2 trillion kcal) to 14.4 mil-
lion tons (150.2 trillion kcal), an average annual growth rate of 9.0%.
GNP increased by 6.7% p.a. during the same period.
1.05      Energy consumption by types in FY78 is shown below:
Energy consumption (in trillion kcal)    Percent

Total                        150.2                          100.0
Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.06      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1.4% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 21.3% and 1.6% of GDP respectively.
1.07      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Thailand's
economic development. Between FY75 and 78, when GDP grew at an average rate
of about 6.4% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an average
rate of about 13.8%. The elasticity coefficient of 2.1 is reasonable and
comparable to countries at a similar stage of development.
1.08      Electricity is the cheapest method of providing lighting and motive
power in rural areas and Thailand has embarked on a program to provide all
villages in the country with electricity by the end of the 1980s (see para.
1.37).

Sector Organization
General
1.09      The power sector consists of eight government agencies, three
state utilities and the ministries to which they report, and five private
franchises whic`' are so small as to be insignificant (para. 1.16).
tenerally, the three state utilities supply nearly all of the electricity
consumed in the country, the private franchises and captive plants comprised
about 13% of the installed capacity in FY78 (see para. 1.30).
1.10      The state-owned utilities are the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Highlights of the EGAT, MEA and PEA
operations are shown in Annex 2.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
1.11      EGAT, which is responsible to the Prime Minister's office, was
established in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government Corporation for the purpose
of increasing the efficiency of electricity supply throughout the country
and coordinating the generation and transmission systems. EGAT generated
95% of all electric energy in Thailand in FY78; the balance was generated by
PEA, NEA, private franchises and self-generating industries.
1.12      EGAT and the Bank have been in partnership since 1957 when the
first loan was made for power to EGAT's predecessor. EGAT has grown into a
well-organized and operated utility which is comparable in efficiency to
any utility in the world, using modern techniques of planning and operation.
The Bank's role in EGAT's institution building phase is nearing completion
and future Bank assistance should be directed to sector-type rather than
project lending (see Chapter 2 - The Borrower).
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority
1.13      MEA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government Corporation
responsible to the Ministry of Interior with the responsibility for supplying
electricity to the Bangkok Metropolitan area covering the provinces of
Bangkok, Thon Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY78, 6,807 GWh were
sold to 607,000 consumers. Compared with FY77, GWh sales and the number of
consumers increased by 12.4% and 4.7%, respectively. All of MEA's power is
purchased from EGAT. The Bank has never been asked to assist MEA,/1 and,
in consequence, it has not been possible to transfer Bank sectoral and
institutional technology to MEA.
The Provincial Electricity Authority
1.14      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly-owned Government
Corporation under the Ministry of Interior with responsibility for providing
and distributing electricity in all provinces of the 2ountry except in the
areas served by MEA.  PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from EGAT but
also generates a small quantity of electricity in area.s not yet connected to
the grid. In FY78, PEA generated 84 GWh; 3,650 GWh were sold to 1,350,000
consumers. Compared with FY77, GWh sold and the number of consumers connected
increased by 15.0% and 18.0%, respectively.               f
/1 Foreign fund requirements have been supplied by ADB.



-4-
1.15      PEA is the Government agency responsible for implementing the
rural electrification program (paras. 1.08 and 1.37). The program only
substantially began with Loan 1527-TH made by the Bank to PEA in 1978 for
the first major phase of the program. The utility is encountering difficulty
in the areas of planning, procurement and financial management largely as a
result of the rapid expansion of its operations brought about by the rural
electrification program.
Private Franchises
1.16      Following the fuel crisis and Government's policy of restricting
tariff increases, most of the franchises asked to be taken over by PEA.
Since FY76, 48 franchises have been purchased leaving 5 in private hands at
the end of FY78; three of them purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA;
one directly from EGAT; the remaining franchise had an installed capacity of
only 20 KW and generated 10 MWh in FY78.
Government Agencies
1.17      The eight Government agencies which have a direct interest in
the power sector (para. 1.09) are as under:
- Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD);
Budget Bureau;
= Tariff Rate Committee (TRC);
N ational Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB);
- Ministry of Finance (MOF);
- National Energy Administration (NEA);
- Rural Electrification Board (REB); and
- Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
These agencies review: tariff recommendations, capital project proposals and
budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual financial perform-
ance; and requests for Government equity and loans. None of them has overall
policy responsibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after all the
agencies including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system is
designed to ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly controlled,
but the fiscal emphasis of the approval process has constrained sector
development. The interest of PTT in the sector arises from the fact that EGAT
will be the predominant customer for natural gas.
Sector Objectives
1.18      Although Thailand's three power utilities operate with a considerable
degree of autonomy, each is expected to pursue common power sector objectives.
These are: (a) to ensure sufficient production and supply of electricity
throughout the kingdom; (b) diversify electricity generating sources to promote



5-
the use of new sources of energy such as natural gas and lignite in place of
imported oil; (c) to encourage international cooperation for the development
of water resources and other natural resources for power generation and the
establishment of international transmission system interconnection; (d) to
regulate the tariff within a reasonable range inter alia in ord- to: encourage
industrial establishments in rural areas to create more employment, to reduce
environmental pollution in the metropolitan area, and to encourage efficient
use and conservation of electricity.
1.19      The Bank has worked closely with the Government and the power
utilities to meet these objectives. EGAT, the institution primarily
responsible for electricity generation, is implementing a comprehensive
expansion program of which the proposed project is an important component,
to meet the nation's growing demand for electricity. Projects for the
exploitation of natural gas and lignite for use in power generation are
currently under preparation and rural electrification programs are being
undertaken rapidly. The majority of the sector objectives have either been
met or are being constructively addressed.
Sector Constraints
Power and Energy Sector Coordination
1.20      The Bank has been concerned about sector coordination since the
sector review in 1976 (Report No. 1794-TH). At that time concern arose from
the fact that too many agencies had a part in sector decision-making (the
situation still exists) causing decisions to be reached as a compromise of
views rather than the best decision in the interests of the sector and Thailand
as a whole. In 1977, the CPPD was formed at cabinet level to oversee the
functioning and development of the power sector and provide overall control.
However, CPPD has not developed into an operating entity to coordinate planning
activities, review the utilities' development programs and projects, review
the adequacy and structure of tariffs and allocate sector funds among EGAT,
MEA and PEA in an equitable manner, by adjusting MEA and PEA's power purchase
price from EGAT for this purpose. The situation has been exacerbated by
Thailand embarking on the accelerated rural electrification program in FY78
requiring closer coordination among the utilities and changed policies in
the sector away from the strictly commercial criteria in providing electricity
to consumers, that have prevailed in the past.
1.21      The establishment of a Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology
has been approved in principle by the Council of Ministers but it has not
been decided whether the proposed ministry would have overall responsibility
for the power and energy sectors in place of various ministries and Government
agencies. It was agreed for Loan 1690-TH (Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project),
at Government's request, that proposals for a study to improve power sector
coordination would be submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1979, for review
and comment. This study, which would be financed under the proposed loan,
would examine inter alia such measures, including institutional changes, as
necessary and feasible to improve sector coordination. It was agreed to
include in the guarantee agreement an undertaking that those recommendations
arising from the study and agreed between the Guarantor and the Bank, will be
implemented by December 31, 1980.

Energy Sector
1.22      The energy study (para. 1.03) being undertaken by NEA is expected
to review the existing institutional framework and arrangements in the energy
sector and recommend changes and modifications as necessary. The Bank will
continue its dialogue on energy sector matters based on these recommendations.
1.23      A brief energy sector review has also been carried out by Bank
staff which is currently under consideration in the Bank.
Tariff Structure and Levels
1.24      The issue of appropriate tariffs for the sector is under review in
the tariff study financed under Loan 1485-TH. This study is aimed at
simplifying present tariffs and ensuring that tariff structures reflect
economic costs. The study is taking longer than anticipated as it is being
carried out by an interagency group in order to build in-house tariff-making
capability in the country.
1.25      Following the proposals of the 1976 Power Sector review (Report No.
1794-TH), fuel taxes have been reinstated. After the December 1978 OPEC
price increase, the Government of Thailand (RTG) increased the price of
all petroleum products except for those sold to EGAT. Fuel, diesel and
lubricating oils purchased by EGAT were cross-subsidized within the petroleum
sector from surpluses made on sales of gasoline, fuel and other petroleum
products to the general public. These together with the subsequent increases
during 1979 were incorporated in the tariff increases imposed in November 1979.
Other aspects of the tax question, particularly whether the sector should
cease to be exempt from corporation tax or its equivalent, is being investigated
by the ongoing tariff study.
1.26      The cross-subsidy to EGAT for fuel and other oils used for power
generation was substantially eliminated in November 1979 when Government
fulfilled the condition of effectiveness under Loan 1690-TH (Bang Pakong) that
tariff levels would be increased to the extent necessary to yield a rate of
return of not less than 7% for EGAT and the sector as a whole for FY80. The
tariff increases introduced from November 1, 1979 were 71% and 56% for EGAT
and the sector, respectively.
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.27      The Bank has made nine loans to EGAT and its predecessor totaling
US$362 million to help finance power plants and transmission facilities and
one loan to PEA of US$25 million to finance the first phase of PEA's Accele-
rated Rural Electrification Project (ARE I). The first six projects of EGAT
have been completed and are all operating satisfactorily. The Seventh Power
Project, Srinagarind (Ban Chao Nen) Hydroelectric Project, was on schedule
at mid-1979 and is expected to be completed in March 1980. The Eighth Power
Project (Pattani Hydroelectric Project) is on schedule and the Accelerated
Rural Electrification Project is about 3-4 months behind schedule due to delays
in the early stage of implementation. A loan of US$80 million for the Ninth
Power Project (Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project) was signed on August 9, 1979.



- 7 -
1.28      Implementation of the ARE I project has been delayed partly because
it is the Bank's first loan to PEA and both organizations must settle down
to working with each other. However, as the Bank's perception of PEA's
policies and operations increases, it is becoming apparent that the strictly
commercial policies that have been inherited from the past are not wholly
appropriate and are in contradiction of the aims of the Accelerated Rural
Electrification program. These issues will be addressed under the ongoing
tariff study and in appraising a loan proposed to be made to PEA this year
for the second phase of the ARE program.
1.29      The most recent power project performance audit report, made in
March 1978 for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH),
indicated that the main objectives of the project had been met. The
project was completed on time and within the original cost estimate.
EGAT's financial performance was satisfactory during the FY71-76 period.
Power Market and Supply
1.30      In FY78, total generating capacity installed by the various entities
was as follows:
Ownership                       Installed capacity (MW)
EGAT                                   2,811.1
PEA & NEA                                 65.2

Total                            3,305.3
Of this total, 910.0 MW were hydro (27.5%); 1,937.5 MW (58.6%) steam;
292.8 MW (8.9%) diesel; and 165 MW (5.0%) gas turbine.
1.31      Total energy generation in FY78 was 13,035.7 GWh.  Hydro plants
produced 2,213.2 GWh (17.0%); steam plants 10,225.0 GWh (78.4%); diesel units
257.0 GWh (2.0%); gas turbines 152.2 GWh (1.2%); and purchased energy from
Electricite du Laos (EDL) 188.3 GWh (1.4%).
1.32      Total energy consumption was 11,348.5 GWh in FY78 or 251 kWh per
capita: 2,427.4 GWh (21.4%) were used by residential consumers; 1,740.9 GWh
(15.3%) by commercial consumers; 7,067.7 GWh (62.3%) by industrial consumers
and 112.5 GWh (1.0%) by street lighting and others. Total system losses
were about 12.9%.
1.33      Based on the program as shown in Annex 7, the composition of the
power system and energy generation in FY90 are compared with those of FY78 as
follows:

Rural Electrification
1.36      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Growth in these areas has been rapid,
at an annual average rate of 12.5% in the number of consumers and about
23.0% on average, in kWh sold since FY68. However, rapid as the growth has
been, the degree of electrification in PEA's area increased only from 9.5% to
23.3% between FY68 and FY78, due to the relatively high population increase;
the fact that PEA had to concentrate its efforts initially on connecting
urban and semi-urban areas to the grid; and PEA's commercial orientation of
not giving connection without substantial contributions for industrial, commer-
cial and domestic consumers, and an additional 30% contribution for villages.
1.37      Government recognized that village electrification was proceeding
too slowly to meet the needs of villagers. To distribute resources more equi-
tably, PEA was directed in 1973 to plan an Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program and give priority to the more backward areas. The annual rate of
villages connected rose from 940 in 1974 to 1,440 in 1975, 2,250 in 1976,
2,680 in 1977 and 2,540 in 1978. In accordance with this directive, PEA
originally planned to electrify all the villages (about 49,000) in Thailand
in about 25 years and now plans to do so by the end of the 1980s although
this program has not yet received Government approval. It is expected that
by 1982/83 PEA's demand would exceed that of MEA. This reflects the progress
made in the provincial areas in general and in rural electrification develop-
ment in particular.
2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be EGAT, established in 1968 by a merger of
three generation and transmission authorities. It is a financially sound,
well organized and operated utility under the control of competent management.
EGAT and its predecessors have received a total of US$362 million in nine
loans from the Bank since 1957. Loan proceeds have helped finance the expan-
sion of the main generation and transmission system in Thailand. Although
the proposed loan will assist in financing the tenth Bank project in partner-
ship with EGAT, the grid has not yet reached all areas of Thailand; growth of
demand continues at a high level; the rural electrification program as
well as agricultural and industrial development are increasing the need for
generation and transmission facilities; and concentration on the development
and use of indigenous non-oil resources for generation requires substantial



- 10 -
investment. Continued Bank assistance is therefore required inter alia to
address energy and power sector issues, and improve sector organization,
planning and management (see paras. 1.20-1.22).
Organization
2.02      EGAT is organized and functions as a modern public utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy and is charged with the operation of the
power generation and transmission installations under its jurisdiction and
the establishment of such new facilities as may be required for the Thai
power grid down to transmission voltages of 115 kV and 69 kV. It does not
have responsibility for isolated diesel or mini-hydro generation or for
transmission and distribution below 69 kV.
2.03      The Board of Directors consists of a Chairman and not more than ten
other members, including the General Manager. All Board members act in a
part time capacity, with the exception of the General Manager, and they are
appointed by the Council of Ministers.
2.04      EGAT is a power utility which compares in its operating, planning
and project implementation efficiency with most of the better utilities
in the world. It is a borrower that in general now requires little or no
institution building assistance from the Bank (see Annex 3, the Organization
Chart).
Planning
2.05      EGAT has a well-staffed planning department responsible for survey,
site investigation, planning of generation and transmission projects; economic
studies; power development programming and system planning; and financial
projections. It uses consultants whenever necessary to assist in the feasi-
bility study of large hydroelectric or multipurpose projects.  It reviews and
revises if necessary, the load forecast and the power development program at
least once a year to cope with the changing economic conditions and the known
primary energy resources available to the country.
Engineering, Design and Supervision
2.06      EGAT uses consultants for the engineering and design of major
hydroelectric and thermal power projects. Construction of generation projects
is undertaken by contractors under the supervision of EGAT's staff assisted
by consultants. EGAT installs the equipment for power stations and substations
using its own work force under the supervision of the manufacturers. Trans-
mission lines are constructed by the suppliers on a supply and erect basis.
EGAT has an excellent record on project implementation and management and is
considered to have developed to a stage where detailed Bank supervision
is not required.
2.07      Since 1974, EGAT has retained the services of an International
Board of Consultants (IBC) for geological investigation and foundation
treatment of a rockfill dam for the Srinagarind hydroelectric project, a
360 MW installation on the Quae Yai river and subsequently on most of the
major hydroelectric projects in Thailand. Its services have been satisfactory.



- ]i. -
Procurement
2.08      Procurement is based on international competitive bidding unless
there are cases where other forms of procurement are more appropriate.
Since EGAi began borrowing from international commercial banks about three
years ago, loans are also sought on a competitive basis. Credit terms are
either requested in bid documents for major project components, or annual
lump sum loans are raised on the best terms obtainable to cover the multi-
farious smaller items of equipment that cannot readily be included in major
contracts.
2.09      Processing of tenders and award of contracts is undertaken equi-
tably and expeditiously and only minor problems have arisen with EGAT
in the Bank's procurement processing over the past few years.
Management, Manpower and Training
2.10      Management and staff are able and well-qualified.  EGAT had a
total of 15,930 employees at end-FY78, categorized as shown below:
Male              Female
Number    %       Number     %
University graduates           1,395   10.37       487    19.66
Diploma and higher
professional education      1,609   11.96        185     7.47
Higher vocational
education                   2,314   17.20       481    19.42
Others                        8,135   60.47    1,324    53.45
Total                   13,453  100.00    2,477   100.00
2.11      The number of staff is slightly higher than considered necessary
for a bulk supplier. The situation, however, improves yearly due to
attrition and system expansion.
2.12      Training is handled by the authority's training and development
division which arranges courses and seminars for all levels of staff.
Recent increases in the number of projects under construction and the
increased size of generating units in thermal power stations, have caused
temporary shortages of some categories of staff but the problems are being
resolved by an active program of recruitment and training.
Accounting and Audit
2.13      Accounting is based on the US Federal Power Commission's system
which is operated and administered by a well-qualified and competent staff on
EGAT's computer.



- 12 -
2.14      The audit is performed by the National Audit Council, the Govern-
ment organization responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The
international accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand, is retained as financial
consultants to cooperate with the Audit Council and issue a separate report
on the annual accounts. The performance of the consultants has been satisfac-
tory. Provision for their continued employment is included in the loan
agreement.
Present Facilities
2.15      EGAT had a total of 2,811 MW in service at the end of 1978 made
up of:
Type of Plant                MW            %
Hydro                        909.0        32.3
Thermal (steam)            1,702.5        60.6
Gas turbine                  165.0         5.9
Diesel                        34.6         1.2
Total                 2,811.1       100.0
2.16      EGAT's grid is modern and efficient.  Power is transmitted at three
voltage levels; 230 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV with a total length of 9,174 circuit-
kilometers at end-1978. Ninety-nine substations were in operation with an
installed capacity of 4,364 MVA. Annexes 4 and 5 give additional details
and the map attached shows the location of generating plants and transmission
lines.
Summary
2.17      In conclusion, EGAT follows the various procedures required
of a borrower by the Bank and need not be appraised or supervised to the
same degree as other borrowing utilities that have not yet achieved a
similar stage of development.

3. THE POWER MARKET
Background
3.01      EGAT's market covers all of Thailand and comprises -he Greater
Metropolitan area of Bangkok served by MEA; the provincial areas served by
PEA; and industries and other large scale or specialized consumers that it
has been directed to supply by Royal Decree, including EDL./l EGAT's sales

3.02      The power market has had a long history of steady growth, the
average annual increase in peak and energy demands being 14.0% and 15.0%
respectively over the period FY70-78. Demand grew rapidly in the early 1970s
due to rising investments, favorable world rice markets, and an expanding
economy. As a result of the oil crisis and the world economic recession, the
low point was reached in FY74 when peak and energy requirements increased by
only 4.8% and 5.6% respectively. However, system growth has recovered rapidly
since FY75. Peak demand and energy growth are shown below:

Load Forecast
3.03      EGAT's load forecast is based on the consolidation of forecasts
made by MEA, PEA and the direct consumers after taking into account the
effects of load diversity, system losses and statior. services.  Th    --
forecasts for MEA and PEA were derived by a study of historical growth
trends of different categories of consumers. The major consumer categories
were: (i) residential, (ii) small business; (iii) medium business; (iv)
large business; (v) street lighting; and (vi) others.
3.04      The latest load forecast was made in December 1978 by a Load
Forecast Working Group consisting of representatives from NESDB, NEA and the
three utilities. It took into consideration actual FY78 loads, new industries
planned beyond FY80 and the accelerated rural electrification program. A
check by a macro forecast method based on a regression relationship between
per capita consumption of electrical energy and per capita GDP, indicated that
the macro forecast would produce nearly the same results as the micro fore-
cast using a GDP growth of 7% from FY77-81 and gradually reducing to 6% by
FY86.
3.05      The load forecast from FY79-90 is shown below:

3.06      EGAT's peak and energy generation would increase from 2,405 MW and
14,188 GWh in FY79 to 7,149 MW and 40,533 GWh in FY90. The average annual
growth rates would be 14.2% and 14.0% respectively for FY79-82; 10.2%, and
9.5% for FY83-86; and 8.0% for both for FY87-90. It has been agreed that the
December 1978 load forecast will be used at this stage as the basis for
formulating the power development program and the consequent financial
projections. However, an in-depth review of the load forecast has been
included in the long-term study for future generation and transmission
projects under the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project (Loan 1690-TH).

Supply
3.07      To meet the increasing generation requirements, EGAT's system has to
be expanded continuously. The system load requirement and the capability
available to meet the demand is given in Annex 6 and shown graphically in
Annex 7. The FY79-89 energy and capacity balances are summarized below:

/a  Dependable capacity of thermal units is reckoned at 95% of the rated capacity;
dependable capacity of hydro units is defined as the average of the plant
capacities at the rated head and the minimum operating head of that hydro plant,
corresponding to an availability of about 97% of the time.
/b Reserve margin is defined as the difference between the dependable capacity and
peak demand.
/c Firm energy of thermal units is calculated at an annual capacity factor of 60-80%
depending upon the type of plant, age and relative fuel economy of units; firm
energy of hydro plants is defined as the annual energy output that would be
available in a critical hydro year.
3.08      The reserve margin in the past was based on the criterion that the
system will maintain supply to consumers with the largest unit out of service.
EGAT has been able to maintain this criterion because annual scheduled mainte-
nance of large thermal units can be carried out when system peaking capability
is ample and because it has hydro plants with large reservoirs which can be
drawn down in the event of the forced outage of large thermal units. It has
been decided, however, that with a greater number of large thermal units
being added to the system, a modification of the reliability criterion will



- 16 -
be necessary. EGAT has therefore decided that reserve requirements will be
based on the largest and the second largest units being out of service
simultaneously which correspond to about 20%, 15%, 20% and 17% for FY79,
FY81, FY83 and FY85 of the system peak load, respectively. However, EGAT will
not be able to fully meet this criterion until after the commissioning of the
second 550 MW unit at the Bang Pakong thermal power station, scheduled for
August 1984. An analysis by EGAT indicates that loss-of-load probability
(LOLP)/l in FY82 and FY83 is about three days per year, improving to less
than one day per year in FY85 and thereafter. This level of reliability is
accepted and will be further reviewed under the long-term study of generation
and transmission projects (paras. 3.06 and 4.02).
3.09      The system will be short of about 4% and 3% respectively of the
total energy generation required in FY82 and FY83, if these are dry
years; the commissioning of the first 550 MW unit at the Bang Pakong
thermal power station scheduled for August 1983 will remedy the situation.
A well-planned maintenance program for the generating units coupled with
special measures to reduce electricity consumption at critical periods
should be able to minimize any adverse impact on the economy to a minimum.
4. THE PROGRAM
General
4.01      EGAT's power development program is based on the principle of
the least-cost sequence of development, following extensive studies of
the alternative generation and transmission projects using the computer
programs available in-house. This development program is currently firm up
to FY86 only; beyond that year further studies and optimization are necessary.
Comparison of several system development programs incorporating capital and
operating costs for both the gas and lignite developments indicates that
natural gas is a cheaper source of fuel than lignite or oil for base-load
operation; and that lignite is cheaper than imported oil despite the
higher capital investment and longer transmission lines required (see Annex
19). The full extent of the reserves of natural gas and lignite, however,
are not yet proven. The program is liable to modification dependent on the
availability of primary energy resources. Hydro potential with the exception
of that from international rivers, will be primarily developed for peaking
plants.
4.02      EGAT considers that there are areas where consultant services might
be helpful in the optimization of the program. Under the Bang Pakong thermal
power project (Loan 1690-TH), EGAT agreed to undertake a long-term system study
of future generation and transmission including: an in-depth review of the
load forecast; comparison of thermal alternatives including imported coal and
/1   LOLP is the probability of not being able to meet the load due to shortage
of generating capacity under emergency conditions.

indigenous lignite-fired thermal units; nuclear power development; a review
of reserve margins and reliability criteria; and formulation of a comprehensivce
development program for a period of 20 years. EGAT also agreed that the
findings of the study will be submitted to the Bank for review and comment no
later than December 31, 1981.
Development Strategy
4.03      The present power system in Thailand is divided into four regions
as shown on the map attached. While Regions 1, 2 and 4 are interconnected,
Region 3 operates in isolation. All generation in Region 3 (South) is
predominantly thermal (lignite-fired, diesel and gas turbines), but Pattani
hydro (3 x 24 MW), which the Bank helped to finance, is under construction.
A 115 kV transmission line is being constructed to link Region 3 to the main
grid, financed under an ADB loan; reinforcement of the interconnection is
also planned by constructing a 230 kV line from Banpong 2 to Prachuap Khiri
Khan. In Regions 1 (Central/west) and 4 (North), base-load is provided by
the thermal plants located around Bangkok, the major load center, and by the
Mae Moh lignite plant in the North; hydro generation (Bhumibol, Sirikit and
Srinagarind from 1980) covers the intermediate and peak load requirements.
Region 2 (Northeast) is mainly served by local hydro generation and from
energy imported from the Nam Ngum hydro plant in Laos. A 230 kV tie line
between Regions 2 and 4 is under construction to improve the reliability
of the power supply for Region 2.
The FY79-86 Program
4.04      The generation program, FY79-86, includes ongoing works totaling
710 MW, and new projects of 3,110 MW capacity, as follows:

has been arranged or is being processed with the exception of the Bang
Pakong Thermal No. 2 unit, the Lang Suan and Chiew Larn hydroelectric schemes
and part of transmission project No. 5 to support PEA's ARE II. EGAT has
asked the Banks assistance in the financing of these projects. The Khao Laem
hydroelectric project scheduled for completion in March 1984, is the project
to be financed under the proposed loan.
5. THE PROJECT
Project Description
5.01      The project is located on the Quae Noi river about 265 km northwest
of Bangkok and 70 km from the Srinagarind dam, now under construction
on the Quae Yai river. The project comprises (Annex 9 provides further
details):
(a) preliminary works and resettlement;
(b)  an 82 m high rockfill dam with a total embankment volume of
about 8 million cu m;
(c) an open-chute type spillway controlled by two radial gates;
(d) an intake structure with an irrigation outlet and three
power conduits;
(e) a surface powerhouse with three generating units of 100 MW each;
(f) a switchyard;
(g) a 230 kV double-circuit transmission line of about 88 km long
from Khao Laem to Srinagarind, and a 230 kV single-circuit line
on double-circuit towers of about 108 km long from Srinagarind to

5.03      The cost estimate is based on mid-1979 price levels.  Physical contin-
gencies representing 12.7% of the base cost include an overall contingency of
20% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for transmission facilities; 100%
contingency was assumed in the quantity calculation for foundation treatment,
based on experience in the construction of the Srinagarind dam. The price
contingencies for foreign costs were calculated on the basis of assumed
annual rates of escalation, of 7% for civil works and 6% for equipment and
transmission facilities, from 1979 through 1984. The price contingencies for
local costs were calculated at 10% for 1979-80 and 9% for 1981-82 and 8% for
1983 and thereafter. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 10.
Project Financing
5.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$80.0 million is equivalent to 22% of
the project cost, excluding interest during construction. This would cover
the total foreign exchange cost of (i) construction equipment required to
carry out the resettlement program and (ii) consultancy services; and (iii)
civil works excluding diversion channel stage 1 and right abutment cut-off.
A commercial bank loan of about US$31.7 million would be required to finance
the foreign exchange cost of preliminary works and civil works for right
abutment cut-off.



- 23 -
5.05      The foreign exchange cost of hydraulic, electro-mechanical equipment
and transmission facilities totaling US$63.7 would be financed by suppliers'
or export credits. Based on experience with projects now under construction
(Mae Moh Unit No. 3, Gas Turbines and the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project),
EGAT would have no difficulty financing major equipment from suppliers' or
export credits.
5.06      The proposed financing arrangements would therefore be as follows:

Procurement
5.07      All civil works and equipment financed under the proposed Bank loan
will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in accor-
dance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The Bank's usual preference
of 15% (or customs duties, if less) will be granted to the local manufacturers
for equipment. In the case of minor items of equipment not exceeding US$250,000
equivalent each and not exceeding, in the aggregate, the equivalent of US$0.75
million, contracts may be awarded in accordance with local procurement
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
5.08      Disbursements for construction equipment for resettlement would
be made against 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported



- 24 -
equipment; 100% of ex-factory cost for equipment manufactured locally; and
85% of total expenditures for imported equipment procured locally off-the-
shelf. Disbursements on the civil works would be 50% of total expenditures.
For the engineering services, disbursements would be 100% of the foreign
exchange cost; and for the consultancy services for the sector study, 100% of
the total expenditures. Disbursements are expected to be completed by February
28, 1985 and the schedule is given in Annex 11.
Engineering Services
5.09      EGAT has been continuing the site investigations since 1972
assisted by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation of Australia (SMEC).
A feasibility report was prepared by SMEC in October 1977 under the Colombo
plan. Under the same arrangement, SMEC is now preparing the tender documents
for civil works and hydraulic and electro-mechanical equipment. EGAT intends
to continue the services of SMEC for the detailed design and construction
supervision of the project. An amount equal to about 2.5% of the estimated
cost of the project has been included for these services, equivalent to about
1086 man-months at US$8,300 per man-month inclusive of local costs. The
terms of the contract have been agreed between EGAT and SMEC.
5.10      Since 1975, the International Board of Consultants (IBC) for the
Srinagarind hydroelectric project has been reviewing the investigation,
layout and design of the Khao Laem project involving five visits to the site.
EGAT will continue the services of IBC throughout the construction period of
the project.
Implementation and Construction
5.11      EGAT will be responsible for implementing the project assisted by
SMEC. EGAT will install the equipment for the power station and the substations
using its own work force; transmission lines will be installed by the suppliers
on a supply and erect basis.
5.12      EGAT has already awarded a contract for the excavation of the
diversion channel to local contractors. Tender documents for the right
abutment cut-off and the main civil works were opened in September 1979 to
allow the contract(s) to be awarded by December 1979, after loan approval.
For equipment contracts, tenders will be issued in early 1980 and awarded by
late 1980. Main civil works construction will start in early 1980 and be
completed before the wet season in 1983 to allow the reservoir to fill up to
the minimum operating level by late 1983 (more than 75% probability if
impounding starts in July). Total construction time is about five years,
including the diversion channel excavation. Specifications and tender
documents for transmission lines and substations will be issued in mid-1980
and awarded in early 1981; completion is scheduled for end 1983. A detailed
construction schedule is shown in Annex 12.
Hydrology
5.13      Hydrology is based on a 16-year record of 4 stream flow gauging
stations. A correlation study was made between rainfall and run-off to estab-
lish the long-term runoff at the dam site for reservoir operation, including
the exceptionally dry period of 1954-56. The probable maximum flood, estimated



- 25 -
by well-recognized methods, gives a peak discharge of 7,100 cms and a volume
of about 3,500 million cu m. The freeboard provided is adequate to accommodate
the flood and also for the abnormal condition of one of the spillway gates
being inoperable during a 1000-year flood.
5.14      The annual sediment load is estimated at about 1.2 million tons a
year. The dead storage of 2,650 million cu m is more than enough to take
care of the sediment inflow over the life of the project. (Further details
are provided in Annex 13.)
Geology
5.15      The design of the project is based on substantial geological investi-
gations. 99 drill holes totaling 7,219 m and 9 adits totaling 1,760 m were
drilled or excavated. EGAT has currently completed a long adit /1 in the
right abutment and is excavating the diversion channel. These works provide
maximum knowledge of rock conditions for the bidders.
5.16      Because of cavernous limestone conditions, particular attention
has been given to dam foundation treatment and potential reservoir leakage
along the right bank rim. After many years of investigations and studies, a
method of treatment using a concrete cut-off wall down to the level of
non-cavernous rock was proposed by the consultants and accepted by IBC. In
its Report No. 4 dated July 1978, IBC concluded that the feasibility
of the project has been established despite the limestone conditions.
(Further details are provided in Annex 14.)
Ecology
5.17      In 1975, EGAT engaged the Applied Scientific Research Cooperation
of Thailand (ASRCT) supported by the Royal Forest Department, the Department
of Fisheries, the Silpakon University and the Srinakharinwirot University to
carry out a Preliminary Environmental Study of the Upper Quae Noi Basin.
The study covers the following disciplines: mineral resources, forestry
and wildlife; fisheries resources; archaelogy; public health; socio, cultural
and land use aspects; tourism and aesthetics; and resettlement.
5.18      This report was reviewed in detail by the Office of National Environ-
mental Board (ONEB). Its general comment was that, while there are negative
environmental impacts on archaeology, forestry and wildlife, fisheries and public
health, tourism and aesthetics, these negative effects can be mitigated or
avoided, if appropriate protection and control programs are established.
EGAT plans to meet these requirements by carrying out further environmental
and ecological studies in two phases: the first, relating to the socio-
economic study for a resettlement program was completed in September 1979; and
the second, aiming at identifying long-term effects and establish programs to
protect and control the negative effects of the project and will be carried
out during construction. A draft resettlement plan prepared by EGAT was
/1   Small diameter tunnel for geological investigations.



- 26 -
available at the time of negotiations. The report was found comprehensive
and the timetable of resettlement acceptable. The cost estimate for resettle-
ment was also reviewed and revised. There are, however, certain issues such
as compensation to non-citizen settlers and the provision of land tltles in
forest reserves currently against the law. Government guidance will be sought
through the interagency resettlement committee.
5.19      The proposed reservoir will inundate an area emcompassing 41
villages with an estimated population of about 10,800 persons (or 2,000
families). EGAT will provide a sum of B 386 million (US$19.1 million) or
about US$1,750 per inhabitant to cover compensation, relocation and provision
of basic infrastructure such as road, utilities, site preparation and resettle-
ment administration, health and social services and agriculture extension
services. EGAT has carried out successful resettlement programs for the
Srinagarind and Pattani hydroelectric projects. Similar practices as applied
at these sites, will be used at Khao Laem. (Further details are provided in
Annex 15).
5.20      Resettlement will be the responsibility of multi-agency coor-
dinating committees. A compensation committee and a resettlement committee
have been functioning since July 1979. During negotiations, it was agreed
that a resettlement plan will be submitted to the Bank for review no later
than June 30, 1980.
Risks
5.21      EGAT has endeavored to minimize the project risks particularly with
respect to the treatment of the cavernous condition in a limestone formation
(para. 5.16). The Authority has engaged an International Board of Consultants
whose advice will be sought if any unusual technical problems arise. To
verify the adequacy of the cost estimate for civil works before Board pre-
sentation, tenders were issued in June 1979 and opened in September
1979; to minimize problems during construction, EGAT has initiated a
socio-economic survey to develop a comprehensive resettlement program and
to establish acceptability by the communities involved. Remaining risks
are not judged to be significant enough to preclude proceeding with the
project.
Completion Report
5.22      In order to inform the Bank and the Borrower about the performance
of the project, and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion
report is required following the closing date of the loan. EGAT should
undertake, not later than six months after the closing date or such later
date as may be agreed for this purpose between the Borrower and the Bank, to
prepare and furnish to the Bank a report, of such scope and in such detail as
the Bank shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of
the project, its cost and the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the
performance by the Borrower and the Bank of their respective obligations under
the Loan Agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the loan. A
provision is included in the loan agreement.

6.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
6.01      The provisions of the Act governing EGAT's activities and the
policies followed by the Board have enabled management to maintain a sound
financial position. Following the fuel crisis, local borrowings, remission
of fuel tax and postponement of capital expenditures maintained EGAT's sound
financial position until 1977 when a 29% increase in tariffs helped to
place the utility in a position to meet its future capital requirements.
Over the past seven years rates of return on historically valued net fixed
assets in operation have ranged from 10.1% in FY71 to 9.5% for FY78; based on
net fixed assets revalued /1 from FY70 the rates of return range from 10.1%
in FY71 to 3.9% for FY78. Revaluation of assets was only required by the
agreement for Loan 1485-TH signed in 1977. Debt service coverage on an annual
basis was greater than 1.8 times in six out of the past eight years and the
debt/equity ratio of 48/52 at end-FY78 was satisfactory.
6.02      Despite the low rates of return EGAT has met its cash generation
covenant with the Bank (para. 6.05). Even for FY78 when water availability
for generation was low and costs increased due to higher than estimated fuel
oil based generation, EGAT contributed 19% of the average of the FY77-79
construction expenditures from internal cash generation.  Income, Funds Flow
Statements and Balance Sheets, FY71-78 are shown in Annex 16.  A summary of
EGAT's FY78 Balance Sheet is shown below:

Future Position
6.03      Economic expansion and the additional generation and transmission
capacity required to support Thailand's rural electrification program will
cause EGAT to expand its asset base four times over the ten years ending
FY88. Expenditures to meet the required construction program are estimated
to total B 140.0 billion (US$6.9 billion) at current prices including interest
during construction. EGAT plans to borrow 55% abroad to cover foreign costs;
16% will be borrowed locally; 1% would come from Government equity; and 28%
would be self-financed, on the assumption that not less than a 6% rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets will be earned by EGAT and the sector for
FY80, 7% for FY81 and 8% thereafter (para. 6.05). The financing plan based on
these assumptions is as follows:

Financial forecasts for EGAT, MEA, PEA and the sector are shown in Annex 17
and the assumptions incorporated in these forecasts are shown in Annex 18.
6.04      EGAT has no difficulty in raising funds in foreign markets.  It
has a long standing association with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan and more recently with
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED). No difficulties have
arisen in the past in obtaining bilateral financing and suppliers credits.
Since funds were first obtained from commercial banks in 1978 for cofinancing
the Pattani project with the Bank, EGAT has made increasing use of Euro-dollar
and other sources and has obtained several commercial bank loans for its
projects. Commercial bank loans are now raised annually to cover any finance
gap.
6.05      Until last year, EGAT's earnings covenant with the Bank was based on
annual self-generation of three years average construction expenditures, com-
prising the test, previous and following years; for FY78 15% self generation
was required and EGAT generated 19% (para. 6.02). Repeated attempts in the
past to change the covenant to a rate of return (ROR) basis finally met with
success in 1978 when Government agreed to a sector ROR during negotiations for



- 29 -
the ARE 1 loan (1527-TH). EGAT was brought into line with the sector position
during negotiations in 1979 for Loan 1690-TH (Bang Pakong) when it was agreed
that EGAT and the sector would earn RORs on average revalued net fixed assets
in operation of not less than 7% for FY80 and FY81 and 8% thereafter. Pro-
visions for continuation of these covenants are included in the loan and
guarantee agreements, but modifying the percentages for FY80 to 6% for EGAT
and the sector as a whole due to the delay of one month in applying the
tariff increases (para. 6.07).
6.06      Funds are transferred from EGAT and MEA, to PEA to support the higher
costs of provincial and rural operations, by EGAT charging PEA a lower price
for power than MEA. Under Loan 1527-TH, the Government undertook that during
the annual review of sector finances for ROR purposes, CPPD will also fix the
prices for the following year that EGAT will charge MEA and PEA for bulk
power, to ensure an equitable division of sector resources among the three
utilities. Similar provisions are included in the loan documents.
Tariff Levels
6.07      A tariff increase of 71% for EGAT has been publicly announced to be
effective from November 1, 1979. When passed through MEA and PEA costs and
revenues, the increase gives a 56% increase in average retail tariff levels
for the sector as a whole. These increases would have earned the previously
covenanted rates of return for FY80 if they had been applicable from
October 1, 1979 the date Government had intended to implement them;
implementation was delayed for political reasons. EGAT and the sector are
estimated to earn 5.6% and 6.6% respectively. The bulk power prices that EGAT
charges and the average tariff levels of MEA and PEA have been estimated on
the basis that each utility and the sector as a whole earn the covenanted RORs
for FY81 and thereafter. On this basis, the average tariff levels that EGAT
and the sector would charge per kWh /1 at current prices and the percentage
increases required to achieve them are as follows:

/1 Fuel prices are at mid-1979 levels. Natural gas prices to EGAT have been
assumed at about 85% of the mid-1979 fuel oil equivalent. Future increases
will be dealt with under EGAT's fuel adjustment clause in the tariff
schedules.

Future Operating Results
6.08      EGAT's energy sales are estimated to increase from 11,516 GWh in
FY78 to 32,262 Gwh in FY88, an average annual growth rate of 11%. Revenues
are forecast to increase from B 6.5 billion (US$0.32 billion) in FY78 to
B 39.8 billion (US$2.0 billion) in FY88, an average annual growth rate of
20%; operating expenses are expected to grow from B 5.8 billion (US$0.3
billion) for FY78 to B 30.0 billion (US$1.5 billion) in FY88 after escalation
at 8% for FY79-81 and 6% p.a., thereafter for all costs except fuel, giving
an average annual growth rate of 18%.
6.09      A downward trend in the operating ratio from 90% in FY78 to 75% in
FY88 indicates the improved financial situation over the forecast period and
that an increasing proportion of revenues is made available to help finance
construction expenditures.
Debt Control
6.10      The capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt equity ratio is estimated to vary between 48/52
(FY78) and 57/43 (FY81). EGAT's current debt control test provides for
Bank review of borrowings when the debt equity ratio exceeds 60/40 or when
medium term debt aggregates to 15% of total debt. It was agreed to continue
these tests for the proposed loan.
Current Position
6.11      The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.4 (FY77) and
2.0 (FY76) and is estimated at a minimum of 1.0 through FY88 due to cash
balances being lower than desirable in the early years of the forecast and
period. However, EGAT has access to short-term borrowing in an emergency
and has additional long-term borrowing capacity, the position is therefore
acceptable. Consumers receivables at end FY78 were about 2.4 months billing
which is high for a bulk power supplier. However, EGAT's contracts with MEA
and PEA provide for extended payment over 60 days after the bill is received.
The supply contract cannot be amended without the agreement of MEA and PEA.
The problem will be addressed during the ongoing tariff study with a view to
having the contracts amended so that bills are outstanding for a reduced
period.
6.12      Inventory levels are less than 2% of gross plant on a historically
valued basis, which is reasonable.
7. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Justification
7.01      A review of EGAT's power development plan, FY79 through FY90,
indicates that its planting-up program in the mid-eighties will be controlled
by energy in some years and by peaking requirements in others. The proposed
Khao Laem hydro project will provide the additional peaking capacity which
is needed by FY84 as demonstrated below:

/a Based on the largest unit out of service (the system would be able to meet
the criterion proposed for the future of the first and the second largest
units out of service only after the commissioning of Bang Pakong second
unit in August 1984 - see para. 3.08).
7.02      The Khao Laem Hydroelectric project will provide dependable peaking
capacity of 236 MW and an average energy output of 765 GWh per year; down-
stream benefits after the completion of Khao Laem reservoir, would include:
(i) an increase of irrigated areas for wet and dry crops by about
47,200 ha for each;
(ii)  a reduction in areas subject to flood from 77,400 ha to 30,200 ha
annually;
(iii) additional water up to 130 (1985) and 810 (2000) million cu m
per year as required for the Bangkok area; and
(iv)  an increase in the minimum Mae Klong river flow by 20 cms to help
industrial pollution control.
7.03      To find the least cost program of system development, the following
three sequences, including the transmission systems required to carry the
power to the grid, were compared on a program basis:

/a   Effective capacity used for least-cost analysis.
Sequence A is the base program; Sequence B is used to compare Khao Laem hydro-
electric project included under Sequence A with its thermal alternative; and
Sequence C is used to compare 5 x 300 MW lignite-fired units at Mae Moh with
3 x 500 MW oil-fired units at Bang Pakong (Annex 19 provides further details).
7.04      The comparison was made on a constant price basis by comparing the
total present worth of investment, operation, maintenance and fuel costs.
The fuel costs were calculated by merit-order operation of generating plant
on a system basis. Efficiency prices were used as follows:
(a) taxes and duties were excluded;
(b) foreign exchange costs were shadow-priced by a factor of 1.1; and
(c) the conversion factors for skilled labor and unskilled labor
were assumed to be 1.0 and 0.5 respectively.



- 33 -
7.05      The total present worth of the three sequences at several discount
rates are as follows:
Discount rate           Sequence A        Sequence B       Sequence C
(%)                 -----------------B million ----------------
8                   146,000          148,000            158,900
10                   118,200          119,200            126,200
12                   99,000            99,200            103,900
14                   85,200            84,900             88,100
16                   74,800            74,200             76,400
Sequence A is, therefore, the least-cost program for all discount rates
up to 12.7%. This demonstrates that the Khao Laem hydroelectric project
and the lignite development are economically justified when the opportunity
cost of capital is below 12.7% in real terms.
7.06      The comparison between Khao Laem hydro and its thermal alternative
is for power alone; no cost allocation is made to downstream benefits and no
increase of fuel prices in real terms is assumed. Khao Laem is a multi-
purpose project and Government has already approved a contribution of B 2,388
million (US$118 million) towards the cost of the project./l If the contribu-
tion is considered as the minimum capitalized value of downstream benefits,
the equalizing discount rate would be greater than 20%.
7.07      During negotiations, it was agreed that Government will provide
funds in an aggregate amount of about B 2,400 million (US$118 million) to
cover the cost of the project attributable to downstream benefits.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
7.08      The internal economic rate of return of the project (IERR) is the
discount rate that equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable
to the project. The costs are net of taxes and include the full costs
of the project, associated transmission and the estimated incremental distri-
bution costs required to market the power to retail consumers. The internal
economic rate of return is about 16% using the incremental retail revenues
attributable to the project based on the average tariff levels adjusted to
1979 price levels as a minimum estimate of the power benefits, and including
downstream benefits for flood control and irrigation (further details are
provided in Annex 20).
/1 Based on a cost allocation study made by EGAT and approved by the Govern-
ment using the acceptable "separable cost-remaining benefit" method.

8. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was be reached on the following:
(a) With the Government
(i) the carrying out by consultants of a study on sector
coordination (para. 1.21);
(ii)  recommendations arising from the study of sector
coordination will be implemented by December 31, 1980

Hydro Potential
General
1.        Precipitation in Thailand varies from 1,000 mm to 3,000 mm per
annum. The river basins in the North and West have large catchment areas, but
the river slopes are not steep. Thus the best development consists of high
dams which provide head and sufficient storage to regulate seasonal run-off
variations. The most important rivers are the Ping, Wang, Yong, Nan in the
North, and Mae Klong and its two tributaries, Quae Yai and Quae Noi, in the
West.
2.        In the South rainfall is abundant but streams are small and
catchment areas are narrow; only medium sized dams with small storage can
be provided. The important rivers are: the Pattani, Sai and Lang.
3.        In the Northeast catchment areas are large but very flat,
accordingly only low dams can be built. The important rivers are Nam Chi and
Nam Num.
4.        An analysis of the reservoirs in existence or under construction is
given below (see map).
Hydro Potential in Thailand
5.        Thailand has an estimated hydro potential of about 9,294 MW, of
which 910 MW are now in operation; 2,200 MW in 9 projects are under con-
struction or programmed for implementation before 1990; 871 MW out of 15
projects have prefeasibility studies completed or at a higher level of prepa-
ration; 1,881 MW in 12 projects have been selected by EGAT for conceptual
studies, and the remaining 3,432 MW in about 93 sites have been potentially
assessed by NEA but their economic feasibility is not yet known.

KHAO-LAEM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.        The Quae Noi river originates in the mountains forming the border
between Thailand and Burma. It flows in a southeast direction and joins the
Quae Yai river near Kanchanaburi forming the Mae Klong river which flows
into the Gulf of Thailand.
2.        The Quae Noi river is about 315 km long and has a catchment area
of about 10,640 sq km above the confluence with the Mae Klong. The slope of
the river varies from 1:100 in the headwaters to 1:2,000 near the confluence.
The upper basin of the river is contained within steep valleys and there is no
flooding problem.
The Prolect
3.        The proposed project consists of a storage dam, a power plant, and
associated transmission lines and switchyard facilities. The storage dam,
located at Khao Laem about 8 km upstream of Amphoe Thong Pha Phum, will be a
rockfill dam about 82 m high. Appurtenant structures include a diversion
channel, an open channel chute-type spillway, an irrigation outlet, an intake
structure and three steel-lined power conduits. The power plant will be on
the surface with three 100 MW generating units. The 230 kV transmission line
will extend from the power plant switchyard to the Srinagarind switchyard and
on to Ban Pong No. 2 substation totalling 196 km in length.
Dam
4.        The dam to be built will have a crest length of 980 m, a crest
elevation of 163.0 m (MSL) /1, a full supply level of 155.0 m, and a maximum
water level of 160.4 m. The total embankment has an estimated volume of about
8.0 million cu m, and the upstream and downstream slopes of the dam will be
1.4 to 1.
Spillway
5.        The spillway of an open-channel chute type, will be located at the
left abutment. Two radial gates of 14.0 m wide x 9.0 m high will be in-
stalled to control the discharge. The maximum spillway capacity of
3,200 cms has been determined from the predicted probable maximum
flood (see Annex 13).
/1 MSL = mean sea level.

Intake Structure
6.        The intake structure will be located at the left abutment.  Three
fixed wheel gates of 4.0 m wide x 8.0 m high will be provided, one for e- 
power conduit. It is designed for a minimum operating level of El. 135.0. ,
Power Conduit
7.        The three power conduits will be of welded steel pipe embedded in
concrete. They will be 6.3 m in diameter with a length of 235 m each.
Powerhouse and Switchyard
8.        The powerhouse consisting of the main machine room, control room,
repair workshop, stores and station service units will be a conventional re-
inforced concrete structure about 110.3 m long, 53.0 m high, and 38.9 m wide
including the auxiliary building and tailrace outlet.
Generating Equipment
9.        The turbines are vertical shaft Francis units of 108,000 hp each
operating at 150 rpm at a net rated head of 56 m (El. 145). The maximum
turbine output is 136,700 hp, achieved at the full supply level, El. 155.
10.       The generators will be of a vertical shaft, umbrella type installed
in a concrete barrel. Unit rating is 111 MVA at 0.9 power factor. This
rating will enable each generator to deliver the full power available from the
turbine at all reservoir levels, operating at power factors between 0.95 and
1.0 with satisfactory voltage levels.
11.       The transformers will be outdoor, three-phase, oil immersed with
forced air cooling each of 100 MVA. Low voltage will be from 11 kV to 16 kV
at manufacturer's option whereas high voltage, 230 kVM
Irrigation Outlet
12.       An irrigation outlet will be provided adjacent to the intake
structure, discharging into the spillway. It will be used for releasing water
for downstream irrigation use.
Transmission Lines
13.       It will consist of one 230 kV double circuit line of about 88 km
long from the Khao Laem switchyard to the Srinagarind switchyard and one
single-circuit 230 kV line of about 108 km to be strung on double-circuit
tower linking the Srinagarind switchyard and the Ban Pong No. 2 substation.

Hydrology
Description of Catchment
1.        The Quae Noi basin is approximately 200 km long and 50 km wide,
situated adjacent to the Thailand-Burma border. The Quae Noi, together
with the Ouae Yai, are the principal tributaries of the Mae Klong which,
ultmately, enters the Gulf of Thailand at Samut Songkhram.
2.        The catchment above Khao Laem damsite has an area of 3,720 sq km,
is rugged, heavily forested and only sparsely inhabited (mainly along the
main river). The elevation of the Ouae Noi basin varies from about 40 m
above sea level at Sai Yok to 1,700 m above sea level in the northeast of
the basin. The profile of the river is quite flat and even at Sangkhlaburi,
about 40 km from the border, the elevation is only about 130 m above sea
level. The western boundary of the basin is the Tenasserim Range which is
also the border between Thailand and Burma.
3.        The main stream of the Quae Noi originates in the Tenasserim Range
to the north of Pilok; it then flows northeast for some 40 km to the vicinity
of Sangkhlaburi, then in a generally southeasterly direction until it joins
the Quae. Yai at Kanchanaburi. A large tributary, the Huai Pilok, with a
drainage area of about 900 sq km adjacent to the Tenasserim Range, enters the
Quae Noi River 10 km upstream of Rhao Laem damsite.
Climate
4.        The climate of the project area is tropical monsoon.  From November
to February, the area has little rainfall and moderate temperatures due to the
northeast monsoon bringing cold and dry air from China. March and May is the
hot season, attributable in part to the retreat of the northeast monsoon. From
June to October, the southwest monsoon prevails, bringing a stream of warm
humid air from the Indian Ocean, and rainfall is abundant.
5.        The annual mean temperature, monthly maximum temperature, and
monthly minimum temperature at the Project area are 29.0C, 38.0C, and
170C respectively.
6.        The annual rainfall of the Quae Noi basin varies from about 5,000 mm
to 1,000 mm; the heaviest precipitation occurs in the upper reaches in the
vicinity of Pilok and reduces rapidly within the catchment area to about
2,300 mm at Sangkhlabura and 1,600 mm at the dam site; the annual rainfall
over the irrigation project area varies from about 1,200 mm to 900 mm and the
average annual rainfall in the Quae Noi river basin is about 1,470 mm.

Flow Records
7.        The Mae Rlong receives the majority of its water from the two main
tributaries, the Ouae Yai and the Ouae Noi. W4ater levels in the Mae Klong
were recorded as early as 1915 but discharge measurements did not commence
until 1939. Discharge has been measured for the Ouae Yai since 1952 and for
the Ouae Noi since 1962.
8.        In the Ouae Noi catchment, the proposed Khao Laem Dam will only
command 3,720 sq km of the total catchment of 10,640 sq km. Flow measurements
have been made in the Quae Noi at four locations downstream of the proposed
damsite, these being:
Station                     Catchment area            Period of record
Quae Noi at Thong Pha Phum              4,015 sq km               since 1965
Quae Noi at Ban Phu Toei                6,558 sq km                since 1968
Quae Noi at Ban Lum Sum                 6,956 sq km                since 1965
Quae Noi at Wang Pho                    6,993 sq km                1962 - 1974
Of these stations the records at Thong Pha Phum and Ban Phu Toei are con-
sidered the most reliable.
9.         Two major tributaries enter the Ouae Noi downstream of the proposed
damsite; the Huai Mae Nam Noi which enters the Ouae Noi between Thong Pha Phum
and Ban Phu Toei and the Lam Pachee which enters downstream of Wang Pho.
10.       The average annual inflow at the dam site is about 5,500 x 106 cu m,
equivalent to an annual flow of about 175 cms. Monthly distribution is shown
below:
Month                   Average flow (cms)
January                        86.4
February                        17.8
March                           14.0
April                           12.5
May                             31.9
June                          147.9
July                          343.1
August                        577.1
September                     454.9
October                       211.6
November                        87.7
December                        43.7

Flood Flow
11.        In the Quae Noi basin, the highest run-off occurs in July, August
and September and most of the major floods have occurred in July and August.
12.       During the southwest monsoon very heavy rainfall occurs in Southern
Burma, brought in from the Bay of Bengal by cyclonic depressions. The rain-
fall occurring in the upper part of the Quae Noi basin is largely caused by
an orographic spillover effect from the Tenasserim Range. The three largest
floods in the Mae Klong which occurred in 1953, 1961 and 1974 were caused by
the depressions being located in the Ouae Noi basin.
13.        Since the proposed dam is a rockfill structure, the determination
of the probable maximum flood is of particular significance in the design of
the spillway capacity and free board. Two methods were utilized by SMEC:
statistical and physical.
14.        Statistical.  The probability calculation was based on 8 years
(1966-72 and 1974) of recorded flood data at Thong Pha Phum plus 5 years
(1962-65 and 1973) of estimated flood data by correlation from recorded data
at Wang Pho. Six different frequency distributions were examined and Chow's
distribution was adopted as follows:
Return period       Flood discharge
(years)               (cms)
2               1,900
5               2,600
10               3,000
50               4,000
100               4,400
200               4,800
1,000                5,700
10,000                7,100
The maximum recorded flood at Thong Pha Phum is 3,060 cms which occurred
in August 1974. A design flood of 4,800 cms corresponding to a return
period of 200 years was adopted for the design of the diversion channel.

15.        Physical.  Five major storms for which good rainfalL and runoff
data were available were applied to the Catchment Flood Routing (CFR) model
developed by Laurenson. Recorded flood hydrographs at stream gauging stations
on the Quae Noi river were synthesized. The following CFR model parameters
obtained for the five floods at Thong Pha Phum were used to establish
parameters for the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) estimate:
Initial loss                                              - 20 mm
Continuing loss                                           - 1.0 mm/hr
Base flow                                                 - 500 cms
Storage lag coefficient                                   - 15 hours
Estimated extreme rainfall
Most severe storm selected                              - July 8-17, 1972
Peak discharge at Thong Pha Phum                     - 2,860 cms
Mean total storm rainfall above Thong Pha Phum  - 587 mm
Extreme dew point                                       - 270C
Maximization factor                                     - 1.54
Probable maximum flood
Peak discharge                                          - 7,100 cms
Flood volume                                            - 3,500 x 106 cu m
Base length of hydrograph                               - 16 days
An independent check made by EGAT's engineer, Mr. Sirichitchob, using unit
hydrograph derived from recorded flood hydrographs at Thong Pha Phum gave a
PMF of 6,690 cms.
Operation Under Abnormal Conditions
16.       Assuming that one of the spillway gates does not function properly
under the condition of a 1,000 year flood of about 5,700 cms, the reservoir
will rise up to El 160.85. The effect of using more conservative parameter
values in the PMF estimate was also investigated. The maximum water level
will not exceed El. 160.95.
Reservoir Operation
17.        Since only a short period of run-off records is available
monthly inflows for the period since 1850 at the Khao Laem damsite have been
derived from the recorded runoff at a number of gauging stations within the
basin and from a correlation study between run-off and rainfall records.
Monthly flows for the period from 1939 to 1972 were used for the simulation
study of reservoir operation including the exceptionally dry period 1954-56.
The number of months required to reach the minimum operating level of
135.0 in reservoir filling are shown below:

December          20        10        9
Therefore, the reservoir filling should be started no
later than August 1983.
Reservoir Sedimentation
18.       Based on a study on the "Hydrological Investigation of Monthly
Run-off and Sediment" by SMEC in August 1974, the sedimentation rate was
estimated to be 1.24 x 106 cu m per annum. With a dead storage of 2,650 x
106 cu m, it was concluded that sedimentation will not be a problem within
the life of the project.

1.        To provide adequate information on rock conditions, 99 diamond drill
holes with a total length of 7,219 m were drilled between December 1973 and
June 1978 at the following locations.
Location                      No. of holes
Left abutment                              12

In adits of the right bank                 10
Total                                    99
2.        Nine adits with a total length of 1,760 m and 12 seismic refraction
traverses with a total length of 1,698 m were made. The Adit at the right
bank ridge is still being deepened to establish the length of cut-off as
recommended by the International Board of Consultants (IBC).
Dam Geology
3.        At the damsite, geological mapping and subsurface exploration have
shown that bedrock comprises mostly:
- Secondary limestone
- Massive primary limestone with solution cavities (Ratburi Group)



- 63                   ~~~~~ANNEX 14
- 63 -                     Page 2
- Shale, siltstone and other sedimentary rocks, both calcareous and
non-calcareous, interbedded with limestone, mostly in relatively thin
beds (Thung Song Group)
4.        Most of the bedrock is obscured by alluvial soil and other super-
ficial materials. The alluvium in the riverbed at the site is mostly sand
and silt, but immediately downstream of the damsite there is gravel with minor
sandbanks. Seismic Traverse C in this area indicated low-velocity material to
depths ranging from zero to 10 m, while drilling showed lateral variations in
depths of alluvium from 1.6 m to 6.3 m.
5.        The limestone is mainly grey to pale-grey, fine-grained and
crystalline. The limestone is cavernous. A cliff of massive, primary
limestone of the Ratburi Group occurs in the right abutment.
6.        The rocks of the Thung Song Group appear to be folded in a complex
syncline along the river. The strike is mostly NNW-SSE with dips, in expo-
sures on the left bank and in the river bed, mostly between 30W and 60W,
that is towards the right abutment. There are wide variations in strike and
dip above the spillway, high up the left abutment. On the lower right
abutment the strata appears to dip 750E. The Ratburi limestone in the upper
right abutment seems to dip generally about 350E.
7.        A vertical fault, about ten meters wide, is located close to
the foot of the cliff nearly parallel to the river between the down-
faulted Ratburi limestone and the rocks of the Thung Song Group.
8.        Karstic conditions are also present in the limestones of the
Kanchanaburi Series forming the riverbed. Caverns and solution channels in
both limestone formations are of sufficiently large dimensions to establish
the need to block them by concrete cut-off walls rather than grouting.
Exploration by large drill holes indicated that cavernous limestone persists
to approximately El 40 beneath the river bed. A concrete plinth will be
provided at the upstream toe of the dam to connect the cut-off with the
upstream concrete slab of the dam. Under the plinth, a narrow trench about
600 mm wide will be excavated under water by a "Kelly Bar" (a percussion type
of excavating machine) or alternatively by drilling overlapping holes of about
600 mm diameter. The narrow trench will be excavated in sections down to the
level of non-cavernous rock then backfilled with tremie concrete.
9.        The IBC, after reviewing SMEC's design, recommended that the
foundation level for the plinth be set at or below El 70 and that the cut-off
be taken down to El 30. Treatment of the zone to a depth below the cut-off
will be done by grouting. IBC concluded that in so doing any caves will be
positively cut off and erodable seams made safe. A concrete cut-off wall is a
positive and effective solution.
Reservoir Geology
10.       The Quae Noi Basin is characterized by several north to northwest
trending belts of sedimentary rocks, generally of Palaeozoic Age. The



ANNEX 14
-64 -                            Page 3
western edge of the basin is formed by a similarly trending belt of granite
which forms the Tenasserim Range along the Thailand-Burma border. There are
some belts of metamorphic rocks to the southeast. In the main river valleys
there are extensive deposits of Quaternary alluvium, while Tertiary sedi-
mentary rocks are reported from the western flank of the Huai Pracham Mai
valley.
11.       Limestone, either thinly interbedded with non-calcareous rocks or
in thick lenses, is common in most sedimentary rock groups, but the massive
limestone of the Ratburi Group forms the main potential for leakage from the
reservoir. This Ratburi limestone occurs extensively in the northeastern
part of the Khao Laem catchment area and also forms the mountain range between
the Quae Noi and Huai Pracham Mai valleys. This range extends south to the
Huai Mae Nam Noi and beyond. There are several other smaller, discontinuous
belts of limestone.
12.       Limestone does not appear to extend continuously from the upstream
part of the reservoir northwards to the Zami River catchment in Burma.
Although the Maenam Ran Ti arm of the reservoir extends into an extensive
limestone area, there appears to be no possible connection to any areas
outside the reservoir area with levels below full storage. There may be a
continuous, although very long, limestone path generally eastwards to the
Quae Yai, however the Srinagarind reservoir will have a higher level than
Khao Laem and any leakage will be towards the Quae Noi. There appears to be
no connection to left bank tributary valleys of the Quae Noi downstream of
the damsite or any connection west and south of the Huai Pracham Mai valley.
13.       The immediate right bank reservoir rim is formed by massive lime-
stone, including the Khao Laem massif, located immediately above the right
abutment of the dam. This steep-sided massif is separated from both the
northern and southern continuation of this mountain range by irregular dry
valleys which slope generally northeastwards. The reservoir will extend
into the northern dry valley for a distance of about 1.5 km, while the
southern dry valley causes a 'neck' only 2 km wide between the full supply
level of the reservoir in the Huai Pracham Mai valley and the corresponding
elevation downstream of the damsite. These dry valleys are probably limestone
collaps structures (or 'valley sinks').
14.       The general conclusions of IBC in its Third Report dated July 1977
relating to water tightness of Khao Laem reservoir are quoted as follows:
"For the major part of the reservoir rim a variety of favorable
hydrogeological conditions, namely watershed areas formed of impermeable
granite, metamorphic and Kanchanaburi beds and groundwater levels well
above proposed storage level as proved by perennial river flows, would
ensure that reservoir leakage does not occur. Only in the Khao Laem
massif, separating the Quae Noi valley from that of its tributary the
Huai Pracham Mai, does the water table in the karstic Ratburi limestone
fall below reservoir level. The actual distance over which a natural
hydraulic barrier does not exist has still to be determined but is
expected to be of the order of 3.5 km.



ANNEX 14
-65 -                            Page 4
Recently completed exploratory adits in the limestone massif have
shown large openings and caverns occuring at intervals with sound
massive limestone between these openings. In places, the limestone
is brecciated. With those cavernous conditions, a satisfactory
cut-off could not be obtained by grouting and a concrete diaphragm
wall would be more positive and appropriate. A limited amount of
grouting would be required where open jointed rock occurs between
larger openings. Above the water table the large openings and
caverns would be excavated between galleries and diaphragm walls
constructed, the width depending on the dimensions of the opening.
A gallery spacing of 10 m is recommended to facilitate working
between galleries. This gallery spacing should establish the
fracture pattern in the limestone massif, along which solution
features form, with greater certainty and reduce the possibility of
leaving openings untreated. In areas where multiple openings or
extensive solution cavities occur, it would be desirable to excavate
completely between galleries to obtain a positive concrete diaphragm
wall.
The water table in the massif would be lowered by drainage from the
galleries and most of the cut-off would be completed in the dry.
Nevertheless, it is expected that a signific.ant amount of treatment
below the water table would still be required. This treatment would
be made in the same manner for the riverbed cut-off below the water
table. The height of the lower gallery would need to be increased
to accommodate equipment for constructing the diaphragm wall below
the water table and a height of 4 m to 5 m would be required (size
for other galleries 3.0 m by 3.0 m). This diaphragm wall would be
0.6 m wide similar to the cut-off wall under the main dam. The wall
will extend down to the lower limit of the karstic conditions (El 70
or lower) and supplementary grouting will be applied below this
level."
Spillway
15.       No problems are expected with foundations for the spillway crest.
The excavation for this part of the spillway will probably be stable with
fairly steep slopes, although some bedding and joint planes may have
unfavorable attitudes. Holes DD33 and DD36, close to the spillway chute
indicate competent foundation for this structure at a depth of about 11 m.
Powerhouse
16.       The powerhouse is located on the left bank downstream of the dam
and downhill of the spillway. Holes DD41 and DD43 indicate interbedded
limestone and shale, a suitable foundation rock, at El 100 m and El 82 m
respectively. As recommended by IBC, the position of the powerhouse has
been adjusted slightly to locate it more in non-calcareous rock.

KHAO LAEM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Ecology
General
1.        A preliminary environmental study of the Upper Quae Noi Basin was
carried out by the Applied Scientific Research Corporation of Thailand
(ASRCT) under the sponsorship of EGAT. The purpose of the study is to
identify those features and conditions of ecological and environmental
significance which should be considered with careful deliberation during the
final planning stages of the project. It also provides a basis for further
comprehensive studies on environmental impact.
Mineral Resources
2.        The mining of tin and tungsten in the upland areas of the upper
Quae Noi basin is quite significant in the regional economy. The present
annual revenue from district mines is estimated to exceed B 100 million.
There are a substantial number of pending applications for additional mining
leases mostly in the Pilok mining area.
3.        None of the existing mines or applications will be directly
affected by the proposed reservoir. One known deposit of barite near Ban
Tin Mong Tha could be affected by inundation but the loss of viable mineral
resources due to the impoundment are considered negligible.
4.        The lower portion of the road of the Department of Mineral
Resources between Amphoe Thong Pha Phum and the Pilok mines will have to be
relocated. This would involve the construction of approximately 30 km of
road.
Forestry and Wildlife
5.        Over 65% of the proposed reservoir area is classified as
non-forest or disturbed forest areas which is or has been subjected to
shifting cultivation. The volumes of the forest resources within the
reservoir area were estimated as follows:



- 67 -                          ANNEX 15
Page 2
Type                 Unit           Quantity
Timber                    cu m            348,000
Bamboo                    culms        40,000,000
Undersize trees           tree            351,400
6.        It has been recommended that where practical any marketable
timbers and commercial forest products in the inundated area should be
removed, and that a long term reafforestation program should be carried out
for watershed protection.
7.        It is general local knowledge that animals do migrate through and
within the reservoir area. Consequently, some adverse effects will result
from impoundment of the Quae Noi river due to the aLterttion   of the
regional ecosystem. Efforts will be made to relocate any wildlife trapped
on artificial islands created by the impoundment.
Fisheries
8.        Ninety-eight (98) species of fish were collected and identified,
including some 40 species which were of economic importance. The percentage
by weight of different species groups of fish was: carp 36.6%, catfish
32.1%, murrels 16.5% and miscellaneous 14.8%.
9.        Water analysis indicated that the pH range of 7.8-8.4 is suitable
to fresh water fish life. The dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, alkalinity
and hardness conditions were suitable for fish and aquatic life. It is
predicted that the proposed reservoir would become rich in food for
limnophillic fish species.  It is estimated that fish production would not
be less than 7 kg/rai per year, permitting an annual yield of about 1,360
tons/year from the reservoir.
10.       Detailed studies on pre-impoundment and post impoundment
conditions should be the basis of the fisheries management program.
11.       Nine (9) species of aquatic plant were recorded during field
surveys in the Quae Noi and its tributaries and local swamps. The most
important one is called locally Khrai Nam (Homonoia riparia) which grows
along the bank of Quae Noi. Species that could cause some problems in the
reservoir after inundation are Phak Top Chawa (Eichornia Crassipes), Sa Rai
(Utricularia spp. and Ceratophyllum demersum), and Bon (Colocasia
antiquarum).
12.       It is considered very important to study the distribution of
existing aquatic plants and to eliminate the undesirable species before the
formation of the reservoir.

Page 3
Archaeological Significance
13.       The basin seems to be a virgin area in prehistorical archaeology
and is rich in historical evidence.
14.       Action should be taken to arrange a program with the cooperation
of the Department of Fine Arts for a detailed archaeological investigation
of the reservoir area.
Social and Cultural Aspects
15.       There are approximately 10,800 people (1,800 families) currently
living within the proposed reservoir area and are composed of 5 main ethnic
groups: Karen (50%), Mon (25%), Lao (15%), Thai and Burmese (7%), and
others (3%). The largest concentration of population is at Amphoe Sangkhla
Buri, where five villages are estimated to have a population in excess of
3,000.
16.       From interviews with villagers, 44% identify themselves as lowland
rice farmers, 42% as upland farmers growing rice and other crops, 4% as
small lot gardeners, 8% as traders and laborers and the remaining 2% as
workers of miscellaneous occupation.
17.       The average annual family income (excluding the value of agricul-
tural products grown for home consumption) of 72% of the families is
estimated to be less than B 5,000 based on interviews with 570 families
living in the reservoir area. Twenty-five percent of the families have an
annual net income of less than B 1,000.
Land Use and Agricultural Activities
18.       There are approximately 406 km2 of land allocated for
agricultural and settlement development by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperations in the Upper Quae Noi Basin. Other areas are mostly conserved
for forest reserves and game reserves. The forests in the area which are
mixed deciduous and evergreen, have mostly been exploited for timber and
shifting cultivation both legally or illegally for over 50 years. The land
use in the proposed reservoir area can be classified into housing,
plantation and rice fields (both lowland and upland rice). The quantity of
rice grown in the Upper Quae Noi basin is generally small as farmers rely
mainly on wet season rainfall for growing crops.
Pjibic    Jh
19.       The area is generally primitive and has a very low standard of
sanitation. The known major public health hazards in the area are malaria
and Bancroftian filariasis. There are only two second class health centers,
three midwife centers and one malaria eradication unit in the basin. There
is a small Christian Hospital with one qualified medical doctor at Amphoe
Sangkhla Buri.

Future Studies
20.       The Preliminary Environmental Study, compiled by ASRCT for EGAT
was submnitted to the Office of the National Environmental Board (ONEB) for
review. ONEB gave support to the project within the context that the
project would cause least negative effects and provide as much benefit as
possible. EGAT should prepare programs and establish methods to protect and
control such negative effects in parallel with construction and carry out
the programs before the impoundment.
21.       To meet these requirements, EGAT plans to carry out further
environmental and ecological studies in two phases as follows:
Phase I: This phase of study should be carried out prior to
construction.
(a) Detailed sociological studies to develop and plan a comprehensive
resettlement program.
(b) Detailed sociological studies to establish the communities'
acceptability of the resettlement program.
(c) Study on the agricultural capability of the resettlement site.
(d) Funding of the archaeological program and a museum near the dam
site.
Phase II: This phase of the study should be carried cut during
construction to identify long-term effects:
(a) Monitoring water quality on possible heavy metal contaminations
and sediment loads due to mining.
(b) Monitoring the effects of the reservoir on wildlife population,
forest communities and on sedimentation of reservoir.
(c) Monitoring the effects of the reservoir on fish resources, change
in water quality and the aquatic ecosystem.
(d) Monitoring the effects of the reservoir on public health
conditions, introduction of new diseases and changes in
nutritional patterns.
22.       The socioeconomic study is being carried out by the Social
Research Institute of Chulalongkorn University. The draft report was
completed in September 1979.

Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts
Revenues
1.        Revenues have been forecast through FY79 at existing tariff levels.
For the rest of the forecast period (FY80-88), revenues are forecast at the
levels required to yield a minimum annual rate of return of 7% for FY81
and 8% thereafter on the average revalued net fixed assets in operation
at the beginning and end of each year. For FY80, revenues are calculated at
existing tariff levels for one month (October) and for 11 months after
including the tariff increases of 71% for EGAT and 56% of the sector.
Fuel
2.        Heavy oil, diesel and lignite have been forecast at the existing
prices for FY80 onwards as follows:
Bhat/Liter
Plant                Diesel  Heavy Oil   Gas La
North Bangkok            4.86       2.90
South Bangkok            4.90      2.89
Surat Thani               -        3.14
Mae Moh (225 MW)          -          -
(525 MW)         -          -
Krabi                     -        3.29       -
Bang Pakong              4.86      2.89      0.58
/a Price of gas (B/kWh), assumed at 85% of the mid-1979 fuel oil
equivalent.
Operating Expenses
3.        Operating expenses are based on FY79 costs:  for power plants at the
1979 cost per MW of installed capacity and the estimated operating cost per MW
for additional units in existing plants after making allowance for economies
of scale; for transmission lines, at the cost per km for operating and main-
tenance. Escalation is assumed at different rates for each expense varying
from 5% to 13%.



- 91 -                           ANNEX 18
Page 2
Depreciation
4.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method at the following
rates:
Steam plants                                4.0
Diesel generating units                     7.5
Hydro plants:
Dams and civil works                      1.3
Electrical and mechanical                 4.0
Transmission towers                       2.5
Poles and fixtures                        4.0-20.0
Structures                                4.0
Borrowings
5.        Foreign borrowings FY79-88 amounting to B 76,551 million
(US$3,780 million) are assumed to come from IBRD, ADB, OECF, KFAED and the
Eurodollar market at interest rates varying from 2-3/4% to 8-3/4%, for terms
up to 25 years including grace periods up to 5 years. Local borrowings of
B 22,852 million (US$1,128 million) are assumed at 10% for terms of 10 years
including 5 years grace.
Construction Expenditures
6.        Construction expenditures are based on 1978 prices escalated at
about 6% per year up to the time of the award of contracts for foreign costs
and at 8% per year FY79 through FY81 and thereafter at 6% per year for local
costs.
Taxation
7.        In the past EGAT has been free of taxation-exempt from corporation
tax and refunded for excise taxes by Government equity (the existing income tax
moratorium has been extended to 1982). Continued exemption from corporation
tax is forecast on the premise that the sector including EGAT will provide
all support necessary for the rural electrification program; RE support and
taxation may cause tariffs to rise to unacceptable levels. The effect of
taxation on sector tariffs will be addressed in the tariff study.

Least-Cost Analysis

1.        The least-cost analysis was made on a program basis.  The following
three sequences, each of which would satisfy the projected demand up to 1990,
were compared:

2.        Sequence A is the basic program; Sequence B is used to compare Khao
Laem hydroelectric project included under Sequence A with its thermal alter-
natives (Khao Laem hydro would contribute about 100 MW of continuous power
and 236 MW of dependable peaking capacity) and Sequence C is used to compare 5
x 300 MW lignite-fired units at Mae Moh with 3 x 500 MW oil-fired units at
Bang Pakong.

3.        Associated transmission facilities were taken into consideration
in the comparison. Capital and O&M costs for projects common to all three
programs were not included with the exception of their effects in the
fuel cost calculation.
Capital Cost
4.        All costs were at mid-1979 price levels.  Efficiency prices were
used as follows: (i) taxes and duties were excluded; (ii) foreign exchange
costs were adjusted by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.91 (or
multiplying foreign costs by 1/0.91 = 1.1); (iii) local costs were adjusted
by shadow pricing: the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project at a factor of 0.85,
made up of the unskilled labor component of the local costs (30%) shadow-priced
at 0.5 plus the remaining 70% local costs (30% x 0.5 + 70% = 0.85); and the
thermal projects at a factor of 0.95, made up of the unskilled labor component
of the local costs (10%) shadow-priced at 0.5 plus the remaining 90% local
costs (10% x 0.5 + 90% - 0.95).
5.        The capital cost estimated for various projects without shadow
pricing is as follows:

7.        The O&M costs of transmission lines and substations are based on:
-    O&M of transmission lines = 0.5% of capital cost.
-    O&M of substations = 1.5% of capital cost.
Fuel Cost
8.        The fuel consumption of alternative programs was calculated by an
energy balance study on a system basis, taking into consideration the following
factors:
(a) maximum generation or energy capability of various thermal plants;
(b) scheduling of energy generation according to merit order operation
so as to minimize fuel costs; and
(c) characteristics of system load.
9.        Fuel costs used in the analysis for various thermal plants before
shadow pricing are as follows:

Results of Analysis
10.       The total present worth of three alternatives at different discount
rates is as follows:
Discount rate          Sequence A       Sequence B           Sequence C
----------------(B million)------------------
8                   146,000           148,000            158,900
10                   118,200           119,200            126,200
12                    99,000            99,200            103,900
14                    85,200            84,900             88,100
16                    74,800            74,200             76,400
Between Sequence A and Sequence B, the former is the least-cost solution for
all discount rates up to 12.7%, which demonstrates that the Khao Laem hydro-
electric project is economically justified on a program basis when the
opportunity cost of capital in real terms is below 12.7%. This is for power
alone; no cost allocation was made to the downstream benefits and no increase
of fuel price in real terms was assumed.



ANNEX 19
-96 -                           Page 5
11.       Between Sequence A and Sequence C, the equalizing discount rate is
20.6%, which means that the lignite development is much economical than its
oil-fired alternative because of the high fuel oil cost.
Sensitivity Tests
12.       Sensitivity tests between Sequence A and Sequence B for variations
in capital cost and fuel cost were made with the results shown below:
(a)  At Basic Cost                         Equalizing Discount Rate
Variations in fuel cost
0% increase                                  12.75%
10% increase                                  13.75%
20% increase                                  14.65%
(b) Capital Cost Increased by 10%
Variations in fuel cost
0% increase                                  11.25%
10% increase                                  12.15%
20% increase                                  12.95%
(c) Capital Cost Increased by 20%
Variations in fuel cost
0% increase                                  10.05%
10% increase                                  10.85%
20% increase                                  11.65%
13.       Since this is a multipurpose project, Government has already
approved a contribution of $2,388 million towards the cost of the project
attributable to downtream benefits./l This may be considered as the minimum
capitalized value of downstream benefits. Taking this into account, the
equalizing discount rate would be greater than 20%.
/1 Based on a cost allocation study made by EGAT and approved by the Govern-
ment using the acceptable "separable cost-remaining benefit" method.
