                         Disbursements are at about 91% of the grant. The endowment fund has been capitalized in the amount of US$ 15.1M. Project implementation is broadly satisfactory. Conservation
                         mosaics (comprised of a National Park and the core are??? and a buffer zone) are implementing management conservation strategies around the Parks with the support of the local
                         communities organized in local working groups. Project implementation has supported biodiversity and water conservation through land use management changes, the establishment
