                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR provides an update on implementation progress reviewed during the June 17-26, 2013 supervision mission. The mission included a field visit to the Conservation Mosaics of
                         Galeras, Puracé-CRC, and Doña Juana-Cascabel-CORPONARIÑO. The implementation of the project is proceeding well and there has been significant progress since the last
                         supervision mission in December 2012. Local Working Groups have been established in each Mosaic, sub-projects have been defined and subsidiary agreements with the subproject
                         executing agencies have been signed.

                         The Colombian National Protected Areas Trust Fund in the amount of US$ 15 Million has been 100% disbursed and closed on April 18, 2013. The endowment fund has been
                         capitalized in the amount of US $ 15 Million. The additional financing in the amount of US $ 4 Million has a closing date of October 18, 2014. The Project supports a range of
                         interventions that seek to promote sustainable management of natural resources and improve conservation of the national parks, working closely with the communities represented
                         by the local working groups. One of the main challenges of the mosaics concept is to continue strengthening social capabilities as well as the creation of social capital at the local

                         level to promote long term conservation.

                         The project has contributed to strengthening coordination and knowledge sharing between Patrimonio Natural and SIRAPM entities, which include the Regional Environmental
                         Authorities (CARs) and National Parks in each of the five mosaics considered under this Additional Financing. Taking into account that National Parks buffer zones are not clearly
                         delimited, the project is promoting an integrated conservation approach for strengthening regional and local planning. This is particularly important since national parks and their
                         buffer zones fall under the mandate of “Parques Nationales? and areas around them fall under the Regional Environmental Authorities (CARs).
