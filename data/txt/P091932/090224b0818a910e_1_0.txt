                         This is the fist ISR for the AF National Protected Areas Project. The project was signed on August 31, 2011 and became effective on November 22, 2011. First disbursement of US$
                         800.000 was on March 2012. 20% of the funds have been disbursed. Local Working Groups (LWG) have been created in each of the 5 Conservation Mosaics (Comprised of a
                         National Park “the core area? and a buffer zone), and are in the process of defining the subprojects for each mosaic to implement managing conservation practices through land use
                         management changes, conversion of productive systems, and biodiversity and water conservation. LWG have agreed on the importance of improving the ecological connectivity in

                         exchange of experiences between the Parent Project and the AF project areas. The monitoring framework for biodiversity in the mosaics is being developed, and it will include the

                         CARs are working together in a coordinated way to implement project objectives.
