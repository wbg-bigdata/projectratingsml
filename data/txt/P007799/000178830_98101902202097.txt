REFORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF PANAMA FOR A
LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco Nacional de Panama with the guarantee of the Republic of
Panama for the equivalent of ;$h.7 million to help finance a livestock devel-
opment project. The loan would have a term of 16 years including a five-
year grace period, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Updating Report on the
Economy of Panama CA-22) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
August 21, 1972. The economic data in Annex I stems from that report. An
economic mission is now in Panama to review the country's recent perform-
ance.
For four years the Government, which took over in October 1968,
has successfully combined a move towards social justice with rapid economic
development. General Omar Torrijos, head of the National Guard, has exer-
cised leadership of the provisional Government and has relied on civilians
to staff all levels of Government including the Presidency. An assembly,
elected last August, approved a new constitution and re-elected Demetrio
Lakas President. Major cabinet and administrative changes were made soon
after the election. Effective power remains in the hands of General Torrijos.
L.        During 1971 and 1972 the Panamanian economy continued its rapid
growth. Real GDP grew 8.6 percent in 1971, slightly above the 7.7 percent
average of the previous two years. Domestic tranquility has been maintained
and foreign investment encouraged; the expropriation of a foreign-owned
utility company in 1972 was quickly resolved by an agreement acceptable to
the Government and the U.S. owner (Boise Cascade). As a result of this fav-
orable climate and its U.S. dollar currency, Panama is fast becoming a
major international financial center. During 1968-1971 foreign deposits in
the banking system more than quintupled to over $600 million. Although much
of this money was relent abroad, over one-third was invested in Panama.
Free-zone warehousing activities and tourism have also expanded rapidly.
5.        The Panamanian economy has now averaged close to an annual 8 per-
cent real growth since 1950, and its per capita GNP of $730 ranks fifth in
Latin American nations. Open unemployment has been maintained at about
only 6-7 percent of the labor force; relatively low by regional standards.
Panama's geographic location, dynamic entrepreneurs, and open economy have
been basic in this rapid and continuing growth. In the past, the growth
of traffic through the Panama Canal and related activities in the Canal Zone
had provided much of the external stimulus to the economy. This growth,
however, generated few benefits for the half of the population not residing
in the urban centers along the Canal Zone. Some recent income distribution
studies show that Panama's wide disparities in income stem from a large
differential between average rural and urban incomes. Average per capita
income for Panama City, for example, was $875, but only $200-250 for most
rural provinces. Past public expenditure was limited both in size and scope,



-2-
as governments followed a policy of limited economic intervention. me
new Governmrent through public policies and expenditures has aimed since
1968 at a better income distribtution compatible with rapid growth. So
far, this ihas been most noticeable for urban workers.  A ne.w labor code,
an extra montht.s salary,. and Rn 'tediilnti nnal tax", all. imolemented in the
nast two years, have increased the relative earniings of salaried workers.
6.        The provisional Government also launched a greatly enlarged
oublic expenditure program after 1968 under a strategy aiming particularly
at providinmg much needed infrastructure and expanding support to education
and he.lt,!.  Initially,the investment emp.Lsis was given to quick-impact
pro Jects for Job creation purposes while preparation work was accelerated
on large infrastructure projects in Panama City and in the rural areas.
Subsequently, the Government supported the gro-wth of urban services by
investments in airports, power, urban development, a convention center,
and expsn.-;ed euciation.al services.  Unt4.1 1972 the Government had restric-
ted -LtS rurai investments to roads and social facilities.  It is now
preparing projects designed to increase agricultural output. A sector
study, which wi].l provide the information needed for a coordinated attack
on agricul.tural and rural problems, will be completed this spring by an
interministerial group. At present the average income disparity between
urban and rural workers is about three to one; to reduce this disparity
the Government mnusi. enhance prciductivity in agriculture.
7.        The response of international and bilateral lending agencies to
the Government's investment strategy has been favorable and strong. Since
1.968 the -inter-American Devel-o0pment Bank (L-B), the U.S. Agenicy for
International De.velopment (AID), and the Bank have approved $167 million
in loans for public investment projects.  In addition, the U.S. Government
has approved a $60 million grant to complete the Pan-American highway in
the Darien area. With construction now under way on projects receiving
official external fixancing, the volume of public investment in 1972 may
well have exceeded the record 1971 level by 30 percent.  Sixty percent of
the 1972 pub:!'-., investuments were accounted for by the IBRD-financed Bayano
power projekt. rural and urban roads, and a Government sugar mill; another
one-fifth was for water and sewerage works, mainly in Panama City.
8.        wihile public investment and external aid has increased sharply
in recent years, Panama continues to have a serious fiscal problem
reflected in a lack of adequatie public savings.  A 1972 tax package did
not produce the large revenue increase the Government had expected, and
the normal growth of revenues continued to be absorbed by current expend-
tures, notably for health and education for the heretofore neglected poorer
Panamanians.  In 1972 savings of the Central Government and the Social
Security System probably amounted to less than 20 percent of Central
Government investment; the rest was financed mostly from abroad. The
financial situation of the public sector as a whole was probably better;
in 1971,about one-third of' total public sector investment was financed
out of public savings. While foreign borrowing has increased from official
lending agencies, substantial net borrowing by the Central Government on
medium-terms also continued. Besides suppliers' credits, the borrowing



- 3-
from private sources has been from consortia of U.S. banks, which used
the Eurodollar market as a prime source of funds. Maturities have
averaged between five and seven years but the 1973 borrowings recently
arranged directly with a European consortium are at 10-year terms.
9.        The balance of payrients problem usually associated with a
rapidly increasing debt service does not occur in Panama since it has
no central bank, uses the U.S. dollar as currency, and virtually all of
its official and private debt is in dollars 1/. The fiscal burden of
the debt service has become substantial, however. Government debt ser-
vice has grown from the equivalent of 12 percent of government revenues
in 1968 to 30 percent in 1972. The Rank has continued a close dialogue
fith the Panamanian Government over its fiscal policies.  Our last
economic report concentrated on the fiscal problem, emphasizing the need
to control the growth of current expenditures. Many of its recommenda-
tions were accepted by the Government.
10.       Because of its concern over the rising debt service burden,
the Government is undertaking an austerity program during 1973, under
which current expenditures are budgeted to increase only slightly above
their 1972 level, minor investment projects have been dropped and almost
three-quarters of the Goveinment investment planned for 1973 will be for
projects associated with the major lending agencies. Current subsidies
to some autonomous agencies have also been reduced or discontinued.
Major administrative reforms now being initiated are the consolidation
of the operations of the principal agricultural agencies into the Ministry
for Agricultural Development and the main housing agencies into a new
Housing Ministry.  The Planning and Finance Ministries are also being
strengthened in an effort to control closely the budgets and borrowing
of the whole public sector. These recent measures are important steps
toward improving the fiscal performance and justify our proceeding with
this loani.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAN.AMA
11.       From 1953 to 1962 the Bank made five loans totalling $18.6 mil-
lion, including two (totalling $13.1 million) for road construction,
two rela-tively small loans for agriculture, and one for electric power.
All five loans have been fully disbursed and three have been fully repaid.
Because of lack of development oriented policies and continuous political
interferences in the operation and management of key public entities, the
Bank suspended lending between 1962 and 1970. Since then, the Bank has
lent $42.0 million for power (Bayano), $20 million for an airport, and
$3.4 million for fisheries. Implementation of these loans has fallen behind
schedule but steps are being takeii to overcome the causes of delay.  In
FY1971,IFC made its only investment in Panama, a commitment to acquire
$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A.,
and lent to it $1.2 million to build a new international hotel. IFC is
not considering any further operations in Panama in the near future.
Annex II contains a summary description of Bpnk/IFC operations in Panama.
1/ Although Panama mints its own coins, the only legal paper currency
is the U.S. dollar. Thus, for all practical purposes, the Panamanian
balboa is not only equivalent to a U.S. dollar, it is a U.S. dollar.

j Includes $60 million grant from U.S. Govermaent for coTmletion

AID has concentrated on social services in recent years through a sector
loan to education, water and sewerage loans, famiily planning assistance, and
some small loans for subsistence farmers; it has also helped finance a new
convention centre in Panama City. IDB has provided suh..port for vocational
and university education, general agricultural credit for poor ana medium-
size farmers, and. seccndary road construction.
13.      As in recent years, the main prospective Bank lending to Panama is
focussed on helping to meet the bottlenecks caused by neglect of infractructure
in the 19606 and by Panamals exceptiWonally rapid development and to provide
agricultural credit in areas not covered by other financing agencies.
Becduse of the country's small size and rapid grow-th, relatively large in-
Y'ras;i;ruct,ure projects will- be periodically needed to assure a contiinual growth.
Ihe Bank is plann.ing to assist the Goverrunent not oily in financing such
ojects, but Jn ensuring that the timing and size of the investments are
aprropriate.  A power project covering generation, transmission and distri-
>r,ion is now being appraised. -Projects are at an earlier stage of prepara-
t.- r.n for a fishing port and the Panama City-Colon highway.
PART III - THE. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
l1L.      Panama's agricultural sector provides a livelihood lor approx-
ir,ately 50 percent of the country's population and accounts for almost the
,-,ve percentage of total employm,ent.  It also contributed some 75 percent
tLhe country's merchandise exports over the last five to six years;
6LŽnanas alone make up 55 percent of these exports.



- 5 -
15.       Agriculture's contribution to the nation's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) declined from about 23 percent in 1960 to about 18 percent
in 1971, but the sector showed an average annual growth rate over the same
period of approximately 5.3 percent in real terms, relatively satisfactory
for Latin America, This was mainly due to a rapid increase in banana pro-
duction, which grew at an annual rate of about 11 percent, while production of
foodstuffs for domestic consumption grew at a rate only slightly above 4
percent annually. Because of expanding domestic demand, food imports have
been increasing and now amount to about 10 percent of the total value of all
imports. Panama is a net importer of meat and meat products, mainly in high
value processed forms such as hams. In 1971, Panama imported about $4,6
million and exported about $1.3 million of meat.   The country is also a net
porter of dairy products; in 1971 imports made up 40 percent of consumption
(about $5 million). Over the past decade, livestock production increased
from about $30 million to about $50 million, at about the same pace as total
agricultural output.
16.       The average per capita income in 87,000 small and medium-sized
farms (farms with fewer than three employees, or about 90 percent of all
farms) has been estimated at about $400 per year, compared to the average
annual income level of $2,500 in manufacturing, $3,000 in the construction
industry, and $1,700 for other non-agricultural workers.   In spite of some
urban unemployment, many farmers have migrated to towns.
17.       In 1962, an Agrarian Code was approved by the Government as the
first step toward an agrarian reform. The Code's general objective is to
transform the land tenure structure, trying to combine greater social
justice and efficiency. An Agrarian Reform Commission (CRA) was established
in 1963 to implement the agrarian reform, but it had no significant effect
until 1969. In February 1969, soon after the new Government was established.
CRA began to distribute unexploited and tax delinquent private properties.
This land was sold ir. three or four years to its de facto occupants who, in
the meantime, were organized into land reform settlement enterprises
(asentamientos) and given training in improved production technology. By
July 1972, about 130 asentamientos, involving about 5,500 families and
80,000 ha, had been organized.
18.       Agricultural and livestock credit is provided by public and
private banks. The banking system in Panama is well developed and competi-
tive and covers the country with some 190 outlets. Although institutional
credit to the agricultural sector increased 2-1/2 times between 1967 and
1971, much of the increase was short-term credit for crop and livestock
fattening and there remains a need for long-term credit with appropriate
grace periods, particularly to develop a sound comnercial livestock industry.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       The proposed Project is the first Bank operation for livestock
in Panama and would be the first stage of a long range comprehensive
livestock development program.   It was appraised in June-July 19720  Negotia-
tions were begun in Washington in January 31-February 3, 1973 and completed,
following a reorganization within the Panamanian Government, on March 26, 1973.



-6-
2).      The Project described in detail in Annex III, is designed to
support the development of about 570 cattle enterprises of five different
tvpes consisting of:
Average Loan   Net Present
Size       Average Oper-
ating Income
US$           US$
oi) 50 small dairy farms with intensive
production systems                             10,500           590
(2) 300 beef/dairy ranches with extensive
production techniques                          12,8C0         2,020
(3) 200 breeding/fattening ranches empha-
sizing better livestock herd management
practices                                      20,400         4,270
(I)  10 breeding/fattening ranches covering
asentamientos                                  36,000         - 9901/
5,)  10 purebred breeding centers for up-
grading the national herd                      68,ooo        21,0140
Investments would be in posture development, fencing, purchase of livestock,
facilities for better management of livestock, technical and consultant
services. The project would also include a feasibility study for livestock
development on the Atlantic coast.
21.       The project is clesigned to help expand commercial livestock
production, initiate new techniques for small viable dairy farms, and
develop lrge-scale economdcal livestock production in land reform settle-
ments.  As a commercially oriented operation, it complements existing
agricultural and livestock credit prograrns for which the Government prefers
to utilize soft, though limited, funds of IDB and USAID. As an extension
a 19`0 loan to helo small and medium farmers and ranchers IDB has
recently approved a $1.3 million loan and plans to consider a larger loan
later thiis year.  Following up on its earlier lending for subsistance farmers,
AID is 'planming a loan of about $8 million for a Small Fnrmers Improvement
Proj.ject, of which a!-oit $L milLion would be for agricultural and livestock
irodir and technical assist-ance and nearly $4 million for health, nutrition,
bc,us'ni and community development.
22.       B3anco Nacional de Panama (BNP), an autonomous Government agency,
4s the countryts largest commercial bank as well Eas the Government's fiscal
agent. In recent years, BNIP has taken an increasing interest in development
_/ Ranches on asentamientos have so far operated at a loss.



- 7 -
lending for agriculture, which now accounts for about 15 percent of its
portfolio. BNP is capably managed and staffed and it is expected that
it will lend directly about 70 percent of the funds to be provided under
the proposed loan. 3NP would also serve as a channel for passing on
project funds for on-lending through the Agricultural Development Bank
(BDA) and, possibly, through private banks. BDA was recently established
as an autonomous public agency which would specialize in lending to
asentamientos and to small and medium farmers. It will incorporate the
operational and financial departments of the Lnstituto de Fornento
Economico (IFE), which it replaces.   IFE's staff had developed consider-
able expertise in extending supervised credits to agriculture and it is
expected that about $1,000,000 of the proposed loan would be channelled
through 3DA. However, EDA is not yet in operation and it was agreed that
it would become eligible to participate in the project only after its
administrative and financial structure and lending policies had been
reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank. The private banks, which
have been predominantly involved in extending short-term credit to
agriculture, are expected to participate in the project to only a limited
extent.
23.       Participating financial institutions would extend loans to
ranchers, farmers and asentamientos to cover about 80 percent of new
investments for development and working capital. Repayment terms for
loans would be flexible, ranging from seven to twelve years, wiith grace
periods of three to four years.   The interest ra-te would be a minimulm
of 1() percent on outstanding balances, which is somewhat above IFE's
9 percent lending rate to medium farmers, in view of the more commercial
nature of the operations under the proposed Bank loan. No additional
charges such as application, inspection, or commitment fees would be made.
Loans to asentamientos would be guaranteed by the Government.
21".      Execution of the Project would be directed by a Management Unit
to be established for the Project. The Unit would include a project
director, an agricultural economist, a dairy production specialist, and
livestock technicians. The Government would pay special attention to the
selection of managers for asentamientos financed under the Project.
25.       Procurement through international competitive bidding would
not be appropriate because of the diversity of items, small size of
individual purchases, and need for free choice by the individual borrowers.
Accordingly, local commercial channels will be used. Price quotations
will be obtained from at least two suppliers for the procurement of
vehicles. Panama has a good network of dealers in agricultural inputs,
competition among local suppliers is keen and facilities for maintenance
and servicing of vehicles and machinery are adequate. Vehicles for
Project Unit use (about 15) would also be obtained through commercial
channels, since purchases would be spread over three years and bulk
procurement would 'e impracticable. Fertilizer, grass seed, fencing,
agricultural machinery and equipment, and vehicles are regularly imported
from Australia, Costa Rica, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States
and TiWestern European countries and supplies are adequate and imports are
either free of duties or at low rates. No country enjoys preferential
tariff rates on goods to be procured for the Project.



26.       The Project would yield an economic rate of return of about
15 percent and it veuld have a significant influence on the future
development of the livestock industry.  Animal husbandry practices,
pasture management and the level of technology would be improved;
productivity wvould be increased; and better quality breeding stock would
become available for later phases of development.  Furthermore, small
viable dairy farms-would be established that could serve as models in
further operations, and large-scale livestock production would be
introduced on asentamientos, which would. have a beneficial effect on their
developm11e tlt'.
PART V - LEGAL fl4STRUNIEN1TS ANI) AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and BNP, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between th.e Republic of Panama and the Bank, the
report o{ the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Arti.cles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
28.       The draft A-greements contain provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part- IV above, incl.uding the usual covenants
for livestock projects.  Section 3.06 of' the Gruarantee Agreement is of
special interest; with this provision, the Government undertakes to
maintain its policies, regulations and measures for the control of foot-
and-mouth disease and to t.ake the actions necessary to prevent introduc-
tion of the disease in its territory.
29.       I am satisfied t-at the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreemeni:. of the Bank.
PART VI - R0ECO iNDATIN-
30.       T recommend that the Execu-tive Di.bzectors approve the proposed
loan.

o   archl    1970;    ClosiDate:   April 30, 1976.
The project is about nine months behind schedule because
of difficulties in finding suitable aggregates for concrete and f'ill
material for the cofferdam. Detailed engineering design indicates that
the project is likely to cost at least $73 million, 26 percent more than
originally estimated. The Project was justified as the least costly
alternative to help meet the electric power demand of the country. The
demand forecast is still valid today and the project is still the least
costly alternative, even with the current time and cost overruns.
Ln No. 783   Tocumen International Airport Project;   US$20.0 Million
Loan of August 2, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.

Procurement Arrangements:
Goods and vehicles would be procured through existing commercial
channels because the diversity, small size of individual purchases, and
free choice to be left to the individual borrower would make international
bidding impractical. Panama has a good network of dealers in agricultural
