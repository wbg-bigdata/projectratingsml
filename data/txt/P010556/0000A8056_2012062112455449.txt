                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) and Outcome Indicators remain relevant and on track. Major achievements to date include:

                         (a) The road network in poor/very poor condition reduced from 49% to 40% against an end of project (EOP) target of 35%;
                         (b) Average network-level roughness reduced from 5.4 IRI to 4.6 IRI against an EOP target of 4.4 IRI. This 15% reduction represents about 5.0% decrease in vehicle fleet road user
                         costs;
                         (c) Karachi-Peshawar travel time reduced by 16% from 47 hours to 39 hours exceeding the EOP target of 42 hours; and
                         (d) Fatalities per 100 km on N-5 decreased by 63% from 107 to 39 fatalities far exceeding the EOP target of 96 fatalities .

                         The Implementation Progress (IP) and Output Indicators are also on track:

                         (a) Eighteen civil works contracts, currently valued at Rs 44.21 billion amounting to 100% of the total works component are at advanced stages of execution;
                         (b) Fourteen civil works contracts are substantially complete. ? 1,013 km (98%) of the project length is reopened to traffic. Overall physical progress of 82.4% has been achieved.
                         Gross work valued at Rs 34.92 billion has been certified. On the whole financial progress is 79%.
