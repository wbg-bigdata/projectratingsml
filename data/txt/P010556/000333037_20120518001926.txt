                                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed restructuring would waive of legal covenants in the Original Financing and the
First and Third Additional Financings relating to the sustainable financing of National Highway Authority
(NHA). The proposed restructuring would delete Section 4.03 (a) in the Development Credit Agreement
(Credit 3846-PK), the Loan Agreement (Loan 7212-PK), Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement and
the Development Credit Agreement (Loan 7341-PK) and Section II.4 of the Schedule 2 to the Financing
Agreement (Credit 4816-PK). The proposed restructuring is Level 2 since the PDO remains unchanged,
environmental assessment category also remains unchanged, and no new safeguards policy is triggered.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Background

2.       The Highways Rehabilitation Project (HRP) was approved on December 23, 2003 with a Credit
amount of SDR 105.9 million (US$ 150.0 million equivalent), and a Loan amount of Japanese Yen ¥
5,605.5 million (US$ 50.0 million equivalent). An additional loan amount of US$ 100.0 million was
approved on December 1, 2005 for reconstruction and rehabilitation of three strategic roads of national
importance that were damaged by the earthquake of October 8, 2005. Another additional loan amount of
US$ 65.0 million was approved on March 29, 2006 to help finance the costs associated with cost overrun
resulting from significantly higher than expected bid prices for phase-II civil works contracts. And,
additional credit amount of SDR 85.7 million (US$ 130.0 million equivalent) was approved on September
28, 2010 for cost overrun related to unforeseen and unprecedented market price escalation and repair of
damages caused by 2010 floods (the worst flooding in over 80 years in Pakistan) and landslide
remediation works. Key project data is tabulated below:

Project Development Objective

3.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) is the sustainable delivery of a productive and
efficient national highway network, contributing to lower transportation costs. The project aims to
achieve this objective through implementation of about 1,034 km of highway improvement works
financed by the project and essential reforms in the sector and the strengthening of National Highway
Authority (NHA). Expected outcome is improved traffic flow on the network monitored through
improvements in key indicators relating to: (i) road network condition; (ii) travel time; and (iii) road
safety.

4.       The PDO and Outcome Indicators remain relevant and on track. The likelihood that the Project
would achieve its Development Objective (DO) is thus rated as ‘Satisfactory’. Major achievements
towards the outcome targets of the Project include: (a) the road network in poor/very poor condition
reduced from 49% to 40% against an end of project (EOP) target of 35%; (b) average network-level
roughness reduced from 5.4 International Roughness Index (IRI) to 4.6 IRI against an EOP target of 4.4
IRI – this 15% reduction represents about 5.0% decrease on the vehicle fleet road user costs; (c) Karachi-
Peshawar travel time reduced by 16% from 47 hours to 39 hours exceeding the EOP target of 42 hours;
and (d) fatalities per 100 km on N-5 decreased by 63% from 107 to 39 fatalities far exceeding the EOP
target of 96 fatalities.

Implementation Progress

5.       The Implementation Progress (IP) and Output Indicators are also on track and IP has been
‘Satisfactory’ throughout the Project’s lifetime, as documented in past Implementation Status Reports (the
latest approved in November 2011). Eighteen civil works contracts, currently valued at PKRs 44.2 billion
amounting to 100% of the total works component are at advanced stages of execution – thirteen civil
works contracts are substantially complete – 1,014 km (98%) of the project length is reopened to traffic –
overall physical progress of 81% has been achieved; and gross work valued at PKRs 34.3 billion has been
certified – on the whole financial progress is 78%.

6.      There are no outstanding fiduciary issues. Financial Monitoring Reports are submitted on time
and there are no overdue audit reports or ineligible expenditures. Environmental and Social Safeguards
compliance is also Satisfactory with procedures for obtaining environmental clearances considered as best
practice.

7.       The Project objectives continue to be achievable. The Project has disbursed US$ 92.38 million to
date in the current fiscal year and it is expected to disburse US$ 110.0 million by close of this fiscal year
(the Project is well poised to be the highest disbursing operation in this fiscal year in Pakistan’s
portfolio).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES:

Waiver of a Legal Covenant Relating to the Sustainable Financing of National Highway Authority

8.      Until 1991 the national highway network was in the hands of a government department known as
the National Highway Board (NHB). The Board’s work was funded by government grants. Then in 1991
the Board became a semi-autonomous authority, the National Highway Authority (NHA). The
government decided that funding of development works would henceforth switch from grants to loans,
even though NHA had no independent revenue source to repay the loans – NHA started collecting tolls
from year 1999 onwards and toll revenues are barely sufficient to cover the costs of operations and
maintenance of the existing road network. Consequently, NHA has built up a huge and growing stock of

                                                     2
debt to GOP. This practice is clearly unsustainable, and undermines NHA’s financial standing. To help
address this problem, the project included a legal covenant relating to the sustainable financing of NHA’s
Capital Development Program which is in partial compliance. It was agreed at Negotiations that:

    a. The Borrower shall make the proceeds of the Credits/Loans available to NHA as a capital
       contribution on a non-reimbursable basis, in accordance with the Borrower's standard budgetary
       procedures.

    b. The Borrower shall not later than April 30, 2004, carry out a review of available options for
       financing NHA’s investment program on a sustainable basis, under terms of reference satisfactory
       to the Association/Bank, and provide the Association/Bank with a prior opportunity to comment
       on the findings and recommendations of the view.

    c. The Borrower shall at the beginning of FY 2004/051, take a decision regarding: (i) the treatment
       of existing stock of NHA debt; and (ii) the mode of all future funding provided through the
       Borrower’s annual Public Sector Development Program, all with a view to making NHA
       financially sustainable commencing such fiscal year.

9.      Of the above-mentioned three legal requirements, the first two have been fulfilled. The World
Bank financing for the HRP is being provided by GOP to NHA as a grant; and a government review2 has
been completed under the project to identify sustainable options for financing NHA’s capital program.
Several options were identified including: (a) a debt write-off and conversion of future capital program
funding to grants; (b) converting the outstanding stock of GOP debt into equity, and providing a similar
treatment to future GOP funding of NHA capital program; and (c) GOP to ‘purchase’ NHA’s existing
road assets to pay off past debt, and to lease them back to NHA at a nominal charge for network
operations and maintenance. The Association/Bank helped draft the Terms of Reference and was
provided opportunity to comment on the findings and recommendations of the study. The Bank advised
the government to adopt any one of the above-identified three options, as deemed appropriate.

10.      However, the government’s resolution of third issue has been delayed and remains outstanding.
The delay stems from government concerns about the implications of any decision in terms of the budget,
as well as the precedent it would create for the treatment of government debt to similarly established
authorities in other sectors.

11.     NHA informed the Mid Term Review (MTR) mission in December 2006 that while they will
continue to work with the government to resolve this issue full compliance with this covenant is not
within its direct control and proposed to drop this covenant. The Task Team experience of HRP shows
that addressing sector key policy reforms in investment operations is a rather difficult undertaking.
Successful implementation of higher level reforms requires a strong government commitment and cannot
be achieved through a project entity.

12.      For that reason, in 2007, the Bank agreed in-principle to drop this legal covenant from HRP and
given the sector wide impact of the National Trade Corridor Improvement Program (NTCIP) took up this
issue under the then proposed three Development Policy Loans (DPLs) – US$ 300.0 million each – as a
prior action for Board presentation of the first DPL operation. However, the DPL approach was
abandoned in late 2007 along with the proposed series of DPLs due to deteriorating macro-economic
situation. In 2008, the Bank took up this issue again under the then proposed 3-phased US$ 1.5 billion

National Expressway (APL) Program. The APL approach was preferred since it not only provides the
tools that are flexible to meet the challenges emerging during the reform program but also the long term
horizon for meeting the program's developmental objective. The APL was aimed to support the GOP's
incremental approach to expansion of the expressway program and key sector policy reforms, while
locking in long-term institutional and political commitment to the Program. The Bank had made
resolution of this issue as a “Conditions for Negotiations? for Phase-I of the APL Program. However, due
to IBRD credit worthiness related issues the National Expressway (APL) Program was also dropped last
year.

13.    A formal request from the Government has been received.

14.    If you agree, please provide us with your approval.

15.    The Restructuring Paper and Amendment Letter has been cleared by Binyam Reja, Acting Sector
Manager, Transport (SASDT); Sameena Dost, Senior Counsel (LEGES); Chau-Ching Shen, Senior
Finance Officer (CTRLN).
