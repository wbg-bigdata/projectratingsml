INTERNATIONAL DEVEIOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE POCHAMPAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $39 million
to India for an irrigation project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The importance of agriculture in the economy of India and the
pressing need to improve agricultural productivity have led the Bank Group
to give high priority to lending for agricultural projects. In 1968 and
1969 the staff had extensive discussions with officials of the Government
of India (GOI) to identify projects suitable for financing. As a result,
lending for agriculture has increased from US $13 million in FY 1969 to
US $97.5 million in FY 1970 and   -  US $90.h million in FY 1971. The
proposed credit would be the first large commitment toward an even higher
level of lending to Indian agriculture planned for FY 1972. The proposed
credit would be IDA's first financing for improving a major surface irriga-
tion system since the Kadana Project in Gujarat State (Credit No. 176-IN)
was approved in February 1970.
3.        The proposed Pochampad project was appraised in November 1969.
The appraisal mission found that the funds required for timely construction
of the project would be substantially more than had been allocated under
the Fourth Plan (1969-1974). As a result,GOI and the Government of Andhra
Pradesh reconsidered the allocations required and, in November 1970, con-
firmed that the amount would be increased. This confirmation cleared the
way for completion of the appraisal, and an updating mission visited India
in February 1971. During negotiations, which took place in Washington from
May 10 to May 20, 1971, the Borrower was represented by Mr. G.V. Ramakrishna
(Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance),
Mr. Sreenevasa Rao (Member, Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC)),
Mr. A. F. Couto (Director, Ministry of Irrigation and Power), Mr. Hit
Prakash (Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture) and the State of Andhra
Pradesh was represented by Mr. B.C. Gangopadhyay (Secretary, Public Works
Department (PWD)), Mr. P. Tripath Reddy (Chief Engineer, PWD), and Mr. L.
Venkataratnam (Joint Director of Agriculture).
h.        A Summary    Statement of Loans and Credits is at Attachment I.
Comments on delays in disbursement are given in paragraphs 6-8 of the
Report and Recommendations for the Tamil Nadu and Haryana Agricultural
Credit Projects circulated to the Executive Directors on May 17, 1971.



With regard to IFC, 13 commitments have been made in India since 1957
totalling US $42.3 million of which US $2.8 million has been repaid,
US $5.8 million sold and US $6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of
US $27.4 million, US $19.1 million represents loans and US $8.3 million
equity. As of May 31, 1971, US $25.6 million of this total had been
disbursed, leaving US $10.4 million undisbursed. The largest commitment
was a total of US $18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertilizer
plant in Goa.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        The latest economic report entitled "Economic Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-25a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 24, 1971 (F 71-120).  It reports the continuation of many of the
encouraging trends observed in the 1970 report - in particular the fur-
ther growth of exports and of agricultural production. On the other hand
-ne report also notes that net aid receipts have fallen to a level lower
than at any time in the past decade, and in the fiscal year ended March 31,
1971, were less than one-third of the peak reached five years ago. The
resulting shortage of resources has inevitably been reflected in a short-
fall of investment, from the planned level, which seems to be the bare
minimum required if India is to achieve a tolerable rate of growth. As
the report notes, India continues to need substantial aid on concessionary
terms.
6.        More specifically in relation to agriculture, the report summarizes
the continued progress of the green revolution which has been encouraging.
Foodgrain production reached a new record of 105 million tons in 1969/70
crop year, showing a 5 percent increase over the previous year, and a fur-
ther increase of 5 percent appears to have occurred in 1970/71. The main
force behind this progress has come from wheat, although sustainable
increasesin rice production can also be expected now with some confidence.
The Fourth Plan set a production target of 129 million tons by 1973/74;
however, actual production is unlikely to exceed 120 million. Two reasons
for the shortfall in foodgrain production are the delay in increasing
assured irrigation supplies and the closely related slowdown in the growth
of fertilizer consumption. In the longer term future, the further develop-
ment of irrigation with effective agricultural support programs should
ensure continued growth in the use of new inputs, including fertilizer,and
in overall farm output.
PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A country basic data sheet is at Attachment II.
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of Pochampad Irrigation Project,
Andhra Pradesh" (PA-90a, June 16, 1971) is attached. A Credit and
Project Summary is at Attachment III.



-3-
9.        The Pochampad Irrigation scheme is situated in the State of
Andhra Pradesh in the south of India. Construction of the dam and other
major works started in 1965, although it is only over the last two years
that work has got underway. Ultimately, about 400,000 ha along the right
bank of the Godavari River will be irrigated. The proposed project is
the first intensive phase of this scheme and provides for the irrigation
of 100,000 ha and related infrastructure. The total cost of this phase is
estimated to be Rs. 9hh million (US $126 million), of which Rs. 262 million
(or 28 percent of the project cost)had been spent by March 1971.    Rs. 129
million would be required for on-farm developments and, therefore, would
be provided by farmers and credit institutions. Of the balance of Rs. 553
million (about US $74 million), the estimated foreign exchange content is
only Rs. 75 million (US $10 million) and Rs. 478 million (about US $6h
million) will be local costs.
10.       The project would be financed from the Andhra Pradesh develop-
ment budget which is supported by loans and grants from GOI: the Association
would have an opportunity to comment on proposed annual allocations for the
project in relation to the construction programs before budget proposals
are finalized. The proportion of project costs, excluding on-farm expend-
itures, to be financed by the Association would be about 53 percent, suffi-
cient to make a decisive contribution to the completion of the project.
Since the foreign exchange component, excluding village roads, to be covered
out of the proposed credit (US $9.7 million) is so small, this means that
about 25 percent of the credit would go to finance foreign exchange expend-
itures and about 75 percent to finance local expenditures. The basic
justification for financing local expenditures on     projects in India,
especially those with a low foreign exchange content,has been discussed in
recenb economic reports, including Chapter X of the latest report (SA-25a).
11.       The parts of the project which still have to be carried out, and
towards which the proceeds of the credit would be allocated, include com-
pletion of the dam (which will be one of the longest in Asia), completion
of the remaining 65 km of Godavari South main canal, lining of the first
phase construction of the main canal (112 km), construction of a distri-
bution system to serve the 83,000 ha not so far covered, construction of
field drainage, and the improvement and extension of village roads.
12.       The principal benefit of the project would be the intensification
of agriculture in an area which hitherto has been dependent upon uncertain
rainfall. This would have two effects upon present cropping patterns.
First, although the kharif (summer) cropping intensity would remain much
the same, irrigation would permit about half the acreage to be put under
rice instead of pulses and maize. Second, rabi (winter) cropping intensity
would more than double. Overall intensity would increase from 110 percent
to 155 percent. In addition, the availability of assured irrigation supplies
would enable high-yielding varieties of rice and maize to be introduced and
would also justify the application of fertilizer. As a result, yields from
rice and maize are expected to increase three times or more, while the yield
from groundnuts should double. Thus, there would be a substantial increase
in production, especially of foodgrains. The resulting foreign exchange
saving is estimated at about US $18 million per annum, once full development
has been reached. Treating past expenditures as sunk costs, but allocating



the entire cost of project works to the 100,000 ha to be irrigated in this
first phase, the economic rate of return for the project is estimated at
14 percent;  this rate of return will progressively increase and will
approach 24 percent as the project costs are spread over the 400,000 ha
of the scheme expected to be fully deve:Loped by the early 1980's.
13.       Presently authorized measures for the recovery of project costs
would cover the full cost of operation and maintenance and about 50 percent
of the capital cost over 45 years excluding interest. Thus, by proper col-
lection, a creditable contribution towards the cost of the project can be
achieved. Full recovery of project costs would require some increase in
existing taxes and levies; the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GAP) has
agreed to study and then to implement by 1974, measures to ensure recovery
of as much as practical of all project costs.
14.       Experience with surface irrigation projects in the early 1960's
underlined the importance of project organization with comprehensive terms
uf reference, assured funding and timely construction in order to ensure
proper use of irrigation water as soon as it becomes available and the
arrangements for implementation of the Pochampad Project have taken these
lessons into account. Moreover, agricultural support, including construction
of new village roads, facilities for on-farm works (such as land levelling
and drainage), and credit, is being planned in such a way that agricultural
development complements progress on construction. In the case of agricul-
tural credit, the Association is already providing assistance to the Andhra
Pradesh Land Mortgage Bank (Credit 226-IN), which together with other govern-
ment agencies will meet the credit needs of the project area. A project
organization will be set up under a senior government officer (the Project
Co-ordinator), with comprehensive terms of reference, in order to co-ordinate
all the elerrments required to bring about successful development. The Project
Co-ordinator will be responsible to a State level Development Committee,
which will provide general policy direction.   This organizational arrange-
ment is similar in scope to that now in operation for -he Kadana Irrigation
Project (Credit No. 176-IN), and it is hoped that this organization will.
enable the State Government to overcome some of the difficulties encountered
in earlier projects where less attention was given to co-ordination of the
sevoail elements necessary to the modernization of agriculture.
15.       Procurement of imported equipment, machinery, and spares (US $3.5
million) would be largely on the basis of international competitive bidding
in which local manufacturers would receive a preference of 15 percent.
(Actual customs duties for most of these items are presently higher at
about. 30 percent.) Minor items of equipment (US $1.3 million) would be
purchased locally under regular Government procedures. The balance of
US $34.2 million would be allocated for civil works.



- 5 -
16.       Traditionally, India has arranged for construction work on irri-
gatl.vn projects largely through force account procedures. In this case,
however, only US$4 million equivalent would be used to pay for force account
work and the balance of US$30.2 million would be disbursed on civil works
contracts awarded under local competitive bidding. There would be a
variety of large and small contracts which would be designed to offer oppor-
tunities for both large and small contractors to compete. These procedures
represent part of the effort which is being made by the Government of India,
supported by the Bank, to build up the capacity of the local contracting
industry in the construction field.
17.       Attention is called to the fact that these arrangements contemplate
the award of civil works contracts entirely on the basis of local competition
rather than having resort to international competitive bidding. It is the
judgment of our staff that there are a number of Indian contractors who
have the technical and managerial capacity to execute the works in question
and that they would be likely to win most if not all of the contracts
concerned even under conditions of international competitive bidding. None-
theless, the results of bidding cannot be predicted in advance and under
the Bank's normal procedures we would have regarded a large portion of the
civil works on this project as suitable for international competitive
bidding, and we would normally have required that contracts for these civil
works be put out to international competitive bidding in order to ensure
that the project is carried out in the most economic and efficient manner.
We have not pressed this requirement upon the Indian Government in this
particular case since we have felt it desirable to gain more experience
with the problem and to pursue further discussions with the Indian Govern-
..ncnt as to what terms and conditions  might be appropriate to secure effective
competition between Indian and foreign contractors.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Government of Andhra
Pradesh and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of the Reso:Lution concerning the proposed credit are being distributed
separately.
19.       There is one special condition of effectiveness included in
Section 8.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement which requires
that Andhra Pradesh shall have appointed a Project Co-ordinator with
suitable rank, powers, and responsibilities, after consultation with the
Association with respect to the experience and qualifications required for
this post.
