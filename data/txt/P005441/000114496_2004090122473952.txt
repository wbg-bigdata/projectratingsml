productivity of said sector.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:  Policy Reforms
(1)   Carrying out of: (a) a program of measures to improve MARA's
budgetary procedures so as to (i) facilitate the timely availability
to the Borrower's agencies responsible for implementing MARA's
investment program of budgetary resources in adequate amounts for
such implementation, and (ii) improve the efficient use of said
resources; and (b) a study to develop a program for the further
rationalization of said procedures.
(2)   Carrying out of a study to strengthen the organization of MARA
and the efficient utilization of its human resources.
(3)   Application of suitable policies and procedures for the
preparation of the Borrower's agricultural investment programs,
designed to ensure the further rational development of the
agricultural sector.
(4)   Development and implementation of a strategy to further
strengthen the livestock and dairy sectors, including measures
designed to ensure the proper delivery of animal health care
services by veterinary doctors and artificial insemination services
by suitably qualified private persons and application of a rational
milk pricing policy.
(5)   Development and carrying out of a program to improve the
accounting of water charges owed by users of water delivered through
the Borrower's large scale irrigation schemes, so as to facilitate
the recovery of said charges and implementation of a suitable

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories

the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
