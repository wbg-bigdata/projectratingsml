impact on Kenya‘s economic growth and development, increased the cost of doing
business in the country, discouraging private investment, and proved an obstacle to
addressing widespread poverty and improving the quality service and of life of its
citizens in general. Key governance problems at that time included: lack of efficient,
transparent, and accountable decision-making in the management of the country‘s public
sector, perverse incentives and existence of high level corruption, weak economic and
financial management and weak rule of law, inefficient service delivery mechanisms, and
weak administrative practices. Despite several reform initiatives to address these
problems in the 1970s and 1980s, only modest results were achieved.

2.      The Kenya African National Union (KANU) party, which ruled the country since
independence in 1963, made effort to improve and reform public sector governance. Its
measures included restructuring the public sector by reducing the number of ministries
from 28 to 15, implementing a staff retrenchment program combined with improved pay
and benefits, reforming the legal and judicial system, and promoting greater engagement
with civil society. A new Government, formed by the National Alliance Rainbow
Coalition (NARC) which won the General Election and took office in December 2002,
promised to enhance the public sector reform program with increased determination to
address governance challenges, opening up of democratic space and undertaking key
policy and institutional reforms to improve both the environment for private sector
investment and service delivery to the people.

3.      The new Government‘s strategy to improve public sector effectiveness was
outlined in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), titled the Investment Program
for the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (IP-ERS,
2003-2007), prepared with the full participation of non-governmental organizations, civil
society organizations, development partners, and other stakeholders, and was debated and
approved by Parliament. The Strategy centered on three inter-linked pillars: (a)
strengthening economic growth; (b) enhancing equity and reducing poverty; and (c)
improving governance. The World Bank‘s Board discussed and approved the Strategy on
May 6, 2004 and the International Monetary Fund‘s Board discussed and approved it on
May 10, 2004.

4.     The new Government made some progress on reforms under the public sector
management technical assistance project with specific reforms led to noticeable
improvement in civil service performance, including, reduction of backlogs in the audits
of Government accounts; strengthening of the civil service wage policy, retrenchment
and abolition of overmanned posts, and establishment of a Remuneration Board to
oversee the implementation of the pay reform policy approved by Cabinet. It established


                                            1
an institutional framework comprising a Cabinet Sub-Committee, a National Steering
Committee on Public Sector Reforms, and a Public Sector Reform and Development
(PSRD) Secretariat responsible for coordinating the implementation of various on-going
reform initiatives in the public sector. As part of its efforts to develop an integrated
sector-wide monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to improve the allocation and use
of public resources, the Government established a Monitoring and Evaluation
Department within the Ministry of Planning and National Development (MPND). To
improve management and quality of public service delivery, performance contracts were
introduced for all Permanent Secretaries and Accounting Officers in all Government
ministries and departments. These performance contracts were tied to the ministerial or
departmental strategic plans and required that they report their performance and resource
utilization in the delivery of services to the people through parliament and other
communication channels. All chief executive officers and board of directors of all state-
owned corporations were also expected to sign these performance contracts.

5.      The Government also took a number of actions to address corruption, including:
(a) implementation of the Economic Crimes Act (2003), which lead to the establishment
of an Anti-Corruption Commission; (b) establishment of a Department of Governance
and Ethics in the Office of the President; (c) enactment of the Public Officers Ethics Act
in 2003, that required all public officials (including the President) and employees, as well
as their families, to declare their assets and took steps to make these declarations public;
and (d) undertook judicial reform, including the establishment of the Ministry of Justice
and Constitutional Affairs, appointment of a new Chief Justice, and firing of corrupt and
inefficient judges. The Government also enacted key legislation aimed at improving
governance and public service delivery which included: the Government Financial
Management Act, the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, the Public Audit Office Act,
and the Privatization Act. The Government also launched an enquiry into a major
corruption case (Goldenberg). Further, it took action against those involved in corruption
in the Bank-funded projects—especially the Kenya Urban Transport Infrastructure
Project (KUTIP), in which both Government officials and Bank staff members were
found to have been involved in corruption.

6.     The Government implemented an action plan in 2005- 2006 to accelerate and
consolidate reforms although it was not meant to represent the totality of the
Government‘s action on anti-corruption. Specific actions highlighted by the by then
Minister of Finance included: (a) timely completion of annual project audits; (b)
clearance of public accounts backlog; (c) introduction of risk-based internal audit
throughout Government; (d) simplification of payment processes, and more importantly,
governance review of selected projects, whose objective was to identify areas of
governance weaknesses that expose projects to fraud risks.

7.      Additionally, the 2005/2006 budget was for the first time compiled without
factoring in donor support. Although donor support remained critical, government
officials argued for a strategy that allows them to plan within their own resource
constraints. The success of the strategy, however, depended on addressing broader
economic and fiscal governance challenges, including efficient revenue collection by the



                                             2
Kenya Revenue Authority and prudent spending by line ministries. The Government also
took a major step in passing the Public Procurement and Disposal Bill, 2005. The
initiatives in procurement anti-corruption, financial management and other improvements
in the various sectors were aimed at improving the quality of governance and service
delivery for communities, the private sector, and civil society in general.

8.     A number of development partners offered to provide assistance to support the
Government to implement various governance activities, including support to the justice
and law and order sector, based on the Government demonstrating its strong leadership in
the effort to eradicate corruption and pursue reforms. The Government subsequently
entered into partnership with development partners to plan and implement the Public
Financial Management (PFM) Reform Program with the aim of enhancing financial
governance in the public sector for effective and efficient resource utilization for
economic growth and poverty reduction. UNDP supported the government through a
program to alleviate poverty through strengthening capacity and participation of
governance institutions and civil society organizations including NGO's and Community
Based Organizations on public governance and coordinated support from bi-lateral
donors to the Office of the President on improving public sector management,
coordination and networking with the long-term objective to improve public sector
management for more efficient, transparent, and accountable delivery of public services.

9.      Despite the government‘s renewed commitment to improve governance and
delivery of services to its citizenry with support from the development partners,
significant systemic challenges could not be fully addressed. For instance, the Civil
service continued to be bloated and service quality remained unstable and poor in key
economic sectors such as the telecommunication, ports, and energy. Pay reform was
problematic because of the lack of a pay policy. In addition, poor harmonization of
donor support to Kenya had led to uncoordinated interventions. This fragmentation was a
huge drain on the capacity of the Government and ran counter to the commitments made
under the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness. There had also been several missed
opportunities for organized scaling up of implementation (e.g. in using rapid results
approaches, etc.), throughout the Government.

10.      Therefore, as part of a new initiative, the government articulated a new vision and
institutional framework for improving public sector performance and service delivery as
part of its broader strategy for reinvigorating its program of growth and structural reforms
for wealth creation. The approach focused on enhancing the change management
capacity of leaders in the Public Service and their teams in delivering ‗Results for
Kenyans‘. The initiative intended to enhance the development and promotion of a value
system and code of ethics developed from the existing legislation as well as best global
practice as a tool to rejuvenate the service orientation and accountability for public
servants by focusing on results and by providing a clear picture of what areas and
outcomes the Government is engaged in.

11.     The focus of the new program was on improving public service delivery and
strengthening PFM with the aim of reducing discretionary powers accorded to its chief



                                             3
executives, improving its service delivery system and enhancing transparency in
government transactions, including procurement reforms, and consequently the creation
of the environment for needed foreign investment. Emphasis was placed on monitoring
and evaluation and the strengthening of feedback systems.

12.    To help implement its new public sector management reform program, the
Government sought assistance from the Bank and other development partners in the
following areas:

       a) Demand-driven capacity building that is aligned with and directly supportive
          of the performance-based management;
       b) Focus on some key ministries (that are critical for successful implementation
          of the ERS, e.g., Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and National
          Development, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Local Government,
          and Ministry of Agriculture);
       c) Assistance to Parliament in its oversight role by supporting the various
          parliamentary committees in the area of economic management (budget
          preparation, budget execution, and expenditure control), and provision of
          technical and logistical support for effective oversight by the Public Accounts
          and Public Investment Committees; and
       d) Improvement in the effectiveness of donor support in critical areas of capacity
          building, governance, etc., by ensuring that they are better aligned and
          coordinated, especially in areas such as PFM.

13.    The IRCB project was thus designed with strong emphasis on improving
governance and restoring the rule of law articulated both in the Investment Program for
Economic Recovery Strategy (IP-ERS), and the joint World Bank-IFC CAS, 2004-2007.
Thus IRCB was fully aligned to both the Government and the Bank‘s strategies. At the
time of the design of the project there was high level government commitment and
ownership to provide a good authorizing environment for reforms.

14.     The Bank responded through the IRCBP in close collaboration with the several
bilateral donors who showed interests in the project, including the Department for
International Development (DFID), European Commission (EC), Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and
(DFID, SIDA, EU CIDA, and Norway. The DPs agreed to support the PFM program
through pooling of funds around a Basket Fund arrangement. Some DPs, namely the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Development
Cooperation of Germany (GTZ) and United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
provided support directly to GoK outside of the pool.

15.     Following the agreement to support PFM reform component of the IRCB project
through a basket fund arrangement , a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed
in the late 2006 between the Government of Kenya and Development Partners (DPs)
comprising of the World Bank, CIDA, Denmark, DFID, EC, GTZ, Japan, SIDA, USAID
and UNDP. The main objective of the MOU was to support the implementation of the



                                           4
GoK‘s Strategy to Revitalize Public Financial Management Reform 2006 - 2010 (PFMR
Strategy) towards the improvement of financial governance in the public sector through:
(a) enhanced macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting, better budgetary management; (b)
improved revenue collection and tax administration, enhanced procurement; (c)
strengthened accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) strengthened internal and
external audit systems; (d) integrated financial management systems; and (f) enhanced
capacity of parliament to play its oversight role in public resources management. The
PFMR Strategy is part of the broader framework of national development policy set out
in the ERS, and is implemented through the GoK Annual Budget and Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF).

16.     The MoU formalized the DPs commitment to the principles of aid effectiveness,
harmonization and mutual accountability as laid down in the Paris Declaration of Aid
effectiveness dated March 2, 2005. The MoU called for the highest degree of
harmonization between the DPs and alignment with the budgetary and accountability
system and legislation of the Republic of Kenya, so as to reduce the administrative
burden on the GoK and to enhance the effective implementation of the Program. With
the exception of the EU, most donors provided funds directly to GOK under the
―pooling‖ arrangements. EU funds in the amount of Euro 4.75 million were provided
through a Trust Fund Administrative Agreement (TF070601) dated December 19, 2007
between the EU and the World Bank. Of this amount, Euro 4.59 million was provided to
the PFM component of the project under a Grant Agreement dated September 8, 2008
between GoK and IDA. The remaining balance was earmarked for administrative
purposes including costs incurred by the Bank in supervising the project. The complexity
of implementing the basket fund and the different interests of donors later got have in the
way of effective coordination and funds flow to the project and provide lessons that are
discussed later in the report.

17.   A PHRD Grant was also formally established on July 3, 2006 in the amount of
US$3.1 million to co-finance the IRCBP.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)

18.    The original PDO of the IRCB project was to strengthen PFM systems to enhance
transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to public expenditure policy priorities as
well as enhance public service delivery through the effective implementation of Results
Based Management (RBM).

19.     It is must be pointed out from the onset that the ICR captures the performance of
the project with the support of financing from the IDA credit, the Multi-donor Trust Fund
(PFM Basket Fund) and the EU Trust Fund. The Key Performance Indicators of the
project captured the emphasis on sound fiduciary arrangements in the context of an
evolving framework of results based management and assessed whether the development
objectives have been achieved. The PDO has two main parts: (a) PFM, with seven
indicators and (b) RBM with one indicator. The PDO indicators and the results at the end

 of the project, as shown in Table 1 below, indicate that two indicators out of eight were
 fully achieved satisfactorily, three were moderately satisfactory, while three were either
 unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory at project closing date (relevant information
 on the final results of the intermediate indicators are provided in the Data Sheet and
 Table 1 below):

     Public Audit Act 2003.                               public due to delays in the PAC to present reports to the
                                                          Parliament for discussion and subsequent release to the
                                                          general public. Thus while annual audit reports for
                                                          central government are prepared on time within the

                                                          recommendations are usually not followed up. Despite
                                                          these challenges, the structures are now in place and
                                                          KNAO has been strengthened. The delays in
                                                          publication of audit reports have been brought to the

                                                          expenditures including donor funded projects increased
                                                          by 10.7 percent of GDP in 2011/12. Most the resources
                                                          were directed towards supporting critical physical
                                                          infrastructure, especially road and air transport
                                                          facilities, which is expected to attract private sector

                                                          Vision 2030.

                                                         expenditure reduced from a high of 35% in 2005/06 to
                                                         18.0% in 2008/09 but increased to 27.0 % in 2009/10
                                                         due to low absorption capacity of donor funds, and to
                                                         huge expenditure on Constitutional referendum.
                                                         However, the Constitutional expenditure was a one-
                                                         time off expenditure, and therefore it is expected that
                                                         Government will be able to contain the differences in
                                                         future budget outturns. Issues of improving the
                                                         Government‘s absorption capacity are being addressed
                                                         by the quarterly meetings organized between project
                                                         team members from the Government, the World Bank
                                                         and other development partners.
7.   Predictability of           Less than 80%           Not achieved (U): Available information reveals that
     annual/mid- term cash                               there has not been marked improvement in the
     flows to line ministries                            predictability of cash flows to line ministries. Cash
                                                         follow to line ministries has remained at an average of
                                                         85 percent over the three years ending June 2011 and
                                                         this is a fairly significant limitation to MDAs and their
                                                         operations.
8.   Accountability and        No baseline               Achieved with moderate satisfaction (MS): All the five
     capacity of public                                  initially targeted ministries have implemented their
     servants enhanced for the                           action plans and in some cases achieved remarkable
     delivery of public                                  results. Through RRI and provision of civil service
     services                                            training financed under capacity building fund, over
                                                         100 MDAs have achieved significant impact in
                                                         providing services to the public. A user satisfaction
                                                         survey conducted in 2009 showed high satisfaction
                                                         levels of the various customers of and employees of
                                                         Government of Kenya. The overall customer
                                                         satisfaction index was 63.5 per cent. This compares
                                                         favorably with those of New Zealand (68 percent in



                                                         7
                                             2007) and Canada (67 per cent in 2005). A joint
                                             Government/DPs evaluation conducted in March 2011
                                             also concluded that this component of program
                                             contributed to a general improvement in the way that
                                             the Government manages for results and in laying the
                                             foundation for institutionalization of RBM.



1.3 Revised PDO
Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

20.    The PDO and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

21.      The PDO and the key performance indicators suggest that the target beneficiaries
broadly included the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, Planning and Development,
Trade and Industry, Local Government, Kenya Revenue Authority and other ministries,
departments, agencies (MDAs) benefiting from the financial management, public sector
and procurement reforms and ultimately the local people who benefited from funds that
supported the overall shift toward effective management of key parts of the economy to
fulfill commitments under the ERS and the Vision 2030 Medium Term Plan for 2007-
2012. The improvement in responsiveness in service delivery (e.g. immigration,
passports, police etc) as a result of RBM and the Results for Kenyans program was of
benefit to service users generally. The user satisfaction survey done in 2009 showed high
levels of satisfaction (63.5%) of the various customers of government services which is
comparable to overall customer satisfaction index in advance countries such as Canada
(67% in 2005) and New Zealand (68% in 2007).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

22.    At the time of approval on January 24, 2006, the project components were as
follows:

Component 1 - Budget and Public Financial Management (US$16.65 million):

23.     Strengthening the management of public expenditure is central government.
There is an urgent need to improve fiscal discipline, bring resource allocations in line
with development priorities articulated in the IP-ERS, and improve the budgeting
preparation and execution, reporting and evaluation processes. The objective of this
component was to make budget processes and PFM more transparent, accountable, and
responsive to policy priorities. It was aimed at strengthening financial resource planning,
budget preparation and implementation, strengthening financial controls, ensuring that
allocation of government resources was consistent with policy priorities outlined in IP-
ERS, and reducing fiduciary risks by making procurement transparent and efficient and
enhancing expenditure monitoring and audit. This component had the following sub-
components.


                                             8
24.     Sub-component 1.1 Strengthening Budget Formulation.                 Support the
Government‘s on-going efforts at streamlining budget formulation processes,
strengthening the MTEF consultative mechanisms with stakeholders and alignment of
expenditure with ERS priorities. Support various activities undertaken before budget
formulation such as providing technical assistance to strengthen Sector Working Groups
and in preparing sector reports. In the short term, budget formulation was expected to be
improved by building capacity of the Budget Supply/MTEF department in the Ministry of
Finance and budget units in line ministries and government agencies. Specific activities
included helping line ministries prepare expenditure plans, training staff in program
costing, and strengthening budget submissions by line ministries as well as helping
Ministry of Finance with development of budget strategy paper and project appraisal
system. In the medium term, it intended to support the development of an organic budget
law which codifies existing practices in PFM. By the end of the project life cycle, the
expectation was that it would have supported the implementation of the new organic
budget law.

25.     Sub-program 1.2 Strengthening budget execution, accounting, and financial
reporting. Support the Government in implementing the recommendations contained in
its Enhanced Financial Management Action Plan (EFMAP). In the short term, the sub-
component was aimed to provide technical support to: (i) improve cash management; (ii)
contain occurrence of further expenditure arrears; (iii) improve predictability of cash flow
to spending units; (iv) improve payment systems; and (v) ensure payroll integrity. In the
medium term, the principles, methodology and processes was expected to have been
established for: (i) a system for financial reporting by semi-autonomous government
agencies and local authorities on budget and contingent liabilities; (ii) expenditure
classification systems along the principles outlined in the international standard
classifications such as the UN Classification of the Functions of the Government
(COFOG) and the IMF‘s Government Financial Statistics (GFS); and (iii) a framework
for the preparation and presentation of timely and comprehensive periodic financial
management accounts and annual financial statements based on generally accepted
accounting principles and professional best practices. By the end of the project life cycle,
it was expected that it would have supported the implementation of the revised principles,
methodology and processes for reporting.

26.     Sub-program 1.3 Strengthening PFM through the use of Information
Technology: Support the Government in achieving two objectives: (i) timely capturing of
accurate and verifiable data of budget execution, for improved financial reporting thereby
reducing the opportunities for unaccountable discretion on the part of the executive: and
(ii) providing enhanced internal controls to improve public expenditure management
(including pay-roll management). In the short term, it was planned to provide technical
assistance to achieve ―live‖ status of the new IFMIS in the Ministry of Finance and one
pilot department. Support the implementation of activities for the completion of the pilot
test phase, resolution of the connectivity issues and data integration issues. In the
medium term, alignment of PFM and IT architectures was expected to have been
achieved in tandem with preparation for further roll-out of the system. Planned activities
included resolution of policy differences and process issues, as well as development of


                                             9
the required capacity and resources to support full roll-out of the system. By the end of
the project life cycle, full implementation of the system was expected to have been
initiated including the finalization of manuals and training courses, setting up of
Ministries on the system, data take-on for priority Ministries, and establishment of
change management and user support processes.

27.      Sub-program 1.4 Strengthening the External Audit System. Support the
strengthening of capacity of the Kenya National Audit Office to become an effective
institution that will enhance financial accountability in the public sector. In the short
term, the focus of the subcomponent was to support ongoing initiatives to clear the
substantial backlog of overdue Local Authorities audit reporting arrears, to prevent
occurrence of new audit arrears and to consider more effective and efficient audit
approaches, such as risk-based auditing and performance auditing. It was also planned to
support strengthening of the relationship between the Public Accounts and Public
Investments Committees of Parliament and the Kenya National Audit Office. In the
medium term, the subcomponent aimed to carry out: (i) pilot risk-based external audits,
and if acceptable to stakeholders, planning and resourcing of the full scale
implementation; (ii) implement alternative audit approaches. The activities to be
implemented under the subcomponent included finalization of manuals and establishment
of training courses and change management processes. By the end of the project cycle,
annual financial reporting by government ministries and departments were expected to be
fully compliant with the Public Audit Act 2003.

28.     Sub-program 1.5 Strengthening the Internal Audit System. Support the design
and rollout of a risk-based audit approach to ministries and departments. In the short
term, it was intended to support the Internal Audit Department to complete their pilot
risk-based audits in order to develop and document a new standard internal audit
methodology and support its implementation in the medium term together with the
establishment of Ministerial Audit Committees to whom internal audit, external audit and
other independent oversight entities will typically present their findings to enable
monitoring of implementation. By the end of the project life cycle, use of audit results to
improve internal control systems was expected to be visible and the risk-based systems
approach to internal audit institutionalized. Activities planned to be implemented
included development of manuals, processes, systems and staff well resourced.

29.    Sub-program 1.6 Strengthening the National Procurement System. The sub-
component intended to support the Procurement Authority that was established following
the enactment of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act 2005. Its principal function is
to provide oversight of the procurement regulations and also assist to develop an effective
framework and control process for the procurement of goods, works, and services. This
subcomponent intended to further assist the development of an effective procurement
monitoring and tracking system. In the medium term, project funds were earmarked to
support a sensitization program to disseminate the new procurement law and system to
promote transparency and accountability in procurement. It also supported training of
procurement staff on the new law, regulations and systems as well as the provision of
support for the review of, and promulgation of new regulations in accordance with the



                                            10
new Act. It was expected that by the end of the project cycle, implementation of the new
Act, framework and procurement systems would have been initiated.

30.     Sub-program 1.7 Support to key Parliamentary Committees for effective
oversight of PFM. To enable the Parliament to play its oversight role in the area of
economic management more effectively and to professionalize its interaction with the
government, this subcomponent supported the various parliamentary committees in the
area of economic management (budget preparation, budget execution, expenditure
control and financial reporting). It earmarked funds for technical and logistical support
for effective oversight by the Public Accounts and Public Investment Committees. In the
short term, research capacity and operational support of the committees was expected to
have been improved. In the medium term, their responsiveness to audit findings and
follow up of their recommendations would have improved. By the end of the project
cycle, the backlog of reports not dealt with would have been completed and new
processes would be operational.

31.     Sub-program 1.8 Strengthening Revenue Collection and Management for the
Kenya Revenue Authority. The Kenya Revenue Authority‘s ongoing Reform and
Modernization Program seeks to help the Government collect all the taxes due and in the
process free Kenya from donor dependency and make the country a truly sovereign
nation. In general, KRA had exhibited good performance in various areas, including
revenue collection which had increased gradually from KSh. 122 billion in 1995/1996 to
KSh. 229 billion in the 2003/04 financial year (FY), accounting for over 93% of total
government revenue. However, the institution was yet to operate as a fully integrated
organization, which had inhibited the full potential of gains accruing from its creation.
The objective of this sub-component was to improve the Government‘s overall fiscal
objectives, including revenue collection, enhance efficiency in utilization of resources,
and improve effectiveness by adopting procedures and processes with the tax
administration system. Activities focused in three main areas: (i) Domestic Taxes
Department (DTD) Reform and Modernization Project: Technical Assistance, training
and equipment in order to restructure the Domestic Tax Department (TDT) from the
current tax-based structure into a unified function-based tax administration; (ii) KRA
Automation Project: Overhauling of the KRA‘s information systems through the
acquisition and introduction of a new modern integrated IT system for tax administration
and supporting infrastructure for business continuity including a disaster recovery site;
(iii) Training and Change Management Project: Training and Technical Assistance to
upgrade and diversify the skills base in the organization to international best practice
standards to the extent of supporting the skill base requirements of the reform program.

Component 2. Capacity Building for “Results for Kenyans?

32.    Sub-program 2.1: Capacity Building Fund (CBF). The primary objective of this
component was to support the overall shift toward effective management of key parts of
the economy to fulfill Government commitments under the ERS, and the related
performance contracts for relevant ministries. This included, but not be limited to,
providing capacity building support to the five key ministries (Finance, Agriculture,



                                           11
Planning and Development, Trade and Industry and Local Government). While the
operation continued to focus on some key ministries, it was clear that several others were
important to the achievement of ERS goals and/or were moving ahead quickly to
significantly enhance their focus on operational efficiency and results. At the mid-term
review of the project, it was planned that a review of the eligibility criteria to include
arrangements for a larger group of key ministries would receive assistance when they
satisfy certain agreed requirements such as leadership and results orientation.

33.     The CBF was demand-driven, i.e., the inputs were to be specified by the targeted
ministries who would demonstrate how they intended to use the funds to achieve the
benchmarks. To ensure there is complete disclosure and transparency of the use of these
funds, the costs and details of the approved plans for implementation was to be made
available to the public in a website. Additionally, to provide for an efficient management
of the CBF, a set of eligibility criteria and rules of access were planned to be established
including a Technical Committee established that would screen all proposals to ensure
proposed activities were consistent with ministerial objectives and support the attainment
of the benchmarks in the ERS. The Technical Committee was designed to include
nominated experts from the beneficiary ministries and various stakeholders including
representatives from the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), and other public sector
governance civil society bodies.

Component 3. Technical Support and Capacity for Project Implementation.

34.     The overall IRCBP was managed by the PFM Reform Secretariat (PFMRS) at the
Ministry of Finance which was established for the purpose of coordinating the
implementation of the IRCBP especially in terms of its compliance with the financial
management arrangements of the pooled resources as stipulated in the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Government of Kenya and Development Partners and the
signatories to the Joint Financing Agreement, which defines the pooled-funding
guidelines. The PFMRS reported to the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Finance, who
is the Accounting Officer of the project. Implementation of the overall program,
therefore, was mainstreamed within Government. The coordination of Component 2
(Capacity Building for Results for Kenyans) was managed by the Secretary, Public
Sector Reform and Development Secretariat, in the Cabinet Office 1 . However, the
PFMRS had the overall responsibility of consolidating the project reports (i.e. IFRs,
progress reports, etc.). PFMR was also responsible for coordinating the contributions
from other development partners supporting the PFM component of the project through
both pooled and non-pooled funding arrangements. Thus, PFMRS served as the main
contact point by the Bank for the project.

1.6 Revised Components

35.     The components were not revised.

 The Public Sector Reform and Development Secretariat was later renamed the Public Sector
Transformation Department (PSTD), and its functions moved to the Office of the Prime Minister.



                                                  12
1.7 Other significant changes

36.     In November 2010, the closing date of the IRCBP was extended from November
31, 2010 to August 31, 2011 in response to government‘s request letter of August 31,
2010. The reasons put forward by the government for the request for extension were
delays in implementation due to the following: (a) post election crisis in early 2008; (b)
putting on hold the procurement clearances between February to June 2009 due to
fiduciary issues identified by the assessment undertaken in early 2009; and (c) project
administration and management changes taken by the government in mid 2009 to address
and implement the action plan recommended by the Bank. It was noted with respect to
the fiduciary issues that stronger internal controls measures needed to be put in place and
this was followed up including the appointment of a more senior level Project Director
of the Public Financial Management Reform Secretariat (PFMRS) and recruitment of
additional financial management staff to ensure sustained and stronger fiduciary capacity.

37.     In mid 2009, the IDA Credit Agreement was also revised for the following
reasons: (a) increase of the ―Prior Review‖ thresholds of contracts that were financed
under the Credit in accordance with the Association‘s updated Consultant and
Procurement Guidelines; (b) introduction of a new provision on ―Anti-Corruption‖; (c)
revision of Part A.1 of Schedule 1 of the Agreement (Withdrawal of Credit Proceeds) for
the purpose of revising the financing percentage of IDA financing to 100% for all
expenditure categories.

38.     The EU Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to co-finance IRCBP was also
revised as follows: (a) extension of the closing date of the of the Grant Agreement
between GOK and the Association from October 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010; (b)
extension of the closing date of the of the Grant Agreement between GOK and the
Association from March 31, 2010 to October 31, 2010; and (c) extension of the closing
date of the Administration Agreement between the EU and the World Bank from June 30,
2010 to October 31, 2010. The extensions were formalized for the same justifications
given for the closing date extension of the IDA Credit.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

39.      Soundness of the Background Analysis. The project was prepared in response to
the initial steps taken by the Government, the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS,
Report # 29038-KE, May 19, 2004) that proposed a program for re-engagement of the
Bank Group with Kenya that is aligned with the IP-ERS and rooted in its results-based
framework, from which the CAS‘s own result-based framework was drawn.

40.    Project administration was carried out by the Public Financial Management
Reform Secretariat (PFMRS), a unit within the Ministry of Finance. The key
responsibilities of the PFMRS was coordinating activities for the PFM and PSR
components, managing fiduciary functions and consolidating reports for the project. As
such this implementation arrangement was designed with the view to ensuring internal


                                            13
consistency in the application of procedures and guidelines. The design also took into
account the involvement of various agencies in clearly understanding the modalities and
responsibilities for implementation. Harmonization of DPs support was also considered
by recognizing the use of both DP planning and disbursement mechanisms that interfaced
effectively with government systems through pooling of funds. While this arrangement
generally worked well during the life of the project in terms of the agreed coordination
and consolidation of reporting for the two (PFM and PSR) main components, there were
problems encountered during implementation. The Country Fiduciary Review of May
14, 2009 found fiduciary weaknesses of the PFMR Secretariat that prompted the Bank to
suspend the issuance of procurement clearances until the problems were addressed. As a
result of the centralization of project management in the Ministry of Finance, during the
suspension period, the implementation of the PSR component (a well-performing
component) was negatively affected by the interruption in the funds flow during the
period that the procurement clearance suspension was in effect.                Thus the
implementation all project components and activities were negatively affected by the
suspension.

41.      There was high level participation in the preparation of the project. The various
implementing agencies played an important role during the preparation and
implementation processes of the project. Among other things, intensive consultations
were held with key stakeholders (component teams and development partners) including
the UNDP who had been coordinating support from DPs financing the public sector
reform (PSR) component of the IRCB program through a separate pool fund
arrangement. This particular pool fund, which aimed at improving public sector
management, was administered with UNDP and was channeled through the PSRD
Secretariat in the Office of the President. The close partnerships during project
preparation greatly helped to develop activities to be supported by linking it to the
priorities of the government‘s ongoing financial reform process. Project design also put
forward the need for activities to be driven by government‘s long-term strategic approach
to technical assistance and capacity building.

42.      The IRCB program was also designed to ensure that strong leadership existed
throughout the project life in principle. The PFMRS was always headed by a senior
government official of the Ministry of Finance. However, frequent changes in
government project leadership created some discontinuity and challenges, including the
new person taking time to settle down on sharp learning curve and loss on institutional
memory. Overall, there were about 4 different project directors in the life the project, the
last one being a few months immediately prior to project closing in 2010; the coordinator
left for another assignment but the government failed to appoint a full time replacement
and this may have affected project management and implementation.

2.2    Implementation

43.   Between the periods starting September 2006 to July 2011, of the eleven (11)
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) recorded for the project, ―Development Objective‖
(DO) rating was ―Satisfactory‖ until December 2008, and thereafter the rating was



                                            14
downgraded to ―Moderately Satisfactory‖ until project closure and similarly the
―Implementation Progress‖ (IP) rating was mostly ―Satisfactory‖ from September 2006 to
December 2008, and thereafter it was likewise downgraded to ―Moderately Satisfactory‖
until project closure. The downgrade in the ratings was mostly due to implementation
delays caused by, among other things, interagency politics and weak interaction between
the PFMR Secretariat and the various components, changes in the project leadership both
on the client side and the Bank side, and fiduciary weaknesses that led to suspension of
disbursement. Some component managers perceived the program as something
additional to their normal work and not part of it – an extra burden in effect – that
resulted in slow down of activities. There were three component coordinators with no
overall project coordinator. Project coordination was not a full time responsibility and
seen as part-time.

44.     Another reason for the implementation delay was the post election crisis,
following the December 2007 elections and which continued through most of the first
quarter of 2008. During that time, some DPs suspended their disbursements to the
project, and as such interrupted the flow of funds to the project. There was a four-month
period in early 2009 where ―no objection‖ requests were put on pending status by the
Bank because of fiduciary concerns. Other reasons that affected implementation were the
frequent changes of personnel in various components. Newly engaged staff needed time
to be fully aware of the procedures being used on procurement and financial
management. Activities in the annual work plans often could not be started immediately
because of the relatively long period that was needed to finalize work plans for the
following reasons: (a) work plans were often presented with unrealistic timeliness and/or
over-ambitious expectations; (b) information from larger components took longer to
complete and components that were ready to move ahead were de-motivated; and (c) the
DPs approval had to be deferred until the issues identified in the draft work plans were
addressed and this caused some delays. The relatively large number of activities
proposed by PFM components also created a big challenge to the PFMR Secretariat staffs
who were confronted with issues related to harmonizing the proposals with the
government budget cycle and the uneven timing of the approval and/or release of DP‘s
contributions. Furthermore, while a pool of funds was established for donor support,
including the IDA Credit, some donors were providing direct financial support outside of
the pool to fund activities already in the PAD, which undermined the principles and
effectiveness of the basket fund and partly explains the low disbursement rate for the IDA
credit. In addition, the change in Bank Team Task Team leadership towards the end of
the project implementation contributed to these delays.

45.     A mid-term review was conducted in September 2009 to assess the PFM and PSR
components. The review found that generally substantial progress has been made
towards achieving the project‘s performance indicators as outlined in the PAD, especially
the PSR component. The progress under the PFM component in meeting the performance
indicators, however, was uneven. It was determined during the review that project
disbursements was low due to significant challenges associated with GoK‘s absorption
problem and more importantly, the competing funds to support the PFM program,
especially since the Government was receiving support for PFM reforms through both
pooled or basket funds and those from outside the pooled funds, including from an EU


                                           15
grant funds managed by the Bank as well as a PHRD grant and direct bi-lateral support to
some components. Thus there were overlapping grant funding with the IDA credit, with
preference for the grants being used. The GoK also increased their counterpart funds to
support the program and activities meant to be funded by the project at the height of the
election crisis when Development Partners were reviewing their continued support to the
program. Basic organizational and administrative set-up of the project was assessed as
generally sound but recommendations were put forward to review the work plan of
components with low disbursement rate such as the Public Procurement Department
(PPD). Government was also advised to hire for at least one year a seasoned
procurement advisor to assist in capacity building within the Secretariat and the
components through hands-on training arrangements that would help mitigate weak
procurement capacity at the project entities level. Unfortunately, a change of the task
team leader after the mid-term review may have resulted in the absence of the needed
follow-up and sensitization to encourage government to take action on these
recommendations. The ad hoc team leadership arrangements for the project after mid-
term review affected close monitoring and implementation support. There is only one
ISR (dated July 31, 2011) that formally documented the result of an implementation
support mission (ISM) between the mid-term review and project closing. The period
after the mid -term review was a crucial time especially since a new constitution has been
introduced and since the government decided to implement a revised IFMIS agenda. The
absence of the appropriate follow-up on the issues identified to strengthen project
implementation further affected the project that consequently may have contributed to the
overall continued slow rate of disbursement. The other issue that was encountered during
that period was the decision by the Bank to have previously cleared IFR‘s revised due to
―exchange rate‖ issues. It should be noted that during the time that the IFRs were being
revised, disbursements could not be made by the Loans Department. Such interruption
caused a major impact in the implementation not only on the PFM components that were
directly managed by the PFMRS but also the PSR component, a relatively well
performing component and whose programs were making great momentum. An
assessment of the work plans for 2011 revealed that large procurement contracts for
goods (particularly for the Kenya Revenue Authority that has been accruing benefits from
the project since the start of implementation) were never finalized due to procurement
issues that extended for a relatively long time and never funded because the resolution
was only completed about six months before the closing date of the project. Such
procurement problems could have benefited from more proactive engagement by the
Task Team. The procurement plan of the taxes and revenue collection component
comprised roughly US$6.0 million of the FY10 PFM work plan.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

46.     M&E implementation. The Results Framework and Monitoring matrix in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) lists eight PDO indicators and eighteen intermediate
indicators. The indicators in this framework were used to monitor progress during the
project implementation period. At the Government level, the Ministry of Finance was
responsible for the overall implementation of the IRCB project operations and for
reporting process and coordinating actions among other project benefiting MDAs. At the



                                           16
same time, the Bank was monitoring actions and reviewing progress of the project
implementation, as well as the subsequent actions of the overall PFM and PSR reform
program by using reform benchmarks and the overall program outcomes outlined in the
PAD‘s Results Framework and Monitoring matrix. The results achieved during the
project implementation period were documented in Bank supervision missions‘ aide
memoires, and various project implementation evaluation reports carried out jointly by
the Government, the Bank and other development partners.

47.     M&E Utilization. The Bank team also assisted Public Sector Transformation
Department (PSTD) to develop an M&E framework that was successfully used to track
progress for the Results for Kenya activities at subcomponent level, including utilization
of Capacity Building funds that were outlined in its annual work plans. PSTD has
continued to use this M&E framework to monitor its own work plans, even after the
project closure. However, the lack of an approved M&E plans for most of the PFM sub-
components minimized the usefulness of the M&E framework as an institutional learning
tool for the government and therefore existed only as a traditional tool for the Bank team
to gauge project performance at a relatively macro level. During the earlier period of
the project implementation period, a consultant was engaged by the PFMRS to prepare an
M&E framework for the purpose of assisting PFM sub-components in adequately
carrying out the reporting, use of data sets and various studies and analysis. However,
the draft M&E action plan was never finalized and, therefore, regular monitoring at sub-
component level was difficult.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.     Financial Management. The project‘s financial management risk was rated
moderate at appraisal.        During implementation, the overall rating of financial
management performance was ―moderately satisfactory‖ primarily due to weaknesses in
reporting and failure of the lead accountant to adequately train junior account staff during
the first few years of the project. There were also problems with GOK‘s provision of
counterpart funds during the early stages of the project although this issue was eventually
resolved when the financing percentages of the expenditure categories under the IDA
Credit was changed to 100 per cent IDA financing. Further problems were experienced
in the preparation of the interim financial reports (IFRs) that were quarterly submitted to
the Bank disbursement office. In this case, the PFMR Secretariat staff had difficulties in
preparing IFRs showing expenditure classified by expenditure category for every DP‘s
contribution in the basket fund. The staff correctly argued that since funds were
contributed into the basket fund, it was difficult to provide information of each DPs
contribution by category of expenditure. This problem was later resolved through an
agreement that allowed the PFMR Secretariat staff to apportion the expenditure
according the each DP‘s contribution in the basket fund during the reporting period.

49.     Procurement. The major procurement risks for the implementation of the
Program were the decentralized nature of procurement that meant a relatively large
number of ministries/departments that were involved in implementation and the weak
procurement capacity of staff at all levels. In order to mitigate these risks, a highly
skilled procurement specialist was recruited. The task team supplemented this action


                                            17
through closer monitoring and provision of periodic technical procurement advice.
Procurement post review exercises were also undertaken on a regular basis. The
performance of procurement within the PFMRS remained moderately satisfactory for
most of the project period because of the general weak procurement capacity at the
component levels. In particular, the Kenya Revenue Authority was often unable to
receive procurement clearance on time due to its inability to comply with the agreed
procedures for large procurement contracts. The delays in finalizing bid documents
resulted in having these packages from not being funded by the project. During the mid-
term review in 2009, it was recommended that the procurement capacity should be
strengthened at the level of the components. More guidance and support by the World
Bank in-country procurement officer was assessed as necessary to address the capacity
constraints. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ―no objection‖ process should be
streamlined and the approval cycle shortened. It was also recommended that training
plans should not be subject to multiple reviews (requests for training undergo three levels
of approval process first, at the work planning stage, then during the implementation
stage by the Accounting Officer and finally by the World Bank) but that once approved
during the work planning stage, the Bank should just be notified of the training activity
that will be implemented and an ex-post audit would be conducted upon its completion to
assess whether the funds were used according to the plan. These recommendations,
however, were not pursued especially after a new Bank TTL took over in early 2010.

50.     Disbursement. The original credit amount of XDR 17.3 million was approved by
the Board on January 24, 2006, and it became effective on July 19, 2006. As of August
29, 2011, the project had commitments estimated at about XDR 7.5 million which
represented about 43% of the original credit amount. Just immediately prior to closure
on August 29, 2011, the undisbursed balance of XDR 9.75 million was cancelled. The
undisbursed balance in Categories 1 through 5 and the remaining balance of Category 6
(Unallocated) were cancelled and an amount equivalent to XDR 55,000.00 was
reallocated from Category 6 (Unallocated) to Category 5 (Operating Costs). The
undisbursed balance was earmarked for reallocation to well performing regional project,
the Kenya Transparency and Communication Infrastructure Project (KTCIP, P094103),
to support the IFMIS Strategic Plan 2011-13 as requested by the government in its letter
of June 30, 2011. The exercise of formally having the funds re-allocated to the KTCIP is
nearing completion. Furthermore, the relatively large amount that was cancelled was the
result of the low utilization due to the pooling arrangements where IDA credit funds
competed with grants made by the Development Partners. In some instances, the
government had to give higher priority to utilizing donor funds since the latter were being
made available only on an annual basis. Overall, and as already discussed, project
implementation also experienced delays that resulted in the relatively low level of
disbursements.

51.     KTCIP is expected to work closely with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to
developing a framework for implementation of IFMIS across MDAs. To this extent,
MOF has established an IFMIS department with the overall mandate of coordinating,
implementing and overseeing the re-engineering of IFMIS, and has launched a three year
strategic plan. The vision of the re-engineered IFMIS is to have ―a secure, reliable,



                                            18
efficient, effective, and fully integrated financial management system‖. One of the major
transformations of the IFMIS will be to shift from using the modular based approach that
saw the design and development of loosely linked modules administered by different
departments, to implementing a full cycle end to end integrated approach. This
integrated approach, if successfully completed, is expected to bring about synchrony
between the planning and budgeting cycle, and also be linked to the procurement and
payment processes to ensure that all purchases made within a spending unit have
requisite budget allocation, and guaranteed resources for their payment.

52.     Environmental Assessment. The environment category of the project at
appraisal was ―C‖ and, therefore, there were no environmental or safeguards issues that
had to be addressed.

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.     The main challenge of the post-completion operation is how to build on the
achievements of the support the government‘s public financial management reforms and
capacity building initiatives. More effort is needed to establish an effective dialogue with
government to sort out priorities in PFM reform and discuss alternatives for the way-
forward of the PFMR. In this regard, the Government has established the PFM Sector
working groups to spearhead dialogue on PFM Sector. Furthermore, the Government has
developed a draft PFM Reforms Strategy 2011-2012 which is expected to guide a broad
array of reforms in the sector for this duration. The most effective way forward could be
for the PFMR to become less comprehensive and focus on a number of key areas of
reform where donor support is important (e.g. further roll-out of IFMIS). It is also
necessary to assess and continue to discuss with government the content of the future
reforms and to distinguish between the scope of the reform program, and the scope of
what is supported by development partners. The government has also alluded to the need
to re-examine the way it supports its PFM reform program. In particular, it had strongly
communicated its desire for a DPL type operation for the future.

54.     Institutional capacity building improvements made in the entire public sector are
likely to be sustained, as well as the MTEF budget preparation and execution processes.
This is because the Government and civil society have worked together to strengthen
citizens participation of the reforms undertaken in these areas during the project
implementation period. The promulgation of the new constitution has also assisted the
citizens to demand transparency and accountability for all activities relating to public
service delivery.

55.     Financial sustainability of the overall public sector management (i.e. PFM and
PSR) reform activities is fairly good Despite the prevailing fiscal situation, including
implementation of priority activities outlined in the new constitution, the Government has
invested significant funds in some aspects of PFM, including re-launching of the IFMIS
with a significant amount of its funds and some support from the IDA under a different
project. This is expected to be complemented by continued assistance from development
partners, including the Bank. This will therefore ensure sustainability of some key
outcomes achieved during the project implementation period.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.     This was a highly relevant project given the governance and public sector
challenges Kenya faced at the time of project conceptualization and design. There was
acknowledgement and realization both within Government and the Donor community
that weak governance and public sector management systems were key binding
constraints on development effectiveness. Thus the objectives of the IRCBP were
relevant both in terms of the priorities and plans of the Government and the overall
country assistance strategy of the World Bank and the other DPs. The project was
developed with strong emphasis on improving governance and restoring the rule of law
articulated both in the Investment Program for Economic Recovery Strategy (IP-ERS),
and the joint World Bank-IFC CAS, 2004-2007. Through concessional financing, the
project was in line with the CAS objective of building institutional capacity for improved
service delivery. The project was linked to the Economic Recovery Strategy Support
Credit (ERSSC), and complemented other lending instruments for institutional reform
and capacity building such as the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC). The
project provided technical inputs on various reforms that were being undertaken by the
Government including financial management, support to the budget reforms and relevant
committees in parliament, accounting reform, and procurement reform. These reforms
were significantly relevant for improving key governance outcomes such as transparency,
accountability and responsiveness in the public sector. PFM reforms are relevant in
strengthening the public expenditure management systems and how the Government
spends its own money. The focus on results through RRIs and RBM were very relevant in
getting improvement in service delivery and behavioural change. It also provided a
catalytic effect for the Government to initiate a number of reforms outside the scope of
the project. Some aspects of the project result and methodology have now been
mainstreamed into Government processes. For example, the Rapid Results approach has
been adopted by the Government in its implementation of the new constitution and
devolution.

57.     Additionally, the project was closely linked with the objectives of the World Bank
Group Action Plan to support the ―Challenge of Africa‘s Development‖, which was a
results-oriented framework to support critical policy and public actions led by African
countries to achieve well-defined goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).

58.     Through this project, the Bank provided considerable cross-country experience in
several of the reform areas including financial management, procurement, enhancing
change management, and strengthening institutional capacity. It also leveraged its
experience as a lead or strategic partner in supporting large scale capacity building
programs in a number of African countries (for example IDA‘s support to Ethiopia‘s
Public Sector Capacity Building Program in 2004, to improve governance,
accountability, and the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at
the federal, regional, and local levels).

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.      The PDO is the strengthening of public financial management (PFM) systems to
enhance transparency, accountability and responsiveness to public expenditure policy
priorities as well as enhancement of public service delivery through the effective
implementation of Results Based Management (RBM). The Key Performance Indicators
capture the emphasis on sound fiduciary arrangements in the context of an evolving
framework of results based management. The PFM component had seven PDO
indicators that measure enhanced (i) transparency, (ii) accountability and (iii)
responsiveness. Overall, the PFM part of the PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory, and
the RBM is also rated as moderately satisfactory. Taking the rating of the different
indicators into account, the Project had a satisfactory rating on transparency; satisfactory
on responsiveness and moderately unsatisfactory on accountability. The
explanation/justification for these ratings is provided next.

60.      Transparency: The achievement of this aspect of the PDO is satisfactory. The
project contributed significantly to the achievement of transparency in the use of public
resources. PDO indicators 1, 3 and 4 measure transparency as well as intermediate
outcome indicators 1, 6, 7, and 8 (see data sheet). The production of annual external audit
reports on a regular basis within the stated time and the reduction in the backlog of
national audits (Indicator 1), the production of regular reports by the Public Accounts
and Investment Committee (Indicators 4 and 5), the reduction of within-year deviations
or actual aggregate expenditure of budget estimates from about 11% in 2004/05 to 7.2%
in 2008/09 and further to 2.4% in 2010/11 (Indicator 6), the rolling out of IPPD beyond
pilot ministries to all ministries, and the publication of results on performance contracts
have all improved transparency in government. External audit reports once cleared by
Parliament (though delayed) are published on a Government website and available to the
public. The Office of the Prime Minister has established a Performance Contract
Department which evaluates the performance of public agencies and publishes the
report/results which is accessible to the public (see www.psrpc.go.ke). This has
institutionalized a performance culture in the public service and reflects a general trend in
embracing the principle and practice of transparency in Kenya. This is also exemplified
in the July 2011 launch of the Open Data initiative, supported with World Bank TA. The
main limitation is slight delays in publication of annual audit report once audits are
completed. The overall achievement in transparency is, however, satisfactory.

61.     Accountability: The overall achievement of this outcome is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory as measured by PDO indicators on Finance Committee/PAC undertaking
its statutory functions (5), accountability and capacity of public servants in service
delivery (8); and also financial reporting by SAGAs and LGAs (Intermediate Indicator
4) and reporting through IFMIS (Intermediate Indicator 5), execution of annual audits
(9); internal audit (10); establishment of results units in MDAs (13) and institution of
code of ethics (14). Despite the limitations, especially the inability to have a functioning
IFMIS that could have introduced controls and reduced official discretion, modest


                                             21
progress was made in accountability on other indicators. On IFMIS good progress on
reforms is being made by the Government to address these limitations and IFMIS has
been re-launched by the Government with IDA support under a different project (KITCP,
with additional financing approved on March 29, 2012).

62.      Responsiveness: There has been a major improvement in responsiveness, partly
as a result of the progress in PFM and mainly as a result of the project‘s RBM and RRI
initiatives, as measured by PDO indicators 2 and 8 and intermediate outcome indicators
15, 16, 17 and 18 (see Data Sheet). Major achievements in responsiveness are the
alignment of the national budget with stated government priorities in the IP-ERS
(Indicator 2); the enhancement of capacity of public servants for delivery of services to
the public with good satisfactory rating, the successful implementation of RBM in pilot
ministries (PDO indicators 8). RBM and RRIs are now institutionalized into government
systems and processes (see Intermediate indicators 15-18). As noted above there is
improved performance culture as government agencies are evaluated on the performance
and the report published. The improved responsiveness is manifested in significant
improvement in public services such as the time to get a passport reduced from 60 to 10
days; ID issuance from 90 to 18 days; processing of business licenses from 30 days to 1
day, with the support of the project under the RBM program. The overall rating in the
achievement of responsiveness is satisfactory.

Budget and Public Financial Management

63.     The objective of the first component was to strengthen the financial resource
planning, budget preparation and implementation, strengthen financial controls, ensure
that allocation of government resources is consistent with policy priorities outlined in IP-
ERS, and reduction of fiduciary risks by making procurement transparent and efficient
and enhancing expenditure monitoring and audit. Key achievements of this component
included:

   a) Predictability of revenue receipts improved over time and this has in turn
      improved predictability of allocations to line ministries.
   b) Though there are still some disparities between the budget allocations and actual
      expenditure, this had been reduced significantly from about 30 percent in early
      2000s to 2.4% in the 2010-2011 financial year;
   c) The budget process had been made more transparent through the introduction of
      public sector hearings and parliamentary committee meetings that are open to the
      public. The budget documents and the quarterly budget and economic review are
      also made available to the public through the Treasury website;
   d) The Kenya National Audit Office (KENAO) had been strengthened and its
      efficiency increased. This resulted in the elimination of backlogs in audit reports.
      Other notable results include the following: (a) KENAO can now respond and
      undertake special audits as requested by Parliament and Development Partners;
      (b) audits are carried out in compliance with the Public Audit Act 2003; (c)
      annual audits were carried out in 100% of all Central Government Agencies and
      Donor Funded projects; (d) audit of Local Authorities and SAGAs is at 70% and


                                            22
     80% respectively; (e) audit reports until 2009/10 were made available through the
     external audit website (www.kenao.go.ke ); and (f) audit recommendations are
     being enforced through Parliamentary oversight committees and there is more
     effective functioning of ministerial audit committees.
e)   The internal audit function had been revamped and the operations changed from
     pre-audit and compliance audit to risk based audit approach. Ministerial audit
     committees have also been set up in all government ministries and their capacity
     strengthened to enable more effective management of their functions. The internal
     audit function had gradually shifted to value for money, performance and forensic
     audits.
f)   The oversight responsibility and capacity of Parliamentary committees had been
     strengthened. An implementation committee was established by parliament to
     follow up on recommendations made by the various oversight committees. The
     Parliamentary Budget Committee is now fully entrenched in the budget making
     process and scrutinizes the budget proposal before they are passed by parliament.
g)   The Public Procurement Oversight Authority was set up and had been involved in
     creating capacity for MDAs on procurement and educating procurement entities
     on the Procurement Law and regulations.
h)   Most of the line Ministries had developed strategic plans with support from the
     Program and have been using these plans to institutionalize results based
     management and performance contracting.
i)   The Kenya Revenue Authority managed to increase revenue collection from KSh
     274.3 billion in 2005/2006 to KSh 634.9 billion in 2010/2011 representing a
     revenue growth of 131%. This had been achieved through automation of the
     business processes. Voluntary tax compliance improved from 88% in 2005 to
     98.3% in 2011. The revenue growth had been estimated above 10% for each of
     the years of the program implementation. Tax debt to revenue ratio was reduced
     from 34.6% in 2005 to 14.7% in 2011. The cost of collection had been
     maintained at a level of less than 2% of the printed estimates and the timeliness of
     production of statistics was reduced from 48 days in 2005 to 38 days in 2011.
j)   The Pensions Department successfully installed a Pensions Management
     Information System (PMIS) and this led to digitization of some pension‘s records.
     A key outcome of this exercise was the reduction of delay in paying pensions
     from 90 to 28 days within the program period.
k)   The Debt Department migrated to the new version of Commonwealth Secretariat
     Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS 2000+). The component
     managed for the first time to prepare and publish a Medium term Debt Strategy
     (MTDS) covering the periods 2009/10 – 2011/12 and reviews were done
     annually.
l)   Capacity building of staff both locally and abroad was implemented across
     various components. The capacity of the components was also improved in terms
     of equipment and technology and facilities were built to enable the delivery of
     project results; and
m) Teachers Service Commission automated their service delivery processes and
   implemented 13 local modules.


                                         23
64.     Despite the various positive outcomes and results described above, there were
some outputs that were not fully implemented during the life of the project. These were
the following:

   a) The Economic Affairs Department within MoF expected to procure a new macro-
      model to assist in forecasting. However the procurement for a firm well versed in
      micro-modeling was unsuccessful and as such this critical activity was not
      implemented. The component continues to utilize the treasury model for
      forecasting;
   b) The adoption of program based budget has not been established even though some
      preparatory activities and indicative PBB was prepared for the 2009-2010
      financial year;
   c) The Kenya External Resources Policy (KERP) which was supposed to be
      published is still in draft form;
   d) The use of IFMIS for reporting had not been institutionalized among the MDAs
      thus affecting the quality of financial reports available;
   e) The interfacing/linking of the IPPD, Pensions system (PMIS) and TSC IFMIS
      was not achieved. The verification of the various payrolls also could not be
      achieved;
   f) Establishment of a common cadre for PFM staff, identification of local
      institutions that could offer PFM training was not achieved during the project
      implementation;
   g) Roll out of all the IFMIS modules delayed. However with the re-engineering of
      the system, it is expected this will be achieved; and
   h) Roll out of all the IFMIS modules implemented by the TSC to the districts was
      delayed.

Capacity Building for “Results for Kenyans?

65.     The primary objective of this component was to support the overall shift toward
effective management of key parts of the economy to fulfill Government commitments
under the ERS, and the related performance contracts for relevant ministries. The
component had two sub-components, Capacity Building Facility (CBF) and
Transformative Leadership Values and Ethics. CBF works with specific Ministries to
support the implementation of action plans for the realization of government priority
objectives in the Vision 2030 MTP.

66.    Implementation of the CBF was successful in relation to the results achieved by
the key ministries that accessed the facility (see Annex 2 for details of the specific
outcomes for each beneficiary). Other achievements include the printing and distribution
of 1, 500 copies of the Progress Annual Report by the Ministry of Planning, National
Development and Vision 2030 to fully inform the public on the status of the CBF.

67.     Other achievements are the following: (a) provision of support to working groups
in articulating the details of the new structure of public service, devolution and other


                                          24
technically packed provisions; (b) effective mobilization of the Task Force on Devolved
Government that resulted in the full implementation of the countrywide consultations and
completion of the report that contained the recommendations and structure for national
and devolved governments; (c) completed the training of 600 Rapid Results Initiatives
(RRI) coaches throughout Government. Through Rapid Results Initiatives (RRIs)
Ministries, Departments and Agencies were fully supported to develop Change
Management Plans.

Technical Support and Capacity for Project Implementation

68.     The PFMRS reported to the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Finance, who is
the Accounting Officer of the project. Implementation of the overall program, therefore,
was mainstreamed within Government. Although coordination of Sub-component 2.2
(Transformative Leadership and Ethics for RBM) was managed by the Secretary, Public
Sector Reform and Development Secretariat, in the Cabinet Office, the PFMRS
undertook satisfactorily the consolidation of reports (i.e. IFRs, progress reports, etc.) and
coordination of the contributions from other development partners for the entire project
through both pooled and non-pooled funding arrangements. The PFMRS also served as
the main contact point by the Bank for the project. Except for the issue related to flow of
funds, interaction and collaboration between the PFMRS and the PSRDS had been
satisfactory for the most of the project period.

69.    The implementation process was coordinated with other development partners
contributing financially to PFM reforms through both pooled and non-pooled funding
arrangements.

3.3    Efficiency

70.      The IRCBP was implemented with the intent of mobilizing resources required for
public sector reform through TA support from the Bank and other DPs. Attempts to
determine an ERR are in such cases not useful. However, in terms of the utilization of
resources, these were carried out with cost efficiency objectives using least cost approach
mandated by the procurement guidelines adopted under the project whereby goods were
procured with the objective of obtaining the best value for money and consultants were
hired with the view to getting the best technically qualified individual or firms for the
money. Furthermore, training activities were budgeted and expensed in accordance with
unit rates that were compared against prevailing rates. These practices helped ensure cost
efficiency in the use of project funds. In addition, to the extent possible, training were
bulked and/or local institutions were engaged (i.e. KIA) in training a much larger number
of staff.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory
71.     This ICR results has assigned ratings to individual components. Annex 1 sets out
the ratings assigned to each of the individual components of the project. The overall ICR
results rating of ―moderately satisfactory‖ is based on the PDO rating and an aggregation


                                             25
of the ratings and overall operational performance and achievements of the components.
It is also informative to look at the different aspects of the PDO and the extent they were
achieved to justify the overall project rating. Section 3.2 above provides explanations and
justifications for achievements on transparency, accountability and responsiveness
aspects of the PDO. The PDO has two main parts: (a) PFM and (b) RBM. The PFM had
seven PDO indicators that measure enhanced (i) transparency, (ii) accountability and (iii)
responsiveness. Based on the achievement of the different PDO indicators and project
components, the overall, PFM part of the PDO is rated as moderately satisfactory, while
the RBM part is also rated as moderately ‗satisfactory (see section 3.2 above for further
explanation).

72.      Additional factors that take into account the overall rating of the project are:

      a) Although some progress was made in achieving the PDO, not all outcomes were
         achieved satisfactorily due to constraints that were sometimes significant (e.g.
         IFMIS). However, on balance, the project contributed to the substantial gains in
         developing the foundations for further reform and in recognizing the capacity
         building needs of a wide variety of actors to manage complex change and move in
         the direction that is consistent with the project design. The project also catalyzed
         the GOK to undertake reforms beyond what is planned in the project, including
         scaling up the RBM principle to all MDAs and adopting it for the implementation
         of the new constitution. Even in cases where the outcomes were unsatisfactory
         (e.g IFMIS), the Government is making serious efforts to address the constraints
         and move ahead with reforms. Example here is the re-launch of IFMIS with Bank
         support after the project has closed.
      b) While the outcomes of the project are rated as moderately satisfactory when
         measured in terms of the government‘s persistence to move ahead with project
         activities despite being confronted by the various operational challenges and
         political events, the phase of implementation and mixed results contributed to the
         moderately satisfactory rating.
      c) The PDO rating was thus based on the final status of the PDO indicators on
         transparency, accountability and responsiveness of the PFM and RBM aspects of
         the PDO as noted in section 3.2 and 3.4. Taking all eight PDO indicators into
         account, two were rated satisfactory with the positive outcomes pertaining to (a)
         alignment of the budget with the Policy Framework of Vision 2030; and (b)
         establishment and functioning of Skilled Finance/Budget committee in
         Parliament, with the public discussion and engagement in the budget process now
         fully entrenched. Another three indicators were partially achieved and indicators
         3 and 7 were rated as MU or U. The rating was also assessed on the mixed
         outcomes and results of the two main components: (a) Budget and Public
         Financial Management; and (b) Capacity Building for Results.

      d) It is also noted that the low amount disbursed from the IDA Credit can be partly
         explained by the government‘s actions in implementing several inter-related
         reforms in the Public Service whose outcomes cannot be strictly attributable to




                                              26
          one project/program but jointly contributed to improved service delivery. It could
          also be attributed to the following:
         The set of activities defined in the original PAD were not restructured after the
          Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of the pooling arrangement was finalized.
          Therefore, the same sets of activities were being funded by IDA and the Donors,
          including the EU, and this has resulted in some competition between IDA
          resources and donor funds; and
         Most of the priority technical assistance activities, including training that led to
          the achievement of key targets in the M&E framework, was completed in the
          early stages of the project. The undisbursed amount (about US$6.0 million) under
          the PFM component comprised mainly of scaled-up activities and large value
          goods contracts intended for the Kenya Revenue Authority and IFMIS
          components. Similarly for the PSR component, undisbursed portion was mostly
          for funding the second phase of the CBF work plans.

73.      The government emphasized that while the total amount disbursed was much
lower than the approved Credit allocation, this should not be considered as the only
benchmark to measure IDA‘s support. The government reiterated that the IRCBP‘s
framework was instrumental in the creating awareness on service improvements
initiatives. In addition, the completion of the technical assistance investments (co-
financed with donors) in the early stages of the project in areas such as change
management, financial audits, human resource development, rapid results initiatives and
the relatively large number of capacity building activities implemented across the project
contributed extensively to the achievement of the intended targets of the M&E
framework of the project. Feedback from the Government counterparts suggests that the
reform initiatives supported by the project has spurred the Government of Kenya to
embark on related reforms.

3.5       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.      As noted in 3.1 above, the Project in its inception was responsive to the
Government‘s strategic approach to improving governance and restoring the rule of law
articulated both in the Investment Program for Economic Recovery Strategy (IP-ERS),
and the joint World Bank-IFC CAS, 2004-2007. The project supported public financial
management reforms and service delivery improvements through capacity building
activities of key ministries that were linked to poverty reduction goals.

75.      Gender aspects under the project and the Kenyan environment in general had
always been given due attention especially in the implementation of capacity building
activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

76.   The project in itself promoted institutional change and strengthening through the
implementation of activities under the two key components (PFM and PSR). The


                                              27
implementation of various reforms and the institutionalization of results based activities
paved the way to stronger capacity of targeted ministries in pursuing its mandate. In
addition, the support provided by the project to the government‘s ―Vision 2030‖ initiative
led to increased awareness in delivery of services that are results based. Furthermore, the
PRMRS and the PSR units were staffed with individuals with relatively stronger sets of
skills in project management and administration that showcased how management units
should be organized and managed.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

77.     The cancellation of the undisbursed balance of the Credit was an unintended
outcome. The undisbursed balance was agreed between the Bank and the government to
be reallocated to a well performing regional project, the Kenya Transparency and
Communication Infrastructure Project (KTCIP, P094103), to support the IFMIS Strategic
Plan 2011-13. This outcome was directly linked to the recent development where the
government brought forward a new comprehensive strategy to reform public financial
management in line with the requirements of the new Constitution and particularly in line
with the implementation of the IFMIS Strategic Plan for 2011-13. The undisbursed funds
had been earmarked for activities that are focused in the following areas: (a) leveraging
industry-leading processes for financial management (aligned with Oracle Financials) for
the development of high-level end-to-end business processes; (b) technical support to the
IFMIS department for a further 24 months to facilitate full roll out to the national and
county government in line with the strategic plan; (c) develop and implement a capacity
building program through the IFMIS Academy of an initial 2,000 officers (classroom
based), thereafter to be extended to 4,000 officers via online learning platforms; and (d)
development of systems integrator for all the IFMIS modules. It should be noted that
despite the cancellation of the undisbursed balance of the IRCBP Credit, the project
achieved its key objectives. As explained earlier, the project had made an impact on
GoK‘s approach to implementing Vision 2030. Project resources also funded technical
assistance activities that inculcated ―Results Oriented Management‖ knowledge among
MDAs and subsequently led to their responsive to public expenditure policy priorities. It
can be said, therefore, that the cancellation was an unexpected outcome which to some
extent was not necessarily a negative result in terms of what had been achieved.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N.A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

78.      Public sector reform is an uncertain process in almost all situations. The
sustainability of its gains is sensitive to contextual conditions, political trends, change of
priorities, bureaucratic conflict and sheer loss of interest and momentum. The IRCBP
has been able to achieve a range of objectives that have been discussed earlier. But it
remains to be seen whether the institution strengthening can be sustained in the Kenyan


                                             28
context, where some degree of political and bureaucratic risks still exist. Continued
engagement, dialogue, follow-up and an innovative lending instrument for the next
operation should be considered to ensure that the gains in service delivery achieved under
the project are sustained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

79.     In many respects, the Bank‘s approach to the design and management of IRCBP
followed most of the currently accepted principles of partnership and aid management
championed in the Paris Declaration. The assessment of Bank performance is thus rated
as ―Moderately satisfactory‖. The task team was composed of the right skill mix during
preparation. The preparation was well coordinated with development partners. The team
correctly identified the need for appropriate institutional arrangements for managing the
reform process that are fully mainstreamed and linked to a clear strategic framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

80.     Supervision was undertaken at least twice each year from 2006 to 2009 that
allowed the provision of on-site support to the government team. Between 2010 until
closing only one implementation support mission (ISM) was carried out which was
inadequate for a project of this nature. The same TTL managed the project from
preparation to the end of CY 2009. From 2010-2011, an ad-hoc TTL arrangement was
put in place by the Bank. During the period 2006-2009, the Bank task team provided
prompt and relevant responses to requests from the government team. The average
period of response to requests for no-objections and review of terms of references was
five working days except when documents were incomplete and/or the procedures used
were not consistent with the agreed guidelines which took longer to process than the
norm of five working days. However, supervision and responsiveness to the client seem
to have waned after 2009. For the most part, the Bank‘s team and its approach was pro-
active, demonstrating flexibility in addressing issues. The Bank task team‘s focus of
realizing the developmental impact of the project ensured that project implementation
focused on the appropriate activities, that the objectives of the project were met. High
quality mission reports were prepared at the end of each mission and the ISRs were frank
with justifiable ratings. The Bank was also instrumental in helping to consolidate
external funding into a common basket in 2006 that, in turn, acted to reduce the
transaction costs for Government. The Bank also succeeded in receiving special funds
from the DPs during the period 2007 to 2009 for work related to compliance with
fiduciary requirements of the project. A comprehensive Mid-Term review was conducted
in September 2009. Implementation issues were identified and remedial actions were


                                           29
agreed upon. However, when an ad-hoc Bank TTL arrangement was put in place
beginning in early 2010, a noticeable reduction in the frequency of the support missions
occurred as evidenced by the existence of only one ISR documenting a field mission.
The lack of appropriate follow-up by the Bank on the recommendations of the mid-term
review may have contributed to the operational problems that were confronted by the
project near of just before the closing of the project (i.e. protracted delays in resolving
procurement issues with KRA, interruption of funds flow, etc.).

81.    Except for the last two years of the project, the Bank maintained a full team that
collaborated with the government and crafted constructive partnership that helped
maintained an informed and steady relationship through provision of sound technical
advice on IEC, IT, M&E, financial management and procurement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

82.     Given the moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and the moderately
unsatisfactory rating for supervision, ICR guidance requires overall Bank performance to
conform with the outcome rating, which was moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     Judgments on the performance of the Government must, given its dominant role
in the implementation of the IRCBP, be a good deal more complex to assess compared to
those that has something to do with the performance of the Bank and other DPs. But the
Government is at least as responsible as the DPs for the success and weaknesses of the
project. The rating assigned in this ICR to the performance of the borrower is
―moderately satisfactory‖ for the following reasons.

      a) The Government through the PFMRS took full ownership and management of
         the project beginning in 2006 and managed it effectively although
         implementation was delayed due to fiduciary issues that affected project
         disbursements and procurement.
      b) The Government managed to sustain its role despite the political crisis that evolved
         during the project. The pattern of longer-term thinking was an important factor
         that yielded a positive outcome in terms of the realization of key reform targets of
         the project.

84.    The number of components under the ―Pooled Fund‖ arrangements led to
major challenges of coordination and harmonization and had some impact on the
timing of the implementation of individual reform programs. The progress of IRCBP
was thus influenced by the difficulties by the PFMRS in coordinating and motivating


                                               30
the component teams that suffered from lack of effective synergies and common
understanding of the procedures that had to be followed under the project. These events
and the delays experienced to implement partly caused the low disbursement level of the
Credit proceeds.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     Project management under the PFMRS was rated ―moderately Satisfactory‖ for
most of ISRs. The rating is based on recorded information that indicates that while work
plans were prepared with the view to prioritizing and scheduling various activities, there
were often delays in finalizing the document that affected the timely completion of
procurement plans. In addition, fiduciary issues confronted the unit. However, as agreed
upon in the Development Credit Agreement, annual and quarterly project management
reports summarizing progress and outstanding issues were prepared in a relatively timely
manner. Procurement management was good as all the approved procurement contracts
followed the procurement procedures outlined in the project documents. Unfortunately,
apparent miscommunication between the PFMRS and components affected the timely
processing of ―No-Objection‖ requests. With regards to financial management (FM), the
fiduciary issues identified by the country fiduciary review, resulted in the replacement of
the PFMRS FM specialist. For the most part, however, financial records were maintained
and annual external audits were commissioned on time and the reports delivered to the
Bank within the stipulated six months after the preceding financial year.

86.    The PFMRS developed the ability to discuss its achievements and failures in
coordinating the reform agenda with relative frankness and openness with both the Bank
and the DPs. Part of this may be due to the overall trend within the Government on
―openness‖ especially as articulated in its ―Vision 2030‖ on accountability and
transparency.

87.     The PFMRS maintained the appropriate number of staff for implementing the
program. It was able to utilize effectively technical assistance to ensure it contributed to
the relevant deliverables. With adequate resources at hand, the PFMRS was able to
implement work plans and met its fiduciary responsibilities for financial management,
procurement and external audit.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

88.   Given the ―moderately satisfactory‖ rating of the Government's performance and
the ―moderately satisfactory‖ rating of the performance of the implementing agencies,
ICR guidance requires overall Borrower performance to conform to the outcome rating of
―moderately satisfactory‖.

6. Lessons Learned

89.     Political Environment and Public Sector Reform Approach: Public sector
reforms are inherently political and their design and implementation has to be
informed by a careful and ongoing political economy (PE) analysis. Kenya‘s complex
political authorizing environment affected the project at various stages. Fiduciary
weaknesses and leakages in government affected the procurement schedules when ―no
objection requests‖ had to be put on hold in more than two instances to re-assess these
risks when there were changes in government ministries and forensic audits provided
useful insights. Post-election violence and coalition government consensus- building
efforts took a long time to settle and resulted in unnecessary delays. Consequently, we
have learned that appropriate PE analysis should be required to underpin public sector
technical modernization efforts.

90.     Fiscal Role and Responsibility of Government: Fiscal roles of the branches of
government and among different levels of government are clearly defined in law and
practice. However, the blurred line between general government and the rest of the
public sector makes it difficult to accurately establish the full extent of extra-budgetary
spending or to clearly define general government.

91.      Resistance to Change is a Major Hurdle. Public sector and governance reforms
affect various interests and often face resistance. In the past few years, Kenya‘s civil
society has increasingly demanded better government services and called for
improvements in the checks-and-balances in the use of resources. However, public sector
institutions have generally resisted this call for change, thus affecting project outcomes.
The implementation of an integrated financial management system, for example, which
aims to make management of public finances transparent, has suffered repeated push-
backs. As a result of the organizational resistance in the MOF and the other MDAs, only
a small portion of the credit could be used to fund IFMIS tasks, which negatively affected
the overall rating of the project. Forty percent of project resources, or about US$10
million out of the 25 million, were allocated to IFMIS, the majority of which were not
utilized.

92.     Design complexity and arrangements: Both the Government and the DPs
supported the design of the project. The design, however, may have underestimated the
implementation challenges inherent in managing such a complex program. For example,
the following constraints and risks faced by the PFMRS during the project
implementation are important lessons that should be taken into account when designing
future similar operations.

   a) PFMRS did not have a mandated authority to give instructions to the component
      managers. This was coupled with the absence of a stable full time project
      coordinator.
   b) The absence of a component leader with strong leadership and ownership skills in
      implementing reforms activities.




                                            32
   c) Lack of a dedicated desk officer at the sub-component level to address operational
      issues and champion the execution of specific reform initiatives under the project.
   d) Failure by components to recognize the need to fully integrate proposed activities
      into strategic plans, annual work plans, performance contracts and budgets of
      MDAs.
   e) Weak understanding of how to harmonize government procedures and systems
      with those of the project.
   f) Delay in the introduction of the agreed monitoring and evaluation framework.
   g) Lack of a strong, elaborate and effective communication strategy between the
      coordinating unit and stakeholders.
   h) Absence of regular higher level management guidance.
   i) Inadequate amount of initial capacity building activities on project design,
      procurement, disbursement, and financial management procedures of the Bank.

93.     Level of coordination and oversight: While the project design adequately
identified high level leadership is key to successful project implementation, effective
leadership at component and sub-component levels, is also equally important. The
project suffered from not having stable project leadership with high turn-over rate (4
project coordinators over the file of the project. Also component leaders were not well-
informed about the project. This predicament resulted in a relatively weak leadership at
the sub-component levels and also at the centre. Furthermore, the absence of regular high
level management guidance created difficulties for the PFMRS in making sub-
components understand that project activities were not isolated activities but were part
and parcel of just one work plan. The change in project team leadership both by the Bank
and the Government happened without effective transition period.

Appropriateness of Lending Instrument: The lending instrument used for IRCBP was
considered the most appropriate one during preparation. However, the challenges that
affected the project during implementation associated with the rate of disbursement
revealed that a different lending mechanism may have been more appropriate. The
current Bank effort to introduce performance for results (P4R) instrument would be
useful in managing the institutional planning problems and better target outputs in future
public sector projects.

94.     Although the project was designed with the view to having flexibility in
anticipation of the pooling arrangements, a project restructuring may have helped
minimize problems encountered on disbursements and absorption capacity. Also, the
restructuring would have given the opportunity to re-visit and formally introduce the
―Operational Manual‖ and the possible re-alignment of the M&E framework.

95.     Harmonization of Donor Assistance in Investment Projects Needs Careful
Review. The Accra Declaration and other accords call for the donor community to
streamline their assistance and harmonize programs. In this spirit, the project introduced a
joint financing arrangement for funding public financial management activities. This
pooling of funds has had mixed results. On the one hand, it has helped to bring together



                                            33
several donors on the coordination table. On the other hand, it has affected actual pace
and implementation due to certain operational challenges. These issues include the extra
burden of multiple reporting to individual donors‘ standard, huge amount of time spent
on negotiation/consultation on the individual donor disbursement share in each
disbursement request rather than concentrating on the substance of reforms. Each donor
has interests in seeing their funds disbursed and sometimes went outside the ‗basket
funds‘ to fund activities in the project. In view of these difficulties it is important to note
that fund-pooling arrangement should only be used when absolutely necessary and
perhaps not for investment-type projects.

96.    Regular supervision and implementation support: Regularized and sustained
implementation support missions are necessary for effective monitoring of the project
and provision of continued support to the clients. Since there is only one recorded field
ISR from 2010-2011, the ICR assessed that Bank supervision of the IRCBP decreased at
the time when this was mostly needed at the end of the project. Therefore, it is essential
to ensure that projects are supervised on a regular basis throughout its life and most
especially during its final stages of implementation.

(CIDA, DANIDA, Norway, and SIDA), were requested to submit written comments but
none did. However, a meeting was held with their representatives on February 8, 2012,
and the key issues and concerns are summarized as follows:

   a) A general unhappiness about the closure of the project closed, but recognition that
      there were difficulties in managing the project and disbursing funds.
   b) Uneven disbursement of funds within the basket among development partners,
      with overall disbursement of the pool funds amounting to only US$4.45 out of
      US$9.92 million. Development partners want to understand the decision making
      process in disbursement. The key point here is that with the basket/pool funding
      arrangement, it is difficult to track particular donor funds, but when the GOK is
      reporting on use of funds it normally reports on the proportion of funds used
      based on how much each partner has put in the basket. Thus unevenness in
      disbursement among the development partners is a reflection of how much each
      partner had put in the basket when a request comes in from GoK.
   c) Recognition that disbursement was slow across both the IDA credit and the
      Basket Fund, partly due to absorption capacity of the government and partly to
      other factors such as fiduciary issues.




                                              34
   d) Management and coordination of the project by the Bank was seen as weak with
      frequent changes of task managers and no one seem to be in-charge, especially
      from 2009.
   e) The basket fund approach was complicated and did not seem to have reduced
      transaction cost both for the Government and Development partners.
   f) There is strong interest in finding a way forward to prepare a follow on operation
      to support the Government, especially with the ambitious devolution program.
      Development partners will have to rethink the modalities for joint funding of
      Government Programs. SIDA is providing transitional funding from the balance
      of its contribution until September, 2012 to enable GOK to prepare a work plan.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     As indicated in section 3.2, an examination of the achievement of project
intermediate results provides enhanced explanatory value in support of the project rating.

2.    Component 1 - Budget and Public Financial Management (Rating:
Moderately Unsatisfactory).
The objective of this component was to make budget processes and public financial
management (PFM) more transparent, accountable, and responsive to policy priorities.

3.      The rating of this component of ―Moderately Unsatisfactory‖ was based on the
partial achievement of the following PDO objectives: (a) while audit is being carried out
and compliance with the Public Audit Account. Audit Committees are in place, not all are
functioning and LGA audit reports are in arrears; (b) although budget is aligned with the
Policy Framework of Vision 2030 MTP 2008-2012, MTEF Budgets are prepared,
stakeholder participates in the National Budget through Sector hearings at the National
Level, a number of MDAs complained that their priories were not always captured in the
Framework of Vision 2030.; (c) while Risk Based Internal Audit Approach has been
adopted in all the line ministries of Government, committees are not functioning
effectively.; (d) MTEF Budgets are being prepared; (e) Public Accounts Committee
submits reports but not in a timely manner. Only one PDO indicator on the effective
functioning of the Finance Committee of Parliament in undertaking its statutory functions
and compliance with the budget was achieved.

4.     A massive dose of capacity building activities in the areas of financial and public
sector management in the focus areas of competence of targeted civil servants were
implemented. Key technical assistance activities that were intended to jumpstart the
process of reform and change management were also carried out.                    Specific
outputs/outcomes of the various components and sub-components are provided in the
following paragraphs.

5.      Sub-component 1.1 Strengthening Budget Formulation (Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory). The objective of this sub-component was to support the Government’s on-
going efforts at streamlining budget formulation processes, strengthening the MTEF
consultative mechanisms with stakeholders and alignment of expenditure with ERS
priorities and to support various activities undertaken before budget formulation such as
providing technical assistance to strengthen Sector Working Groups and in preparing
sector reports.

6.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) a comprehensive
budget and an Indicative Program Based Budget have been developed; (b) capacity on
Program Based Budget built through the training of 80 budget preparatory teams; (c)
guidelines for the preparation of Program Based Budget developed; and (d) public
finance management bill had been formulated.




                                         37
7.       Among the notable results included budget macroeconomic forecasts and
underlying macroeconomic assumptions that were clearly presented and were generally
realistic. A comparison of actual receipts against the original budgeted figures over the
years 2004/05 to 2006/07 indicated that, in aggregate, the budget had been successful in
forecasting the actual revenue receipts. In two of the three years, actual revenue received
exceeded the budgeted amount; and in only one of these years was revenue collection
below 99.7% of budgeted domestic revenue estimates. The performance, therefore, had
been good, with a positive trend both in the budgeted and actually collected amounts.

8.       Another outcome is the revision of the organic budget law (Public Financial
Administration Bill 2008) that was presented to Parliament. This resulted in the
significant improvement on the 2004 Act. Of particular importance under the new law
are: (i) strengthening the prudential oversight role of the National Assembly in the budget
process (ii) expanded responsibility of the Treasury to include the preparation of a debt
policy statement and a strategy for external and domestic borrowing (iii) timely
budgetary reporting within 20 days of end of month, and (iv) the legal consequences of
financial misconduct by public officers. The annual budget cycle, which had been
strengthened in the last few years under the MTEF reforms, was well defined and
structured, known to budgetary entities, and generally adhered to. The budget preparation
circular gave clear guidance and reflects three year ceilings. It was generally approved
by Cabinet before being circulated.

9.      There was good practice in terms of having the Budget Strategy Paper (BSP)
published before the annual budget was finalized. The BSP was used to reconcile the
changes between the PRGF, BOP and BSP. Budget Speech incorporates the up-to-date
information on the preliminary outturn of the previous financial year. Reconciliations
were presented at an aggregated level by broad economic classification, and not by
sectoral/ministerial ceilings or functional allocations.

10.    This lead to improvements in recent years of the deviation in actual expenditure
as compared to the approved estimate on aggregate level. For example, the deviation was
-11% for 2004/05, -6% for 2005/06, and -4% for 2006/07. The variance in composition
of expenditure outturn as compared to the original approved budget was as follows: 3.8%
in 2004/05, 7.5% in 2005/06 and 3.6% in 2006/07. The considerable reallocations noted
in 2005/06 related to the Office of the President, and the Ministries of Finance, Roads,
Energy and Lands.

11.     However, there were some challenges in budget preparation techniques and sector
planning. The budget was predominantly incremental, with limited changes in
allocations over the years. The creation of sector working groups and plans, however,
displayed the growing commitment to improved sector planning. Since 2006, the role of
the Sector Working Groups in the functional allocations had been strengthened. The
MTEF is now supported by eight Sector Working Groups, which cover approximately
75% of the budget. The costed sector strategies represent a priority list and are not fully
funded under the ministerial ceilings. Some costed activities may be funded if/when
additional domestic revenue is collected or additional donor resources materialize.



                                          38
12.     The Budgetary Supplies Department also explored the possibility of introducing
program-based budgeting (PBB), which points to further commitment by GoK to move
away from incremental budgeting. The IMF conducted two missions and give technical
advice on PBB and MoF staff visited 5 countries that have adopted PBB. Line ministry
personnel were fully trained and undertook study tours in other countries through the
(OECD) SBO Africa network. The new Fiscal Management Act became a legal
requirement to present results in the budget. The activities that led to these results were
partly financed through PFMR, partly through direct assistance from GTZ and GoK
resources.

13.     Budget presentation is now partly consistent with international standards. The
budgetary and accounting classifications include administrative and economic
classifications, but do not include functional or program classifications. The economic
classifications were upgraded to a GFS 2001 compatible framework in FY 2005/06 (with
support of the IMF and GTZ).

14.    With regard to transparency of the budget, it can be noted that public access to
key fiscal information has improved. The MoF website now provides better access to
budget documents than before. Furthermore, sector hearings are organized with the
public/media.

15.     The public debt legislation is now reviewed in conjunction with debt management
objectives and strategy in the law. Quality of debt data recording and reporting has
become more comprehensive and accurate. The Central Bank is now managing domestic
debt with front office operations with the view to consolidating all three functions (front,
middle and back office) into a single debt management office. There are now clearly
defined functions, annual work plans, a debt management service charter, and debt
management is included in the MoF strategic plan. Now, effective responses can be given
to parliamentary questions. The new debt management software had been installed, used
in budget preparation and debt statistics. In 2008/09 new business process manuals were
prepared.

16.    Sub-program 1.2 Strengthening budget execution, accounting, and financial
reporting (Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory). The objective of this sub-component was
to support the Government in implementing the recommendations contained in its
Enhanced Financial Management Action Plan (EFMAP).

17.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) harmonization of the
financial regulations with the constitution through the development of the Public
Financial Management bill; (b) development and adoption of the COFOG budget coding
system; (c) completion of training of the staff of GFS 2001, COFOG and IFMIS; (d)
completion of the 6-month Certified Public Accountants (CPA) course for 127 staff; (e)
completion of training of 5 officers from the External Resources Department on effective
management of donor funds; (f) completion of training of officers from some line
ministries on the use of electronic Project Monitoring Information System (e-ProMIS);
(g) finalization of the review of the Kenya External Resources Policy (KERP) that was



                                          39
used to harmonize the policy for the new Constitution; (h) completion of the loading of
aid management data of 100 government projects to e-ProMIS; (i) completion of training
of 10 ERD officers on the use of e-ProMIS; (j) acquisition and full installation of 6
laptops, 6 heavy duty photocopiers, 2 medium duty colored printers and 6 medium size
duplex printers for key staff of ERD responsible for managing external resources; (k)
completion of the Debt Strategy Formulation training of two (2) ERD officers who are
now supporting the Department in updating the existing debt management strategy; (l)
completion of the review and update of the Mid-Term Debt Management Strategy that
was presented to parliament together with the budget; (m) procurement of 12 racks for
the efficient storage of pension files; (o) completion of training for 150 officers on basic
computing, 80 officers on records management, and one (1) officer on electronic payroll
and records management of the Pensions Department; and (m) continued digitization of
manual records.

18.      It is worthwhile to note that the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database
Scheme (IPPDS) had been a ―homegrown‖ success story, developed by a local project
management team that ensured full GOK ownership of the system. It successfully
covered all ministries and employee data for about 550,000 civil servants and state
employees (or 95% of central government employees including education and medical
staff at district level, the military and police services). Currently All salary payments are
made on the 20th of each month. The IPPDS had also improved the timeliness of
changes to personnel records, thereby helping to ensure no ―ghost workers‖ were
included in the system. Unfortunately the IPPDS was not fully integrated into the IFMIS.
It continued as a ―stand-alone‖ system so that salary data and payments were made
outside IPPDS, with data entered manually to the IFMIS. The Government had not fully
implemented a WAN system although this issue was on the government‘s agenda at the
time of project closure

19.      Due to the relevance of the teachers‘ payroll on budget management and the need
to update about 260,000 payroll data of teachers, PFM funds were utilized to support the
Teachers Service Commission (TSC) financial management functions. The key
outputs/outcomes of the activities funded include the following: (a) completion of the
training of 471 staff on integrated payroll and personnel data base (IPPD); (b) completion
of training on database management and administration of 74 staff; (c) completion of the
training of 30 auditors on managing the audit function, 6 staff on financial management
in public sector, 283 on school returns database management, 10 staff on IFMIS technical
skills, 20 staff on CISA, 8 ICT staff on website and software support and maintenance, 25
staff on IDEA software, 60 staff on public relations and customer care and 5 staff on
public asset and disposal management; (d) acquisition and full installation of 300 desktop
computers and Uninterrupted Power Supply units, 30 laptops, 2 servers and 90 medium
duty printers.

20.    While there were notable results of the component, persisting challenges in the
budget process were experienced during implementation. For example, budget releases
were not predictable and payments were delayed resulting in high arrears. Cash
management and commitment control therefore were not fully reliable. Available data do



                                           40
not allow tracking of expenses to district level. There were reports of high leakage from
surveys that track whether spending units receive their intended budget allocations and of
poor budget implementation, especially related to development spending for several
programs. The financial records do not provide sufficient information for decision-
makers and had been limited in scope by one-dimensional hierarchical accounting
structures and in access by the lack of automation. Quality of financial records was
relatively low and timeliness and design of reports was inaccurate. The production of
annual reports ready for audit, were often delayed or incomplete. Basic accounting and
internal control procedures are frequently modified and are not legally enforceable.
Furthermore, the Constitutional provisions related to government financial administration
are no longer underpinned by a set of clear and legally enforceable financial regulations.
Financial administration is presently governed by outdated regulations known as the
Government Financial Regulations and Procedures (GFRP) dating from 1989. Many of
these are no longer followed and are no longer appropriate to the changes made by
government in its financial management. Some changes to regulations have been
implemented by circulars issued by the Treasury which have not yet been codified and
which rarely refer to the legal authority supporting them, and are thus probably not
legally enforceable. These challenges could form the basis for the further support or
should be considered when setting further the priorities in the development of the new
PFM strategy.

21.     Sub-program 1.3 Strengthening Public Financial Management through the use
of Information Technology (Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory). The objective is this
sub-component is to support the government I (a) timely capturing of accurate and
verifiable data of budget execution, for improved financial reporting thereby hereby
reducing the opportunities for unaccountable discretion on the part of the executive: and
(ii) providing enhanced internal controls to improve public expenditure management
(including pay-roll management).

22.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) completion of the
customization of the General Ledger, Accounts Payable and Purchase Orders reports; (b)
sensitization of 250 officers from technical areas of finance, budgeting, human resource,
audit and procurement on the use of the newly introduced modules; (c) roll out of IFMIS
to 54 accounting units in ministries; (d) full implementation of G-PAY (Electronic Funds
Transfer) and installation of additional modules such as Account Receivable, Asset
Management and Cash Management; and (e) completion of the roll out of IPPD to six
additional SAGAs.

23.     The automation of the public financial management system was a cumbersome
process that had taken a long time to develop. Three modules were rolled out to all
central government entities in Nairobi, with the accounting module being the most
important of these. While its progress to date has not been steady and it faces resistance
from some quarters, the IFMIS rollout has enormous potential for improving budget
control, increasing transparency, improving cash management etc. Just before the project
closed, the Minister of Finance communicated to IDA and the DPs the need to move
forward with IFMIS. This was also the reason for the action taken by the Bank to cancel



                                         41
the balance of the Credit and to re-allocate it to a regional project (KTCIP) that is dealing
with providing support on IT infrastructure.

24.    Sub-program 1.4 Strengthening the External Audit System (Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory). The objective of this sub-component was to support the strengthening of
capacity of the Kenya National Audit Office to become an effective institution that will
enhance financial accountability in the public sector.

25.     The main outputs/outcomes for this sub-component were: (a) completion of the
training of 3 officers in CISA; (b) development and adoption of the Forensic Audit &
Financial Audit Manuals; (c) 100% compliance in audit of government ministries and
donor funded projects, 85% in SAGAs and 70% in Local authorities.

26.     The Kenya National Audit Office (KENAO) as an independent external audit
organization moved towards the strengthening and increasing the scope of audit.
Implementation, however, was confronted by problems associated with poor financial
records and systems and poor compliance with audit regulations and poor response to
audit queries.

27.     Notable results include the adoption of approved auditing standards and resolution
of systemic issues (e.g. payroll, procurement). The KENAO has achieved this by using
its resources better and through better planning and training of its personnel. Training of
staff has resulted in improved skills in areas such as report writing, performance audit,
fraud and investigations, risk based audits and change management. In recent years, the
KENAO was not able to cover the whole central Government annually; the PEFA
evaluation of 2006 noted that the coverage was between 50 and 75%. KENAO had now
substantially increased its audit coverage to 100% of central Government annually. The
work of KENAO was facilitated by the acquisition of new motor vehicles that were used
to audit agencies in remote areas such as Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. The timeliness of
submission of audit reports had improved considerably and KENAO had cleared its
backlog in central government and is now producing the annual report every year. For
the last three fiscal years KENAO has submitted its annual reports 6-7 months after the
receipt of financial statements. Newly installed computers also helped to improve faster
processing of audit reports. The ratio of computers to officers had improved from 1:10 in
2006 to 1:4 in 2009. As a result, the processing of data analysis is faster. However,
delays in legislative scrutiny continued to be a problem.

28.     When it comes to Local Authorities, KENAO still need capacity to carry out a full
annual audit and considerable backlogs dating years back continued to be a challenge.
Furthermore, weak capacity existed in the ability of Local Authorities to prepare good
quality accounts and the non-existence of accounting and financial statements. However,
the backlog for local government had been significantly reduced (with support of GoK
funding).

29.    The KENAO and Parliament are taking measures to improve public availability of
information on audit procedures and audit reports. The KENAO had created a website



                                           42
(www.kenao.go.ke) for posting the audit reports pertaining to the central government,
state corporations, local authorities and specialized audits. The website is under
continued development since the content is limited to general information about KENAO.
The full audit report runs to over 2,000 pages. The Parliament had passed a resolution to
open the proceedings of the PAC to the public, in line with a regional parliamentary
initiative.

30.    The national audit act needs to be amended to accommodate CAG (the Controller
and Auditor General) to report directly to Parliament, to report on emerging issues
between audits and obtain priority for presentation of his/her report. Plans for up-grading
of the KENAO staff‘s capacity need to be synchronized with capacity building for
Members of Parliament and Committee staff. Audit capacity is currently not fully
adequate for the KENAO to address its functions effectively. KENAO‘s ability to
exercise its functions is hampered by capacity weaknesses, particularly in the areas of
computerized and performance audit.

31.     Sub-program 1.5 Strengthening the Internal Audit System (Rating: Moderately
Unsatisfactory). The objective of the sub-component was to support the design and
rollout of a risk-based audit approach to ministries and departments.

32.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) completion of
training in CPA and CISA certification of 20 internal auditors; (b) completion of fraud
examination audit training of 10 auditors; (c) completion of training for 200 members of
Audit Committees; (d) completion of 12 provincial workshops for district internal
auditors on emerging issues in audit, identification and reporting of audit issues and
evaluation of audit reports and output; and (e) completion of training of 73 auditors on
senior management and strategic leadership.

33.    The Office of the Internal Auditor General (IAGD) was established under the
Government Financial Management Act 2004. A new platform for internal audit was
presented in 2005/2006 to give the internal audit good conditions for its work. This new
platform, which was complying with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standard, had
successively been implemented and helped operationalized audit entities.

34.    The central IAGD had developed well and showed commendable professional
ambition. Pre-audit was mostly phased out and focus for more than 50% of staff time was
given to systemic issues. Audit management system software were acquired and put in
use. An internal audit manual was developed and training in line with the manual
continues. There are a good number of reports issued that showed professionalism and
the adherence to international auditing standards for internal auditing (using modern audit
techniques such as risk-based audit).

35.     The coverage of the internal audit has improved significantly in 2008. Treasury
has brought under the IAGD the school internal audit unit in the Ministry of Education,

auditors and the Ministry of Finance internal audit units. All these units were previously
independent of the IAGD.

36.     However, the coverage still demonstrated some deviations from international
standards: the internal audit at the Kenya Revenue Authority is not covered by the IAGD,
which in practice meant that almost the whole revenue side of the government budget,
and there was no consolidated Annual Activity Report by the IAG to describe the
situation for the whole Internal Audit area.

37.   Sub-program 1.6 Strengthening the National Procurement System (Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory). The objective of the sub-component was to support the
Procurement Authority that was established following the enactment of the Public
Procurement and Disposal Act 2005.

38.      The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) successful
facilitation of the implementation of MDAs plans and budgets; (b) completion of various
capacity building workshops on procurement; (b) completion of procurement training
staff of MDA and potential bidders; (b) development and adoption of Public-Private-
Partnership (PPP) guidelines which were also subsequently gazetted; (c) completion of
the review of the Procurement Act and regulations to harmonize with the new
Constitution; (d) completion of training of 5 Line Ministry officers on strategic supply
chain management; (e) completion of training of 83 Senior Procurement Officers on
senior management; and (f) completion of training of 41 Senior Procurement Officers on
strategic leadership development.

39.    A milestone in procurement reforms in Kenya was attained with the enactment of
the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005. Regulations were put in place and
became operational. An assessment of efficiency of the act indicated that the level of
implementation was satisfactory in ministries and state corporations. The law and
procedures had been widely publicized and awareness at all levels of government had
been increased. Procurement auditing was started in several districts and training was
conducted successfully as stated above.

40.     The funds for this component were mostly provided by USAID who supported
this component directly through provision of funds to the (then) Public Procurement
Directorate (subsequently the Public Procurement Oversight Authority) to develop
implementing regulations for the Procurement Act 2005. GTZ also provided long-term
technical support to the PPOA (administrative review, strategy, compliance, public
procurement in general etc.). Among other things, USAID‘s funds were used for the
long-term technical assistance to PPOA through consultants on contract based in Nairobi.
Since PPOA‘s work began in October 2007, they had successfully engaged in training
more than 2000 persons at hundreds of GOK procuring entities and had conducted
various procurement reviews of GOK procuring entities. Since USAID did not pool its
resources, the PPOA had voiced its concerns about their inability to access pooled funds
due to the perception of the pooling DPs that PPOA‘s capacity was low to utilize the
extra resources.

41.    Support to key Parliamentary Committees for effective oversight of public
financial management (Rating: Moderately satisfactory). The objective of the sub-
component was to enable the Parliament to play its oversight role in the area of
economic management more effectively and to professionalize its interaction with the
government.

42.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) completion of
training on report writing and committee management for 100 officers who serve under
various parliamentary committees; (b) development and adoption of budgetary process
guidelines and procedures to enable more effective scrutiny and enhanced legislative
oversight of the budget; (c) successful implementation of ―Budget Scrutiny‖ workshop
for the parliamentary committee members; and (d) completion of various training of
budget and implementation committee members of the Parliament in the budget making
process.

43.     Parliament conducted proactive budget formulation and public expenditure
reviews in addition to ―post mortem‖ PAC and PIC deliberations. The aim was to
become more than a ―rubber stamp‖ – to take an early role looking at macro economic
forecasts, discuss taxation and link broad allocations with policy before the budget is
tabled. The Parliament had become more involved in the budget process through the
Budget Committee. The Budget Committee members received advance information and
became involved in sector working groups that prepare the budget which had given them
more detailed information before the formal budget scrutiny. In June 2009, the Fiscal
Management Act was adopted by Parliament, which allowed more scrutiny of the budget
and public hearings. It contributed to increased accountability and transparency of the
budget process. However, the increased role of Parliament raised some constitutional
issues as to where responsibility for designing the budget lies – with the executive or with
the legislature. The Parliament also suffered from poor research capacity and needed
further briefing on their role and methodologies related to budgeting and audit.

44.    Sub-program 1.8 Strengthening Revenue Collection and Management for the
Kenya Revenue Authority (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory). The objective of the sub-
component was to help the Government collect all the taxes due and in the process free
Kenya from donor dependency and make the country a truly sovereign nation.

45.     The main outputs/outcomes of this sub-component were: (a) procurement of
mobile caravan bus to establish an equipped Mobile Taxpayer Unit so that taxpayer
education program is facilitated and customer service delivery is improved; (b)
procurement of equipment that upgraded the IT infrastructure on business process in
KRA; (c) successful implementation of two new business applications; (d) completion of
training on Corporate Risk Management strategy for 140 officers; (e) completion of
training on records management of 30 officers; (f) procurement of CCTV at KRA head
office that improved security and surveillance capacity; (g) acquisition and full
installation of automated investigative tools; and (h) completion of Project Management
Prince 2 training and subsequent certification of 25 officers on project management
skills.



                                          45
46.     The Kenya Revenue Authority had greatly improved services to its clients and
moved towards implementation of reforms that had successfully improved collection,
automated systems and revised tax legislation. The Investigation and Enforcement
Department responsible for fraud investigation now implements its audit work plan with
clear risk assessment criteria. It had fully implemented a call centre application to handle
taxpayer queries. It acquired computers, equipment and accessories to support the roll-out
of new applications and electronic services that helped reduce the time for providing
services offered to the taxpayers. It also adopted an Integrated Risk Management
Framework for Corporate Risk based on the Internal Auditor General Guidelines.
Notable results include:

   a) Better access by taxpayer to information on tax liabilities and administrative
      procedures
   b) Transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities
   c) More effectiveness of penalties for non-compliance with registration and
      declaration obligations.
   d) Improved planning and monitoring of tax audit and fraud investigation programs.

47.     Success of KRA were also gauged against the following benchmarks: (a) PEFA
indicator PI-3 (aggregate revenue out-turn compared to original approved budget) rated C
in 2006 improved to A in 2008; (b) 2008 PEFA assessment showed improved
performance in PI-13 (transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities) from B in
2006 to B+ in 2008; and in PI-14 (effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and
tax assessment from C+ in 2006 to B in 2008; (c) revenue collection growth from KSh.
360.1M in 2006/7 to KSh. 480.6M in 2008/9 which can partly be attributed to the PFMR
put in place; and (d) the cost of collecting revenue was reduced to 1.7% against the target
of 2% of the printed estimates.

Component 2. Capacity Building for “Results for Kenyans?

48.    Sub-program 2.1: Capacity Building Fund (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory).
The primary objective of this component was to support the overall shift toward effective
management of key parts of the economy to fulfill Government commitments under the
ERS, and the related performance contracts for relevant ministries.

49.     The sub-component intended to provide capacity building support to the five key
ministries (Finance, Agriculture, Planning and Development, Trade and Industry and
Local Government). While the operation initially focused on these key ministries, it later
became clear that several other ministries and departments were important to the
achievement of ERS goals and had plans for moving ahead quickly to significantly
enhance their focus on operational efficiency and results. At the mid-term review of the
project, eligibility criteria for this component were reviewed to include arrangements for
a larger group of key ministries to receive assistance.

50.    The PSRD Secretariat, which was later renamed the Public Service
Transformation Department (PSTD), was responsible for managing this component, and



                                          46
more specifically, institutionalizing the RBM within various ministries, departments and
government agencies (MDAs). PSTD used the Rapid Results Initiative as a tool for
institutionalizing RBM. Through RRI, over 100 MDAs have achieved significant impact
in providing services to the public. There has been a general shift in focus in the public
service delivery approach moving from emphasis on processes to focus on results, better
utilization of funds and enhanced institutional collaboration.

51.     A user satisfaction survey conducted in 2009 showed high satisfaction levels of
the various customers of and employees of Government of Kenya. The overall customer
satisfaction index was 63.5 per cent. This compares favorably with those of New Zealand
(68 percent in 2007) and Canada (67 per cent in 2005). The results also revealed that all
the customer satisfaction indices with the exception of index for ―Justice, Security and
Provincial Administration‖ (index=55.7 percent) were above 60 percent.

52.    A joint Government/DPs evaluation conducted in March 2011 also concluded that
this component of program contributed to a general improvement in the way that the
Government manages for results and in laying the foundation for institutionalization of
RBM. The fact that today all MDAs have strategic plans and annual work plans that
align with the MTEF and the medium term plan (MTP) for Vision 2030 is a testament to
this.

53.     The evaluation report also noted that there have also been positive changes in the
attitude and performance of civil servants over project implementation period and they
appear to be more motivated. These changes have translated to discernable incremental
improvements in public service delivery in some areas such as department of migration,
prisons, police stations, offices of chiefs and sub-chiefs, hospitals, the Nairobi City
Council.

improvement plans and group training interventions would be organized in specific skill
areas. A platform for dialogue and linkages between leaders in the public service on
leadership, change management, values and ethics was also to be established.

57.     As mentioned below, thousands of civil servants were trained on TL, values and
ethics (through integrated RBM training). The project supervision reviews noted that it
resulted in a positive change of mindset for the civil servants who underwent the training.
There was also intention was to have all cabinet ministers trained in TL, but there were
challenges in terms of finding appropriate trainers. However, through Kenya Institute of
Administration training, cabinet was exposed to principles and models of leadership.
Leadership Orientation was also part of the RRIs orientation and training, and TL training
is now mandatory for certain cadres of officers.

Institutionalization of the RBM Approach in the Public Sector

58.     Ministerial Management Units. As already mentioned, the strategic objective of
this sub-program was initially aimed at delivering the overall institutional structure for
the Results for Kenya (RfK) program, including organizational structure to coordinate
RBM implementation and report on ministerial targets. Ministerial Management Units
(MMUs) were to be established to coordinate the implementation of RBM and other
public service reform initiatives. MMUs were also to provide support to Ministerial
Management Steering Committees (MMSCs). A Results Office was to be created within
the PSRDS Secretariat to oversee the development of performance management and an
integrated performance appraisal system, performance audit, RBM monitoring and
evaluation system and other accountability processes including performance targets and
performance contracting, the introduction of service charters, the Ministerial Balance
Scorecard and implementation of the Management Accountability Framework and a
Leadership Code.

59.    In a few Ministries (such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of
Immigration), MMUs exist and appear to be operating effectively. In the Ministry of
Agriculture, for example, the MMU (which includes representation from Administration,
Finance, HR, Technical Services and the Chief Economist) is responsible for overseeing


                                          53
and coordinating cross cutting reforms including RRIs, Performance Contracting, and
PFM. However, in several MDAs, MMUs were either not established or did not become
fully functional, although at least some of the envisaged roles of the MMU are being
carried out by different departments, most frequently by the Central Planning Units.
Several reasons were cited for failure to create MMUs in some MDAs. Existence of a
large number of other committees and units at Ministerial level whose work cuts across
what was envisaged for MMUs. The existence of many structures, such as the MMUs,
Central Planning Units (CPUs), Statistics Units, Reform Committees in line ministries
resulted in duplication of efforts and lack of cohesiveness. It was also expected that
MMUs would be staffed with senior officers, and yet for many officers it was not clear
how joining an MMU would contribute towards their career path and future promotion
opportunities, and this may have made it harder to attract senior staff. A particular
challenge with institutionalizing MMUs was the frequent personnel transfers that took
place within MDAs, and in particular with personnel that staffed the MMUs. However,
despite the ongoing challenges with establishing functioning MMUs across MDAs, they
continued to be highlighted throughout the life of the program as critical for
implementing and institutionalizing RBM.

60.      Performance Contracting. Performance Contracting (PC) was a strategic tool
that was rolled out by the Government (beginning in 2003) and strengthened during the
IRCB implementation period. PC stands out as making a major contribution towards the
institutionalization of RBM to date. At project closure, over 470 institutions were on
Performance Contracts. It is an approach that appears to be widely accepted and
internalized throughout government, and is taken very seriously especially by senior
management in the civil service. This could partly be due to the fact that there is a
greater level of ownership for it within government.

61.     Despite its successes, there remain a number of areas in which the application of
PC needs to be improved. The Government's own review of performance contracting
carried out in 2010, revealed that there is disparity between PC and other performance
management tools, and recommended that an integrated performance management
system for government be developed and operationalized.

62.     Performance Appraisal System. The Performance Appraisal system (PAS) has
been rolled out to all MDAs and is a requirement for promotion. Efforts carried out
through the Results for Kenyans (RFK) program to strengthen the PAS were primarily
through the draft HRM strategy and support provided to the Kenya Institute of
Administration. However, there were a few concerns raised by civil servants regarding
PAS- they include: (a) perceived subjectivity, including the requirement that an
individual's patriotism is measured; (b) unclear relationship between PAS and
rewards/sanctions, making it difficult to provide staff with incentives; (c) weak linkages
between PAS and PC; (d) limited efforts made to collect or analyze PAS data to highlight
issues or improve overall performance within institutions; and (e) lack of enforcement.

63.    Rapid Results Initiative (RRIs). Rapid Results methodologies were to be
adopted in the implementation of projects within MDAs, and institutionalized as a tool
and process of reform to energize improvements in service delivery. At a basic level,


                                         54
RRIs were used to demonstrate how to achieve results by focusing energy and resources
against tangible and time bound targets. The RfK program provided support to RRIs
through the RRI coaches, as well as funds for RRI launches advertising and celebrations.
By the project closure, some 65 MDAs had launched and completed RRIs. The support
from RRI coaches was considered extremely important, in particular during the first or
second wave of RRIs. RRI coaches not only trained staff on RBM, they also provided
relevant information on best practice and benchmarking and they participated in the mid-
term and end-term evaluations. Although they did not try to influence decisions on
priorities, they played a useful challenge role to the teams and were able to push MDAs
to deliver results.

64.     The public launching and celebration of RRIs allowed institutions to showcase
results that had been achieved. Even the media adverts paid for by the RfK program were
considered useful in bringing public attention to the institutions more generally, and in
several cases the number of visits to an institution's website and phone calls received
from citizens increased significantly in the period following a newspaper advertisement
linked to an RRI. Therefore, the publicity around RRIs was a key part of raising
awareness not only of RBM, but also of what the public can expect in terms of broader
service delivery specific to the institution. The public launches and celebrations also were
opportunities to strengthen teamwork and break down barriers across the office.
Examples of RRIs with significant results include:

   a) The Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and Internal Security used
      RRI to introduce customer care desks in all provinces and districts and service
      registers in all District and Chiefs offices - Service Charters can now be found in
      most government institutions;
   b) Ministry of Immigration reduced passport issuance days from 60 to 10, and ID
      issuance days from 90 to 18 (in Nairobi) and reduced the waiting period for birth
      and death certificates from 14 to 5 working days;
   c) Ministry of Water strengthened irrigation schemes and improved their registry
      (file renewal and introduction of a file tracing system);
   d) Kenya National Trading Corporation developed systems to provide regular
      reports to all
   e) Ministry of Agriculture increased maize productivity in parts of Western Province
      from 2 to 6 bags per half acre through an RRI (and gains have been sustained by
      the farmers coming together themselves and forming grain banks); and
   f) City Council of Nairobi carried out beautification of the city and reduced the time
      required to obtain business licenses from 30 days to 1.

65.    As noted elsewhere in this report the evaluation report of the RfK program
conducted jointly by government its development partners was quite positive of the
RBM. A user satisfaction survey conducted in 2009 showed high satisfaction levels of the
various customers and employees of Government of Kenya. The overall satisfaction rate
was 63.5% and this is favourably comparable with those of New Zealand (68% in 2007)
and Canada (67% in 2005).

66.    Component 3. Technical Support and Capacity for Project Implementation
(Rating: Moderately Satisfactory). The objective of this component was to coordinate
the implementation of the IRCBP especially in terms of its compliance with the financial
management arrangements of the pooled resources as stipulated in the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Government of Kenya and Development Partners and the
signatories to the Joint Financing Agreement, which defines the pooled-funding
guidelines.

67.    The PFMRS reported to the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Finance, who is
the Accounting Officer of the project. Implementation of the overall program, therefore,
was mainstreamed within Government. Although coordination of Sub-component 2.2
(Transformative Leadership and Ethics for RBM) was managed by the Secretary, Public
Sector Reform and Development Secretariat, in the Cabinet Office, the PFMRS had the
key role of consolidating reports (i.e. IFRs, progress reports, etc.) and coordinating the
contributions from other development partners for the entire project through both pooled
and non-pooled funding arrangements. The PFMRS also served as the main contact point
by the Bank for the project.

Public Financial Management Reform Programme 2006-2011
Project Completion Report

Introduction

1.      In 2003, the Government embarked on the Economic Recovery Strategy for
Wealth and Employment Creation popularly known as the (ERS) covering the period
2003-2007. The overall objective of the ERS was poverty reduction through employment
and wealth creation. The ERS emphasized the need to reform the public finance system
in order to achieve; fiscal sustainability and balance in the economy, restructuring and
reallocations for growth and poverty alleviation and improved public sector performance,
efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector leading to improved service delivery and
results for Kenyans.

2.      To implement the public financial reforms, the Government formulated the
Strategy for the Revitalization of Public Financial Management System in Kenya 2006-
2011. The Strategy was organized around six pillars executed by fifteen components
during the 5 year period. The areas identified for reforms included: transformation of
political priorities into the annual budget allocations; credibility of the budget; quality,
timeliness and accuracy of financial reports; procurement; institutional reform; capacity
of PFM staff among others.

3.       To implement the public sector financial management reform programme, the
Government obtained financial assistance from the World Bank, European Commission,
Department for International Development (DFID), Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),
Norway, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ), and USAid. A credit to finance the implementation was entered into between the
Government and World Bank under the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building
Technical Assistance Project (IRCBP). The other Development Partners entered into a
joint financing agreement with the Government and the World Bank agreed to administer
the funds on their behalf through a Memorandum of Understanding.

Background to IRCBP

4.     The Government had made some progress on public sector reforms under the
Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Project (PSMTAP) which included
reducing backlogs in audit of government accounts, introduction of result based
management and performance contracting. Reforms were also undertaken in the budget
formulation process by changing the budget timetable and consolidating the budget
documentation into a budget outlook paper and budget strategy paper outlining the
ministerial ceilings and government priorities. Other reforms included streamlining of
Government structures, reduction in employment numbers and wage bill control,



                                          62
installation of integrated Human Resources and Payroll Management System, improved
pay structures and enhanced salary levels, and the decentralization of service delivery.

5.      The PFM Strategy was expected to build on these results and address areas of
reforms that had not registered substantial progress and these included; roll-out of IFMIS,
installation of a Pensions Management System, improvement of revenue collection and
accounting, improvement of public debt administration, reforms in procurement among
others. The achievement of these objectives was to be realized through efforts of 15
components of the PFM system that were grouped in 6 reform pillars.

6.     The Programme was launched in March 2006 and was expected to end in
November 2010 however due to delays in mobilization of staff to implement; setting up
of the programme management unit and operationalization of the basket fund the
implementation period was extended to August 2011. The Programme consisted of three
components: (i) Budget and Public Financial Management; (ii) Capacity Building for
Results and (iii) Technical Support and Capacity for Project Implementation with eight,
two and one sub-components respectively.

Programme Objectives

7.      The project development objective was to strengthen Public Financial
Management (PFM) systems to enhance transparency, accountability, and responsiveness
to public expenditure policy priorities as well as enhance public service delivery through
the effective implementation of results based management (RBM). The key performance
indicators emphasized on sound fiduciary arrangements in the context of an evolving
framework for RBM and included:

   a) National budget is aligned with explicitly stated government priorities in the IP-
      ERS (which was replaced by Vision 2030-Medium Term Plan (MTP) in 2007)
   b) Budget allocation and actual expenditure disparities reduced
   c) Improved predictability of Treasury‘s annual/midterm allocation flows to line
      ministries
   d) Risk based external audit reports prepared and published in a timely fashion in
      accordance with the Public Audit Act 2003
   e) Adoption of a risk based internal audit approach and establish effective
      Ministerial Audit Committees
   f) Skilled Public Accounts, Public Investment and Finance Committees of
      Parliament that uni cannodertake their statutory functions, meet in a timely
      manner to discuss and act on reports
   g) Procurement entities adhere to national procurement law
   h) Accountability and capacity of public servants are enhanced for the delivery of
      public services through the introduction of RBM, which are linked to the delivery
      of specific outputs/results




                                          63
    i) Ministries accessing funds under the credit develop strategic plans and show good
        performance in implementing them and
    j) External resources department is strengthened and develops and adopts an aid
        policy that brings order to donor support for capacity building.

8.      Later the programme was reviewed to include other sub-components that were
not targeted during the initial project formulation (e.g. Teachers Service Commission and
Directorate of Public Procurement). In addition the monitoring and evaluation framework
developed and the indicators were revised to 15.
The arrangement for results monitoring covered all the sub-components and monitoring
efforts were to focus on some eight outcome indicators and fourteen intermediate results
indicators covering all the components. Components were also to achieve some 65
output indicators most of which were sector specific and service delivery related and that
were to contribute towards the outcome indicators.
Programme Components

9.     Following the review and inclusion of new sub-components, Component one
(Public Financial Management) was implemented under eighteen sub-components:

   a)      Macro-Fiscal Policy and Planning

Programme Management

11.    The PFMR Programme was managed and coordinated by the Ministry of Finance
- Public Finance Management Reform Secretariat; however the reforms were
implemented by several MDAs (Ministries, Departments and Agencies) within and
outside the Ministry. To ensure proper coordination of the implementers and to ensure
the effective monitoring of programme performance, a number of institutional and
governance structures were established. These institutional mechanisms included:

12.    The Programme Steering Committee (PSC) which was chaired by the
Permanent Secretary/ Treasury whose membership comprised of Permanent Secretaries
from implementing ministries and the Programme Coordinator serving as the secretary to
the PSC. The PSC held its meetings quarterly and the responsibilities included:

   a)   Approval of annual workplans and budget proposals from components
   b)   Guide the PFM Reform coordinator and Secretariat and component managers on
        policy issues;
   c)   Monitor reform progress and take action on the quarterly and annual progress
        reports;
   d)   Approve major reallocations within components in line with funding regulations
        and conditions;
   e)   Decide on additional financial requests during the year; and
   f)   Decide on major institutional, legal, investment or conceptual questions related to
        the reform
13.    The Joint Working Group (JWG) was chaired by the Reforms Coordinator and
co-chaired by a development partner representative. Its membership included the
component managers and PFM-Donor Group members. Its responsibilities included:

   a) Recommend for approval the Programme Annual Implementation Plan (work
      plan, procurement plan, training plan) for every financial year starting in July
   b) Review the programme‘s progress reports, including the Financial Management
      Reports (FMR), audit reports and any other reports deemed relevant to the
      Programme
   c) Identify measures required to remove any implementation constraints and ensure
      the achievement of the Programme‘s objectives
   d) Monitor and follow–up on implementation measures agreed during previous
      meetings and during semi-annual programme reviews (captured in aide
      memoires)
   e) Provide oversight of the PFMR activities

14.      The PFMR Coordinating Unit was headed by the Reforms Coordinator and
consisted of technical officers who handled the daily programme implementation
activities and offered assistance to components in implementation. The secretariat was
responsible for coordinating the programme implementation, financial management of
the programme, monitoring and reporting the progress of the programme in accordance


                                          65
with set indicators, procurement of some goods and services and for information
dissemination, education and communication.

Programme Cost and finance
15.     The PFMR Programme was budgeted to cost US$ 88.0 million, however by the
closure of the Programme, the amount that had been disbursed totaled US$ 30.39 million
and the expenditure totaled US$ 24.52. Receipts and expenditure data for the Programme
is as shown below:

Supplementary sources of programme funding and appropriation of funds is as
documented below:

Programme Results
16.    The Programme results were to be measured in terms of 15 high level
performance indicators, which are closely related to the programme‘s objectives as
described in Section 3 above. In terms of implementation, most Programme outputs were
implemented though sometimes with much delays. Key achievements included:

    a) Predictability of revenue receipts improved over time and this has in turn
         improved predictability of allocations to line ministries
    b)   Though there are still some disparities between the budget allocations and actual
         expenditure, this has been reduced significantly to 3% in 2010-2011 financial
         year.
    c)   The budget process has been made more transparent and participatory through the
         introduction of public sector hearings and parliamentary committee meetings
         which are open to the public. The budget documents and the quarterly budget and
         economic review are made available to the public through the Treasury website
         (www.treasury.go.ke). There is also move to adopt programme based budget for
         the entire government.
    d)   The Kenya National Audit Office (KENAO) has been strengthened and its
         capacity built to increase its efficiency. This has enabled the office to eliminate
         backlog in audit reports and can now respond and undertake special audits as
         requested by parliament or development partners. Audits are carried out in
         compliance with the Public Audit Act 2003; annual audits are carried out in 100%
         of all Central Government Agencies and Donor Funded projects; audit of Local
         Authorities and SAGAs is at 70% and 80% respectively; audit reports upto
         2009/10 are made available through the external audit website (www.kenao.go.ke
         ) and audit recommendations are being enforced through Parliamentary oversight
         committees and more effective functioning ministerial audit committees.
    e)   The internal audit function has been revamped and the operations changed from
         pre-audit and compliance audit to the risk based audit approach. Ministerial audit
         committees have also been set up in all government ministries and their capacity
         build to enable them undertake their functions effectively. The internal audit
         function has also slowly shifted to value for money, performance and forensic
         audits.


                                                  67
f) Parliamentary committees have been capacity build and facilitated to undertake
   their oversight function properly. An implementation committee was established
   by parliament to follow up on recommendations made by the various oversight
   committees. The Parliamentary Budget Committee is fully entrenched in the
   budget making process and scrutinizes the budget proposal before they are passed
   by parliament.
g) The Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA) was set up and has been
   involved in creating capacity for MDAs on procurement, carrying out market
   surveys and educating procurement entities on the procurement law and
   regulations.
i) Majority of the line Ministries have developed strategic plans through assistance
   of the Programme and are using them to institutionalize results based
   management and performance contracting.
j) The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) managed to increase revenue collection
   from 274.3 billion in 2005/2006 to 634.9 billion in 2010/2011 representing a
   revenue growth of 131%. This has been achieved through automation of the
   business processes and improving voluntary tax compliance from 88% in 2005 to
   98.3% in 2011. The revenue growth has been at above 13% for each of the years
   of the programme implementation; tax debt to revenue ratio has reduced from
   34.6% in 2005 to 14.7% in 2010; the cost of collection has been maintained at a
   level of less than 2% of the printed estimates and the timeliness of production of
   statistics has reduced from 48 days in 2005 to 38 days in 2011.
k) The Pensions department managed to automate its processes through installation
   of a Pensions Management Information System (PMIS). Pension claims are now
   processed electronically and it is possible to track the process. The ease of access
   of manual documents was improved through use of modern filing racks while the
   Department has commenced the conversion of manual records into electronic
   records. This enabled the component to simplify the number of procedures from
   27 to 7 and reduce the duration of paying pension claims from 90 to 28 days
   within the programme period.
l) The Debt department migrated to the new version of Commonwealth Secretariat
   Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS 2000+). The component
   managed for the first time to prepare and publish a Medium Term Debt Strategy
   (MTDS) covering the periods 2009/10 – 2011/12 and reviews are done annually.
m) Teachers‘ Service Commission (TSC) automated their service delivery processes
   and implemented 13 IFMIS modules. This assisted in streamlining the payroll for
   the over 256,000 staff by eliminating ghost workers and ensuring timely payments
   of salaries. Interconnection of the TSC headquarters with the districts was
   initiated after the procurement of the necessary infrastructure.
n) Programme Management and Coordinating Unit. The Coordinating unit managed
   the programme fairly: disbursing funds to components, developing the Monitoring
   and Evaluation framework, producing periodic financial and physical progress
   reports, participating in review missions, publishing and disseminating
   information on the programme to the public.




                                      68
   o) Capacity building for staff both locally and abroad was accomplished for all
      components. The capacity of the components in terms of equipment, technology
      and facilities was also built to enable the delivery of project results.
   p) The capacity of staff within the Accountant Generals Department (AGD) was
      built and over 227 accountants acquired professional qualifications.
   q) The general ledger, accounts payable, and purchase order modules of the
      Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) were rolled out in all central
      government ministries and reporting done through the system.
   r) The absorption of donor funding increased as a result of training of various staff
      in the External Resources Department (ERD).

A few of the key outputs were not fully implemented as planned:

   s) The Economic Affairs Department projected to procure a new macro-model to
       assist in forecasting. Even though the Macro-Fiscal Forecasting section was
       established; officers deployed and trained, software of running the model
       acquired; the procurement of a firm well versed in micro-modeling was
       unsuccessful and as such this critical activity was not completed.
   t) The adoption of programme based budget has not yet been fully adopted even
       though some preparatory activities and trainings were carried out.
   u) The Kenya External Resources Policy (KERP) was supposed to be published but
       has remained in draft and will be revised to take into consideration requirements
       of the Constitution.
   v) Electronic Service Delivery: The Integrated Financial Management and
       Information System roll out of all the modules was delayed thus curtailing the full
       use of the system for reporting and thus affecting the quality of financial reports
       available. However with the re-engineering of the system in 2011, it is expected
       this will be achieved.
   w) The intended interfacing/linking of the IPPD, Pensions system (PMIS) and TSC
       IFMIS was not accomplished. The verification and cleansing of the various
       payrolls also could not be achieved.
   x) Establishment of a common cadre for PFM staff, identification of local
       institutions that could offer PFM training was not achieved during the project
       implementation.
   y) Roll out of all the IFMIS modules implemented by the TSC to the districts was
   delayed.

Major Implementation Issues Encountered
17.   The programme managed to achieve some of the major outputs as outlined above,
however there were some major challenges that affected the implementation.

   a) The delay in setting up the coordination structures and getting the right capacity
      within the coordinating unit delayed the implementation. Capacity to deliver on
      the reforms in other components was also not sufficient.



                                         69
   b) Protracted procurement processes within the components and delays in getting
      ―no objection‖ from the Bank affected project implementation.
   c) There were institutional weaknesses and gaps in the coordination of cross-cutting
      reforms and sector development programmes. Components could not link their
      reform efforts to their sector development plans or service delivery
      improvements. It was therefore not possible to harmonize and prioritize
      interventions across reform programs.
   d) Inadequate capacity to manage donor funded projects with special reference to the
      procurement guidelines and capacity to develop specifications for specialized
      areas such as IT products.
   e) Slow Disbursement of funds when the project commenced and during the
      midterm period when the project stalled. This resulted to the lapse of procurement
      activities that were on-going and implementation performance was adversely
      affected.
   f) Communication and guidance - providing clear instructions to components on
      procedure expectations since at times documents approval delayed due to
      communication breakdown. Given the considerable number of stakeholders
      involved in funding and implementing the programme dialogue and provision of
      timely feedback would have greatly improved implementation.
   g) Initially, there was a challenge in financial reporting which resulted in late
      disbursement of funds. Harmonization of both the World Bank and Government
      procurement procedures also remain an implementation bottleneck.

Sustainability Issues
   a) The reforms are consistent with national goals and are anchored in the Medium
       Term Plan for 2008-2012. The Government is committed to continuing PFM
       reforms in the public service, and continue to offer significant and high-level
       political support.
   b) The Government has also adopted critical measures to sustain public sector
       reforms through implementation of strategic plans, programme based budgeting,
       monitoring and evaluation and reporting frameworks which aim to ensure
       performance management systems are sustained in the long run and that the
       public service focuses on results.
   c) The beneficiary organizations have also provided necessary resources for
       maintenance and operational costs to ensure the assets procured continue to be
       operational. The capacity of component staff has been build to support installed
       systems and service delivery.

Key Lessons Learnt

18.    During the implementation of the PFMR Programme some of the following
lessons were learned:

   a) The components need to take a stronger lead in designing and implementing
      reforms so as to create ownership. There is a need for a dedicated desk within the




                                        70
        implementing agencies to champion and report on the execution of reform issues
        within the project.
   a)   Reforms activities need to be integrated into the strategic plans, annual
        workplans, performance contracts and budgets of MDAs. The implementers
        therefore need to ensure that their reform interventions are linked to sector
        programmes, and any internal service delivery improvements being implemented.
   b)   Approval of work-plans, allocation of resources to finance the activities and
        actual disbursements should be timely to avoid delays which lead to uncertainties
        and apathy.
   c)   The reform programmes need to be integrated into Government processes and
        systems and development partner‘s procedures harmonized in order to improve
        implementation.
   d)   A monitoring and evaluation framework should have been developed at the
        beginning of the programme in order to measure programme results.
   e)   There is need for an elaborate communication strategy for a programme like this
        especially between the coordinating unit and all other stakeholders. The
        communication of the achievements needs also to be improved.
   f)   High level management support in implementing components is critical to achieve
        the set deliverables.
   g)   Sequencing of reform initiatives is important especially on aspects of priority
        setting, timing, scope and change management needs to be institutionalized to
        sustain the reforms.
   h)   There is need to build capacity of the project teams on project design,
        procurement, disbursement, monitoring, reporting and financial management
        procedures.
   i)   The use of country systems especially in procurement, accounting and reporting
        would ease project implementation.

Development Partners Performance

Design
19.    The World Bank was significantly involved in all aspects of programme design
and assisted the Government in identifying its reform priorities. The Bank maintained
dialogue during the project formulation and design.

Implementation
20.     The development provided adequate technical support and resources during
implementation. Although there were some delays in setting up the basket funding
arrangements the development partners showed flexibility in extending the Programme‘s
time frame by nine months to cover for this initial delay. Once the basket fund became
operational, pooled financial resources were disbursed in a timely fashion. Non-
submission of financial reports lend to freezing of funding which greatly affected
implementation which further delayed programme activities. The no objection process
caused delays in clearance for procurement activities in the duration of the project.



                                         71
Reviews and Supervision
21.    Participatory reviews and supervisions were held throughout the course of the
programme implementation and Aide Memoirs agreed upon by the World Bank and the
Government in order to ensure ownership. The Government implemented most of the
agreed upon recommendations from the supervisions. The development partners were
involved in the joint working groups meetings where programme implementation issues
were discussed.

Procurement
22.    The ―no objection‖ process at the World Bank delayed majority of the
procurements. These procurement procedures led to significant delays in terms of
implementation. Delays were also the result of inadequate forward planning by
implementers, and bureaucratic procurement procedures within agencies themselves
contributed towards and caused unnecessary delays.

Financial Management
23.     Through the programme a number of capacity building initiatives were
undertaken in order to improve financial management. Workshops were organized
locally and regionally focusing on various areas of the financial management including
disbursement procedures as well as financial reporting. In both mid-term and in annual
reviews issues of financial management were addressed and financial ratings were
provided.

Borrower‟s Performance

Design
24.    The Government took the lead role in programme design and had a strong
ownership of the planning process. Stakeholders were involved in coming up with the
PFMR strategy and also in the securing of funding from the development partners.

Implementation
25.    The reform activities were coordinated through the Ministry of Finance – Public
Financial Management Reforms Secretariat. Although some delays in implementation
were encountered initially, the overall capacity to implement and coordinate reforms
improved significantly during the project period and this led to satisfactory achievement
of the project objectives. Progress reporting was not satisfactory initially but later the
programme managed to clear the reporting backlog and developed an implementation
manual and a monitoring and evaluation framework.

Procurement
26.     The procurement within the programme was handled both at the coordinating unit
and component level. The efficiency in the processes therefore differed from one
component to another, but in general most of them delayed. These delays within
components contributed to delays in the overall programme and thus affected
implementation of programme activities. Components with dedicated procurement desk
for dealing with PFM issues registered substantial progress in contracts management and

execution leading to considerable absorption levels. It is however; regrettable those big
contracts which were of major reforms initiatives in revenue collections were not
finalized due to escalation of costs that resulted in wide discrepancy between the
budgeted and the actual expenditure outlay.

Financial Management
27.     The programme‘s financial management initially was not satisfactory and this
lend to suspension of disbursements for almost a year. The capacity of the coordinating
unit was improved and reorganization within improved performance thus leading to
resumption of funding for the programme.

Conclusion
28.     After some initial delays, the Public Financial Management Reform Programme
was largely implemented as planned. Most of the desired results were achieved or in
other instances significant progress was made in ensuring reform moved in the right
direction. During implementation, relationships between the actors were constructive and
positive. Capacity within Government was strengthened considerably, and reforms are
likely to be sustained into the future.

   Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

a) A general unhappiness that the project closed earlier than expected, but
   recognition that there were difficulties in managing the project and disbursing
   funds.
b) Uneven disbursement of funds within the basket among development partners.
   Development partners wanted to understand the decision making process in
   disbursement. The key point here is that in a basket/pool funding arrangement, it
   is difficult to track particular donor funds, but when the GOK is reporting on use
   of funds it normally report on the proportion of funds used based on how much
   each partner has put in the basket.
c) Recognition that disbursement was slow across both the IDA credit and the
   Basket Fund partly due to generally low absorption capacity of development
   funds by the government and partly to other factors such as FM and procurement
   procedures.
d) Management and coordination of the project by the Bank was seen as weak with
   frequent changes and no one seem to be in-charge, especially from 2009.
e) The basket fund approach was complicated and did not seem to have reduced
   transaction cost both for the Government and Development partners.
f) There is strong interest in finding a way forward to prepare a follow on operation
   to support the Government, especially with the ambitious devolution program.
   Development partners will have to rethink the modalities for joint funding of
   Government Programs. SIDA is providing transitional funding from the balance
   of its contribution until September, 2012 to enable GOK to prepare a work plan.
