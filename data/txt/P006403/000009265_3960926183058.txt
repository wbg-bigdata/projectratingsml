MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SECOND NORTHEAST BASIC HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$267.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for fifteen years,
including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, and would help finance a basic health services project.
2.       Background.  Despite Brazil's overall level of development and
favorable comparison with other middle-income countries as to public health
expenditure as a percent of total public spending (approximately 7.OZ),
health conditions are poor. Life eypectancy at birth is 65 years,
comparable to countries with lower per capita income than Brazil, including
Colombia and Mexico. Infant mortality (63 per 1000 live births) is
significantly higher than for Colombia and Mexico (46 per 1000). In most
parts of the country, diarrheal and respiratory infections are the leading
causes of infant death, foilowed by perinatal causes. Within Brazil, skewed
income distribution is paralleled by equally wide disparities in health
status; residents of the South and Southeast are still likely to live more
than ten years longer than their counterparts in the Northeast. Health
conditions for low-income groups, particularly in the underdeveloped
Northeaet, closely resemble patterns found in low-income West Africa or
South Asia; infant mortality rate for the Northeast in 1986 (79 per thousand
live births) was significantly higher than in low-income countries such as
India (53) and Kenya (63). Public health ;:ograms hav' not been effective
in addressing this situation, in part due to separation until recently of
curative and preventive programs between two uncoordinated agencies: the
Nationa4 Institute for Medical Assistance of the Social Security System
(INAMPS) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). The better-funded INAMPS'
*        success in providing curative care, based on reimbursement of services by
funds deducted primarily from employees' wages, has contrasted sharply with
MOH's basic health programs (preventive plus simple curative care),
traditionally dependent upon limited and variable public revenues.
Effectiveness of basic health programs has thus been diluted by inequitable
allocation of the range of health resources, as INAMPS has been able to
attract superior manpower, financial resources and management capacity.
3.       Since the early 1980s, Brazilian authorities have made a series of
efforts to improve the quality of basic health care, by means of (a)
increasing access to such programs, and (b) improving efficiency of the
public health system. The most recent Government action, decreed in July
1987, calls for (a) the merger of the MOH and INAMPS networks, at the state
level; and (b) decentralization of operational and administrative
res,ponsibilities to the states, and to local units within the states
especially municipalities, in order to make basic health programs more



-2-
efficient and more responsive to local needs. Implementation of the decree
is e,pected to result in increased support over time to disease prevention
and control programs as public health authori,ies, who have a broader
perspective on health issues and problems, will be responsible for
allocating resources between curative and preventive care. Specific health
interventions to be given priority in the Northeast include control of
transmissible diseases (particularly immuno-preventable and endemic ones),
basic sanitation measures, improved access of high-risk groups to ambulatory
and hospital medical care, institutional development, and food and nutrition
activities. However, the new reforms are not yet fully operational, and
efforts within the MOH and the State Health Secretariats (SESs) to proceed
with implementation of the sectoral reforms have been hindered by skill and
resource constraints, particularly aW. the state level. Moreover,
arrangements for the responsibility and financing of services under the
Unified Health System (SUS), created by the New Constitution in late 1988,
are still evolving.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Brazil of
promoting macroeconomic adjustment, economic growth and institutional
efficiency involves support of social sector programs designed to redirect
public spending to programs that serve the poor and to optimize utilization
of scarce resources. This project is targeted mainly towards rural poor,
particularly women and children, in the Northeast. Bank assistance will
reinforce the Government's efforts to extend adequate basic health care
services and facilities to previously underserved areas as well as to
implement sectoral reforms, including the reallocation of public spending in
health from curative to preventive care and the decentralization of health
service delivery to the state level and eventually to the local level.
5.       Project Objectives.  The project has two main objectivess (a)
strengthening of basic health services in selected low-income areas; and (b)
reinforcement of the implementation of the on-going sectoral reforms,
including the decentralization of financial resources and administrative
authority within the states. Attainment of these objectives should
contribute to improved health status of rural residents in the project
states, and serve as an example of sectoral reform for other low-income
states and countries. In addition, the project,'by improving management,
planning and administrative capacity in the MOH and the seven SESs9 will
strengthen their ability to deliver health care efficiently.
6.       Project Description.  The project represents an extension to six
additional states in the Northeast (Alagoas, Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba,
Pernambuco and Sergipe) of services and institutional development support
activities provided under a previous project (Loan 2699-BR, approved in
FY86). with further expansion of activities in new areas of the State of
Bahia. The project consists of two major components: (a) a Health Services
Development compoinent (862 of total project costs) to assist in the delivery
of a package of three basic health services, including (i) comprehensive
care for women and children, including family planning, (ii) a program of
infectious disease control, and (iii) a program of ambulatory and hospital-
based medical care, through expansion and upgrading of basic health
facilities, staff and materials; and (b) an Institutional Development
component (14X of total project costs) to improve (i) administration and
delivery of basic health services, and (ii) decentralization of the public



-3-
health network, through provision of technical assistance, training and
special studies. The MOH will have overall responsibility for project
coordination and implementation. The seven SESs will be responsible for
project execution at the state level through their respective regional
health directorates. Along with the MOH, federal agencies in the health
sector, including INAMPS, will participate in the monitoring of project
implementation. The project, which will be carried out over six years,
provides funds for civil works, equipment, training, supervision, technical
assistance, special studies, information, education and communications
activities, maintenance (buildings, equipment, vehicles) and drugs. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$610.6 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$141.1 million (232).  Retroactive
financing of up to US$18.0 million has been approved to cover eligible
erpenditures made on or after February 1, 1988, the date of appraisal. A
breakdo n of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule L. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7159-BR, dated October 25, 1989, is also attached.
(The Government may reach agreement with the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) to provide financ'g equivalent to approximately US$13.0 million on a
parallel loan basis for project activities in the State of Ceara. Should
the Government enter into a co-financing agreement, the Loan Agreement would
be amended to reflect the Bank's policy in respect of co-financing.)
7.       Agreed Actions.  The actions agreed upon as conditions of loan
effectiveness are: (a) preparation by one State, to the satisfaction of the
Bank, of (i) an update of its plan for decentralization; (Li) evidence of
counterpart funds required to carry out the first year of the project in its
1990 budget; and (iii) a signed agreement supplementary to existing
convOnios between the Government and said State, stipulating State
concurrence with conditions and project activities described in the Loan
Agreement; and (b) evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, of the inclusion in
the 1990 Federal budget of counterpart funds required to carry out first
year's project activities.  As special conditions of loan disbursement, (a)
each of the other states will be required to meet the conditions stated in
(a) above; (b) for any eligible municipality owning and operating its own
health facilities, the municipality will be required to conclude contractual
arrangements (with its respective State or MOH) acceptable to the Bank, with
respect to project expenditures in the respective municipality; and (c) for
MOH expenditures with respect to information, education and communications
activities, the MOH will prepare a two-year plan acceptable to the Bank.
The Government has also agreed that (a) the MOH will obtain technical
assistance to assist the States in managing the procurement and
implementation of civil works and equipment; (b) the MOH will submit a
detailed analysis of sources and uses of funds covering the states' health
finances for the preceding year by December 31 of each year, and (c) the
MOH, jointly with the Bank, will conduct at least one periodic review per
year, in collaboration with INAMPS and the cooperation of each SES, covering
overall project implementation, plans for technical assistance and training,
adherence to the schedules of decentralization and the adequacy of the
delivery of health services, on the basis of indicators, prepared by the MOH
and approved by the Bank, measuring physical inputs (such as drug supplies,
staffing of health facilities). If the Bank and MOH mutually agree that any



-4-
of the States has failed to perform adequately (i) in its participation in
the implementation of the corresponding State component, (Ai) in adhering to
any of the schedules of decentralization of financial resources and
administrative authority for the provision of health services within the
State in question, or (iii) in maintaining adequate delivery of health
services and expenditure levels, the Bank may, after consultation with and
by notice to the Borrower, reallocate or cancel, or any combination thereof,
any amount of the proceeds of the Loan for that state.
8.       Project Benefits.  Benefits of the services component of the
project include reduction in the prevalence of major health problems,
especially diarrhea, pneumonia, pregnancy-related complications,
malnutrition and infectious and communicable diseases, for approximately
12.0 million rural residents, particularly women and children, of the
project areas. In addition, institutional development support of the basic
health care system will further extend benefits to include the remaining
24.0 million residents of the project states, in the form of (a) an increase
in the proportion of overall public health resources going to basic health
care; (b) improvement in the management, administration, delivery and
overall efficiency of basic health services in the rural Northeast, partly
as a result of system decentralization; (c) extenslon and upgrad_nig of basic
health services in rural areas of the Northeast that had previously been
inadequately served; and (d) containment of per capita and overall health
care costs.
9.       Project Risks.  Major project risks are associated with (a) current
managerial and skill limitations in the seven State Health Secretariats,
which may hinder effective implementation; (b) uncertainty as to states'
ability to provide resources, including counterpart funds, at levels
sufficient to sustain the project; and (c) difficulty in placing qualified
staff in rural *reas. These risks are addressed within the project, in that
(a) institutio!Lal development support will increat- overall skill levels
and, by assisting in implementation of decentralizction of financial
resources and management authority, improve efficiency of the system and
general working environment for health staff in rural areas; and (b)
periodic reviews by the MOH, INAMPS, the SESs, and the Bank of state plans,
budgets and finances will monitor the provision of adequate counterpart
funds and the fulfillment of staffing requirements.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
