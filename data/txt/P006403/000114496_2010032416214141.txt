ANNEX TO SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Model
A.
Basic Health Care Module (BHCM):
 
The organization of resources into a Basic Health Care Module (BHCM) is a 
strategy to improve access to and efficiency of basic health services. A BHCM is a set 
of physical, human, technological and financial resources for providing household 
health care (health care activities performed at the beneficiary's home, mainly by a 
class of auxiliary personnel called attendants) and ambulatory services and local 
hospital care (health and medical care activities carried out at local health 
facilities by auxiliaries and health professionals) to defined groups of families or 
population clusters. People, more than geopolitical boundaries, become the key 
variable in structuring a BHCM. A BHCM will care for well-defined population groups 
through household visits by health attendants and by the use of services provided in a 
health post, health center, or an undade mistas (a health unit with outpatient and 
in-patient facilities for 3 to 50 beds), as required. When population clusters are 
under 2,000 inhabitants, they will be cared for by health attendants living in the 
community and linked to the nearest health facility; construction of health facilities 
will be considered only for population clusters above 2,000 inhabitants. The normal 
point of entry to the health care services within a BHCM will, thus, be either the 
household visit by the health attendant or the patient's visit to the health post, the 
health center or the unidade mista. The structure of the BHCM must be flexible enough 
for adjusting resources to variations in health problems, population distribution 
(clustered versus scattered), territorial boundaries, and physical access to health 
care (roads, paths, transport, geography, and existing health facilities). Staffing 
patterns for the health facilities of each BHCM will follow the guidelines established 
in the Annex to Resolution No. 3/81 of CIPLAN on "Norms for adequating and expanding 
the health network in the federative units" and may be modified as required for 
improving the efficiency of the BHCM.
B.
Basic Health Services Program Package (BHS):
Page  22
The BHS aims at reducing infant, child, and maternal mortality as well as the 
prevalence and severity of diseases common in the Northeast. The first program, 
Comprehensive Care for Women and
Children (PAISMC), will concentrate efforts on improving women's reproductive health 
and children's health. This program will improve children's growth and development and 
reduce diarrheal and respiratory diseases through actions such as health education, 
immunization, encouragement of breast feeding, growth monitoring, and oral rehydration 
therapy. The program will also improve women's reproductive health by providing 
information and education on prenatal care, breast feeding, family planning, sexually 
transmitted diseases, breast and cervical cancer. Additionally, activities will 
include prenatal, delivery of post-partum care, screening and treatment for breast and 
cervical cancers and sexually transmitted diseases, and provision of a wide range of 
appropriate contraceptive methods. The second program, Infectious Disease Control 
Program (CDI) will provide vaccinations against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, 
tetanus, measles and tuberculosis to children under five (5) years of age. CDI will 
also provide screening activities in  target populations so as to detect and 
immediately treat positive cases of tuberculosis and leprosy. The third program, 
Ambulatory and Basic Hospital Medical Care Program (AHM), will provide medical care in 
health centers and unidades mistas. Services in these facilities will be limited to 
out-patient and in-patient care not requiring highly trained professionals nor 
expensive technology, thus ensuring simple but effective patient care and patient 
referral to sophisticated levels of care when required. The BHS package will be 
delivered at the household and health posts by auxiliaries and at health centers and 
unidades mistas by auxiliaries and professionals.
