NEW ZEALAND
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        New Zealand Railways (NZR) is operated as a Government department,
headed by the Minister of Railways who is also Minister of Transport. The
Department operates railway systems on the two main islands totalling about
3,000 route miles, a large fleet of road vehicles and a road/rail ferry
service connecting the islands. Management is capable, with adequate auto-
nomy, and the staff is competent. Handling of traffic, operations and other
technical matters is good.
ii.       NZR has always been protected by law from unrestrained competition
by commercial trucking. While Government policy during the past eight years
has gradually liberalized restrictions, enough protection still remains to
suggest that the transport system may not be satisfying overall needs at
minimum cost. The Railways has become a competitive force in its own right
and does not need to be sheltered in order to survive and operate efficient-
ly. Indeed, there are trends apparent, notably containerization, which will
enhance the comparative advantage of rail. As part of the proposed project,
a study will be undertaken by the Ministry of Transport with the assistance
of independent consultants. The purpose of the study will be to reassess
the role of transport regulations and to develop the principles of a nation-
al transport policy. The foreign exchange costs of the study have been in-
cluded in the proposed loan.
iii.      The proposed project, costing an estimated US$88 million equival-
ent, consists of the first three years of the New Zealand Railways' US$160
million, 1970/71-1975/76 Investment Plan and the transport policy study.
The proposed loan of US$16 million to New Zealand would finance about 33%
of the foreign exchange costs of the project. No retroactive financing is
involved. This would be the second World Bank loan to the Government for
railway purposes: US$42 million was provided in 1965 (Loan 438-NZ) to help
finance part of the Railways' 1965/66-1969/70 Investment Plan.
iv.       The main items in the proposed project include motive power and
rolling stock (45%), improvements to permanent way (12%), two additional
ferries (15%), and workshop and track maintenance equipment (7%). The pro-
posed loan would finance specific goods procured through international compe-
titive bidding: 1,100 freight cars and 100 ballast cars plus components for
the local manufacture of 610 freight cars, a small amount of workshop, track
maintenance and signalling equipment and foreign exchange costs for consulting
services required for a study of transport policy. The total foreign exchange
component of the project amounts to US$48 million equivalent. This is to be
financed by the proposed loan of US$16 million, specific bilateral agreements
and the Government's own foreign exchange resources. US$15.5 million of the
proposed Bank loan would be made available to NZR while the US$.5 million for
the transport policy study would be used by the New Zealand Government, which
will be responsible for its execution.



- ii -
v.        The project is economically sound.  The proposed investments are
not designed to change the relative size of NZR in the transport sector but
rather to equip it to meet demands which are certain to arise and can be
justified on grounds of comparative advantage. These demands have an insig-
nificant probability of being altered by the findings of a transport sector
study. The weighted average economic rate of return on the investments in
the project is about 18%.
vi.       Under Loan 438-NZ, it was agreed that measures would be taken to
progressively improve the Railways' financial position and to achieve an
operating ratio of 85% by 1970/71. The recession in 1967/68 and increases
in wages and prices, however, adversely affected NZR. The increases in
costs were partly absorbed by the Railways by modernization and improved
operations -- it carried 19% more freight net ton-miles in 1970 than in
1965, with 12.5% less staff. Tariff increases were made in 1967 and Decem-
ber 1968, but the timing and the quantum thereof were affected by competi-
tive and other considerations, with the result that the targets were not
reached. However, the Railways met all its financial obligations, includ-
ing debt service. Substantial additional wage increases are expected dur-
ing 1971. A 12% freight tariff increase on a selective basis and a 10%
increase in passenger fares will become effective on February 15, 1971, at
the end of a price freeze imposed by the Government. A further tariff ad-
justment would be needed later in 1971 to maintain satisfactory finances
and generate adequate funds for the Railways' needs. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that the Government would cause the Railways to take
all necessary measures (including but not limited to adjustment of the tar-
iff structures and rates) as shall be required to meet, out of internally
generated resources, debt service obligations and needs of working capital
and to finance a reasonable proportion of its capital expenditures, includ-
ing the replacement of assets. It was agreed, keeping in view the needs of
the Railways, that the Railways should break even in fiscal 1972 and earn
rates of return of 3.5% in fiscal 1973, 4% in fiscal 1974 and 1975 and 5%
in subsequent fiscal years on the net fixed assets in operation.
vii.      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to
the New Zealand Government of US$16 million equivalent for a term of 15
years, including a grace period of about 2-1/2 years; US$15.5 million would
be made available to NZR on identical terms.



NEW ZEALAND
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of New Zealand and the New Zealand Railways (NZR)
have asked the Bank for a loan of US$16 million equivalent to finance
part of the foreign exchange cost of NZR's investments during the first
three years of its six-year plan 1970/71-1975/76 and the entire foreign
exchange costs of a study of transport policy. NZR's investments during
these three years are estimated at NZ$ 78 million (US$88 million equiva-
lent) with a foreign exchange component of about US$48 million equivalent.
The study of transport policy is estimated to cost about US$.7 million of
which US$.5 million represents the foreign exchange cost.
1.02      The Bank helped finance a previous railway project in Nev Zealand
under Loan 438-NZ for US$42 million equivalent in 1965. Performance on
this project has generally been satisfactory. All procurements financed
under this first loan have been received and the locomotives, freight wagons
and the road/rail ferry are in service and performing well.
1.03      As in the previous Bank loan for NZR, the proposed loan would
be made to the Government. The US$15.5 million for railway equipment would
be made available to NZR to finance specific imported goods and US$.5 millio.
would remain with the Government for the transportation study.
1.04      This appraisal is based on information supplied by the Government
of New Zealand and the New Zealand Railways and on the findings of a Bank
mission in June 1970, comprising Messrs. Bronfman (economist), Karman
(engineer), McCunniff and Nanjundiah (financial analysts). This report was
prepared by them and Mr. Mactaggart (economist) and has been edited by Miss
V. Foster.
2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      New Zealand comprises two main islands about 1,200 miles southeast
of Australia. It covers an area of 104,000 square miles, slightly larger
than that of the United Kingdom. Its population is of very low density,
totalling 2.8 million people, and is growing at 1.5% per annum.
2.02      New Zealand's Gross National Product (GNP) has grown at an average
of 3.3% per annum in real terms since fiscal year 1965. In FY 1970 it
reached NZ$ 4.8 billion or approximately US$1,890 on a per capita equivalent
basis.  This was achieved with limited physical resources by reliance on
exports from highly developed, efficient agricultural industries buttressed
by a preferred position in the UK market. Dependience on limited external



- 2 -
markets and lack of diversification leave the New Zealand trade balance vul-
nerable. A major economic uncertainty stems from the proposed British en-
try into the European Economic Community (EEC). While the percentage of
total exports going to the UK declined from 58 in 1959 to 38 in 1970, it
is likely that the economy will suffer if the entry takes place without safe-
guards for New Zealand produce. Several promising developments could help
to offset an unfavorable outcome: (a) broadening of meat exports into
other overseas markets, especially Japan and the United States; (b) export
of new goods, particularly forest products; and (c) discovery of potentially
significant deposits of natural gas, iron ore and other minerals.
B. The Transport Sector
2.03      New Zealand's transport system consists of an extensive road and
rail network, a growing system of commercial aviation and a small but modern
capacity for coastal shipping. Terrain is rugged, with mountain ranges bi-
secting the country in a north-south direction. As only 8% of New Zealand is
plain, extensive bridging and tunneling have been necessary. The North and
South Islands are separated by Cook Strait, a narrow, turbulent sea passage
which creates the need for effective but costly transshipment. Heavy re-
liance on the export of agricultural products creates marked seasonal peaks
and imbalances in domestic traffic. Much of the country's production calls
for specialized haulage equipment, which inevitably leads to substantial
amounts of one-way loading. Freight and passenger statistics by mode of
transport for 1958-1969 are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
(i) Road Transport
2.04      The total number of vehicles in 1969 was about 1.1 million; 75%
were automobiles, giving New Zealand one of the highest ratios of vehicles
per capita in the world. During the same year there were 52,000 miles of
engineered interurban roads supported by an annual expenditure of about NZ$
93 million for maintenance and new construction. Roads are divided into
three classes with different axle load restrictions related to design
characteristics. A large proportion of total mileage is 20 to 30 years old
and deficient in pavement strength, unduly constraining efficient usage of
modern heavy transport equipment. In terms of output measured by net ton-
miles, road transport is the dominant mode, followed by the railways. The
scope of road transport is limited by axle load restrictions and by legal
restrictions on haulage in competition with rail services.
2.05      Trucking performs two functions.  It hauls specific commodities
exempt from regulation, such as livestock, meat and fresh produce. With
commodities protected by regulation, such as most industrial goods, it
provides short-haul services under a 40-mile limit. Within the "for hire"
segment, there has been a trend toward creation of large trucking organiza-
tions. For various reasons, including cost and convenience, private truck-
ing "on own account", while subject to the same regulations, has increased
rapidly.



3-
(ii) Rail Transport
2.06      The railway is the prime carrier of freight over longer distances,
including traffic between the islands. Some specialization has developed in
freight, particularly with frozen meat and forest products. Although the
relative status of rail transport has declined in the postwar years
vis-a-vis roads, in absolute terms railway freight services have expanded and
improved. From the peak route mileage of 3,577 attained in 1952, the net-
work has declined by 514 miles or 14% to 3,063 miles as of March 1970 as a
result of closing uneconomic branch Lines.  A vigorous sales drive, better
services to the public, improvemLent of rolling stock, an almost complete
change to dieselization and better traffic control methods have contributed
significantly to the revival of rail transport as an effective competitor to
commercial and "own account" trucking and coastal shipping. A greater inte-
gration of the rail networks on the North and South Islands by way of two
railway-owned roll-on/roll-off vessels, which transport both railway wagons
and road vehicles, has added to the success of railway operations in recent
years.
(iii) Aviation
2.07      The major air transport service is undertaken by two Government-
owned corporations, Air New Zealand and National Airways Corporation, with
a small private firm under contract to NZR providing connectirg air freight
services between the main islands.
(iv) Ports, Overseas and Coastal Shipping Services and Containerization
2.08      New Zealand has many ports, 17 of which handle overseas trade.
Coastal shipping has improved considerably during the past ten years; the
trend is toward fewer vessels of larger capacity, faster turn-around time
and concentration of traffic at fewer ports. New Zealand is about to intro-
duce the unit load-containerization concept into her overseas trade. Con-
tainer vessels will commence runs to and from the USA in 1971 and the UK and
Western Europe in 1973. The need for a fast turn-around of container ships
will demand the construction of specialized wharves, the development of ad-
jacent assembly areas and the installation of container cranes and other
peripheral equipment. This will likely involve the concentration of container
ship operations at two (Wellington, Auckland) or possibly three ports. Con-
siderable changes will also be made in the rolling stock and handling tech-
niques of both the railway and trucking industries.
C. Transport Coordination
2.09      For many years NZR has beeni protected from competition by road
transport, effected through strict regulation of the coimmodities carried and
routes served by trucking firms. The basic regulatory system was establislhed
by tthe Transport Licensing Act of 1931 whien slackened demuand had created
substantial excess capacity in thie transport sector and chaotic competition
conditions were a danger.  The threat to thie Railways was especially great



- 4 -
due to the "differential" structure of its rates which did not reflect op-
erating costs and was not flexible enough to meet the challenges of the
trucking industry that was beginning to develop. The system of protection
as amended by the 1962 Transportation Act was fairly complete. In general,
trucks were not permitted to carry traffit between points serviced by rail
more than 40 miles apart regardless of the comparative costs of quality of
service. Exemptions from mileage limits were granted for livestock, fresh
meat and some agricultural produce.
2.10      The trend in recent years has been toward relaxing regulatory
constraints. Mileage limits on the carriage of most perishable commodities
have been extended or lifted entirely. This pattern has been impeded, how-
ever, by the underinvested and, therefore, vulnerable position of the Rail-
ways until the advent of a modernization program, aided by Bank financing,
in the late 1960'a. In addition, occasional balance of payments difficul-
ties have constrained the Government from allowing trucking firms to in-
crease their capacity from foreign suppliers.
2.11      The current regulatory framework, little more than a patched ver-
sion of the original, does not lead to a least cost solution. While some
improvements have been made by the 1968 Ministry of Transport Act (see Annex
1 for a current organization chart of agencies pertaining to transport), this
progress should be supported by basic research on inter-relationships within
the transport sector. The appropriateness of existing regulation should be
reviewed in the light of prevailing economic and social conditions and trends,
spelling out the objectives and the appropriate pricing and regulatory criteria
for developing an efficient and economical national transport policy.  A pro-
posal made by the Bank for an in-depth study was welcomed by the Government.
The study will be undertaken by the Ministry of Transport as part df a program
of long-term research in transport with the help of consultants. The consul-
tants will submit their own independent recommendations; their selection and
terms of reference will be mutually agreed between the Government and the Bank.
The findings and recommendations of the study will be submitted by the Govern-
ment to the Bank for comments promptly after its completion. The study forms
part of the project and the estimated foreign exchange costs have been provided
in the proposed Bank loan.
3. THE RAILWAY SYSTEM
A. Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      New Zealand Railways is operated as a Government Department, headed
by the Minister of Railways who is also the Minister of Transport; a General
Manager is responsible for Railways management (see Organization Chart, Annex
2). The Department operates the railway system and a large fleet of road
vehicles, and also provides rail and road ferry service. The Railways has
adequate autonomy.



- 5 -
3.02      The Railways' management is capable and the handling of traffic,
operations, and technical matters is good. The staff is competent. Legis-
lation makes promotion other than on a seniority basis very difficult.
Labor relations are good.
3.03      The average number of employees has decreased from 24,805 in 1963
to 21,113 in 1970. There is no general surplus of staff; actually, there
is a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled men because of a loss of labor to
private industry. NZR is taking remedial measures by training apprentices
and by providing social services, such as housing.
B. Railway Property
(i) Railway Lines
3.04      There are two separate railway systems of 1,625 route-miles in the
North Island and 1,438 route-miles in the South Island, a total of 3,063
route-miles linked by roll-on/roll-off rail ferry. The gauge is 3 ft. 6
in. compared with 4 ft. 8-1/2 in. in North America and most European coun-
tries. The entire network is single track except for 161 miles of double
track. Mountainous terrain has required extensive civil engineering. The
value of the fixed assets is, therefore, comparatively higher than on most
railways. In recent years 33 uneconomic branch lines have been closed for
a total length of 514 miles (Table 3). Closing of four more lines is cur-
rently being investigated.
3.05      The only new line construction in progress is the Kaimai deviation.
It includes a 5.5-mile tunnel and will slhorten the distance from Frankton to
Tauranga by about 40 miles; it will also allow the closing of a 15-mile sec-
tion with steep gradients, narrow curves and tunnels. The complete Kaimai
tunnel and deviation is expected to be in service by March 1973.
3.06      Another line construction is under consideration, connecting Rotu-
rua with Paengaroa. This new line would give the timber-producing Rotorua
area a direct 40-mile rail connection to the log export wharves at Mt. Maun-
ganui, in place of a tortuous 110-mile rail route over the Mamaku ranges.
The Mamaku line could presumably be closed when the Paengaroa line is opened,
possibly in December 1976.
3.07      Much of the track is laid witin old, light rail, but since 1950 thie
main lines have been relaid with 91 lbs per yard rail. About 70 miles of
track are completely renewed each year (Table 4).
3.08      A total of 68 route-miles is electrified, mostly for commuter
services in tile Christchurch and Wellington suburban areas. Further elec-
trification is not contemplated.  Signalling is generally adequate and well
maintained. According to tine density of traffic, Centralized Traffic Con-
trol (CTC), automatic signalling, token block instruments or "open section"
procedure is used.



- 6 -
(ii) Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.09      NZR has 299 main line and 270 shunting diesel locomotives and 20
electric locomotives; the last 18 steam locomotives are to be retired in
1970. Passenger stock decreased from 854 cars in 1965 to 722 in 1970. De-
tails of freight wagon stock are given in Table 5. Freight wagons of over
40 years of service represented about 20% of the fleet in 1965 and 10k in
1970 and would almost disappear in 1975 under the present investment plan.
A detailed costing study in progress may enable the economic life of stan-
dard rolling stock to be brought down to 35 years. Motive power and roll-
ing stock are well maintained.  There is a lack of adequate wagons for
paper and steel products as well as a lack of flat wagons for container
traffic, expected to grow significanitly.
(iii) Other Property
3.10      Cook Strait Rail Ferry:  Two ferries operate between Wellington
and Picton. The Aramoana (4,160 tons) and the Aranui (4,542 tons, financed
under Loan 438-NZ) are each designed to carry 34 railway wagons or about 85
automobiles on the vehicle deck and a further 30 automobiles in an upper-deck
garage. There is all-weather accommodation in each vessel for about 500
passengers. A two-ship timetable of 21 round trips per week was introduced
with the advent of the Aranui in 1966.
3.11      Road Services:  A total of 1,154 vehicles are operated by the Rail-
ways over a 5,925-mile network, both for goods and for passenger transport.
Ancillary services are also operated (a) to convey ordinary rail-consigned
small lots of goods between stations; (b) to carry through-booked air freight
between railway terminals and aerodromes; (c) to perform transship work at
goods terminals; and (d) to operate licensed door-to-door road services.
In 1969/70, a total of 24.18 million miles were run by the road services,
of which 20.82 million were for passengers, .95 million for goods and 2.41
million for the ancillary goods service.
C.   Traffic and Operations
(i) Freight Traffic 1965/66 to 1969/70
3.12      Comercial freight traffic rose from about 1.5 billion ton-miles
in 1965/66 to about 1.7 billion ton-miles in 1969/70, a gross increase of
14%. Considerable fluctuations occurred on a year-to-year basis, as shown
in Table 6, which also shows trends in various commodity groups and compares
actual volumes carried with forecasts prepared by the Railways in 1965.
The cumulative variance of actual from forecast over the five-year period
was minor - a shortfall of some 2.4%. Variances are explained in detail in
Annex 3. Table 6 shows trends for various commodity groups.
3.13      Important developments have materialized to improve operating ef-
ficiency. Some, such as dieselization, upgrading of rolling stock and acqui-
sition of the Cook Strait ferries, were financed in large part by the first
railway loan. Others have resulted from better management of railway re-
sources. Increased reliance on bulk tonnage operations has enhanced the



-7-
comparative advantage of rail transport and improved customer service by
promoting better wagon loading and cutting the expenses of local transport
door to door. Encouragement of some unit train operations, particularly for
timber products, has increased load factors. Further, the average haul has
increased 21% from 119 miles in 1964/65 to 144 miles in 1969/70. This re-
flects the closing of uneconomic lines, increased truck competition, and
more frequent rail ferry services. The average density of traffic has in-
creased 21% over a four-year period but large imbalances still exist, as
shown in the following tabulation:
Freight Ton-Miles per Route-Mile
Year      Total New Zealand       North Island      South Island
1965/66          453,000               645,000           259,000
1969/70          547,000               745,000           324,000
(ii) Freight Traffic Forecast 1970/71-1975/76
3.14      NZR estimates that commercial freight traffic will increase 37% be-
tween 1970/71 and 1975/76, from 1.7 billion net ton-miles to 2.3 billion net
ton-miles (Table 7), an average annual increase of 6%. This primary forecast
is based upon commodity-by-commodity projections assuming (a) opening of the
Kaimai deviation in 1973; (b) introduction of two more Cook Strait ferries;
(c) creation of new plant capacity for steel, pulp and meat processing; (d)
developments in container traffic; and (e) no change in transport regulatory
rules. Traffic in several commodities is expected to increase. Containeri-
zation will influence the carriage of meat, wool and dairy products. The
Railways believes that net ton-miles (not tons) of these commodities will
rise because of the transfer from conventional shipping to containers, re-
ducing the number of ports handling traffic and changing flows to meet ship-
ping demands. By 1975/76 an additional 135 million net-ton miles should be
generated by containerization. Traffic in "other commodities" is expected
to rise by 45%, reflecting growth of inter-island bulk tonnage operations
with the addition of two new ferries. Anticipated trends in all major com-
modity groups can be seen in Table 7. The assumptions underlying the fore-
cast are presented in Annex 4.
3.15      NZR also subjected the primary traffic forecast to sensitivity anal-
ysis assuming changes in regulations regarding commercial trucking. This
analysis is considered reasonable. First, it was assumed that liberalization
of policy would be gradual and would follow one of two paths: an extension
of current mileage limits on trucking activity (Hypothesis A) or the removal
of restrictions on particular commodities (Hypothesis B). Possible dates
for implementation of the regulations were further assumed. An analysis was
made of the likely effect of the measures oni some 45 individual commodities
over six mileage intervals. The results indicated that growth in total net
ton-miles over the period would be limited to 20% under Hypothesis A and 26%
under Hypothesis B compared to 37% from the primary forecast. The theoretic-
al effects on NZR's traffic and revenue are shown in Table 8. A final test



-8-
estimated the impact of a complete removal of all legal restrictions on truck-
ing.  While it is considered unrealistic that such a shift would materialize
immediately, it provides a useful exercise for examining the rold of the Kail-
ways under extremely adverse conditions. A rigorous commodity-by-commodity
analysis indicated that freight traffic could conceivably fall 15% below the
primary forecast in 1971/72 in the unlikely case of NZR doing nothing to alter
its marketing strategy to offset the policy (Annex 4). The actual reduction
in 1971/72 would almost certainly be less than this "most pessimistic" esti-
mate. In the longer term with increased investment in road transport, rail-
way traffic may be more fundamentally affected, but it nevertheless can be
concluded that the Railways would certainly retain an important role in the
transport system.
(iii) Passenger Traffic 1965/66-1969/70 and Forecast 1970/71-1975/76
3.16      The Railways provides both rail and bus services on an intercity
and suburban (commuting) basis; trends in passenger carriage are outlined in
Table 9. Total passengers fell some 12% from 23.8 million to 21.0 million
during the five-year period. The major changes have been the introduction of
an efficient daylight railcar service between Wellington and Auckland in 1968
and the cancellation of some uneconomic routes. Total patronage of NZR buses
remained constant at approximately 22 million passengers per year. Railway
management forecasts a continuing decline in rail passenger traffic but at a
lower rate than in the past and an absolute fall in bus traffic during the
next five years (Table 9).
(iv) Operations
3.17      NZR is well operated.  Operating efficiency in terms of net ton-
miles per train-mile and of traffic units per employee is satisfactory and
shows a steady improvement (Table 10) with only one drop in 1967/68 due to
an unfavorable economic situation and a strike in May 1967.
3.18      Passenger traffic is concentrated in suburban areas and is operated
with diesel and electric railcars. Less than 10% of the passengers travel
long distances. Many passenger trains have been replaced by road services.
Between Wellington and Auckland an express railcar provides three daylight
trips per week each way and is operating at 70% of capacity, which is satis-
factory.  Because of the popularity and profitability of this service, three
new express railcars have been ordered from Japan.
3.19      Average loading of freight cars is low at 53% of capacity.  Several
major commodities have poor load factors, e.g., frozen meat can never be
loaded up to more than 40% of the weight capacity of the wagons because of
the shape of the carcasses. The average length of haul is consistently in-
creasing and was 144 miles in 1969/70 compared with 119 miles in 1964/65.
3.20      The turn-around time of the freight cars is good, between five and
six days. However, this figure is arrived at by considering a 260-day year.
Freight traffic is almost non-existent between Saturday noon and Monday noon.



- 9 -
Factories close and shipside activity halts during the weekend. This situa-
tion is traditional in New Zealand, as in many other countries, and there is
little hope of improving utilization by increasing the number of working days
in the year.
(v) Tariffs and Costs
3.21      The structure of freight tariffs is satisfactory.  In addition to
"class" rates which vary with distance, the Railways makes extensive use of
"special" rates and contract rates. Special rates are usually applied to
specific commodities between specified points and are available to all cus-
tomers. Contract rates are designed to meet individual customer requirements;
e.g., increasingly important is the "bulk tonnage" contract whereby the Rail-
ways leases flat cars and agrees to provide unlimited (limited if inter-island
traffic) trips between two railway terminals for a fixed annual rate, with
the shipper performing handling and documentation and accepting liability
for loss and damage. This has resulted in an increase in freight forwarding
by private enterprises, especially trucking firms providing door-to-door
service. NZR makes frequent use of costing in the establishment and modifi-
cation of freight rates, particulgrly special and contract rates. Costing
procedures are satisfactory.
3.22      Suburban passenger fares, on the other hand, do not cover operating
costs. Total annual losses amount to about NZ$ 2.1 million for rail services
and NZ$ 0.5 million for road services, which NZR covers by cross subsidization
from freight revenues. This practice will become progressively less feasible
as competition in the transport sector increases. Consequently, a special
committee recommended in February 1970 that financial responsibility for urban
rail and bus services gradually be assumed by urban transport authorities, the
Railways to continue to provide services wnere urban transit is deemed social-
ly desirable but, at the end of an eight-year period, to be responsible for
covering only 20% of the deficit generated. This proposal shows no signs of
having been reached on the basis of sound economic criteria. The appropriate
pricing policy for suburban rail services will be examined as part of the
agreed transport policy study.
4.  THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Six-Year Investment Plan
4.01      For major investments, tlhe Railways has to obtain the approval of
the Government. The proposed six-year Investment Plan has been approved.
4.02      As shown in Table 11 and summarized on the following page, the Plan
provides for capital investment of NZ$ 142.5 million (US$159.6 million equiv-
alent) with a foreign exchange component of US$78.6 million.  The Investment
Plan is based on careful studies by the Railways of future traffic and capi-
tal requirements. Emphasis is given to modernization of rolling stock, es-
pecially for particular commodities and for container traffic. Other main
items are diesel locomotives and two additional Cook Strait ferries.

B.  The Project and the Proposed Loan
4.03      The Project consists of the first three years of NZR's six-year
Investment Plan 1970/71-1975/76 and a study of transportation policy (Tables
12 and 13 and Annexes 5 and 6). The total cost of railway investments during
these three years is estimated at NZ$ 78.4 million (US$87.8 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of about US$47.8 million, of which US$15.5
million would be provided by the proposed US$16 million loan, which also
includes US$.5 million for the foreign exchange costs of the transport policy
study. No retroactive financing is involved. A breakdown of the Project and
of the proposed loan follows.

4.04       Investments included in the Project but not selected for the pro-
posed loan will either be financed by other sources or are unsuitable for in-
ternational competitive bidding. Annex 5 gives a complete description of the
Project items.
4.05       As shown in detail in Table 13, about 86% of the US$16 million pro-
posed loan would finance the procurement of 1,100 freight cars and 100 ballast
cars to be imported in knocked down condition and of parts for the manufacture
of 610 freight cars in the railway workshops.  With the balance of the loan,
two wheel lathes and one ballast cleaning machine would be procured and CTC
equipment provided for two lines totalling 48 miles. Provision has also been
made for financing the foreign cost of the transport sector study. A complete
description of the Bank-financed items is given in Annex 6.



- 12 -
C.   Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.06      New Zealand Railways is able to carry out the Project without tech-
nical assistance. All items to be financed by the proposed loan would be
acquired through international competitive bidding. It is considered that no
local firm would be in a position to bid for any of the Bank-financed items.
4.07      The New Zealand Government is anxious to save foreign exchange and
to make full use of existing NZR workshop capacity by manufacturing part of
the freight car requirements in New Zealand. Among other equipment, the last
Bank loan to New Zealand Railways helped finance a hydraulic press, mainly in-
tended for the local manufacture of freight car components. A study was
made by NZR to compare the cost of flat cars built in the Railways workshops
and using about one-third of imported components with the cost of the same
cars imported in knocked down condition. The study showed that locally manu-
factured cars would be, at the most, 5% more expensive than imported cars.
It is therefore suggested to agree to NZR's request and include in the pro-
posed loan the financing of imported parts for local manufacture of 610 flat
cars, which is consistent with full utilization of existing workshop facili-
ties.
4.08      The cost estimates are based on recent quotations obtained for
similar goods under international competitive bidding. If any savings in
foreign expenditure result from favorable prices in competitive bidding,
the corresponding savings in the loan account would be used to finance the
foreign exchange cost of additional but similar Project items subject to
review and agreement with the Bank.
4.09      For all items to be covered by the proposed Bank loan, price con-
tingencies have been added and amount to an average of 7% of the total (Table
13), which seems reasonable in relation to world market trends and the proba-
ble dates of commitment and delivery of the goods in question.  Contingencies
have been included on the other freight cars and on the road vehicles accord-
ing to New Zealand practice, the actual number of vehicles purchased being
related to a fixed amount. Contingencies for items not financed by the Bank
are shown in Tables 11 and 12.
4.10      The estimated quarterly rate of disbursement (Table 14) is based on
the assumption that the Bank loan would become effective by April 1971.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Plan and the Project
5.01      While the survival of the Railways is not doubted, several uncer-
tainties regarding future transport policy and the economic impact of the
UK-EEC negotiations suggest a prudent investment policy for NZR. This is
reflected in the modest size of the Railways' investment program.



- 13 -
5.02      The Plan and the Project involve a number of investments which, when
taken together, are designed to meet three common objectives. First, NZR in-
tends to continue its modernization program by upgrading rolling stock, road
vehicles, workshop and track maintenance equipment, and permanent way. Second,
it wishes to prepare for containerization in external trade during the early
1970's by purchasing bogie flatcars, installing transtainer cranes in Auckland
and Wlellington, and increasing ferry capacity. Finally, it proposes, by ac-
quiring specialized rolling stock, to strengthien its position in individual
markets such as steel, timber, logs and paper where the comparative advantage
of rail over other modes has been clearly established.
B.   Evaluation of the Pr2oect
5.03      Major investments proposed in the Project are evaluated in the
following paragraphs.
(i)  Items Required for Containerization
5.04      The Project calls for tne purchase of 670 bogie flatcars and three
transtainer cranes totalling NZ$ 11.8 million to equip NZR to handle con-
tainer traffic by 1972. The importance of containerization in buttressing
the position of New Zealand exports by reducing shipping costs, most of
which take the form of outflows of foreign exchange, is well understood and
accepted by the Government.  A major study, commissioned by the Minister
of Transport, undertaken by the Metra Consulting Group, and reviewed and
considered acceptable by the Bank, indicated that conversion of the majority
of the UK and 50% of the European traffic to the lowest cost container system
would yield annually savings in transport costs of NZ$ 23 million over conven-
tional shipping and NZ$ 14 million over palletized shipping on an investment
base of about NZ$ 80 million. When an increase in the cost of internal trans-
portation due to the aggregation of traffic at the major container ports of
Auckland and Wellington is built into the analysis, rates of return attributa-
ble directly to containerization and therefore to the equipment necessary for
its application, including that contained in the Project, range from 14% to
23%. While the issues have not been studied separately, it is reasonable to
assume that similar returns will accrue to future container trade with North
America and Japan. It is interesting to note also the findings of the con-
sultants regarding the least cost modal split for handling the movement of
containers within New Zealand. On a district-by-district basis, using various
factor load assumptions, they determined that allocating traffic to road or
rail on the basis of the 40-mile restriction on road haulage would capture
the relative economies of the two modes, i.e., that rail was cheaper than
road transport in almost every case on hauls of over 40 miles.
(ii)  Permanent Way
5.05      NZ$ 9.5 million is for improvements to permanent way consisting
mainly of routine renewal of bridges and tracks over the three-year period.
These expenditures are modest components of the total Project and very
necessary to ensure the safe, efficient operation of the Railways. Bene-
fits will accrue from increased utilization of equipment and from reduced
track maintenance costs. The rate of return on these investments is esti-
mated at 12%.



- 14 -
(iii) Other Freight Wagons for Specialized Traffic
5.06      The desire to exploit the comparative advantage of the rail mode in
specialized markets is reflected in the provision of 600 four-wheeled cars
and 200 bogie flats for pulp and paper traffic, 400 flat cars for steel traf-
fic, and 40 cars for timber and bulk tonnage. The total cost of these 1,240
freight cars is NZ$ 10.6 million. Economic benefits are savings in transporta-
tion costs attached to decreased maintenance, improved turn-around time, and
better utilization of capacity and are estimated at approximately NZ$ 1.5 mil-
lion in the early years rising to NZ$ 2.2 million in the fifth year when the
cars will be fully utilized. The rate of return is estimated at 18%.
(iv) Cook Strait Ferries
5.07      Outlays on two additional roll-on/roll-off ferries are scheduled
during the Project period. The third ferry, costing NZ$ 7.6 million, is
scheduled for delivery in late 1971. Oriented toward both freight and pas-
senger traffic, it will assist in clearing the traffic bottleneck across
the Cook Strait and will absorb increases in freight due to containeriza-
tion up to 1973. The fourth ferry, costing about NZ$ 8.0 million, will
carry only freight and is scheduled for delivery in mid-1973. The rate of
return, estimated conservatively on a financial cash flow basis, is 14%.
(v) Workshop and Track Maintenance Equipment
5.08      NZR has budgeted NZ$ 6.7 million for workshop and track maintenance
equipment and 100 hopper cars to add to and replace current obsolete stock.
Benefits on the Bank-financed portion have been attributed to cost savings in
maintenance and decreased labor requirements. The rate of return is high,
about 40%, reflecting the higher capital intensity of the work with this new
equipment.
(vi) Diesel Locomotives
5.09      NZ$ 4.9 million has been allocated for the purchase of 15 main line
locomotives and nine shunters. The new 2500 HP main line locomotives will
be used on heavy trains for which two 1425 HP locomotives are presently need-
ed, thereby greatly reducing operating cost. The rate of return is 30%.
(vii) Passenger Cars
5.10      NZR plans to upgrade its passenger fleet by spending some NZ$ 4.8
million for passenger cars including three new railcar sets plus 27 cars and
four power vans for use on the profitable day liner and overnight runs be-
tween Auckland and Wellington. The service will produce quantifiable bene-
fits in the form of cost savings in repairs and fuel, better utilization,
and increased patronage. The rate of return is conservatively estimated
at 11%.



- 15 -
(viii) Road Vehicles
5.11      The Project calls for annual expenditure of NZ$ 1.0 million to
NZ$ 1.3 million for routine replacement of road vehicles. This corresponds
to approximately 70 vehicles per year and is comparable to the replacement
program over the past four years.
(ix) Conclusion
5.12      The rationale underlying the investments included in the Plan and
the Project is sound, fitting well with New Zealand's development strategy.
It is not geared toward changing the relative size of NZR in the transport
sector, but rather toward equipping it to meet demands which are certain to
arise. This cautionary stance is well conceived at this time until the con-
clusions of the proposed transport policy study have been formulated and the
uncertainty surrounding the UK-EEC negotiations is clarified. The weighted
average rate of return on the investments subject to quantification (72% of
the Project) is about 18%. The Project is economically well justified.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Background
6.01      The Railways had operating losses for several years, but the posi-
tion improved after 1963 when the Government and the Railways adopted a con-
tinuing financial plan to improve the Railways' earnings and financial posi-
tion. The Government lifted the burden of paying fixed interest on Government
capital by converting it into non-interest bearing capital with effect from
April 1, 1965. Dividends may now be paid by the Railways to the Government
only after meeting the Railways' needs including those of investment. The
Government and the Railways also agreed under Bank Loan 438-NZ to improve
the Railways' financial position; an operating ratio of 85% by the end of
1970/71 was the objective.
B.   Present Position
(i) Actual Operating Results
6.02      The actual operating results for the last five years are
summarized below (Table 15 gives the details).

6.03      The Railways came close to the objective in fiscal year 1966.  The
deterioration in 1967 and 1968 reflects the adverse economic conditions in
New Zealand, when the forecast traffic increases did not materialize and
there were increased costs to the Railways. It was agreed, under Loan 438-NZ,
that to achieve the financial target referred to, the Railways would increase
rates and fares to the extent necessary to offset rises in costs resulting
from increases in wages and prices of materials, taking into account compen-
sating increases in traffic and operating efficiency. There were significant
increases in wages and prices of materials - about 32% in wages and about 25%
in prices of materials - between 1965 and 1970. A part of these was ab-
sorbed by the Railways by modernization and improvements in operation, which
enabled it to carry 19% more freight net ton-miles in 1970 than in 1965, with
12.5% less staff. Tariff increases were effected in 1967 and December 1968,
but the timing and the extent thereof were also affected by competitive and
other conditions, with the result that the targets were not reached. Ilowever,
the Railways met all its financial obligations, including debt service.
(ii) Summary Balance Sheets
6.04      Actual balance sheet data for the last five years are summarized
below:

Finances, as reflected by these balance sheets, have been satisfactory;
lowest current and liquid ratios were 4.4 and 3.1, respectively, in 1970.
The debt equity ratio was 9/91 in 1970; the only long-term debt was the
first Bank loan.
C.   Future Prospects
6.05      A continuing problem has been frequent increases in wages.  The
wage increases in 1969/70 added NZ$ 4 million to the total wage bill despite
a reduction in the staff of 1,072 or 4.8% in that year. A new law regulating
service conditions of employees in State services requires periodical review
of wage scales and their adjustment as necessary to maintain parity with in-
dustry. The Railways states that wage adjustments already approved and ex-
pected to be approved in 1970/71 will add another NZ$ 9.7 million to the
1970/71 wage bill. These increases, on a full year basis, will increase
the 1971/72 wage bill by NZ$ 13.4 million and by NZ$ 15.2 million in 1975/76.
The Railways and the Government realize that the financial prospects are poor
unless appropriate tariff adjustments are made very soon. This matter was
discussed during negotiations. NZR and the Government stated that a 12%
freight tariff increase on a selective basis and a 10% increase in passenger
rates will become effective on February 15, 1971, at the end of a price
freeze imposed by the Government. A further tariff adjustment would be
needed later in 1971, and NZR's financial forecasts take into account these
two tariff adjustments which are essential to offset the increases in costs
referred to, maintain satisfactory finances and support the investment pro-
gram. The principal assumptions on which the financial forecasts are made
are outlined in Annex 7.
6.06      The forecast income accounts are in Table 15, balance sheet data
in Table 16, and cash flow data in Table 17. These are summarized in (i),

6.07      The forecast above indicates that the operating ratio would progres-
sively improve from 104.5% in fiscal 1971 to 87.3% in fiscal 1976. While the
Railways would fail to earn interest charges in 1970/71, the times interest
earned ratio would be 1.1 in fiscal 1972 and no less than 4.6 during the rest
of the period. Debt service coverage ratio would be only 0.9 in fiscal 1971,
but this would improve to 2.3 in fiscal 1972 and vary from 3.3 to 4.0 in the
rest of the period. The rate of return would gradually improve to 3.6% in
fiscal 1973, 4% in fiscal 1974 and 5% in 1976. The current, liquid and debt
equity ratios would also be good.
6.08      The summary cash flow data in paragraph 6.06 preceding indicates
that of NZ$ 78.4 million investment during the project period, NZ$ 8.7 mil-
lion (or 11.1%>) would be met from Government funds, NZ$ 29.0 million (or
37%) from borrowings including the proposed loan, and the balance (51.9%)
from the Railway's resources including use of cash funds available at the
beginning of the period.
6.09      The foreign exchange needs of the Railways for investment during
the project period would be only partly met by foreign loans. These, other
than the Bank loans (438-NZ and the proposed loan), include suppliers'
credits already arranged to the extent of NZ$ 12.8 million. The balance
amount of approximately NZ$ 13.7 million would have to be made available
by the Government, with the Railways reimbursing the Government in local
currency.
6.10       In the preceding forecast, it has also been assumed that increases
in costs to the Railways (by increases in wages and prices of materials) be-
yond the increases referred to in paragraph 6.05 would be compensated by
appropriate measures, including tariff adjustments, so that the Railways
does not have to absorb the impact of rising costs to the detriment of its
financial position. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government would cause the Railways to take from time to time all necessary
measures (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the tariff structures
and rates of the Railways) as shall be required to enable the Railways, out
of internally generated resources, to meet debt service requirements and re-
quirements of working capital and to finance a reasonable proportion of its
capital expenditure, including the replacement of assets. In order to achieve
this objective, it was agreed during the ne"otiations that the Railways should
break even in Fiscal 1972, and earn rates of return of 3.5% in 1973, 4% in
1974 and 1975 antd 5% in subsequent fiscal years.
6.11      The forecasts for the period 1971-76 referred to are, as indicated
in Annex 7, based on the primary freight traffic forecast. A gradual relaxa-
tion of restrictions on highway transport would have the effect of reducing
the Railways' reventues during 1975/76 by 1.8% under Hypothesis A and 2.6%
under Hypothesis B (Table 8).  Under Hypothesis B, which is the more unfavor-
able for the Railways, this would mean a redluction in revenues to the extent
of NZ$ 3.2 m1illion per annum (including the effect of revision of tariff in
1971 referred to) during the period 1974-76 and even less in the earlier



- 20 -
years. There would, however, be some compensating savings in operating ex-
penses; thus, the reduction in net revenue could be expected to be about
NZ$ 1.5 million per annum (1.1% of gross operating. revenues) during 1974-76.
In effect, therefore, there would be no significant change in the overall
financial forecasts. It may also be added that the forecasts assume that
the Railways would continue to bear the losses on suburban rail and road
services, which amount to about NZ$ 2.6 million per annum. The economic
need for marginal cost pricing of these services and the mechanism by which
the finances of NZR can be compensated will be reviewed in the transport
policy study, included in the project.
D.   Budget, Accounting and Auditing
6.12      The Railways prepares separate budgets for operations and capital
investments. Like all Government budgets, that of the Railways requires
the approval of Parliament. Budget procedures are satisfactory.
6.13      The accounting system has all the aspects of commercial accounts.
Property accounts are recorded on the basis of cost. The Government is the
Railways' banker. All revenues are paid into the Works and Trading account
of the Treasury and all working expenses are paid therefrom. Accounting
procedures are good, except that, with regard to depreciation, a slight
change is necessary.
6.14      As of April 1, 1965, the Railways shortened the depreciation life
of certain assets, i.e., wagons from 40 to 35 years, ferry boats from 20
years to 16 years. At the same time, the Railways stopped charging depre-
ciation on some assets which it had originally intended to write off,
even though such writeoff was not actually effected. This means that the
assets will reach full life without being fully depreciated. The rectifi-
cation of this was discussed during negotiations and NZR and the Government
agreed that the position would be reviewed in detail and depreciation on
such assets charged no later than 1974 (for the back period, depreciation
chargeable would be adjusted to capital reserve). It has also been agreed
that for the purposes of the financial targets, the Railways would continue
the present method of calculating the depreciation of all rolling stock ac-
quired after April 1, 1969 using the "sum of the years digits" method (which
would result in a higher charge in the initial years, when the repairs etc.
are minimal, although the amount of depreciation written off over the life of
the asset is not increased), and of all other depreciable assets using the
straight-line method.
6.15      Internal audit procedures are satisfactory and the work is effi-
ciently performed. External audit is performed by the staff of the Control-
ler and Auditor General to the New Zealand Government who also provides a
report to the Parliament.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government of
New Zealand and NZR on the following principal items:
(i)  an in-depth transport study to be undertaken by the Min-
istry of Transport with the help of consultants (para.
2.11);
(ii)  revision of tariffs and rates to offset cost increases
(para. 6.05); and
(iii)  financial targets for fiscal years commencing in 1972
(para. 6.10).
7.02      The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$16 mil-
lion equivalent. The proposed loan would be made to the New Zealand Govern-
ment for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of about 2-1/2 years;
US$15.5 million would be made available to NZR on identical terms.

NEW ZEALAND RAILWAYS
Explanation of Variances Between Traffic Forecasts and Actual
Traffic by Commodity: 1965/66-1969/70
This annex explains in soire detail the cumulative variances
between actual and forecast freight carriage which are outlined in
Table 6.
1. Coal: The greater-than-forecast rapid decline resulted from two
factors:
(a)  A quicker-than-anticipated transfer from coal to
other fuels for industrial and domestic use;
(b) A drop in the demand for thermal power at Meremere in
1968.
2. Timber, Logs: The failure to attain forecast was caused by three
factors:
(a) The forecast assumed that the Bay of Plenty area would
not be able to support both internal and external demands,
a condition that would have forced timber to move North
from the South Island. This assumption did not material-
ize; the Bay of Plenty has been able to produce for both
markets - overseas and internal - and has restricted
other areas to supplying largely for local demand. Ton-miles
have been reduced as a result.
(b) In overseas markets, concentration has been on the export
of processed timber products rather than "raw" timber,
reducing both tonnage and miles hauled.
(c) A depression in the building industry has reduced the
demand for timber in internal markets.
3. Fertilizer, Lime: Actual ton-miles of lime and fertilizer carried
was below forecast for three reasons:
(a) The depression of 1967/68 struck hard at the farmer
with little spare cash for land development and
improvement. Neither lime nor fertilizer traffic
has recovered from this slump.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(b) A new fertilizer works, planned in 1965 for Wellington,
has not been built. The demand is at present being
satisfied from a depot in Wairarapa of the Hawke Bay
works. This accounts for an unexpected sluggishness in
the growth of the "raw materials for manure" component
of fertilizer.
(c) The anticipated additional Government subsidy on
fertilizer was not granted.
4. Pulp Products: Forecasts and actual ton-miles carried are closely
matched. This occurrence in depression years suggests that there was a
greater transfer from sawn lumber to finished product than anticipated.
5. Cattle, Sheep Meat: The negative variance of actual from forecast was
caused largely by a greater than expected reduction in livestock carriage.
Livestock net ton-miles fell from 56.3 million in 1965/66 to 23.8 million
in 1969/70 because of increased road competition as restrictions on truck-
ing were relaxed. The Railways also gave low priority to the repair of
livestock wagons in a deliberate attempt to reduce the tonnage carried.
Frozen meat traffic, on the other hand, followed forecasts, increasing
in tonnage and average length of haul.
6. Cement:  The depression of actual from forecast stemmed from three
main causes:
(a) Government restriction on building and construction which
was instituted in 1967, lifted in 1969 and reintroduced
on a limited basis in 1970.
(b) Delay in the approval of new projects following the com-
pletion of major hydroelectric schemes in 1967.
(c) Takeover of the Te Kuiti cement works by Portland, which
reduced rail forwardings by rationalizing flows and trans-
ferring most Auckland traffic to coastal shipping from
Whangarei.
7.  Petroleum:  Actual increases were greater than forecast because of
two factors:
(a) A reclassification of commodities which brought "oil,
cases and drums" out of the "other commodities" category
and into petroleum;
(b) Aggressive marketing efforts which developed larger-than-
expected contract volumes.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
8. Butter, Cheese, and Dairy Byproducts: The negative variance was due
to:
(a) A drought in 1969/70 which reduced tonnage;
(b) Government incentives to change from dairying to beef
production because of problems with the UK market, also
to change from butter and cheese into other dairy products
aimed at the Japanese and South-East Asia markets.
9. Grain, Wool: Performance of both products resulted in positive
variances in actual carriage over forecast. Both tons of grain and wool
carried increased modestly during the period while average length of
haul increased substantially.
In the case of grain, all increase in traffic was on the North
Island;
(a) Maize grown in the Gisborne area - and considered for
local consumption only in 1965 - has been more in
demand as a stock food. Long hauls on the North
Island to Taranaki, Hawke Bay and Auckland have resulted.
(b) Government policy aimed at making New Zealand self-
sufficient in wheat has encouraged more cultivation in
the North Island.
10. Other Commodities: A larger-than-forecast increase materialized
for three reasons:
(a) The impact of the Cook Strait ferry service, particularly
on bulk tonnage and consumer goods. Much of this traffic
transferred from coastal shipping more quickly than
anticipated.
(b) The growth of bulk tonnage and contract rate traffic.
(c) The increasing average length of haul conveyed.
These developments are illustrated in the following table:

NEW ZEALAND RAILWAYS
Major Assumptions Underlying and Tests of Freight Traffic
Forecasts: 1970/71 - 1975/76
A.   Primary Freight Traffic Forecast:
1.   General Assumptions:
(a) Ferry Services: Two additional ferries will be acquired,
one in December 1971, the other in mid-1973. Each will
displace 420,000 dead-weight tons and be oriented toward
freight. Resultant traffic will develop as follows:
- for ferry No. 3 - traffic growth of 189,000 tons;
new traffic of 231,000 tons.
- for ferry No. 4 - traffic growth of 225,000 tons;
new traffic of 195,000 tons.
The estimates in both cases include additional container traffic between
the islands.
(b) Containerization: Container traffic: (i) between New
Zealand and the east coast ports of North America will
commence in October 1972; (ii) between New Zealand
and the United Kingdom will commence in October 1973.
(c) New Plant Capacity: Additional pulp processing capacity
installed at Kawerau and Kinleith in 1973 will generate
a 20% increase in traffic, i.e., 110,000 tons and 18
million NTM's.
(d) Network Improvement: The Kaimai tunnel will be completed
by March 1973, reducing the rail distance from Frankton to
Tauranga by 40 miles. The deviation will result in
a net decrease of 10 million NTM's after 1972, composed
of traffic presently carried on a longer route in antici-
pation of the tunnel's completion, offset to some extent
by traffic gained from trucking.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
2.   Specific Assumptions Regarding Commodities
(a) Meat, Wool, Dairy Products, Fats and Tallow
(i)  Effects of Containerization:  Carriage of each of these
commodities will increase in terms of net ton-miles
(not tons) given a reduction in the number of ports
handling traffic and a change in traffic flows. The
following table presents estimates of additional ton-
miles generated for the year ending 1976 taking into
account the impact of both the North American and
United Kingdom container trade:
Effects of Containerization: Year Ending May 1976
Type of Container/Commodity                       Millions of NTM's
Import Container                                    52.7
Export Container                                    82.6
Total                                         135.3
Export Traffic includes:
Meat                                                43.5
Wool                                                19.1
Butter, Cheese                                       7.2
Dairy Byproducts                                     8.3
Fat, Tallow                                          2.1
Other Commodities                                    2.4
Source: New Zealand Railways
(ii) Other Effects: Abstracting from the influence of con-
tainerization, traffic in all of the above goods except
meat will experience either decline or very slow growth.
In the case of meat, apart from 1970/71 when a decrease is fore-
cast because of drought conditions, an annual increase of 4% is expected.
This estimate conforms to the growth forecast of the National Development
Council. It is also based upon the following assumptions:
- maintenance of Government incentives to change from
dairying to dairy/beef and beef production.
- growth in present Japanese and USA markets.
- future development of markets in South East Asia.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(b) Coal. The coal commodity group has been divided into
five segments for forecasting purposes:
(i)  Coal, West Coast South Island -- coal on short haul
to port for shipment which will continue to decline;
(ii) Coal, East Otira -- long haul coal from the West
coast of the South Island which will continue to
decline as industry converts to other fuels;
(iii) Coal, Not Otherwise Specified -- coal traffic from
other mines such as Wairio, Kaitangata, Huntly, Ohura
for domestic and industrial use within a radius of
150 miles which will continue to fall for the reasons
outlined in (ii) above;
(iv) Coal, Mission Bush -- coal shipments from the Huntly
area to the New Zealand steel mill at Mission Bush
are expected to increase as the mill, opened in 1969,
approaches capacity in 1971; and
(v)  Coal, Meremere -- The power station at Meremere will
continue to be a source of demand for coal from Huntly
whenever there is a shortage of energy from hydroelec-
tric sources. The forecast considers that Meremere
coal will be increasingly required until the New
Plymouth Power Station is completed.
The aggregate forecast for coal calls for a slight increase in NTM's for
1971 due to reduced capacity at Mission Bush -- then a steady decline,
some 15% over the six-year period, as the other factors outlined above
come into play.
(c) Timber, Logs: Ton-mile forecasts are largely based upon
probable developments in the Bay of Plenty area. A near
zero rate of growth is anticipated mainly because of the
trend toward carriage of timber products rather than raw
timber. Estimates shown allow for completion of the Kaimai
Tunnel in 1973. An assumption has been made that timber
and log traffic in the rest of the country will follow
National Development Council forecasts.
(d) Pulp Products: Carriage of pulp products is forecast up
31% over the six-year period for two major reasons:
(i) A 20% increase in pulp capacity as new equipment is
brought into operation at Kinleith and Kawerau during
1973. Production at these locations will be aimed



ANNEX 4
Page 4
at export markets, particularly Australia. The
average length of haul of this traffic will decrease
upon the opening of the Kaimai Tunnel.
(ii) The continuance of a general trend away from logs
and timber towards pulp and finished wood products
for export.
(e) Petroleum: An increase of 27% is anticipated as national
demand for petroleum products continues to rise. This rate
of growth in rail carriage is somewhat below national oil
consumption forecasts because the major growth centers are,
and will continue to be, served by company-owned coasters
emanating from the refinery at Whangarei. Further discover-
ies of natural gas could reduce the annual rate of growth
for petroleum slightly. Increasing overall demand for clean
fuels, however, will minimize this impact.
(f) Other Goods
(i) Bulk tonnage. The forecasts show increases in both
tonnage and average length of haul. Three major
influences will continue to buttress this growth:
- the overall attractiveness and flexibility of the
service to the user will increase demand as the
economy expands.
- increase in ferry capacity for inter-island trans-
port will cause internal movement to increase at
an increasing rate as plant locations are rational-
ized.
- the major segment of traffic growth will occur on
routes between major centers serviced by bulk ton-
nage operators which are some distance apart, i.e.,
on routes between:
Auckland - Wellington               (426 miles)
Auckland - Christchurch             (644 miles)
Wellington - Christchurch           (218 miles)
Wellington - Dunedin                (448 miles)

B.   Supplementary Freight Traffic Forecasts Based Upon Sensitivity Analysis:
The sensitivity of the primary traffic forecast to changes in
major assumptions has been tested in some detail by Railways officials.
The following supplementary forecasts outline possible developments should
restrictions on road transport be eased or removed entirely. The analysis
is divided into two actions: (1) forecasts which do not assume total
relaxation of restrictions and (2) forecasts which do assume total relaxa-
tion.
1.   Forecasts which do not Assume Total Relaxation of Restrictions
on Road Transport
The Railways believe that it is unlikely that all restrictions
on road transport would be relaxed simultaneously. Further libeialization
would probably be implemented via one of two possible strategies, either
through:
Hypothesis A: relaxation by mileage limits on an across-the-
board commodity basis.
or
Hypothesis B: removal of restrictions of specific commodities.
(a) Assumptions underlying Hypotheses A and B: The following
assumptions underlie the strategies and the forecasts
developed from them.
(i) Hypothesis A - Alteration in mileage limits:
- institution of 50-mile limit by April 1971.
- institution of 60-mile limit by April 1973.
(ii) Hypothesis B - Alteration of commodity limits:
- complete removal of restrictions on grain, root
crops, fruit and vegetables by April 1971.
- complete removal of restrictions on wool, arti-
ficial manures and agricultural lime by April 1973.
(b) Forecasts Developed from Liberalization of Hypotheses A and B
Table 8 compares the forecasts derived from Hypotheses A and
B with the primary forecast in terms of tonnage, net ton-miles,
revenues and rates per ton-mile.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
The losses, should Hypothesis B be implemented, are initially
less than the losses under Hypothesis A but become more
severe as restrictions on other farm traffic, particularly
artificial fertilizers, are lifted.
The impact on revenue and tonnage of Hypothesis A would be
to reduce total freight revenue by NZ$2,336,000 in 1975/76
and the tonnage by 774,000 tons. This is less of an impact
than Hypothesis B which would reduce revenues by NZ$ 3,056,000
and tonnage by 871,000 tons in the same year.
These losses could be reduced by better marketing aimed
at a selective approach to traffic retention. Efforts
could be made to retain flows which are profitable and to
discard those which are more efficiently conveyed by other
modes of transport. Savings would also accrue from a
reduction in the stock of wagons as much of the tonnage
removed is highly seasonal in nature.
The effects of deregulation as embodied in these strategies
would be more severe in the South Island than the North
Island as 70% of the grain traffic, 33% of the wool traffic
and 30% of the artificial fertilizer traffic originate in
the south.
2.   Forecasts which do Assume Total Relaxation of Restrictions on
Road Transport
The Railways have also undertaken a complete analysis of the
vulnerability of their traffic to road competition should all restrictions
on the latter mode be dropped. The sensitivity of each main category of
traffic weighted for tonnage was tested separately over six discrete
mileage intervals: from 1-40 miles, 41-60 miles, 61-80 miles, 81-100
miles, 101-210 and over 210 miles. The following estimates of potential
traffic losses to road by commodity were calculated for the years 1970/71
and 1971/72.

This analysis, when aggregated for total freight traffic, yielded the
following results:
For 1970/71:
total tonnage loss:          14% or 1,680,000 tons
total NTM loss:              17% or 293,000,000 NTM's
total revenue loss:          17X or NZ$ 13,300,000
For 1971/72:
total tonnage loss:          15% or 1,840,000 tons
total NTM loss:              17% or 306,170,000 NTM's
total revenue loss:          17% or NZ$ 13,900,000
These results represent most pessimistic estimates. They take
into account volumes of traffic that would probably shift to road if the
Railways did nothing to offset the total relaxation of regulatory constraints.

ANNEX 5

NEW ZEALAND RAILWAYS
Items Included in the Project
1.        The total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated
at US$47.8 million. Table 12 gives a complete breakdown of the costs of
individual investments as well as the proportion represented by each in
the total Project. The following paragraphs describe the nature of these
investments more fully.
2.        Freight and Passenger Cars.  The largest item in the Project,
amounting to about 33% of the total cost, is the procurement of 2,010
freight cars of various types, mainly as a replacement of outdated stock,
uneconomical to keep in service. The new cars will be of greater loading
capacity and will include 670 bogie flats for the growing container traffic.
About half of the freight cars as well as the ballast cars would be imported
knocked down, but complete and ready to erect. The other half, consisting
of wagons simpler to build, would be manufactured in the Railways' workshop,
with imported components amounting to about one-third of the total cost. The
passenger cars to be procured consist mainly of a new set of railcars for the
express service between Wellington and Auckland.  No expenditure is envisaged
for suburban traffic.
3.        Locomotives.  With the complete elimination of steam, nine diesel
shunters are needed for operation in stations, yards and private sidings.
Of the present fleet five 1425 HP locomotives are to be modified for low-
speed operation in a new marshalling yard and 10 old light-weight locomotives,
expensive to maintain, are to be scrapped in 1973 after the opening of the
Kaimai deviation. The 15 new 2500 HP locomotives (already ordered) could
handle the heaviest trains, now operated with two 1425 HP locomotives, thereby
reducing operating costs.
4.        Cook Strait Ferry.  A third and a fourth ferry have been ordered to
supplement the Aramoana and the Aranui presently in service and whose capacity
is not sufficient to meet the traffic demand. They will have much greater
capacity than the present ships for the conveyance of rail and road vehicles.
The third ferry will carry only a limited number of passengers while the
fourth will be exclusively for freight.
5.        Mechanical Handling and Workshop Equipment.  Three transtainer
cranes will be installed, two in Wellington and one in Auckland, the two
ports where most of the container traffic is to be concentrated. Other
cranes, gantries and lift-trucks will be procured to deal with containers
at various locations in the network.  The workshop equipment consists of
wheel lathes to replace outdated machines and plant equipment for the diesel
workshops. Mechanical track maintenance machinery is also included under
this heading to replace manual work and help solve the labor shortage problem.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        Permanent Way.  As in all railways, this item is important, and
represents about 12% of the Project. It comprises the capitalized portion
of main line track improvements and realignments, bridge renewal and
strengthening as well as some construction and housing improvement for
permanent way personnel in remote areas.
7.        Stations and Yards.  In connection with a second berth for the
additional rail ferries, to be built in Picton, a yard rearrangement is
scheduled which shall provide additional operating sidlngs in order to in-
crease the wagon reservoir and to allow the closing of some nearby stations.
Facilities for inspection, cleaning and servicing for express trains as well
as passenger terminals are to be provided in Wellington and Auckland. In
Auckland, a new yard development is to replace several small yards in the
metropolitan area and make valuable land available for sale.
8.        Workshop Buildings.  Civil work for the workshops consists of new
sheds and improvements of existing buildings, following the change from steam
to diesel traction. About NZ$ 1.2 million witlh no foreign exchange is re-
quired during the project period for this purpose.
9.        Tunnel Clearance and New Tracks.  A program of tunnel clearance im-
provement is under way and most of the tunnels on the North Island are already
prepared for container traffic. Also provided under this heading are small
amounts for studies for the proposed Rotorua-Paengaroa line.
10.       Signalling.  Improvements in the existing signalling system are to
be provided related to increasing traffic, and CTC is to be installed on some
lines where the savings justify the initial cost.
11.       Road Vehicles.  Regular replacement of vehicles for the road serv-
ices amounts to NZ$ 1.0 to 1.3 million annually. No foreign exchange is in-
volved in this continuing program.

NEW ZEALAND RAILWAYS
Items to be Financed by the Proposed Loan
1.        As shown in Table 12, the total foreign exchange cost of the
Project is estimated at US$47.8 million, of which US$16 million or about
33% would be financed by the proposed loan. The individual costs of the
Bank financed items are shown in Table 13. About 86% of the loan would
be used for the procurement of 1,100 freight cars and 100 ballest cars import-
ed in knocked down condition and of imported parts for 610 freight cars to
be manufactured in the Railways workshops. For the latter wagons, the imported
parts (castings, roller bearings, brake equipment, etc.) represent about
one-third of the final cost. Other items to be financed by the proposed
loan are two wheel lathes, one ballast cleaner and signalling equipment for
two lines totalling 48 miles.
2.        Freight Cars for Pulp Paper and Newsprint.  The load factor
of the existing wagons used for transporting these products is not
satisfactory. The present average loading is slightly over 9 tons (maximum
load 15 tons). The major obstacle to higher average loadings is the width
of the wagons and the height of the sides. By increasing the width from
7 ft. 7-1/2 in. to 8 ft. and the height of the sides from 3 ft. 8 in. to
4 ft. 6 in., the average payload would increase to about 12.5 tons for the
4-wheelers and 25 tons for the bogie wagons. In determining the number of
4-wheeled and bogie wagons required, it must be noted that about 60% of
consignees receiving pulp products order in 12-ton lots and the requirement
must continue to be catered for in this form.
3.        The proposed procurement is thus for 600 Lpa 4-wheelers and for
200 Rpa bogie wagons of respectively 12.5- and 25-ton capacity, actual
loading. The total capacity would then be 12,500 tons and, with an average
turn-around of 7 days, a total of 460,000 tons could be transported. The
1970 tonnage of "Products of NZ Pulp Mills" was 586,551 tons and a 42%
increase in production is scheduled for 1974 which means that the new
wagons alone would not be enough to carry the load and that a portion of
the present wagons shall remain in use for this traffic.
4.        Freight Cars for Import/Export Containers.  Very close collabor-
ation has been maintained by the Railways with the various shipping lines,
and latest figures indicate a total of 135.3 million net ton-miles. With
an average length of haul of 135 miles and a turn-around time of 7 days,
the corresponding fleet capacity needed is about 26,900 tons or 670 wagons
of 40-ton capacity. As the traffic is already scheduled to start in 1971
it is proposed to import 300 wagons completely knocked down while the other
370 would be built in the Railways workshops with some imported parts. The
proposed loan would finance the 300 imported wagons and imported components
for 170 locally-built wagons. Construction of the remaining 200 locally-
built wagons is already under way.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        The wagonis would have a maximum load of 42.5 toIIs and would be
capable of carrying one 40 ft. or two 20 ft. containers, 8 ft. or 8 ft.
6 in. high, some fitted with clip-oii refrigerator units.  The provision of a
central deck 12 ft. long will permit the 20 ft. containers to be loaded
without removal from the wagon, thus eliminating the need for expensive
transfer equipment. All this loading represents new traffic for flat
top wagons and is beyond the capacitv of the present fleet whicih is fully
employed in the conveyance of timber, pulp, steel and other commodities.
6.        Additional Wagons for Steel Products.  In May, 1968, the construc-
tion of 150 Us wagons to meet, in the main, requirements of NZ Steel Com-
pany was approved. However as construction commenced, unforeseen demands
for additional transport of export logs and containers for bulk tonnage
operators necessitated the conversion of 133 of these wagons. Authority
for 50 further Us wagons was then obtained and 13 of these have already
been converted to Usk for bulk tonnage operators container traffic. Thus
out of a total of 200 wagons ordered, 146 have been diverted to special
classes and there is an urgent need for additional Us wagons to cater for
NZ Steel Company's traffic which is increasing with forecast demand. Con-
sequently it is proposed to start a program of 400 Us wagons, to be built
in the railways workshops with foreign components to be financed by the
proposed loan.
7.        Additional Bogie Flats.  Smaller amounts have been included for
the procurement of imported parts for the manufacture of 40 bogie flats.
Twenty will be of the Usl type and are required to supplement the 188 log
wagons of various classes already in service to cope with forecasts of
timber trade expansion. The other 20 will be of the Usk type in addition
to thie present 58 similar wagons and are required when the third Cook
Strait ferry enters service for bull tonnage operators.
8.        Ballast Cars.  The present stock of NZR's specialized ballast cars
consists of only 26 units, which is insufficient for a network of this size.
Ballast is frequently transported on ordinary freight cars needed fcr general
traffic and unnecessary manpower is required for regulating unevenly spread
ballast.  Spreading ballast evenly on tile track is achieved only with hopper
cars provided with adequate discharge doors in the center and on the side.
The 100 hopper cars to be procured would be imported complete, but in knocked
down condition and assembled in NZR's workshops.
9.        Wheel Lathes.  TWo wheel lathes are to be procured, one for
Hillside (Dunedin) and one for Christchurch. The Hiillside lathe is to
replace an obsolete "London" machine purchased in 1926 for the steam depot
and not economical for turning diesel locomotives tires while the other
is to be an underfloor wheel lathe, for the re-profiling of tires and thus
avoiding the unnecessary stopping of locomotives, freight cars, railcars
and electric multiple units for bogie changes. Experience with a similar
machine at the Wellington depot has shown that the tires on a diesel
locomotive can be skimmed and the locomotive returned to service after
about 40 manhours of work, compared with approximately 600 manhours of



ANNEX 6
Page 3
work involved in a normal bogie exchange. The Wellington lathe can capably
handle the skimming for all North Island vehicles and the new one to be
installed at Christchurch will perform the same job on all South Island
vehicles.
10.       One Ballast Cleaner.  This machine is intended to work on
Sundays only, when full track occupation can be provided during 10 hours.
The savings in manhours are such that, even with this limited use, they
represent about 150% of the total annual cost of the machine, assumed to
be depreciated in only five years.
11.       Signalling.  The last item proposed for Bank financing consists
of providing CTC on two branches, Waiuku (12 miles) and Murupara (36 miles),
where there is no signalling of any kind at present. The traffic on the
Waiuku branch consists of heavy loads to and from NZ Steel Company in
Mission Bush and it is essential that the trains pass through Paerata as
quickly as possible to minimize delays to main line trains in this increas-
ingly busy area. Traffic forecasts by Tasman Pulp and Paper Company show
an increasing consumption of logs from Murupara and an increasing trade in
export logs through Mount Maunganui, at a level where signalling hes to be
provided.
12.       Tablet machines are no longer manufactured and the modern trend
gives option of CTC at a cost of about NZ$ 8,500 per mile or of single
line automatic signalling at a cost of about NZ$ 6,800 per mile or 20%
cheaper. Due to the savings in manpower, housing and intermediate stations
inherent to the CTC operation, the additional initial investment is justi-
fied under New Zealand conditions.

ANNEX 7
NEW ZEALAND RAILWAYS
Principal Assumptions - Financial Forecasts
The financial forecasts are based on the following principal
assumptions:
1.   The primary freight traffic forecast (para. 3.14);
2.   The passenger traffic forecast (para. 3.16);
3.   Freight rate adjustment of 12% on a selective basis and increase
of 10% in passenger fares as of February 15, 1971;
4.   Increase of 10% in freight rates and fares as of October 1, 1971;
selective increases in freight rates as of April 1, 1975;
5.   Increases in wages and salaries in 1970/71 in addition to those
already granted in this year amounting to a total of NZ$ 9.7 million
in 1970/71 and in 1971/72 on a full year basis, to NZ$ 13.4 million;
6.   Otherwise, constant 1970/71 rates and prices of railway goods
and services, and that to the extent such prices rise in
excess of those referred to in item 5 preceding, rates and
fares, to compensate, will be adjusted upward, to the extent
the higher costs cannot be offset by lower expenses or greater
traffic, than included in the forecasts; and
7.   Government to provide the foreign exchange needed in excess
of that to be provided by the proposed Bank loan.
