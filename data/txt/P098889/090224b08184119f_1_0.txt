                         component that led to substantial progress in cotton farm debt resolution, and agrarian reform discussion. Freedom to farm is now a reality as confirmed by the farmers interviewed

                         during the recent supervision mission. Under the Post Harvest Financing sub-component, subsidiary loans worth USD 10.4 million (100% of available funding) were disbursed
                         through two local participating financial institutions (PFIs) to eleven ginneries in August-September 2011 for seed cotton purchases from farmers in the 2011-2012 season, including
                         the five million USD from the roll-over account of the 2010-2011 cotton season. Also, following the successful implementation of the cotton post-harvest financing scheme in the first
                         two years since project restructuring, the PFIs have started using the roll-over funds to finance other eligible activities, such as production of cotton, potatoes, grains, livestock,

                         poultry, food processing, etc. The Producer Support sub-component has also made significant progress with four training information centres (TIC) established, registered as legal
                         entities under the authority of the local khutumats, and operational. In combination with the demonstration plots, the TICs have provided much needed training to farmers.

                         Despite lower international cotton prices in the current marketing year compared with 2010-2011, the average seed cotton price paid to farmers actually increased from USD 701 per
                         one ton in 2010-2011 to USD 775 per one ton in 2011-2012 (+11%). This was largely due to increased competition amongst participating ginneries and their anticipation of higher
                         international cotton prices later in the 2011-2012 marketing year. However, the later expectations of higher world market prices did not materialize causing significant difficulties with
                         loan repayments in the current year.
