                         discussion. Freedom to farm is now a reality as confirmed by the farmers interviewed during the recent supervision mission.

                         With support of the project a high-level Working Group on Agricultural Reform of Government and Development Partner experts was created to help design a comprehensive
                         agriculture reform strategy, notably in: (i) water and irrigation, (ii) land reform, (iii) new mechanisms for agricultural financing, (iv) rural social development, (v) local government

                         reform, and (vi) cotton debt write-off. This has led to the acceptance of the need for “freedom to farm? as a further building block for cotton sector reform, and reduction of local
                         government intervention in farmer decisions, has been advanced as a result of project activity along with Land Registration and Cadastral System Project also financed by the Bank.
                         The farmers’ debt write-off is also a considerable progress and constitutes a critical step forward in the development of a more diverse and balanced agriculture sector.

                         The post-harvest financing scheme provided an alternative to government funded credit lines and facilitated government agreement to phase out this publicly funded source of
                         agricultural credit. Previously, ginneries would not have to be open about their pricing as they were tied to the financing provided by cotton fiber exporters. Under this sub-
                         component, subsidiary loans worth USD 10.4 million (100% of available funding) were disbursed through two local participating financial institutions (PFIs) to eleven ginneries in
                         August-September 2011 for seed cotton purchases from farmers in the 2011-2012 season, including the five million USD from the roll-over account of the 2010-2011 cotton season.
                         The loan repayment is 100%. In 2011-2012 season about 13,400 tons of seed cotton was purchased against 7,000 tons in 2010-2011, the first year of implementation of the financing
                         scheme. Also, following the successful implementation of the cotton post-harvest financing scheme in the first two years since project restructuring, the PFIs have started using the
                         roll-over funds to finance other eligible activities, such as production of cotton, potatoes, grains, livestock, poultry, food processing, etc.

                         Despite lower international cotton prices in the recent marketing year compared with 2010-2011, the average seed cotton price paid to farmers actually increased from USD 701 per
                         one ton in 2010-2011 to USD 775 per one ton in 2011-2012 (+11%). This was largely due to increased competition amongst participating ginneries and their anticipation of higher
                         international cotton prices later in the 2011-2012 marketing year.

                         The Producer Support sub-component has also made significant progress with four training information centers (TIC) established, registered as legal entities under the authority of
                         the local khukumats, and operational. In combination with the demonstration plots, the TICs have provided much needed training to farmers. Starting from January I, 2013 the TIC
                         operate independently and are self-financing organizations. The PMU supported TICs in obtaining specific license from the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Tajikistan, to
                         authorize them to provide trainings and give certifications to tractor operators, agronomists and accountants with professional computer user skills. In total, the TICs have been able
                         to accumulate about 40,000 TJS in the last 7 months.
