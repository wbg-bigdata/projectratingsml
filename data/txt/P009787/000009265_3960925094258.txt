PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TNDIA
ANDHRA PRADESH AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
fCr. 1219-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Andhra Pradesh
Agricultural Extension Project for which Credit 1219-IN in the amount of SDR
5.3 (US$6.0 M) was approved on March 30, 1982. The Credit was closed on March
31, 1989, one year behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on October 3, 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Asia Division, New Delhi Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision
mission of the project in July 1989 and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and th( borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Extension Project
(Cr. 1219-TN)
Evaluation Summary
This project was designed to achieve early and sustained increases in
;ricultural production throughout Andhra Pradesh through reorganization and
:rengthening of the extension services of DOA. It aimed at systematic
t-ovision of useful advice on farming practices through programmed village
Lsits from regularly trained field staff operating under a unitary extension
~rvice and with continuous iupport of the research system.
nplemfentat ion Experience
To achieve the goals, the project made available a Credit of SDR 5.3
:.llion to provide mobility, housing, training, incremental staff and
?ei-ating funds for the field extension services and monitoring and evaluation
sit. Except on "training", there were slippages in impleme tation in all the
ijor components: staff, housing and mobility. Of these, the variation was
ie highest in positioning of VEWs: only 3869 as against 6776 originally
Lanned for could be positioned during the project. (Details at Table 4.)
With the above limitations, the project designed organisational
:ructure, end a training and visit oriented extension system with active
apport of tha research system, were fully established. This project in its
arly phase had a set back from inadequate budgetry support, rapid turnover
i senior managers and temporary disruption in field supervision due to
cansfer of extension officers to the control of mandals (Panchayati Raj
"ustitutions); necessitating extension of the project by twelve months.
The Bank and GOI/MOA missions assisted the GOAP to focus attention on
ay implementation issues and establish a professional extension service.
aspite poor start up and administrative problems which persisted, GOAP
:ilized in full the credit of SDR 5.3 million.
The project has enabled GOAP to establish a single line extension
.rvice with functional linkages with the agricultural research system,
-riodic training to field staff, placement of SMSs at field level, regular
:llage visits and closer contact with farmers. Consequently, farmers are
?preciative of the extension services and significant production gains have
Bsulted. Rice yields have increased during the project to a level which
.bstantially exceeds that required to obtain a 50% ERR if that increase could
B attributed to the project; it is not possible, however, to directly link
"is productive response to the extension service. There has been no
=gnificant change in the jowar (sorghum) yields. Input use hias increased



- iv -
substantially during the project (Details at Tables 6A and 6B.)
Developmental changes are prominent in areas under irrigation. On
rainfed agriculture, the impact is not that perceptible. Besides, serious
regional imbalances in growth also exist. GOAP in future will need to focus
on rainfed agriculture, horticulture, tree farming, fodder devleopment, issues
on natural resources conservation, human resources development, planning and
agricultural management.
Sustainability
4.    Timely and adequate budget support and continued commitment to provide
integrated research based extension service to the farmers are critical for
sustainability. Anticipated risks on weakening of the established structure
could be avoided by broad-basing the extension approach and the increased
accountability to local institutions. Development of a farmer-paid field
extension service also deser_ves serious consideration.
Findings and Lessons Learnt
5.    Overall project goals have been  attained despite certain field staffing
inadequacies. The Credit of SDR 5.3 million has been fully utilized with a
project extension of 12 months and cost overruns largely due to inadequate
management.  The following lessons may be learnt from this project, one which
attempted to bring about organisational and process changes:
a.    deployment of staff, if critical, must be a precondition;
b.    appraisal should address sustainability issues; and
c.    a capacity and willingness to undertake a mid-course review and
correction is a must for effective project implementation.

PROJECT COMPLETION r2PoRT
Part I: Project Review from Bank's Perspective
1.    Project Identity:
Name:             Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Extension Project
Credit Number:    1219-IN
Credit Amount:    SDRs 5.3 million/US$6.0 million
Board Approval:   March 30, 1982
RVP Unit:         AS4
Country:          India
Sector:           Agriculture
2.    Background
2.01        Government of India's developmental plans consistently assign
priority to alleviating poverty and creating employment in rural areas.
Agriculture is the dominant sector in Indian economy; it engages 70% of the
labor force and contributes about 40% of the G.N.P. Establishment of an
efficient extension service to promote faster spread of improved farm
technologies is one of the planks chosen by the national government for
development of agriculture and rural economy.
2.02        State governments have direct responsibility for agricultural
extension.  The most important sector of the economy of Andhra Pradesh, the
fifth most populous state in the Indian Union, is agriculture. Rice and Jowar
are the major crops of the state; Andhra Pradesh is one of the important
cont-lbutors to the national food reserves. Besides, a wide range of
commercial crops are also cultivated.   Before this project the extension
services of the state were organised orn conventional lines: parallel
extension set up for various commodity crops; diffused multiple lines of
control; inadequate research support; and multiprupose field functionaries
with responsibilities for non-extension activities as well.
2.03        The Government of Andhra Pradesh first introduced the re-organized
extension system in the command areas of the four irrigation projects covered
by the Andhra Pradesh Composite Irrigatioa Project (Ln 1251-IN). IDA approved
a credit of US$6.0 Million for the Andh::a Pradesh Agricutural Extension
Project, in March 1982 to overcome the weaknesses noticed in the command area
project and establish re-organized extension system on the T&V model in the
whole state of Andhra Pradesh.

3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.01        Project Objectives:  The project was designed to achieve early and
sustained increases in agricultural production throughout the 22 districts of
Andhra Pradesh through the reorganization and strengthening of the extersion
services of DOA. Specifically it aimed at providing farmers on a regular and
systematic basis with up-to-date advice on farming practices best suited to
their specific conditions and capable of having an immediate impact on
production and income. The method chosen was programmed visits from regularly
trained field staff under unitary control supported by professional advice of
the research system.
3.02        Proiect Components: The project supported:
a.    provision of transportation (16 cars, 65 4-WD vehicles, 874
motorcycles, and 7000 bicycles), office equipment and audio
visual aids;
b.    provision of incremental operating funds, travel allowances,
vehicle operating costs, and extension materials;
c.    construction of housing for extension workers and hostel
accommodation at training centres;
d.    provision of funds for training of extension staff at
different levels;
e.    provision of incremental staff and incremental salaries to
upgrade 1000 posts of VEWs; and
f.    creation of a monitoring and evaluation capacity through
provision of staff, transportation and operating expenses.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        The project was designed on a very well tested logical conceptual
frame: unified extension service, one village extension worker for about 800
farm families, regular pre-scheduled visits with specific timely messages,
close supervision and guidance by an agricultural graduate extension officer,
support provided by field subject matter specialists, fortnightly field
oriented training and monthly workshops with the research system. To
operationalise the chosen extension system adequate funds were provided to
establish single line of control with strong linkages with the research
system, train staff regularly on latest technologies, establish organizational
structure and procedures for project M&E Unit, and for housing, mobility and
teaching aids. The GOI and GOAP clearly shared and understood the project
concept, aims and approacnes.
4.02        The project was thoroughly prepared with due consultations with
the GOI/GOAP/ SAU officials. The roles and responsibilities, the linkages
critical for success and methods of field operation were clearly articulated,



3
discussed and finalised.  The project attempted to fulfill the national and
state requireme.ts for technology transfer at the farm level.
4.03        In retrospcct, one could vouchsafe that the project design and
organization has vastly improved the technology delivery capability of the DOA
through establishment of a professional extension service with a sound
structure, training and mobility, with appropriate linkages with the research
system and a closer contact with the farmers. In this process, the project,
perhaps in it's anxiety to establish a cost eff-activa unitary extension
service, accommodated staffing of incremental VEWs through deployment from
Panchayati Raj/CADA departments and upgradation of DOA lower level field
staff. This decision, unfortunately, resulted in serious inadequacy in field
level staffing and positioning of poorly qualified persons as VEWs and
affected adversley the output of the project throughout it's cycle.
S.   PEroject Implementation
5.01        Except on 'training", there was slippage in project implementation
in all the other three major components: Equipments and vehicles, civil works
and incremental staff costs funded by this project. Of these, the variation
between the numbers of field level VEWs planned and actually positioned was
the gravest (Details at Table 4).
5.02        The project at appraisal estimated the requirement of VEWs as 6776
and agreed to draft 2421 persons from Panchayati Raj establishment and upgrade
4355 field functionaries of DOA as VEWs. But, despite governmental assurances
at appraisal and negotiations it was not possible to redeploy p rsons from
Panchayati Raj Department. After protracted negotiations over 3 years, it was
agreed by GOAP/GOI and Bank to position a reduced number of 4000 persons as
VEWs by assigning varying farm family/VEW ratio based on field requirements.
5.03        However, the state finally positioned only 3869 persons as VEWs
and these too, were niot rationally allocated among the districts according to
need. Repeated efforts to get them redeployed never succeeded till the close
of the project due to one administration hurdle or the other. Besides, during
project implementation, the extension officers were transferred to the control
of the "Mandals" (Panchayati Raj) - thus snapping the unitary line of control
insisted and agreed to at negotiations. This change though set rignt later
had in the meanwhile affected seriously project super.-ision and guidance.
5.04        This project in its early phase suffered from inadequate funding,
rapid turn over of state level managers and unstable political environment.
Personnel management problems persisted throughout the project with palliative
actions taken now and then with indifferent results. Consequently, the
closing date of the project had to be extended by 12 months.
5.05        The project at appraisal realised that transfer of multi-purpose
field workers and establishment of a single unified professional extension
service will be difficult for the government to make and maintain; but wished
it away by noting the numbers to be deployed as a small proportion (when in
fact it was 35%) and that the GOAP had given assurances. The appraisal



4
mission had also noted frequent staff changes in the upper ranks of the
government and lack of sustained informed and motivated management as yet
another major risk factor. This anticipated risk was sought to be corrected
through close supervision by the Bank.
5.06        The supervisional efforts of the Bank were regular and directed
towards improving quality of extension performance and focussed sharply on
major administrative issues. There was not a single supervision mission which
had not pointed out the inadequte staffing issue. One of the missions in
Eebruary 1984 suggested that in case the state had serious problems in
deployment of staff, the area of the project coul.d be suitably reduced so that
farmers could get better services. For some unknown reason or the other, this
was not persued.
5.07        There was no other major implementation issue.  At appraisal the
project cost was US$ 8.7 million. The final cost is US$ 10.2 million as shown
in Table SB. The project on request by GOI/GOAP, was extended by 12 months
and the entire credit of SDR 5.3 million was fully disbursed.
6.    Project Results
6.01        Project Obiectives:  Overall the project was successful in meeting
its principal objectives of reorganizing and strengthening the extension
services of DOA.  It enabled establishment of a single line extension service
with functional linkages with the research system, periodic training to field
staff. placement of subject matter specialists at field level, regular village
visits and close contact with the farmers (wherever VEWs were in position) and
an M&E unit to assess project progress and impact. Consequently, there were
significant agricultural production gains.   (Details at Table 6.)
6.02        Physical Results:   At Table 4 results of the planned physical
components is displayed. During project implementation the physical targets
on staff, civil works, and to a limited extent, on vehicles was scaled down.
Inspite of this, physical targets have not been achieved though the credit has
been utilized in full indicative of cost overrun, that too mainly on staff
salaries.
6.03        Financial Performance:  Against a credit estimate of US$6.0
million at appraisal, the actual disbursement at close of project was US$ 6.4
million due to SDR/Dollar exchange rate variations. Credit disbursement which
was poor in the initial years picked up some ..,omentum later but remained
static throughout 1986, 1987 and first half of 1988 and ended in a spurt at
the time of credit closure. (Details are at Table 3 and 3A). Thus the credit
though utilized in full has not been judiciously spread out reflecting
inadequate financial support and management.
6.04        Economic rate of return:  Attributing a precise level of benefits
to an extension project is rather difficult since crop production and
productivity result from interaction of innumerable physical, biological and
socio-economic factors. However, the appraisal mission justified the project
on the grounds that ERR would be 50% in case the yields of the two of the



5
major crops, rice and jowar, went up by 6 and 2 kgs/ha respectively. During
the project, rice yields have increased to a level which substax.tially exceeds
that required to obtain a 50% ERR if that increase could be attributed to the
project; it is not possible, however, to directly link this productive
response to the extension service. There has been no significan_ change in the
jowar (sorghum) yields. (Details are at Table 6A and 6B).
6.05        Project Impact:  The farmers are quite appreciative of the
regularity of visits of the extension services and the technical assistance
provided by them. Use of inputs has increased consie½rably. Despite adverse
seasonal conditions, there is stability in production. The technical
knowledge and skills of the extension service has improved conspicuously.
Healthy linkages with the research system has been established. There is
systematic field testing of technologies to select appropriate solutions to
field problems. Consequently the efficiency of the technology delivery
competence of the extension service hds vastly improved.
6.06        The developmental changes are prominent in irrigated farming
situations; rainfed agriculture is yet to transform. Due to poor staff
deployment serious regional imbalances in provision of extension service
exists. The major focus of research/extension systems has continuously been
on rice and other irrigated crops. Horticulture, tree farming, fodder
development and issues on natural resources conservation inclusive of soil
moisture conservation have not received adequate attention. Planning and
management of agricultural programs are yet to attain desirable professinnal
standards. Data base continues to be weak. GOAP will need to focus attention
on all these issues and make sustained efforts to improve the quality of
extension performance to make a better impact on the socio-economic
environment.
7.0   Project Sustainability
7.01        To consolidate the project gains and improve upon it, timely and
adequate budgetry support is critical. Besides, attention needs to be
bestowed on continuous human resource development, broad basing of extension
with an eye on cost effectiveness and provision of integrated services to the
farmers, high quality research support, close coordination with other support
systems, and improved planning and management methods. Above all a firm and
continued commitment to provide extension service through a single line agency
is vital.
7.02        Risks:  The present extension approach is staff intensive.  With
ever increasing salary scales, the state may have problems funding a large
extension organisation. GOAP has been supporting extension adequately and it
is hoped that it will continue to do so. The demand by the local bodies for
the transfer of the services of the agricultural field workers to their
control even now is great; it is likely to increase in the future and thereby
disrupt extension's single line of control. In an attemnpt to make the
services cost effect4.ve, non-extension, input oriented activities may also be
entrusted. Such moves could be averted by making extension cost effective by
assignment of all land based agriculture related extension activities,



6
increasing the accountability of extension to local bodies without losing
direct administrative control, and exploring continuously, establishment of
farmer paid field extension services at least on a pilot scale.
8.0   Bank Performance
8.01        The Bank  has assisted the GOI/GOAP to establish a reformed
extension service critical for rapid development of agriculture which is a
national priority. The performance of the Bank has been satisfactory. The
project preparation and appraisal have been completed within a reasonable time
with substantial support from the regional office. Supervision missions have
assisted the project management to improve it's performance and consistently
focussed attention on key implementation issues.
8.02    Lessons Learnt:  In retrospect, the following lessons may be learnt
from this project, a credit support for organizational structure and process
changes:
a.    deployment of staff must be a precondition;
b.    project appraisal should review critically issues on project
sustainability; and
c.    a capacity and willingness to undertake a mid-course review
and correction is a must for effective project
implementation.
9.0   Borrower Performance
9.1         The GOAP was genuinely interested in the project and fully
participated in preparation, appraisal and implementation. However, changes
in political environment, quick turnover of top level managers, and
established governmental personnel policies hampered positioning of adequate
number of field functionaries and the project had to go through with ad hoc
adjustments on staff issues. Inadequate budget support in the initial years
was yet another hinderance leading to time and cost overrun. With a better
commitment these costly lapses perhaps, could have been avoided.
10.0 Project Relationship
10.01       Bank relationship with GOI/GOAP on the project has been good.
11.0  Consulting jervices
11.01        For the project there was no special provision for consulting
services. Implementation assistance was provided by the DOE of GOI and to a
limited extent by the Bank supervision missions. To enable the DOE to provide
such support to the states on a continuous basis, the Bank has strengthened
the DOE through NAEP I (Cr. 1523-IN).



7
12.0 Project Documentation and Data
12.01       The legal agreements for this project was quite adequate and
appropriate for achieving the project objectives. The appraisal report
provided a useful framework for the Bank as well as GOI/GOAP for project
implementation and review. Introduction of M&E concept as part of the project
has influenced the DOA to build a better data base and criticlly examine
developmental issues based on facts.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II - REVIl3W FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE*
1.INTRODUCTION
1.01    The T & V system was introduced in India at the instances
of the World Bank in mid 70's. It came initially as a part of the
package which the World Bank recommended while extending loan
assistance to Irrigation Projects eg., (Srirama Sagar Project,
Nagarjuna Sagar Project and Chambal Project of Nadhya Pradesh, and
Rajasthan Canal Project etc.,). With the experience gained in the
working of the system in selected areas, over the years, efforts
have been made to introduce the system in the entire State. Till
1982 the T & V system was introduced in 12 States.
1.02 Experience of T & V in Andhra Pradesh
The T & V system was first introduced in Andhra Pradesh in
1976-77 as a part of the World Bank Composite Project for
irrigation and CAD (Loan IN 1251). The T & V system u nder this
scheme was to be introduced in the four selected commands of
Sriram Sagar, Nagarjuna Sagar Project (Left Canal); Nagarjuna
Sagar Project (Right Canal) and Tungabhadra. The World Bank was
not to extend any loan assistance for the T & V component.  The
total extent to be covered by the T & V system in the four select
commands was 12.60 lakh hectares.
1.03    The impact of the T & V programme in the  four select
commands was monitored by the CAD Department. The results indicate
that     sizeable increase in productivity is obtained, the World
Bank has been feeling that there were certain weaknesses and
short-comings in the implementation of the T & V system in the CAD
areas vtz: a) Poor supervision. (b) Isolation of Extension staff
fiom the rest of Agriculture Department and Research. (c) Failure
to secure release of extension workers from non-extention duties.
Ilie Andlira Pradesh Agricultural Extention Project was
formultltid to extend the system in all the districts duly removing
the weaikntsses.

Project Report   for  introducing  the T & V system.   Thie scheme
prepared by thle Director of Agriculture covering (a) training,
(b) adaptive research, (c) housing for extension staff and (d)
re-structuring agricultural administration   was estimated to cost
Rs.29.71 crores of rupees.  From 1977 till 1982 when the scheme
was  finalised  and  agreement  signed with  the World Bank,   the
scheme underwent a number of revisions mainly with the objective
of scaling down the expenditure and to fit it in within the
financial resources which were available for this purpose.
2.02    Following the initiative of the Government of India for
introducing the T & V system in as many States in the country as
possible, this subject was discussed by Sri. R.C.Sood, Additional
Secretary, Government of India with the Minister for Agriculture
and Panchayat Raj at New Delhi on 7-6-1979.  Keeping in view the
financial constraints being faced by the State Government, it was
agreed that the scheme could go through another paring process
resulting in further economies and re-phasing to fit into the
financial provisions available with the Stite Government.
2.03    Appraisal:
During  Dr.  Benor's visit  to Hyderabad  and discussions
with Secretary, Food and Agriculture, Government of Andhra Pradesh
on 4-7-1979, the cost of the scheme was brought down to Rs.6.13
crores.
2.04     Later  after  Dr.  Benor's  discussions  in  Hyderabad  on
4-10-1980, a World Bank team visited Hyderabad from 14th to 16th
October, 1980 and the Project proposals were 'again revised upwards
to Rs.16.26 crores.
2.05    In the discussions held at Hyderabad with  Secretavy,Food
and Agriculture, Government of Andhra Pradesh on 3-11-1980 by
Sri.R.C.Sood, Additional Secretary, Government of India and
Dr. Nekby of World Bank, the project cost was again brought down
to Rs.8.72 crores.
2.06    Tllis was followed by visit of thie World Bank Appraisal
Mission  in Mlay/June, 1981.  The Mission finalised a project cost
of Rs.8.11 crores including physical and price contingencies with
a base (,;L ofn Rs.6. 5 crores.
2.07    liis draft was discussed in New Delhi on 4-9-1981 with the
Governmont of India  and the World Bank and the Project cost was
finailsud  -IL  Rs.7.83 copres.   This was thle final figure .  'Ili
project  agreement  was  made  by  the  Government  of  India  and
Government of Andhra Pradesh with the World Bank in March, 1982
and cred1i signed on 5-5-1982.

3.02    During the negotiations in Washington, it was agreed that
the ProjectWas deemed to have been implemented from 1981-82 itself
and  the project was eligible for retroactive   financing with
effect from 1-1-1982. The important compotLUfILs of the scheme are:
a)Establishment  of  a  single  line  of  command  between
full-time   village   extention   workers   and   extension
head-quarters.
b)Promotion of close co-operation between agricultural
extension and research activities.
c)Carrying out of systematic training programmes as an
integral part of extension activities.
d)Application of an extension methodology based on a system
of regular und frequent farm visits  and continuous
advisory services to farmers.
e)l)volopment and implementation of regular monitoring and
evaluation procedures; and
£)I'.P vLsion of incremental staff, fellow-ships for staff
tr.lIning, housing, vehicles, equipment and materials and
provision of loans to field extension staff for purchase
.- motor-cycles and bicycles, all as required for carrying
out    the prroject.
3.03    The Government of Andhra Pradesh has complied the
following conditions before credit negotiations:
a)established the post of Addl.D.A.(Extension) filled this
position with a suitably qualified officer, and assigned



-12-
to him full-time responsibility for implementation of the
project, i.e., he would have no duties other than
day-to-day management of the extension service.
b)issued a Government order transferring 3000 positions
of VDOs from the Panchayati Raj Department to DOA along
with the budget and retaininig them for extension work.
c)made adequate budgetary provision for the operation of the
first project year; and
d)concluded a memorandum of understanding between GOAP and
AP'AU as to thle role of APAU in project implementation.
Based on which Credit Agreement was made during March 1982.
Immediately after the project agreement was signed 33 vehicles
were purclhased and 22 VEOs were deputed for prosecution of
Graduate courses in A.P.A.U. The actual project was sanctioned by
the State Government during July 1982 for a period of five years
at an estimated cost of Rs.7.83 crores.
4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:
4.01     It was originally  proposed to provide 6776 VEO s duly
merging staff from CAD and Panchayat Raj Departments for which
orders were also issued, but due to administrative and legal
problems,  thie  system  functioned   with  only  2612  VEO s  upto
31-7-1985.
4.02   IThis issti- was resolved in a tripartite meeting held on
4-4-1985, wlhereil it. was agreed to provide about 4000 VEO's by
merglng C n1m;mndl .\ia Development, Extension staff.   Accordingly
39711 ;. hn:i"ve Ioen provided. Similarly only 429 Agricultural
Officers v;rnges aid 195 Subject llatter Specialism have functioned
till1 3-/-1')8 anid subsequently staff provided after merger of
C.A.D. ';Lff.
4.03    Six Zonal Joint Directors of Agriculture Offices were
establistied as per 5Laff Appraisal Report (SAR) but were kept in
abeyance since 1983-84 due to administrative reasons.



-13-
4.04     Under  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  cell  all  the  posts
indicated under S.A.R were sanctioned during July 1982 and were
filled up though there were delays in taking staff on deputation
from Bureau of Economics and Statistics.
4.05.    The  S.A.R.  has provided for purchase of 81 vehicles,
sanction of loans for 876 motor cycles and 6776 Bicycles, against
which 73 vehicles have been purchased, while sanctioning loans for
872 motor cycles. In case of Bicycles it was revised to sanction
of mopeds.   Therefore  1300 mopeds and 435 bycycle loans were
sanctioned. All the vehicles could not be purchased due to ban on
purchase of new vehicles.
4.06.   Orientation training programmes were organised for all the
staff during 1982 to 1985. Targets in all the training programmes
have been achieved. 1358 monthly workshops have been conducted by
A.P.Agricultural University at 17 identified research statioto.
During the course of implementation A.P.A.U., came up with a
proposal  to  strengthen  10  research  stations  as  they  lack
infrastructure facilities like Staff, class rooms, furniture, A.V.
Aids and mobility. But this could not be provided as it was not a
part  of  the  project.   Various missions  have  appreciated  the
deliberations of monthly workshops, but have pointed that use of
Audio Visu als, Charts,  live  samples  and  skill teaching need
attention.   Joint  field visits made by research and  extension
staff have played a key role in identification of pests and
diseases etc., specially in controlling whitefly and Heliothis on
Cotton and BPH, Gall-fly and G undhiBug on Rice.
4.07.  Iortnightly Trainings(11819)  were conducted at block level
in 67 revenue divisions.  Various  inter disciplinary teams and
World Bank missions have indicated that these fortnightly training
programmes are organised effectively.
4.08    So far 160 candidates for B.Sc(Ag) and 152 candidates for
M.Sc(Ag) Courses have been deputed.   The shortfall in graduate
courses j[ due to the fact that V.D.O's from Panchayat Raj
Department have not joined.  lHence not deputed under this project.



-14-
4.09    There was a provision for deputation of 20 Officers for
various overseas training but only 7 Officers were selected and
deputed. The shortfall was due to the fact that there was no
quota f ixed by Government of India for the state as per the
S.A.R., (Statement.I, II(a) and II(b))
4.10     It was originally envisaged  to have  195 VEO quarters.
This target was reduced to 130 due to   escalation  of cost against
which 64 quarters have been completed and 18 are in progress.
4.11    One building for hostel accomodation is completed and 3
are in progress.  The delay in execution is due to escalation of
cost from Rs.3.00 lakhs to Rs.4.1 lakh per centre. (Statement-I)
4.12    Extension and Research Linkage:
Extension and Research Linkage is well knit and fully
co-ordinated, in implementing various Agricultural programmes
i.e., exLersion and Research programmes. State is divided into 7
Agro-climatic Zones and in each Zone there is a Zonal Research
Advisory  Council,  to  closely  co-ordinate  the  extension  and
research  programmes.   Pre-seasonal  conference  are  regularly
conducted in which extension and research persons deliberate on
various programmes implemented, evaluate the performance of
various  variations, management practice  etc.,  Based on these
deliberations,  recommendations and  future  plan  of  action  are
prepared for approval at state level.
4.13     Besides, above the monthly workshops are being conducted
in 17 i4cntified research stations of Andhra Pradesh Agricultural
University.   During the monthly workshops, on first day there are
discussions, exchange of information on field problems, other
constraints in the implementation of earlier recommendations and
research   gaps.  Further,  the   skills   and  other  production
recommendations for the month are finalised.  On the second day
Joint Field visits to the problematic areas are organised.



-15--
4.14    Three (3) advance workshops on monthly workshops were also
organised for two days each with the assistance of Andhra Pradesh
Agricultural University staff in 3 regions of the state, to
improve the quality of the training Ln the monthly workshops.
4.15     Besides, promotional trainings of B.Sc(Ag) and M.Sc(Ag)
courses, crop production trainings of different durations, namely
Refreslher and short courses and extension training programmes are
also taken up for the benefit of extension personnel of the
Department by the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University.
4.16    MONITORING AND EVALUATION:
The Monitoring and Evaluation unit was set up under Joint
Director of Agriculture (M&E) as proposed in the S.A.R. together
with  the  entire  staff.   Few problems were encountered in the
initial stages for promotion of staff and hiring their services
from Bureau of Economics and Statistics, which were resolved in
the initial stages itself. The Unit has brought out 9 Monitoring
Surveys and 9 Monitoring-cum-Evaluation Surveys together with 2
special studies. The important findings are as follows:-
1. % OF FARMERS WliO KNEW THE VEO (CONTACT FARMERS:)
1. The number of Contact farmers who knew the Village
Extension Officers were 94% during Rabi 1983-84 on average In
Andhra Pradesh and this continued to be so till Kharif 1988,
with marginal variations, which suggests thiat the V.E.O's are
well known to the contact farmers in all the Districts.
2.1% OF FARMERS WHO KNEW THE VEO (NON CONTACT FARMERS)
llie number of non-contact farmers who knew the V.E.O were
82% during Rabi 1983-84, which increased to 83% during 1984-85
and subsequently there were marginal variations.
3.V.E.0 VISITS TO CONTACT FARMERS( 2 or more )
During Rabi 1983-84, 86% of the V.E.O's have visi ted



-16-
contact farmers twice or more and 68% of V.E.Os have visited
contact farmers regularly. Subsequently there 's a decrease in
the percentage of visits.  1Lic reason beir
i) During 1987, the Agricultural Officers, and V.E.O's were
drafted toMandal Praja Parishads.
4. V.E.O VISITS TO NON CONTACT FARMERS:(2 or more)
During  Rabi  1983-84,  44%  of  V.E.Os  were  visiting
non-contact farmers twice or more while 32% of V.E.Os were
visiting the Non-Contact Farmers regularly which was increased
to 53% in Kharif 1984 and subsequently this was affected due
to deployment of field staff in Relief works for Natural
Calamities and Election works etc.,
5.      PROJECT COST:
5.01    At the time of appraisal it was estimated that the project
would cost Rs.7.82 crores (6 Million Dollars) but due to price.
escalation and increase    in the staff cost, inclusion of CADA
merged staff,       for reimbursement the actual cost has come to
Rs.13.97 crores (6.4 Million Dollars) Statei clit-ITI
6.      PROJECT FINANCING AND CREDIT ALLOCATION:
6.01     The IDA was expected to finance 69% of SAR estimated
project costs.  While the total credit allocated for the project
was utilised, actual disbursements were far behind from the SAR
schedule this was mainly due to the reason that separate Head of
Account was not adopted initially and delay in obtaining the audit
certificate on account of large number of drawing and disburstn,
Officers spread over the entire state.
The allocation of credit proceeds as per the SAR and the
actual disbursement indicated that there were over disbursements
under staff component on account of escalation of staff cost and
extending the period of one year while the other components of
civil works, vehicles, loans for mobility are not fully utilised.



-17-
7. COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS:
7.01    The Government of Andhra Pradesh has compl;ed with all the
co ven.nts  included  in  the  development  credit  and  project
agreements Though there were delays in meeting the target dates
specially for Audit Certificates etc. Due to administrative and
legal problems the staff agreed upon could not be provided in the
initial stages of the project. However these issues were resolve&
in the later stages of the project implementation except removing
imbalances of field level staff in certain districts.
8. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE:
8.01     The main objective  of  the  project  was  Institutional
reorganisation and strengthening of Extension system in the State
to have an effective extension service to the faru. ag co-aunity.
Inspite of some problems in initial stages
implementationitha project has succeeded in providing a basic
systamatic  extension  structure  as  envisaged  in  the SAR.  The
day-to-day functioning and the technical management of the project
has  become  the  responsibility  of  Additional  Director  of
Agriculture(Extension) under the overall control of Commissioner
and  Director  of  Agriculture.   Excellent  linkage  and  active
collaboration with the Research and training activities of A.P.A.U
were achieved.  The State Level Techn  ical committee and ZRAECs
were established mainly to strengthen the Research and Extension
linkages and to identify research gaps and finalise priorities.
9. PROJECT COORDINATION:
9.01    A State Level Project  Coordination Committee headed by
Secretary, Agriculture was established which met for the first
time in November 198Z and subsequently it met threo. times during
the  period  of  the  project.   The  Coordination  Committee  was
successful in re,olving key problems like merging of CAD staff
and establishing a single line of command. Posting of se niors as
Assistant Director of Agriculture(Regular) to lead the team of
S.M.Ss. at the divisional level, upgrading the Disaric. posts to
the Joint Director of Agriculture Cadre and dithdraw.ng veh- les

from the pooling system and providing it to the Extension staff.
10. ACCOUNTS AND REPORTING:
10.01   The Department of Agriculture maintained the information
drawing Officer-wise and componeLt wise expenditure which were
considered to be adequate as project accounts.  Though initially
there were problems of separate heads of accounts and submission
of annual accounts Certificates etc., on due dates.  Six monthly
reports were also submitted regularly to the World Bank/Government
of India upto September, 1989.
11. PROJECT IMPACT
11.01   With the implementation of T & V system linkage between
research  and  extension  personnel  have  been  developed  and
strengthened resulting in continuous and effective transfer of
latest technology and skills to the farmers. This is evident from
the phenomenal growth in the utilisation of Agricultural input
parameters like seeds and fertilisers etc., which are indicated
below:

11.03   The sys.em has also provided necessary infrastructure to
launch a maasive dry land agriculture development programme in the
State.   A  major  thrust  has  been  given  to  the  transfer  of
technology in hitherto neglected area of dryland Agriculture with
NaturfiL ;alamitil c, fn thie
encouraging  results.   Inspite  or/ recent  past  the  levels  of
productivity and production have been maintained. Further, due to
implementation of the systems the exposure of extension staff to
regular and frequent trainings in the concerned disciplines has
increased their professional competency and create confidence in
them enabling them to face the farmers boldly at the field level.
12. BANKS PERFORMANCE:
12.01   The IDA performance in formulation of the project and
financing was quite positive and contributed towards reorganising
the  IDepartinent  to have a single line of Command from VEO to
Commissioner and Director of Agriculture level and in establishing
cl(c;e linkage witth Research and farmers.
12.02   The Bank has fielded 14 supervision missions and 6 other
missions including appraisal of the project. They have pointed out
variou; defeciencies In implementation of the project which have
been aLtended to on priority basis.  The Bank has played a key
role in releasingLh-' vehicles from the pooling system and merger
of Comm-n'd Aron  DevelonmenL    Authority       extension staff to
have a single line of command.



-20-
12D3    The appraisal report prepared was a good frame work and
without a MTR the project could be completed successfully with
tangible impact.
1284    During the project period the Bank always maintained very
good relationship with Government of Andhra Pradesh.

Deployment of field staff from Panchayati Raj institutions to work full dme on disciplined village
visit with periodic training and support of the research system was canvassed and agreed upon.
But deployment of staff became a critical issue in implementation.

Comments:
Attributing a precise level of benefits to an extension project of this tye is difficult since
production and productivity of crops result from interaction of number of socao, economic and
technological factors. However, the results obtained outstrip the benefits assumed to- support
projectat appraisal.

Ass=ntions
I.    At Appraisal (1982)
To achieve an ERR of 50%:
a.    the yield of paddy should increase by 6 kg/ha from the initial
yield level of 1670 kg/ha (1974/75 to 1979/80 average);
b.    the yield of jowar should increase by 2 kgs/ha from it's initial
yield level of 580 kg/ha (1974/75 to 1979/80 average);
Based on:
i.    the economic prices of paddy and jowar - Rs.2006/ton and
Rs.1045/ton, respectively (at 1979 prices); and
ii.   Cost of the project - $6.0 M.
II.   Estimates at project completion (1989)
To realize an ERR of 50%:
a.    the yield of paddy should increase by 11 kg/ha (1983/84 to 1987/88
moving average);
b.    the yield of jowar should increase by 3 kg/ha (1983/84 to 1987/88
average);
Based on:
i.    Economic prices of paddy and jowar at 1989 constant prices -
Rs.1960/ton and Rs.1740/ton, respectively;
ii.   Actual cost of the project - $6.4 M

BORROWER'S COMMENTS ON PART I AND III
Para-4.03
It is a fact that to make the project cost effective and
to provide full employment to the village development officers of
Panchyat Raj Department it was agreed to draft the staff from
Panchyat Raj Department as well as merge field level staff of
Command Area Development Department. It may be mentioned here that
80% of the job of Village Development Officers was Agriculture and
that C.A.D. staff were already implementing T & V System.  Had
they not been mergeJithey would have been under employed. But due
to various administrative and legal problemsvillage development
officers  of  Panchyat Raj Department  (except in West Godavari
District) have not joined the Department. Similarly the C.A.D.
Staff could not merge till 1-8-1985.
Since the Village Development Officers of Panchyat Raj
Department have not joined the Department 1000 posts which were
proposed to be up-graded have not been provided.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:
Para-5.03
In a tripartite meeting dated: 4-4-1985 it was decided to
provide above 4,000 Village Extension Officers in the state to
implement the T & V System as against 6,776 originally envisaged.
These posts are district cadre posts under six point formula and
are not transferable outside the district therefore, imbalances
from district to district could not be removed by transfering
Village Extension Officers from surplus districts to deficit
districts.
Subsequently,   the   State   Government   created   1100
Agricultural Mandals to brinrg administration closer  to the people
and 1100 Agricultural Officers wet  provided to the Mandals with
the idea of better ncroilntability uf the Extension Staff. However
the position wa.i; esLordcl   subsequently and the staff brought
under single line of command.

-38-
Para-5. 04
Though  the  project  was  implemented  as  per  schedule
including retroactive  financing during 1981-82 itself but due to
staff problems there was a set back in providing adequate funds as
per the phlasing provided in the staff appraisal report.  Since it
took 21 to 3 years to resolve the issues the project was proposed
to be extended by one year which was agreed to by the Bank.
Political environment was quite stable though changed. It has not
effected the implementation of the project.
6. PROJECT RlESULTS
Para-6.02
As per the revised target so far as the staff is concerned
it is achieved to the extent of 96.98%.  In case of purchase of
vehicles and mobility loan targets were achieved to the extent of
90.123% and 119.123% respectively. For trainings the targets were
exceeded whereas in civil works targets were achieved to the
extent   of  about   50%  only  due  to  certain  administrative
constraints.
7. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
Para-7.01
A project for strengtlhening of existing Agricultural
Extension System has been formulated at a cost of Rs.369 crores
for a phased period of 10 years which is yet to be appraised by
the World lBank.  Under the proposed project it is envisaged to
have a broad-base extension servlce at the field level.
Para-7.11 2
Il[ere  is  no  proposal  to  entrust  non-extension,  input
oriented actLvities to tthe field staff. In Andhra Pradesh Private
Agricultural. cotisult:incy is encouraged through a scheme wherein
Agricultiur;al Fxtenslon Officers are permiLted to go on leave and



-39-
provide  Agricultural  Extension  Services  to  tthe  Farmers  on
remuneration from farmers. The Agricultural Officers can come back
as and when tthey want or go on retirement, if they so choose.  The
scheme is still continuing and so far, 42 Agricultural Extension
Officers have availed this facility.
8.BANK PERFORMANCE
Para-8.02 - EVALUATION SUMMARY
A) NO REMARKS
B) NO REMARKS

on thle projnvts.



-40-
6.  Mobility  loans  due  to  price  escalation  have  become
unattractive as the cost of vehlicles went up and the
sanction limit remained constant. For maintenance of
vehicles separate allowances may be provided.
7.  Simultaneous   strengthening   of   research   should   be
undertaken.
8.  Overseas training seats to be allotted by Government of
India as per Project Agreement.
