SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Falconbridge Dominicana C por A has asked the BEInk for a loan
of $25 million to meet the foreign exchange requirements of the power
plant and related facilities which will form part of a ferronickel
project in the Dominican Republic. The company is sponsored by
Falconbridge Nickel Mnes Limited of Canada and Armco Steel Corporation
of Ohic.  The Government of the Dominican Republic owns 9.6% of the
company'-s shares.
ii.       The ferronickel project consists of the mining and metallurgical
processing of :Laterite nickel ore to produce ferronickel. The treatment
plant is designed for an annual production of approximately 63 million
pounds of nickel in the form of ferronickel. Extensive supporting
facilities incLuding power generation, fuel pipeline, storage and topping
facilities, roads, water supply and housing,form part of the project.
The proposed Bank loan is to help finance the thermal nower generatine
station, including the pipeline which transports bulk fuel from the Port
of Haina to the nlant site,

I.  INTRODUCTION
1.    The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
Ueen asked Lor a "loan of $2 mlillon 1/ Dy Falconbridge Dominicana
C por A (Falconbridge Dominicana), to assist in establishing a ferronickel
project in the Dominican Repuolic.  The loan is required to meet the
foreiLgn exchange component of the capital cost of the power plant,
pipe:Line and. related facilities included in the project.
2.    Since 1955 Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited (Falconbridge
Canadla) has catried on in the Dominican Republic a program for the
exploration and development of indicated nickel deposits.  For this
purpose they established a subsidiary, Minera y Beneficiadora
Falconbridge Dominicana C por A, the name of which was subsequently
shortened to the present title.  Initially, Falconbridge Canada owned
81.7, of the company's shares, the Government of the Dominican Republic
owned 9.6% a.nd the balance was held by individuals and companies in
Canada and United States.
3.    In January 1969, Armco Steel Corporation (Armco) of Ohio
authorised participation in Falconbridge Dominicana through the
purchase of stock from Falconbridge Canada and the assutmption of
40% of the latter's liability for project financing. Armco's share
represents 1.6.3% of outstanding common stock of Falconbridge Dominicana
and Falconbridge Canada's residual share is 65.4%.
4.    As of December 1968, FalconbridRe Dominicana had msade investments
valued at approximately $17.25 million in the Dominican Republic for
geological exploration and pilot Dlant operations. Ore reserves of
63 m:Lllion tons 2/ containing 1.55% nickel have been established.
The ores are of lateritic origin and Falconbridge has developed an
appropriate metallurgical process for the recovery of ferronickel and
has tested the process by large-scale pilot plant operations located
on the concession area in the Dominican Republic.
5.    The project will comprise mining and transportation facilities,
a treatment plant and a nower plant.  The treatment plant is designed
for an annual production of approximately 63 million polnds of nickel
in the form of ferronickel.  The exmendit.ire on the eomnlete oroiect
is expected to approximate $195 million.

III.   THE PROJECT
Intoduction
29.       The project consists of the mining and metallurgical processing
of lateritic nickel ore to produce ferronickel for sale on the world
market. Extensive supporting facilities including power generation,
fuel pipeline storage and topping facilities, roads, water supply and
housing form part of the project. Power generation and atssociated
facilities are discussed separately in Section IV since the proposed
Bank loan will be for the financing of the foreign exchange conponent
of these facilities.
A.   Mining
Exploration
30.       Dominican nickel-bearing laterites have bee-n knowmn since the
beginning of the century. In 1918-19 a preliminary examination and
some sanpling was carm-ied out hv geologists of the United States
Geological Su;rvey. A further survey by this agency in 1941-42 estab-
lished the most pro-mising areas for fullscale 
31_       In L!955 Falconrbridge geologists began a detailed geolopical
investigation and sampling program. The main ore-bearing areas were
saw le ;,rhpits a 100  eer      'Iaras and in  -tain a.-eas at, 50 SmsetEr
intervals. Pitting was completed in 1958 and further sampling has

~i3 bhefelt1oI O63 iiLl on dry sIhoLtb uu  Uof ore avera1r L..5)5 ickl,
this is considered acceptable.   These reserves are sufficient for about
25 yez.rs at the proposed level of extraction, and continnuing explordtion
work indicates that additional reserves of commercial value are likely
to be proven.
Geology
34.       The ore deposits are dispersed over the length of Falconbridge
Dominicana's concession area extending in a narrow zone from sierra
Prieta about :L2 km. north of Santo Domingo some 100 km. northwest to
La Vega (see Maps). The deposits of commercial value occur midway in
the length of the Concession on the area.s of high ground where weatherirng
has prDduced a lateritic capping on the ridges and plateaux. In places
under this capping secondary enrichment has taken place.
35.       There are two general types of material carrying economic
concentrations of nickel: the overlying layer of laterite containing
35 - 50% iron and 0.6 - l.h% nickel distributed relatively homogeneously
throughout; and the underlying layer of rock at various s-tages of
alteration, which is heterogenous in character with iron varying from
5 - 30% and nickel from about 0.8 up to b% in pockets of :Local enrich-
ment.
36.       The depth of ore varies from 1 meter up to 55 meters, but the
average depth is around 10 meters on the main deposits.
Minine Plan
37.       The variable nature of the denosits reouires the adontion of
a flexible mining system, which will take into account the dispersion
of the ore bodies  the lnrge nnd rapid e-hanges in the plet'.tinn of the
terrairi and the variations in the physical and chemical constitution of
38.       Minino, will he oarrieRd oit hb rnonventionnl strin mining methodn
using large bulldozers equipped with riDpers. No drilling and blasting
will be necessary other thnn to lear occasional la.rge rock int-  uions.
The ore will be loaded into trucks by L4 yd. diesel electric shovels
from a. nu..ber Oe"4 face  s u     s   to provide fo bPg         Because

road building program will be an important part of the min:ing operations
over the first Lew years.



40.       The mining rate required for a plant output of 63,hoo,000 lbs.
per year of nickel in ferronickel is about 16,000 short tons of run-of-mine
ore per day. Two shifts per day will be adequate to handle this tonnage
using the proposed equipment.
B.   Processing
hi.       The Falconbridge process for the extraction of ferronickel
from laterite ores was developed by Falconbridge Canada specifically to
treat Dominican ores but also with a view to general application else-
where. Certain aspects of the process are the subject of patent applica-
tions by FalconbridPe Canadaj buit. Falconbridge Dominicana is to have
access to the process without payment of royalties.
42.       Pilot plant work was initiated in 1959 on a site adjacent to
the m,ain ore bodies.  Progressive experimentation established 1-mproved
plant designs and operating techniques until the stage was reached where
a sa'is     kr p r- es s h,a d 'been. developed.  ihes  imrovements were in-
corporated in a large-scale pilot plant which was commissioned in early
-196,' and operatLled on a continuous "-as-'s unt-i1 thI'e er.d of 'gu  1968,
when it was closed down, having successfully fulfilled its objectives.
43.       This pilot plant was visited in July 1968 by engineering staff
of International Finance Corporation, who subsequently concluded that
a satisfactory technical process had been developed to produce ferro-
nickel from the Dominican laterites.
44.       The Falconbridge process has a number of attractive features
including: all of the ore deposit can be treated without the need for
selective mining; the flow sheet is relatively simple,and marketaDie
ferronickel is produced without any refining steps; and the production
of atmospheric pollutants has been minimized and there are no harmful
effluents to pollute rivers.
45.       Processing consists essentially of three successive stages -
ore preparation, selective reduction, and electric melting.   These are
described in detail in Annex 2.
46.       The ore is upgraded and blended by autogenous milling under
controlled conditions. Milled and screened ore is stockpiled and forms
the prepared feed for the metallurgical plant.  Ore preparation is carried
out on a two-slhift per day basis; the other operations of the plant will
be continuous, three shifts per day.
47.       Ore from the stockpiles is fed to briquetting presses which in
turn feed the reduction furnaces. Carefully controlled conditions in
the furnaces produce the required degree of reduction of the briquettes
which are then transferred to electric arc furnaces for melting and
separation into slae and ferronickel. The ferronickel is cast into
pigs for shipment.



- 9 -
48.       IThe overall recovery of nickel from run-of-mine ore to
ferr-onickel. is of the order of 81.5% and indicates an efficient process.
49.       The plant site is located mid-way in the Concession area,
about 90 kilometers northwest of Santo Domingo near the town of Bonao.
These locations are illustrated in the annexed maps.
C. Water Supply
50.       The entire water requirements of the plant and supporting
facilities are drawn from the nearby Yuna River which has a minimum
flow of 60,000 U.S. gallons per minute.  The company proposes to erecb
a cc,ntrol structure in the form of an earthwork or concrete dam which
will direct a sufficient flow of water into an old channel of the river
that runs alongside the plant site.  This plan is being studied by
Aqueductos y Alcantarillados, S.A., a DoTminican company experienced in
this work.
51.       A pumping station will be installed On thhe. old chan-nel witth a
pumping capacity of 12,000 gallons per minute, and storage capacity for
800,000 galLons is provided. A water treatment plant filters and treats
water for the plant and power stations, and a separate treatment unit
provides dlrkinkig water.  The pumping station and water treatment plant
will be included in the facilities to be financed by the Bank loan.
52.       The make-up water requirements are about 6,00o gallons per
minut  o f W.hi rh about 4,000 are required for the power i'lant and the
balance for the process plant.
Ai. Transpor-t
53.       Tit!o methods of traSr.port are used.  The large 4' -' 0l of,el
oil Xor the power plant and processing plant are transported by pipeline
from a tanker unloading dock at the Port of Haina to storage tanks at
the site.  Ihe port will have to be dredged from 25ft to 31ft alongside
pnie r t+o b e capabl, 1e o f b,e r thirn. g a '20nw,000A (4 4on   ntan-r
54. Dieel oilsgasoline and ,,.iscellaneous s-upplies9 are 'ranspor'Le'd
from Haina by road, and ferronickel is transported to Haina by road.
55.-      The main road from Haina and Santo Domingo passes close to the
site, and a connection by a new access road and bridge over tne Yuboa
River is part of the project. The main road will be more than adequate
to hasndLe thge additional traffic resulting from the proJect.



- 10 -
E. Townsite
56.   It has been decided that accommodation at the plant site should
be limited to a lodge, some single quarters and hospita]L facilities.
Tne main housing for expatriate staff is to be provided by an urbanisation
schenme at the local township of Bonao (about 6 kilometers distant), and
some 75 family homes and 38 single apartments are required.    Negotiations
between the Government and Falconbridge Dominicana on the provision of
townsite facilities and housing are in progress, and it is anticipated
that the company will contribute approximately $2.5 million.

using pertinent information obtained from supplies and contractors and their
past experience with the construction of the two pilot plants. Estimates
for mining and mine road building were determined in a similar way by
Falconbridge.   The cost of the access road and bridge into the plant sitE!
was estimated bv the Comnanv's (onsultants. Marshall Macklin Monaphan Limited
of Don Mills, Ontario. The power plant estimate is described in Section IV.

G. Engineering and Construction
63.    TLe primary responsibility for the engineering and supervision
of the project will lie with Falconbridge Canada's general engineering
department. Up to the present they have contracted out the major work
in design and engineering to a number of consulting engineers.
64.   The mining aspects of the project have been the responsibility
of Falconbridge Canada. The production and service facilities have been
contracted to Atkins, Hatch and Associates of Toronto.     Uther consultants
presently involved in the project are:
Scrgent and Lundy of Chicago - power plant
Pipe Line Technologists Inc of Houston - pipelines
Marshall Macklin and Monaghan of Toronto - access,road and bridge
William Trow Associates of Toronto - s6il testing
ILternational Water Supply Co. of London, Ontario - water supply
Ac[ueductos y Alcantarillados of Santo Domingo - water supply
All of these consultants are well qualified in their fields.



- 12 -
65.  Engineering work is at present about 2,5%  " c0 pleted ar.d a num.be
of bids for the major plant items have been received and evaluated.
The a,ctual construction will be performed by a general contractor assisted
as necessary by the various consultants.  The main contractor,
Brown and Root Inc of HoIuson  Texas was selected fom bids received
from four leading companies all with experience in the Caribbean area.
I is expected tuba  utie contracuor will ut on s±te wiJ.IALI  nex
three months and in anticipation, clearing and drainage works have
commenced. The contractor will be paid on a cost plus fixed Lee basls.
66.   Tne construction of the access road and bridge has been let to
a local contractor, and is well advanced.
67.   The project is scheduled to start up in March 1972.
H. Procurement
68.   The procurement of the Bank financed facilities is being
carried out according to usual Bank procedures (see Section IV).
69.   The procurement of most of the remaining plant and equipment is
tied up with the proposed United States Agency for International
Development (U.S.A.I.D.) guarantee of the other lenders and consequent]y
bids are beirng obtained mainly from U.S. and Canadian suppliers. It is
probable that about 10% of machinery and equipment will come from
Canadian sources.
I. Personnel
70.   The total number of persons employed in the Dominican Republic
will 'be 1,15C); an additional staff of 9 will be required in the Head
Office in Toronto. Of this total, expatriate technicians or administrcative
personnel wi]l number 81. Of the remaining 1,069 Dominicans, 411 will
be classified as unskilled although some may be doing work above that
of lalborer.
71.   No diff'iculty is anticipated in obtaining the required number of
Dominicans and Falconbridge will provide or recruit the necessary
expatr,iate personnel.  The pilot plant operations have provided a
nucleus of key personnel for the start up of the commercial operation.
J. Production Cost Estimates
72.   The production program envisbges start up in March 1972 and
additional expense during the running-in period until June 1972 has been
capitalised. Cost estimates shown in table 4 are based on a normal
year.; oneration.

7T.       The important items of cost are labor and fuels, which together
account for about 75% of the total cost. Labor costs have been conser-
vatively derived on anticipated wage rates and a productivity factor of
half that which would be adopted for North American conditions. Fuel
consumption is based on the large pilot plant operations and on well
established rates for power generation and for earthmoving equipment.
Costs are calculated on current market prices for fuel. T'he consumption
rates for other materials are also based on the pilot plan,t operations.
The current estimate of annual operating costs seems soundly based and
is therefore accepted as reasonable.

IV. BANK FINANCED FACILITIES
A. Descrintion of Facilities
75.    The proposed Bank loan will be to finance the foreign exchange
portioris of the thermal power generating station, a   ninnln   to tas
port crude oil from the Port of Haina to the plant site and a topping
nit   at the site, to convert +e crde in+o appropriate -ractions.       A

76.       The thesrma1Ll pUower  b ation with a capacity of 198 iVTw will consist
of three 66 IAW turbo-generators, boilers and associated ecuipment, in-
cludiung water supply and treatment plant.   Ine generators are of conven-
tional design, operating at a voltage of 13.d kV, 0.85 power factor,
three phase, sLxty cycles and hydrogen cooled.
77.     Each boiler, of the fully outdoor type, has a capacity of 600,000
lbs. of steam per hour, 9500F, 1,250 psi, and is fired with heavy fuel
oil.  Condenser cooling water is recirculated and cooled in heat exchanger
towers.  The overall heat rate of the thermal plant is estimated at
10,750 BTU/kwnh, based on the boiler and turbine contracts. The output
of the power p:Lant will be transformed to 34kV for primary mine distribu-
tion and operation of the smelter furnaces.
78.     The pipeline has a diameter of b", is 44 miles in length and has
the capacity to transport up to 5.0 million barrels of oil per year.
The topping unit converts crude oil into fuel oil and higher petroleum
fractions by volume ratio of 60 percent and 40 percent respectively,
giving an annual fuel oil capacity of 3 million barrels, compared with
an estimated fuel oil requirement of 2.5 million barrels, including
about 300,000 for the ore drying kilns. Adequate storage facilities
at Haina and the plant site would be provided.

80.   I'he es-timated total cost of the thermal station and associated
facilities amounts to $28.1 million with a foreign exchange component
of $2h.0 million, exclusive of interest.   The Bank loan would finance
thiS Z'lt.O million and a nortion of interest; estimated at less than
half that which will be payable during the construction period.
81.   The estimate of the cost of the thermal station was prepared by
Sargent and Taindy of rhicago c-nsuling engineers for this part of the
project. As virtually all of the contracts for the thermal plant have
nnw beehn placed on a firm. price basis  the -onntingencyv allowance includes
only a nominal amount of about 5 per cent. The unit cost of the thermal
statioin is $103 per kie uohich is w-el  below average for a plant of this t rpe
and results from the favorable contracts placed.

03nting ordcer to meet th                schaedule in Spite of delaysai
reaching final financial agreements, expenditures for engineering services
of -up lo $1 million, and for equipment of -up to $0.5 mill:on are being
incurred prior to signing, which mould be eligible for reimbursement.



84.   Disbursements would be for the CIF cost of imported materials
and equipment required for the project ana for the Iforeign exchange cos t
of civil works and engineering services, together with up to
US$1,Ci00,000 for interest and other charges. if, at such time as project
construction is sufficiently advanced to indicate there may be surplus
funds to any of these requirements, consideration woula at that time
be given to disbursing them for other categories.
C. Operating Cost - Thermal Flant
85.. Crude oil (Bunker "C") is estimated to cost $1.70 per barrel
($Il.5O per ton) CIF Haina, with an additional $0.05 per barrel,
repreEsenting the operation cost. The total delivered cost of fuel oil
to the thermal plant amounts to about $0.28/million BTU and is reasonably
low priced.
86.   The cost of fuel will amount to about 3 mills/kWh and operation
and ma.intenance charges will add a further 1 mill.
D. Power Requirements
87.   The metallurgical plant comprises three electric melting
furnaces (Annex 2) taking a total of 120 MS under normal operating
conditions and a holding furnace and ore preparation facility requiring
an additional 30 MI. The estimated peak demand is 172 MI. Total annual
energy consumption is estimated at 1.22 billion kWh giving a load factor
of 81 per cent.
E. Engineering, Procurement and Construction
88.   Economic and other considerations dictated that the thermal plant
shoulcd be located at the site of the production plant and the fuel
transported by pipeline.
89.   Equipment and materials for the thermal plant and associated
faciliLties are being purchased on the basis of international competitive
bidding excent in the case of minor items for which such bidding would
be impractical. The general construction contract has been awarded to
Sociedad Venezolana de Electrificacion G.A. of Venezuela. following
international competitive bidding. There are separate contracts for
the nurchase of other maior comnonents of' ele.trinal eqpmrnent, for the
fabrication and construction of the pipelines and of the topping unit.
90.   The schedule calls for the placing of most orders during 1969
and full-scale operation of the pnwer plant by the end of 1971
It is likely that most, if not all contracts, for the thermal plant,
as this was necessary to meet the schedule.

v. THE MAR KeT
A. General
91.   The principal use for nickel is as an alloy element in wrought
and cast steels and non-ferrous alloys. When alloyed with other
meta:Ls it imparts strength, toughness, hardness and ductility, together
with resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Despite reSearch over
many years to find a cheaper and more plentiful substitute, little
headway has been made.
92.   Although the use of nickel is widespread throughout industrialised
countries, almost 90% of the non-communist supply is produced by
three Canadian companies and a company operating in New Caledonia,
due to the fact that the principal nickel deposits that have been
until. now exploitable commercially, are located in these two area9
of the world.
93.   Primary nickel is traded in three main forms - reiined metal,
oxide and ferronickel.  In addition, a considerable quantity of
secondary nickel is recovered principally from stainless steel and
non-ierrous alloy scrap.  The major consumer of nickel is the
IJnit.ed States whieh anrniints fnr about )40% of the total nonsumotion
in the western world.

Y9.      The nicKel consumed for tne various end-uses can ce divided
from the application aspect into two product classes. Class I includes
electrolytic nickel and other pure forms of nickel and nickel salts;
Class rI includes ferronickel and nickel oxide.
98.      End-use categories d, e, f, and much of g, require Class I
materialis for reasons of production technology.  Categories a, b and c,
which account for about 57% of total consunmption, can use either Class
I or GLass II but are tending to swing to the latter since the unit
cost is lower.
99.      Most of the above uses have good growth prospects.   For example,
the use of stainless steel is increasing steadily in important manufac-
turing industries, including automobiles, aircraft, domestic appliances
and building. The use of low and mediumn alloy constructional steels is
increasing at a rate of growth considerably above that for steel as a
whole. Space-age superalloys also promise an increasing requirement for
nickel. The excellent corrosion-resistant properties of nickel electro-
plate should aLso assure a steady, if not spectacular, growth area.
100.     Because of the relative scarcity and high cost of nickel, metal-
lurgists have for many years carried out research with a view to develop-
ing alLoy compositions in which nickel could be replaced by cheaper and
more p:Lentifu]. elements. So far however, only limited success has been
achievted. In some applications such as high temperature alloys for gas
turbines, substitute materials impair performance; in othiers such as
alloy steels, the possible substitute elements like molybdenum,
vanadilm or chromium may be in even more limited supply. In certain
stainlless steel compositions, the technology is proved for substituting
about half of the nickel content by manganese; however, a real incentive
to make the change has so far been lacking. At this point it does not
seem likely that substitution of this kind will result in any serious
rp.,ine1t.-inn ir, tl:p. 4,-_mqnri fnr ninkpl.

101.      World conRumntion of nrimarv nickel has grown eLt an average
rate cf 6% per annum over the period 1947-68.    Total consumption which
r_ehd npe      of Sin million Ihb    in 196h. fell to 810 million lbs. in
1967, and was expected to reach about the same level in 1968.    This

that the utilization of secondary nickel will increase proportionately.

103.       lnnex J gi-ves details of the historical pattern of supply
over the period 1955-67 in terms of mine production of recoverable
nickel, and FalconDridge's forecast of possible future production for
the period 19,68-75.
104.      The following points should be noted with regard to these
figures.  First nickel production over the period 1955-67 has been
consistently Less than reported nickel consumption. The reasons for the
discrepancy !ie in purchases and disbursements by the U.S. stockpile;
imports from Communist countries; and changes in consumers' inventories.
Thus past experience shows no indication of over-supply of nickel,
even for short periods.
105.      Secondly, in many cases, the ore mined is semi-processed at a
the mine site and refined at another location. For example, some of the
matte ! produced by International Nickel, and all produced by Falconbridge
in Canada, is refined in England and Norway respectively, and matte from
Le Nickel in New Caledonia is refined in Canada, France and Japan.
106.      Thirdly, there is considerable difficulty and uncertainty in
attempting to forecast future changes of nickel production, since not
only the deveLopment of existing mines is involved, but also the open-
ing up of undeveloped newly-discovered or as yet undiscovered deposits.
107.      The forecast is based on many published trade reports, informa-
tion obtained from Government departments and other sources of intelli-
gence concerning the development of nickel deposits around the world. Et
has to be recognized that plans to develop deposits may change between
now and 1975 but this is not calculated to influence unduly the supply
picture. W,hat might upset the balance later is the exploitation of
deposits not yet discovered or proved. However, this factor could not
be expected to make a serious impact before 2975.   Annex f briefly
1/ Unrefined nickel sulphide

descri.bes the naJor developments that have been taken into consideration
in making the forecast.
108.      Over the last few years the picture has consistently been of
a supply shortage that may well have restricted potential] consumption.
Consicderation of the probable future supply/demand position indicates
that sun approximate balance is likely to be- achieved up t, 1975;
especially if it is assumed that mine production will not exceed 90% of
projecrted capacity. IyWTevertheless1 delays in opening new deposits - a
not unlikely possibility - may mean a continuation of the tight supply
situation for a year or ta,i w.  In         d virtiua In trol of nickel
mining rests with three or four large producers, which suggests that new

consistent over the period, averaged 15% per annum. This is more than

112.      The sharn increase in the nronortion of ferronickel hetween
1970 and 1975 is due to the unit cost advantage of ferroriickel as com-
pared with pure nickel. and to the intrrPa'dr1 avniuI  ility of ferro-
nickel.  Whereas it is forecast that 39% and 46% respectively of total

1'w.4     ralconbridge Canada will contract with Falconbridge Dominicana
to purchase the entire output of ferronickel. Falconbridge Canada has
a worldwide saues network in nickei and other metals and is experienced
in this business, so that it can be reasonably assumed that the sales
organization vill be adequate. During the period 1964 - 1968 the pilot
plant :Droduction of ferronickel has been sold to a large number of steel
makers in North -nerica and Europe in order to test acceptance. WIritten
offers have been made to a number of consumers undertaking to deliver
specific quantities starting in 1972. Favorable verbal and written
respon3es have been received, and within the limitations cf the delivery
and purchasing intentions expressed, it may be said that 150 million
lbs. amnually (or about 80% of the projected output) has lbeen tentatively
accepted on the market.
115.      Unde!r the terms of the                          i
Canada will take delivery of the ferronickel, FOB vessel Port of Haina.
The realized value of each shipment will be the CIF sellinlg price of
nickel contained in the ferronickel received from buyers in the United
States and Europe. Under this Agreement the estimated ne-b FOB price
used in financial projections of this report is 98.26 cents per lb.
after deducticns for sales commissions of 1.5% of the market value less
transportation costs.
116.      Sales will be made according to competitive commercial terms,
without special concessions for any purchaser including AiRMCO.
117.      The price for cathode nickel in the western wor:Ld has risen
steadi]y over the last 10 years from $0.7h per lb. in 1959 to $l.03 in
1969.  There is little reason to expect a decline in the f!uture in view
of the rising costs of production in Cnnadrin mines and the fct that.
serious over-supply is unlikely for the next 5 years.

122.    IBRD has been asked to provide a loan of $25 milli:on towards
financing the foreign exchange costs of the power generation facilities,
pipeline and other ancillary services, which are estimated to cost
$33 million. The loan which will rank equally with the senior loans
from banks and institutions, will be senior in security to the subordi-
nated debt and will be made directly to Falconbridge Dominicana. The
term of the loan is 15 years with a St years period of grace.
123.    Falconbridge Dominicana proposes to repay the IBRD loan with
semi-annual equal-payments of principal which returns thet bulk of the
loan funds to IBRD earlier than the normal level line met-hod.
124.    Long-term loans of $80 million will be provided by the following
companies in the proportions shown:

125.    The repayments on the principal commence in 1976 and the loans
mature on June 15, 1986.  The interest rate is &A%, payable semi-
annual:Ly, and, the commitment fee is ½6_ of 1%. The loans will rank
pari passu with the IBRD loan.
126.    Medium-term loans totalling $h1 million are being provided by
two banks; the First National City Bank will lend $21 mil:Lion and the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Corinerce $20 million.
127.    Repayment of the commercial bank loans commence in 1972 and
the loans reach maturity on June 15, 1976. The rate of initerest is
8% and the commitnment fee is ½ of 1%=  The nommPercial bank loans will
rank pari passu with the IBRD loan and. the $80 million loans from the
insurance companies, and will have a term of 7 years including 21½ year
grace period.
128.    Falconbridge Canada and Armco also agree to provide all additional
funds needed to com-plete the nroieAt in the event of cost overruns.
Such additional funds will be provided on the same 60% to 40% basis and.
there i.s no liimit to the amount un to a time limit of JanLarv 1, 1974.
In case completion is not feasible or the sponsors decide to abandon

129.   Interim financing during the construction period wAill be provided
by the co-mmercial banks, which will establish revolving credits up to
$55 million. Falconbridge Dominicana will use the credi-ts to meet
payments between drawdowns of long-term institutional loans, and the
credits will cease with the final drawdown on December 3:l, 1971.
TLhis procedure does not apply to payment for constructioni and plant
financed by ]:BRD. The company has established tendering procedures
which satisfy requirements for IBRD disbursement.
130.   U.S. A.I.D. will provide investment guarantees to cover risks
against inconvertibility, expropriation and war, revolution and insurrection
on Arrnco's equity subscription and on all loans othler than the IBRD loan.
131.   In order to be eligible for U.S. A.I.D. guarantees, the sponsors
have organised a U.S. based financing corporation (Loma Corporation) to
which the loans of the commercial banks and the private institutional
lenders and the subordinated debt will be made. The IBRI) loan will be
made clirectly to Falconbridge Dominicana.
B. Financial Prospects
132.   Falconbridge Dominicana is expected to be in production in
March 1972 and to yield profits for that year. The expected profits
in the first five years of operations are shown below.

133.    The financial projections (shown in full in Annex 6) indicate
that the net profits will be about $4 million in the early years of the
project and w ll have grown by 1980 to more than $8 million. Depreciation
allowances (10% per annum on $180 million of the investment and
5% per annum on remaining $15 million) will be substantially exhausted
by 198L and subsequent annual net profits range upwards from $18 milliorn.
These profits are estimated to exceed $25 million annually after 1989.
134.    The yield of the investment to the company is the after tax
profits plus the interest on the subordinated debt for each particular
year on the total of the equity and quasi-equity.   For the first four
years of operations the yield averages 16.1%. The yield in 1976 is
18.3% and increases in 1981 to 24.3%. Th re mainr dpnrecia-tion allowances

135.    The discounted present value of the investment is 16.8%.
136.    In each year income from operations and depreciation allowances
create sufficient funds to meet the debt servicing requirements of the
company. In 1973 the portion of debt due for repayment in that year is
coverer- 2.01 times b,ty available funds, and in the three subsequent
years the projected coverage averages 2.1 times.   The repayments of the
lsrncei"nnr-m co..panies loans  -   4.nCp in 1076 and av-Iable f'u.nds in the
five subsequent years are expected to cover debt repayments 2.6 times.

C.   Debt Servicing Guarantee
139.    Alth-ough Falconbridge Canada and Armco are assured of A.I.D.
guarantee against inconvertibility, expropriation, and war, revolution
and insurrection and have the protection of force majeure clauses, it
may become necessary for them to assume debt servicing (see Section VIII).
Their ability to do so is demonstrated below.
Falconbridge Canada
140.    In the period 1964 - 1968 the annual sales of Falconbridge
Canada have increased from $74 million to $97 million, which is an
annual growth rate of 7%. Gross profit on sales have averaged 39% over
the period (see Annex 7).
141.    Annual net earnings after tax of the company have ranged from
$22 million to $25 million over the 5 year period with an annual average
of $23.9 million.  Net earnings after tax in 1968 represented 22.7% pro-
fit margin on sales.
142.    Since 1965 Falconbridge Canada has spent $100 million on major
expansion and modernization projects in Canada and Norway. Further
expenditure of' $180 million will be made on plant and mines in the
period 1969 - 1975.
143.    In its investment program Falconbridge Canada has seldom used
loan funds. Short-term loans from banks in December 1968 were $25 million
but there werei no substantial long-term debts.  The short-term credit
will be retired in 1969 while a small continuing mortgage relates to the
finance of company housing. Capital required for expansion after 1970 is
generated entirely from internal sources.  The debt to equity ratio was
at a peak of 17:83 in 1968 and is expected to be 0.1:99.9 in 1970.
144.    The company expects increases in profit of about 30% annually
un to :1970 as new projer-ts hPeGOm  onprative  Higher depreciation
charges lower the net profit after 1970, but total funds provided from
orprn+a:nnL nare, conicstz+.en+.tl  abnhaver tA T4nmllieonn in ^   vaor frrom 1970-

145.    Falconbridge Canada's projected funds are sufficient to cover
iL US  0 li/O aCLULLiyU Fa U.L  Mconbridge £LL1irc bL1  y '4.) t,.ir,,es in L79J7  adIU LJ'y
2.0 times for the whole of the first six years of operations.  In addition,
over the sa!t( period, the comJpa-ny canLLaintain the payrt,eat of dividendUL
at the current rate.
146.    The :Loan potential of Falconbridge is considerable as borrowings
are negligible after 1970. The company nas tne financiali capacity to
borrow4 and service up to $260 million, which is $150 million in excess
of the whole of the company's 60% liability to Falconbridge Dominicana.
147.    It can be concluded that Falconbridge Canada has the financial
ability to meet its part of the debt service guarantee included in the
Sales Agreeme!nt.
148.    In the Ancillary Agreement between First Nationa:L City Bank
(acting as Trustee for Loma Corporation), Falconbridge Canada and Armco,
a deblt limit of 45% of consolidated net tangible assets :is to be imposed
on Fa:Lconbridge Canada.  This is a debt:equity ratio of about 31:69,
and this restriction is more than adequate to protect al:L lenders
including IERD.
Armco Steel Corporation
1)49.   Since 196)4 Armco's annual sales in the U.S. and Canada have
exceecled one billion dollars. Sales outside these countries are made
through subsidiaries. whose profits are included only as dividends paid
to Arnmco.  Sales in 1968 were $1.4 billion and 10% higher than sales
recorded in 1967. Gross Drofit on sales averaged 23% from 1964 through
1967, but declined to 21% during 1968. With extensive modernisation the
comparny expects a substantial lowering of production costs and increased
proUtits from 1969.
150.    Annual net earnings of the Corporation have averaged $83.8 million
since 1964. In 1968 net earnings increased to $88.9 million, and were
$17.L4 million higher than the previous year. This conforms to the
pattern of increased sales and higher cross Drofit recorcled for the vear.
The nEt earnings figure for 1968 represents 6.h% profit margin on sales
after n1llow2nre fnr tn-r
11.    In 196A4 the cormpany e.mnbark.ed npnn an  fl+ensi-v expanqion nrl
modern,isation program which to date has cost $650 million.  In addition
loca'l ;mini-rn1 i+.1in m-  =v,rnr.dinr7 53 mrillifn or. fan 1cili+tie whlic-h are
to be leased to the company upon completion in 1969.
152.    Long-term debt of Armco at the end of 1968 was $241 million,
while current leasing arrangei,,ents with the Ohio .m,unicip-1ites addeda
contingent liability of US$199 m,illion.  The long-term debt:equity ratio
.LS )L41 Ur. UrLen'  "liabl es are h     L±U iigh anA 4the total debt:eq-uity raio
is 41:59.  These liabilities are well covered by current assets and the

- 28 -
it was in excess of 3.0.  The ratio of debt to equity has been rising
each year since 1964 with the increased borrowings for the heavy invest-
ment program, but is expected to decline after 1969.
153.    Armco future nlanning is based on a 5 year financial plan,
(shown in Annex 8) which extends to 1972 and estimates beyond this date
are not available..  The coiupann predifts a ilC increase in earnings each
year w:hich together with depreciation of the new equipment, create a
rapidl;y incre-sing, cash flowTT. Cpital expenditure is to continue at a
higher rate but only in 1969 is extensive recourse made tio loan financing.
Bevond 1969 c-ash flow is sufficient for ca t>al expenditure, repa,Trent sf
loans and dividends and should still yield a large surplus. The cumul-
ative surplus in 19   ic e.ected to be four tim.es Amco'^s contingent
liability for 40% of Falconbridge Dominicana's debts.
154.    On the assumption of a 50:50 debt:equity, Armco has a current
borrowing capacity of nearl US$1 billlon, which is $300 ri-llion hi
than the present level of total debt. Annual earnings are sufficient to
ser vice debt Increases of this magnitude. I  necessary, Artco has the
capacity to raise sufficient loans to service its liability to
F ' ~LconvDr-' dge Vomr,Linicana.
155.    It is apparent that Armco has the financial abiiity, in both
earnings capacity and loan potential, to meet the 40% debt; servicing
guarantee, should it become necessary.
156.    The institutional lenders to Falconbridge Dominicana have not
imposed. debt restrictions on Armco, but the parties have agreed that
reasonable debt covenants will be applied should Armco take over its
share cf the senior debt in the event of default by Falcon.bridge
Dominicana.
D.   Concessions and Incentives
157.    Concession arrangements between the Government of the Dominican
Republic and Falconbridge Dominicana were re-examined recently and
agreement was reached in June 1969. A memorandum of agreed stipulations
was signed on June 15, 1969 by President Balaguer and M4r. Marsh A. Cooper.
158.    The efi.ective tax rate on profits of Falconbridge Dominicana
is to be 33% with no reduction for depletion.



- 29 -
159.    Depreciation on the $15 million equity investment is to be
allowed over 20 years and depreciation on the remaining costs of fixed
assets is allowed over 10 years. However deDreciation will not be
charged in any year if it reduces the taxable profits below $6 million.
Depreciation disallowed in one year can be charged fully or partly
in any subsequent year, subject to the taxable prof'its in that year
beinge above the minimum.
160.    An income tax of 18% is to be withheld from dividends paid
to any foreign shareholder of FaLconbridge Dominicana, subject to the
tax being allowed as .redi t or deducti on against the shareholder's
taxation in his home country. At the moment this tax wouLd probably
apolv to Uriited States sharehol ders. hut not to Ganadian.
161.    Falcoribridge Dominianan will n2v an anniiua  fee of 114
on the outstanding balance of the IBRD loan to the Govermnent of the
nominic-an Republic for guaranteeing the loan.

VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS
162. The proposed project would be the most important industrial
undertaking in the Dominican Republic and would represent the largest
external invesftmPnt in any singRle nroiect to date including those which
are currently under consideration. It would tap a potential source of
nati ona:1 weal; which hit±herto has nott hbn e,xnloitefi and because of
the nature of the ore cannot be economically exploited without special
Process1n g whno ch reqTTires considernhle outlay and t.echnic1 expnerience.
neither of which could be supplied from domestic sources. The project
rwvould prode+. +bni   tth       ncnorm o,f' tfhe. coirntrv in vuarious fields.

the construction period, increasing total investment above the 1963i base
by some 12 p~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~erer.. ThL'e viarious ecor.omic benefits e.x ete to accu  to
the country ares briefly discussed in the following under three aspects:
Ia) gains in .oriL±      idLa,,  (b) fiscal bets; (c                ---JployII,ent a.I.
other indirect benefits which cannot be easily estimated at this time.
Gains iL Foreian Exchanr-e
164. Tables in Annex 9 estimate the net generation of foreiign exchange,
which consist amainly of construction costs (both ori,4inai aWnd subseL-ueU.-),
operatin; costs, corporate taxes and dividends on shares held by Gov-ern-
ment.  Construction and operatingr costs incLude the costs o^ purchasing
land, local materials and employment of local labor. The corporate tax
ie;)resents 33 percent on the tax-able income of Falconbridge Jo-nicana.
The latt;er is affected by depreciation over 13 years *if the tutal cost
of fixecL assets and over 2, years of the pre-operating expenses.  Di-Vidends
would be received by the Gcvernment on its hcldings of 9.6 percent of the
total outstandin7 com-cmon shares of Falconbridge D,minicana.
6.  Durin- the period 1966-1966, the value of exports from the Do.mnican
R.epublic averasedi P152 iaillion.  The average annual value of exports of
ferronicKel, beJinning in 1972, would be $462.4 million.
Lo6. Total net foreian exchange generated by the project range from 44.3
-rillion to over $11.7 million a year from 1969 through 1981, except for
1970, the year of most intensive construction work, when it will be
around $16.5 million. From 19d2 onwards, i.e., after the tenth year of
operatio:a when the depreciation allowance comes to an end and the cor-
,:orate tax increases substantially, total net foreign exchange receipts
will ranige from $16.0 million to over $21 million. The grand total of
foreign exchange generated between 1969 and 1991, i.e., over a 23 year
period, :Lncluding 20 years of operations, is estimated at $325 million.



- 31 -
167. From the point of view of foreign exchange benefits, the 23
years covered by the estimates can be divided into three periods.
During the construction period (1969-1971) there will be a large
inflow of foreign exchange, concentrated, according to present plans,
around 1970. This neriod will be followed by 13 relatively "lean"
years when depreciation and interest payments cut deeply into taxable
innnom!s. Finally; from 1982 onwards; taxes ani cnonsoillentTv foreign
exchange receipts will pick up considerably.
Fiscal. Benefits
160. Annual fiscal revenue of the Dominican Government since 1905 has
'~tTlflOn   1 71.     ' ll p-  nnn, n e n, 4 n no o-,   4r A n c  ,n. n o
0.e   e $1,705 '-L 9. l;on.  -L  aS-.er.ts or.J ncome   %.L V .J.A.a.. genera+ed
by the project would add between 1972 and 1961, an average of $3.3
mill4on per annum , and     ng. thAe subseq-ent I 1 years,  a yearly a-r-rage
of $12.2 million. The grand total of tax receipts from the project up
4.A  ±1  7±'  WUU±U.  U' V4J± - -1-i±±±±U
tIo 1991 wouldU bue $1,5 r,illuio.
169.  In adoit;ion, there woUld be dividends accr-i ng to the GoverriUfe±.t
as shareholder of Falconbridge Dominicana. Between 1972 and 1991 annual.
dividends would range from $0.6 million to $2.3 million and would average
$1.5 million.  Total dividends would amount t.o over $2d.9 million.  In the
estimated Total Government Revenue, shoam in Annex 9, dividends are cal-
culated on the assumption that all cash surpluses are dec:Lared as dividends
during the twenty year production period.   Moreover, nickel prices are
unlikeLy to remain constant during the period under consideration and an
increase would. probably exceed labor cost increases as the project employs
little labor relative to its size.
170. IL mnall amount of annual revenue is gained through the guarantee fee
for the IBRD loan which is calculated at 1 1/2 percent of the outstanding
amount of the loan. The annual amount is initialAy about $0.4 million,
but decreases as repayments are made, and amounts to $3.7 million over
the term of the loan.
Indirect Benefits
171. There would arise from the project a number of further quite
important benefits to the country which, however, cannot be very well
estimated at this time. They are briefly summarized as follows.



- 32 -
172.    The project would help to diversify the local economy which is
largelr agricultural.  In the field of mining. at nresent the onlv maior
operat-Lon is the export of bauxite by Alcoa, although several other
mining  onnes, ions have been granted and some prosnpeting is goine on.
Apart from being the largest mining and industrial venture, the project
wouldf r st+.imil na+t +.the  rowt7rF.h of' smanl l Pr  subshci Hi ary i nrd1u.stri e3s nsuch as

ance. Apart from the generation of income for those immediately con-
cerned, this additional employmen wo-uld also lead 4o various revenues
for the central and local government from income and businLess taxes.
174.    Finally, there will be in the country an increase in technical
SKills due to the training of Dominican staff as geologica3L, cnemical,
mining, electrical, administrative, etc. operators.
VIII. PROTECTIVE ARRANGEMENJTS
175.    The protective arrangements for the financing of Falconbridge
Dominicana eccur at two levels; protection of the loans an,d protection
of onerational cemmitments._ The Bank has to be satisfied in relation to
both arrangements.
176.    The loan from IBRD is to be guaranteed by the Government of
tbha D1min-iicnn. Paroiinr- TLons from other :n,1rrqes will be guaranteed bv
U.S.A.I.D. against specific risks mentioned previously.
177.    Loans from IBRD, the commercial banks and $80 million of loans
from the insura nce onmnniPs will rank equally and will be senior to the
$34 million of subordinated loans supplied by the insurance companies
and guaranteed by Flor.nbiridge Canada and A-rmeco against eommercial. but
not political risks.  The senior loans will be secured pari passu by
(i) a mortgage and mining hyroth.ec on F.teOnhrirge nomininana's fixed
assets, (ii) an assignment by Falconbridge Dominicana of its rights
ag-ainst Fr   , ^nn d-A CAar.d  nA A?mr-. iiunrdr +t-.' Rnles Agreement and of
its rights against Falconbridge Canada under a license agreement, and
(iii) a pledge by F- conbridge Can--ada- and AAw'^ +their sharp_s of
stock of Falconbridge Dominicana.
178.    Falconbridge Dominicana will enter into contractual arrangements

to purchase the whole of the production of Falconbridge Dominicana and
to pay full market price for the metal, less transportation costs and a
selling commission of 14. Falconbridge Canada is obliged to apply the
diligence of an agent in obtaining the best available price for the
metal or obtain the market price if such price for ferronickel becomes
established.
179.    Payments for sales will be made to a Trustee who will represent
the interest of the Bank, the other financial institutions, the Central
Bank of the Dominican Republic and the Loma Corporation. Ern the event
FaLconbridge Dominicana is unable to produce or Falconbridge Canada
unable to sell in any one year sufficient metal to allow Falconbridge
Dominicana to meet its debt services obligationp then Falconbridge
Canada will prepay for future deliveries so as to meet debt servicing
obliaat:ions. The liability for the nrenavments will devolve 60% on
Falconbridge and 40% on Armco.  The liability under the Sales Agreement
is to remain in force until all Fnnconbri dpe fomi nic2na's obligations to
the long-term lenders including the Bank are fulfilled. TDe liability iE

181.    During nergotia-L-CZ  full understanding was reached on the agree-
ments to be signed by the Bank, which, in addition to the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements, also include hle Trust AgreemUentL, the Com-,.pletion
Agreement, the Lenders' Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Substantial

IX.   CONCLUSION
182.    Tne project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
$25 milLion to be repaid in equal maturities of principal during 15
years with a -s year period of grace.

Or-E- rMEPARATION AND PROCESSING
1.        The aim in ore preparation is to obtain the max:imum rejection
of hard rocks and boulder cores of little value; to achieve thorough
mixing and blending of all the reta.ined material; and to give a blend
that will yiel.d strong briquettes for the reduction furnaces.
2.        Ore is delivered from the mine in large dump trucks which
normally discharge into the feed hopper for the coarse screens.  A
surge pile of 6,ooo short tons of ore will be maintained to provide
for truck delays.
3.        The run-of-mine ore is first screened to reject coarse rock
+3O",-30" material is screened again at 3" and the unders.Lze is con-
veyed directly- into three bedding stock piles of one week capacity each.
+3" mal;eria.l passes to an autogenous mill where a 'rubbling' action
breaks down softer high-grade lumps and abrades the nickeL-rich material
from the softer surfaces of the hard boulder cores.  The rock passes
through the end of the mill as reject, and the -3" material is dis-
charged through peripheral grates to be conveyed to the bedding stock
piles.
4.        Opera.tions up to this sta.ge are on a. two shift/clay basis -
the remainder of the processing plant will operate three shifts/day.
5.        Blended material reclaimed from the stockpiles by mobile
bucket loaders forms the feed for the metallurgical oneration.  It is
first subjected to controlled drying in twio rotary oil-fired dryers in
which mloisture evaooration is cnntrnlled to ield A dlust-free screen-
able product containing from 16 - 18% moisture, and is then crushed
and screened to i" before nassing to the storage bins whic:h feed the
briquette presses.
6.        Briquettes are formed by a simple gravity feed between the
rolls of twelve rofl-fvne presses - one press to feed each of twelve
reduction furnaces. The formed briquettes are conveyed to the shaft
furnaces where a      shuttle conveyror distributes a.n even charge along the
furnace top. Twelve identical furnaces are provided, the basic design
paramet.ers of which have been established by the pilot pl.t operations.
Each furnace has a gasification reactor which produces the heating and
rneliiririog gas h%r panr+tiacmuto  ofr nap.n.tha. (Fuel oil c:ould also be
used but this would raise the level of sulphur in the ferronickel.)
The teVi erature and reducing co.dio    inside the-
controlled since it is at this stage that the composition of the final
ferronickel is deter,ined.

7.        The hot calcined briquettes are discharged from the furnace
bottom into a gas-tight transfer ca.r so that re-oxidation of the reduced
material is prevented.  The ca.rs are hauled by small locorotives on a
track svstem to the electric furnaces charging platform.
8.        The hot briquettes are dischareed from the transfer cars via
multipLe feed ports in the roofs of the electric melting furnaces with-
out coining into atmospheric contact. There are three identical arc
furnaces of rectangular cross-section with a nominal power rating each
Of 1L,000O KVA supplied frnm three single-phase 17j000 IkT t.ransformers
per fu:rnace. The furnaces carry out purely a. melting operation in
which -the briq,uettes are m.elted and separated into ferroni-kel and slag.
The ferronickel is tapped at regular intervals into a lad:Le ca.r, which

ANNEX 4
FUTURE PRODUCTION OF NICKEL
1.        Production of nickel by International Nickel in Canada is
expected to exceed 600 million pounds per year in the latter part of
1971. Future production by Sherritt Gordon will decrease steadily due
to dec:Lning cre reserves.  Between 1957 and 1962 nickel was p mduced by
North Rankin Nlines and included under "Other Canadian." There is the
possib:ilitv that one or more of a ntmber of Canadian orebbdis 7nder
invest:igation by companies not presently producing nickel could be
developed before 1975.  Provision for this possibility is made ulnder
"other Canadian."
2.        Hanna Mining has been exploring nickel deposits in Colombia
for some time.  Plans to produce nickel in this country have not yet
been amnounced.
3.        After the Cuban facilities were nationalized in 1960, nickel
produced there was consmed almost entirely in Co .....ast *otntr-es.  It
has therefore not been considered as part of world production.
4.        A production facility is to be brought into operation in
Gulatemala by Inte..zational Nickel.  A mino-   holding in Jte operation
is owned by Hanna Mining.
5.        Le Nickel has been studying laterite deposits in Venezuela to
determeine the possibilities of a nickel mining venture in the countryis
central states. A facility producing 10,000 metric tons of ferronickel
may result buti production is not likely to start before 1975.
6.       irniand may increase its production of nickel if new deposits,
recently located, are mined.
7.        The Greek facility which started producing nickel in 1966 is
pa-ruially owned by Le Nickel.
8.        Yugoslavia will become a ferronickel producer by 1971 if
metallurgical problems can be overcome. This is included in world
production although there is a possibility that some will be exported
to Comnmunist countries.
9.        Roan Selection Trust is studying a substantial body of nickel-
copper ore in Botswana. As the orebody is probably sulphide ore,
metallurgical problems should be overcome relatively quickly and it is
possible that production could begin in 1972.

10.       In Rhodesia, Anglo American is expanding the annual capacity
of the Trojan mine to 8 million pounds.    The Madziwa mine, also owned by
Anglo American, will begin production in 1969.    A refinery is being
built to process concentrates from both mines and is expected to reach
full capacity bY the middle of 1969.   Rio Tinto will begin. production
at its Empress mine in 1972 at the rate of 12 million pounds per year.
11.       Substantial increases in production have taken place in
South AfriGa wh!re ninok>l i  minnet in  onniinntionn with platinum.  Since

in Indonesia. Due to the remote location of the deposits, the explora.-
tion phase is expected to take another two years at least and production
is not likely before 1975. The Japanese interests which already mine
nickel in Indonesia are not likely to expand the facilities there
because of concentrates and matte available from other sources.
15.       Nickel production in New Caledonia includes production by
Le Nickel, independant producers, the Kaiser-Le Nickel project which
will start up in 1970, and future production by the consortium of French
interests and I]nternational Nickel.
16.       The right to develop nickel deposits in the Philippines has
been awarded to a local mining company and Sherritt Gordon.     Two and a
half years will be required to complete metallurgical studies, and it
is doubtful whether production on a commercial scale will begin before
197h.
