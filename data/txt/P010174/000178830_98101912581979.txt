I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Pakistan has requested a loan of US$38.5 million
to help finance the Fertilizer Industry Rehabilitation Project (the Project),
to be undertaken by the National Fertilizer Corporation of Pakistan Ltd.,
(NFC), the state-owned holding company of several fertilizer production
and marketing companies (the NFC Group). The Project has several components
expected to cost a total of US$49.3 million, including US$38.5 million in
foreign exchange. The principal components are (i) rehabilitation and
expansion of the urea and ammonia plants of the fertilizer complex at Multan
and rationalization of other facilities at the same site (US$29.6 million);
(ii) rehabilitation of the Daud Khel ammonium sulphate plant by replacing
some of its equipment (US$9.7 million); (iii) assistance to the NFC Group in
developing and improving operations, management and training, including
through foreign operating assistance (US$10.0 million); and (iv) study of the
viability of additional fertilizer capacity in Pakistan which is to be
financed separately under the proposed Technical Assistance Credit recently
negotiated. The Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of the
Project including the capitalized front-end fee, and 78% of its financing
requirements. The remaining financing would be provided by the NFC Group
through inLernal cash generation.
1.02     This Project is considered by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) as a
priority project to help assure the continued availability and increased
supply of domestically produced fertilizer, and to increase the energy
efficiency of existing facilities.   Growing fertilizer demand and an
increasing burden on the balance of payments make it imperative to reduce
reliance on imports by taking advantage of any possibilities to economically
increase and rationalize domestic fertilizer production.
1.03     By supporting this Project, the Bank Group will continue its critical
involvement in Pakistan's fertilizer industry sector. So far, the Bank
has participated in the financing of three of the five modern fertilizer
plants in existence or under construction. A first loan (Loan 549-PAK) of
US$32 million was made in 1968 to Dawood Hercules Chemicals Ltd. (DH) for
new ammonia and urea plants; IFC participated with an equity investment of
US$2 million. The second loan (Loan 988-PAK of US$35 million) was made in
1974 to Pakarab Fertilizer Ltd. (PFL), now part of the NFC Group, to expand
facilities at Multan for the production of ammonia, calcium ammonium nitrate
and nitrophosphate. A third operation in 1978 involved an IDA credit
(Credit 846-PAK of US$55 million) to the Fauji Fertilizer Company (FFC) for
the establishment of new ammonia and urea plants which are now being commis-
sioned. Finally, under an IDA credit (Credit 1066-PAK, US$50 million)
granted in 1981 to finance fertilizer imports, a study of the NFC Group's
management and organization was undertaken.
1.04     Following preparation of the various project components by NFC
and its subsidiaries, the Project was preappraised in April 1981; its appraisal
was carried out in November 1981 by a mission consisting of Messrs. H. Harald
Burmeister (Chief), Roger E. 0. HeaLh and Turgut Ogmen (Consultant) of the
Industry Department. A post-appraisal mission took place in February 1982.

II. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A. Agriculture
2.01     Although budgetary and balance of payments problems have persisted,
the recent past has witnessed a significant economic recovery in Pakistan.
GDP growth during FY78 through FY81 averaged over 6% p.a. and a similar rate
is likely to be attained in FY82. This growth has been accompanied by a
recovery in agricultural and industrial production well above the rate of
population growth, currently averaging 3% p.a., and by a rapid rise in
exports. Exports increased in real terms by 20% in FY79, 22% in FY80 and
22% in FY81; during FY82 a further 10% increase is expected. Value added
in agriculture is predicted to rise by 5.1% this year, following an increase
of 4.4% in   FY81; in industry it may rise by 9.5%  this year compared to
9.2% in FY81. This performance contrasts markedly with the economic
stagnation of the early and mid-1970s, when the growth of GDP averaged only
3-4%, goods production, 1.1% p.a., and export growth was negligible.
2.02     The recovery in the economy since 1977 has been aided by several
factors, including favorable weather conditions, improved foreign demand for
Pakistan's exports, and higher domestic consumption associated with better crops,
rising rural incomes and workers' remittances from the Middle East. Various
policy changes (as discussed in para 2.05 below) introduced by the Government
have also contributed to the recovery.
2.03     Agriculture remains the economy's mainstay, accounting directly
for roughly a third of GDP, employing about 60% of the labor force and,
directly or indirectly, providing nearly two-thirds of total exports.
Agricultural land, however, is limited. From the total area of the country
of about 79 million hectare (ha), because of the mainly arid climate, only about
19 million ha are cultivated. Of this area about 6 million ha, mainly in the
North and Northeast, are farmed under rainfed farming systems and 13 million
ha are irrigated from a 64,000 km network of canals and 179,000 tube wells
around the Indus River. There are only about 3 million ha of exploitable
forest. With a population of about 80 million largely concentrated in the
Indus River Irrigation System, Pakistan is one of the poorest countries in
the world with a current annual per capita income estimated at US$270.
2.04     Agricultural  growth during the 1960s averaged about 6% per year,
mainly due to the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat,
increased use of fertilizers and increased supply of irrigation water.
During the first seven years of the 1970s, agriculture's growth, at about
1.5% per annum, failed to keep pace with population growth at 3.0% p.a. This
slowdown was due to a combination of adverse factors, chiefly among them were
several years of bad weather, inadequate price incentives for agricultural
products, poor water management, and inadequate agricultural support services,
including credit, research, and extension. However, during the last four
years, production performance was encouraging at an annual growth rate of 5%.
In part, this represents a recovery from the depressed production levels for



some crops in the early 1970s, and in part, the effects of recent continuous
acreage expansion. There were also some modest improvements in per-hectare
yields. The recent policy initiatives taken by the Government, and discussed
below, are also a major factor in the improved performance.
2.05      Despite the recent recovery in output, a number of fundamental
factors continue to limit agricultural productivity at levels well below the
potential implied by existing land resources and technologies already available.
It is a matter of concern to the Government that the nation is not self-
sufficient in food. The Government, therefore, has set as an objective of
its development plan to increase agricultural output by 6% per year in the
1980s. In spite of land availability constraints, considerable potential
exists for additional productivity by increased use of fertilizer and other
modern inputs. The importance of increasing yield productivity is now widely
recognized in the Government which is taking active measures to address this
problem. Along with increases in fertilizer production, Government support
for programs to strengthen research, extension, water management, credit and
other services in the agriculture and water sectors is being intensified.
In effect, in recent years the Government has taken a number of specific
initiatives to increase productivity. Particular attention has been given
to improving farmer incentives and input supplies. Support prices for all
major crops have been raised so that they are now closer to world prices. At
the same time fertilizer subsidies are being reduced to minimize budgetary
problems. Efforts have been made to improve the availability of inputs and
the efficiency of the fertilizer distribution system by expanding marketing
networks and by ensuring adequate supplies and timely delivery of fertilizer
imports. A better balance between nutrients has also been attained. A start
has also been made in improving extension services through the adoption of
the so-called training and visit system. Preliminary reforms have been
initiated to the agricultural research system. Improvements in irrigated
agriculture and water delivery systems are also being implemented. These
initiatives, however, are only at an early stage and major efforts will be
required to achieve a breakthrough from the problems of low agricultural
productivity. The Bank is assisting the Government in these efforts through
its substantial past and projected lending to the sector,
B. Fertilizer Industry
1. Background
2.06    Industry currently contributes about 15% of GDP and, during much of
the 1950s and 1960s, provided a major stimulus to growth. Although in the
1970s industrial performance almost came to a standstill, in the last few
years a significant recovery has taken place. Industrial output expanded by
8.1% in FY80 and about 10% in FY81. Much of the progress was due to an
improvement in the investment climate which seems to have been sustained
during the last three years as a result of GOP's generally more positive
attitude toward private investment, new incentives being given to private
industries, and recent major changes made to streamline investment procedures.
Together with an expansion of the subsectors opened to investment by the
private sector, GOP has introduced a number of incentive measures over the



- 4 -
last three years. These include: exemption from import duty for some
machinery and materials; granting tax holidays especially for less developed
areas; direct cash rebates for a large number of export industries; and
restrictions on the export of some materials required for domestic industrial
uses. Furthermore, in December 1980, GOP liberalized quantity restrictions
on imports. These measures have led to an improvement in private sector
confidence and to a sharp increase in private investment projects.
2.07     At the same time, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive
review of its overall industrialization strategy. It is beginning to
reform the public sector which has been plagued by low efficiency and poor
profits. Following major studies on the management and organization of the
public sector, and on the performance of individual enterprises, implemen-
tation of many of the recommendations of these studies has begun. The Board
of Industrial Management (BIM) was abolished, the number of sector holding
corporations has been reduced from 11 to 8, and boards of directors have
been established at the enterprise level. Some public sector units which had
little prospect of improved financial performance have been closed down.
Public disinvestment is being considered on a case-by-case basis. A mutual
fund has been established for the sale of equity holdings in public sector
enterprises to private investors. With regard to the public sector fertilizer
producers in the NFC Group, considerable improvements have been achieved and
production at the two new facilities completed in 1979/80 is rapidly approaching
rated capacity levels. Finally, high staff turnover, which was endemic in
the past, has gradually diminished as a result of more liberal pay policies
adopted by the Government.
2. Existing Producers
2.08     There are currently eight fertilizer producers in Pakistan.  Five of
these form the NFC Group, while the remaining three, Dawood Hercules, Fauji
and Exxon Chemicals Ltd. (Exxon) are privately owned.
2.09     The NFC Group comprises two large and three small production units,
all of which are operated independently. With the exception of one new plant
(Mirpur Mathelo), all originate from the 1950's and 1960's. They are: (i)
Pakarab Fertilizers Limited (PFL), located at Multan, Province of Punjab,
which has substantial foreign private ownership and operates a complex of plants
designed to produce 304,000 metric tons per year (tpy) of prilled nitrophos-
phate (NP), 450,000 tpy of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and 59,400 tpy of
urea; 1/ (ii) Pak-Saudi Fertilizers Limited (PSFL), at Mirpur Mathelo,
Province of Sind, operating ammonia/urea plants completed in 1980 with a
production capacity of 557,000 tpy of prilled urea; (iii) Pak-American
Fertilizer Limited (PAFL), at Daud Khel (Iskanderabad), Punjab Province, with
facilities to produce 90,000 tpy of ammonium sulphate; and (iv) Lyallpur
1/ On the basis of 300 stream days per year for NP and CAN and 330 stream
days per year for urea.



Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. (LCFL), which operates two plants with capaci-
ties of 71,000 tpy of single superphosphate (SSP) at Jaranwala and 18,000
tpy of SSP at Faisalabad. In addition, a urea plant of 96,000 tpy capacity
is being constructed by the Hazara Urea Fertilizer Plant Ltd. (HUFPL) at
Hazara (North West Frontier Province), and is expected to start production in
late 1982. The NFC Group's production capacity currently amounts to about
55% of the total capacity installed or under construction in Pakistan.
2.10      The Dawood Hercules plant, built with Bank Group support, is
owned privately by the Dawood family of Pakistan (40%), Hercules Inc. of
Wilmington, Delaware, USA (40%), IFC (10%) and Pakistani investors (10%).
The DH plant has a capacity of 345,000 tpy of urea; since beginning produc-
tion in July 1971, it has been a technical and economic success consistently
operating above its rated capacity. The company is currently considering to
double production capacity.
2.11     The new Fauji ammonia and urea plants were implemented with IDA
financial support. With capacities of 330,000 tpy of ammonia and 557,000 tpy
of urea, these plants are curently being commissioned and expected to commence
operations shortly after a 45-month construction period, compared to an
initial schedule of 36 months. The project is estimated to cost US$293
million, excluding working capital and interest during construction, an
increase of 29% over the original estimate.   Forty-four percent of FFC's
common stock is owned by the Fauji Foundation, an organization created by the
Military in the late 1940s to provide retired personnel and their dependents
with medical and education assistance; the Foundation's investment of its
endowment has generated funds which have allowed it to develop into a major
industrial conglomerate producing sugar, textiles, bottled gas and other
goods. Other shareholders in FFC are local public investment institutions
holding 30% of its common stock, the Government of Pakistan (2%), and investors
from Denmark (16%) and Kuwait (16%). The Exxon plant was built in 1970 and
has a rated capacity of 217,000 tpy of urea.

a/ Fertilizer years from July to June
b/ Production is assumed to stabilize at this level, except for a decline in
production, beginning in 1987, at two small SSP plants of LCFL due to
obsolescence.
2.13     Excluding the Fauji plant which is not yet in operation, the ferti-
lizer industry operated at an overall capacity utilization of 72% in 1980/81.
This overall rate, however, conceals wide variations among the various
companies. Whereas DH and Exxon produced at high levels of capacity
utilization, those at the new PFL and PSFL plants were low; at PFL this
was due to certain design deficiencies and high personnel turnover which are
currently being overcome (para 3.19). The PSFL plant began operations in
1980 and has now reached production levels closer to its rated capacity.
After the PFL and PAFL plant modifications contemplated under this Project



are completed and with the appropriate management support provided under the
Project, these plants should be able to reach a 90% capacity utiliation by
1984/85. Taking into account these factors, and assuming that DH and Exxon
will maintain existing production rates and that both Fauji and PSFL will
eventually operate at 90% of their rated plant capacities, Pakistan's ferti-
lizer production is expected to increase from a level of 637,000 nutrient
tons in 1980/81 to 1,062,000 tons by 1984/85, representing 94% of installed
capacity. In spite of this expected growth in domestic production, Pakistan
will remain deficient in fertilizer supply, with imports accounting for about
one-third of consumption by 1984/85 and 57% by 1989/90 (para 4.03). If addi-
tional capacities are installed by DH, now under study, total production could
rise to about 1,200,000 tons of nutrient by 1986/87.
2.14     Eighty-four percent of Pakistants total nitrogen production capacity
(including Fauji) is accounted for, by large, modern, energy-efficient plants.
For phosphorous fertilizer the situation is similar, where 81% of total
production consists of a high value product made in modern, large-scale
facilities. The Project will assist in improving the capacity utilization
and energy efficiency of the older plants.
C. Raw Materials
2.15     The feedstock for all of Pakistan's existing ammonia plants is natural
gas which is the most efficient and economic raw material for nitrogenous ferti-
lizer production. The FFC, PSFL and Exxon plants all of which are located in
the southern Punjab and northern Sind Provinces (see Map), are being supplied
with natural gas directly from the Mari field located in the same area. All
other plants, located in central and northern Punjab, obtain their natural
gas from the Sui Northern distribution network. The small domestic production
of phosphatic fertilizer is based mostly on imported rock phosphate. A study
partly financed with British Government aid is underway to determine
the viability of greatly expanding exploitation of phosphate rock deposits
near Hazara in the North West Frontier Province. Preliminary data from the
study, scheduled to be completed by year-end 1982, point to the inferred
and indicated availability of some 12-16 million tons of ore averaging about
26-27% P 20 at five different locations, which after suitable beneficia-
tion, coull be economically and technically suitable for fertilizer produc-
tion. However, the need for further drilling tests to firm up available
quantities, as well as processing tests to determine the adequacy of the rock
for fertilizer production, and the need for substantial infrastructure
investments in the mountainous terrain are likely to delay any domestic
phosphate production program there for some years.
D. Expansion Plans
2.16     NFC plans to study alternatives for setting up additional phosphate
production capacity in Pakistan, to be based either on the Hazara or on
imported rock phosphate, and for replacing the existing ammonium sulphate
plant at Daud Khel. Such a study, proposed to be financed under the Project
(para 5.35), will evaluate the technical, economic and financial merits
of several alternative projects, including a second nitrophosphate plant to
be based on ammonia produced from natural gas.



- 8 -
2.17    Investigations of natural gas resources, which are being carried
out with Bank financing, are promising. GOP expects to reach a decision
in late 1982 when additional gas resources are expected to be proven, as
to the quantities of gas that will be available for increased fertilizer
production.
2.18     As noted above (para 2.10), the other major expansion Droject
currently envisaged in the country is by DH which plans to expand its ammonia/
urea production capacity by about 300,000 tpy of urea. However, DH's final
decision on this project is held in abeyance until a sufficient availability
of natural gas can be assured, and until agreement with GOP can be reached on
conditions for new investments.
III. THE NFC GROUP
A. National Fertilizer Corporation of Pakistan Ltd. (NFC)
1. Organization and Management
3.01     History and Organization. NFC whose offices are located in Lahore
was formed in 1973 as a Government holding company for the four Government-
controlled fertilizer plants located at Multan, Daud Khel, Faisalabad (Lyallpur)
and Jaranwala, previously under the administration of the West Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation (WPIDC). Apart from overseeing the
operations of these plants, NFC implemented the substantial expansion of the
Multan plant, the establishment of the new ammonia/urea plant of PSFL at
Mirpur Mathelo, and implementation of the smaller ammonia/urea plant of HUFPL
at Hazara, which is still under construction. From 1973 to 1981 the NFC
Group's output of fertilizer has grown from 210,000 tons to 1,018,000 tons of
product. With combined sales revenues of about US$180 million equivalent in
FY1981, the NFC Group is the third largest industrial enterprise in Pakistan.
As mentioned before, NFC's principal subsidiaries are PFL, PSFL, PAFL, LCFL,
HUFPL, and the National Fertilizer Marketing Ltd. (NFML). They are described
in more detail in the following sections of this Chapter. The Group's corporate
structure is shown on Annex 3-1.
3.02     NFC's role toward its subsidiaries has been mainly that of a holding
company and principal shareholder, acting as financial supervisor, channel of
communications with Government authorities, and agent for certain bulk
purchases. Based on the recommendations of a study of the NFC Group's
organization and management which was undertaken by SGV & Co. of Manila (the
SGV Study) under IDA's Fertilizer Imports Credit (Credit 1066-PAK), several
organizational measures (discussed in detail in para 3.07) are being considered
which would enlarge NFC's role to that of a central corporate head office of
the Group.
3.03     Management and Staffing.  NFC is headed by a Chairman, Mr. Riaz H. Bokhari,
appointed by the Government in 1977, who reports through a Board of Directors to
the Secretary of the Ministry of Production. He is assisted by a small staff of
capable individuals who have been working within the fertilizer industry



- 9 -
for many years and who all played key roles in the implementation of the
large Multan expansion and Mirpur Mathelo projects. The NFC Chairman also
chairs the boards of all the NFC subsidiaries.
3.04      The managerial effectiveness of NFC and its subsidiaries has been
greatly affected by a significant turnover at all levels of its managerial
and technical personnel. The impact of this turnover is most pronounced on
the implementation, during 1974 to 1979, of NFC's two major projects mentioned
above. Although the substantial delay in the completion of the PFL plant
(para 3.13), and the delay in the completion of the PSFL plant were attributable
to many factors, the high personnel turnover at the two companies and NFC,
exacerbated by the drain of skilled technicians to the Middle East, was an
important cause.
3.05      The principal reason for the staffing problem is to be found in the
low levels of remuneration granted to NFC's technical and management staff:
these levels are tied to Government pay scales and historically have been
well below those customary in comparable private sector industries. In
connection with the Multan Expansion Project, the Government had agreed to
remove pay limitations to public enterprises as an important measure to allow
public sector plants using sophisticated technology to attract and maintain
the highly qualified staff needed to operate them. As a result, in 1979 the
Government began to significantly improve pay conditions in the two major NFC
operating plants by allowing them to raise emoluments for certain categories
of technical and managerial operating staff; further increases were permitted
in 1980 and 1981. These improvements have succeeded in reducing turnover at
the plants and it is expected that they will permit them to hire in the near
future the qualified technical and management staff required.
3.06       Since pay limitations were eased only for several of NFC's operating
subsidiaries but not for its headquarters staff, NFC has an insufficient
number of adequately qualified technical and managerial staff. The constraints
imposed on NFC's hiring capabilities are being liberalized to allow NFC to
retain and attract the staff required to oversee the operations of the NFC
Group's very capital-intensive productive investments, and in general to
enable NFC to adequately perform its role, including implementation and
supervision of the various components of this Project and the development of
plans for future new productive capacity. Agreement was reached during
negotiation that GOP will take promptly all action necessary to enable the
NFC Group to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial staff.
It was agreed that this will include raising compensation scales to be competi-
tive with those of the private sector fertilizer industry, employment of staff
on contract, and secondment from subsidiaries. The adequacy of the NFC
Group's managerial and technical staffing will be reviewed with the Bank
periodically.
3.07       The NFC Group currently employs 4,740 people, 904 of which are in
managerial and technical positions, 2,350 are skilled and 1,496 semi-skilled
laborers. Although staffing is not adequate at all managerial levels,
semi-skilled labor is excessive. But since semi-skilled labor is paid low
wages (an annual average US$1,200), the financial impact of the excess labor
is not significant.

3.08    Organization and Management Study.  The SGV Study mentioned in para
3.02 above, resulted in a number of practical recommendations for changes in
the organizational structure of the NFC Group aimed at helping to facilitate
its adaptation to the demands of large manufacturing organizations and of the
high level of technology with which the large NFC plants are now endowed.
The principal recommendations of the SGV Study include:
(i)  provision by Government of greater autonomy
to the NFC Group on operational matters, particularly
on the setting of compensation;
(ii) delineation of responsibility and delegation of
powers between NFC and its operating units;
(iii) restructuring of the organization of NFC and
its operating units and their alignment with recom-
mended plant manning levels;
(iv) development of integrated training programs for
employees, with suitable systems for periodical
appraisal and performance reviews; and
(v)  detailed review and revision of current management
information systems, accounting manuals, etc.
3.09     Although some of the Study's recommendations, mainly included under
(iii) above, have already been implemented, NFC is setting up a program for
those remaining to be implemented. It was agreed that such a program, based
on an exchange of views with the Bank, would be completed promptly.
2. Financial Performance of the NFC Group
3.10     Since NFC is a holding company and has no operating income of its
own, its financial performance has to be seen in combination with that of its
operating subsidiaries. Annexes 3-2 and 3-3 thus summarize the NFC Group's
consolidated balance sheets and income statements for the years 1979 to 1981;
the following table is a summary and reflects also NFC's and its three
principal subsidiaries' financial positions and results for FY81.

3.11      Since construction of the PFL and PSFL plants was completed
the financial results of the NFC Group have improved considerably: when FY80
revenues, including Government compensation payments to operating subsidiaries
(para 4.12), increased to more than two-and-one-half times those of FY79, the
Group became profitable. In FY81, net sales increased further to about
US$180 million and internally generated cash flow totalled about US$41
million, allowing the Group to service its debt. As a result, the long-term
debt to equity ratio improved from 75:25 in FY79 to 69:31 in FY81. As noted
in Chapter VII, further improvements are projected for FY82 and the future.
The liquidity situation of the NFC Group is now satisfactory, with a current
ratio of 1.6 to 1 as of June 30, 1981.

B. Pakarab Fertilizers Limited (PFL)
1. History
3.12      PFL was formed in 1973 by incorporating the existing fertilizer
plant at Multan, then owned by WPIDC. In 1974, PFL proceeded to develop and
implement the Bank-financed Multan Expansion Project which was completed in
1979, thereby substantially increasing the Company's productive capacity.
Apart from the Bank loan, financing was also obtained from the Asian Development
Bank, the OPEC Fund, local and foreign banks and the Government through NFC
to finance that expansion. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC)
provided equity and now holds 48% of PFL's shares.
3.13     The Expansion Project was originally estimated to cost US$84.4
million but ended up costing twice as much (US$170.8 million) mainly as a
result of sharp increases in international equipment prices following the
1972 oil crisis, higher than anticipated inflation for local plant items, and
high technical personnel turnover, wiich was a principal cause of delays in
procurement and construction; project implementation took 52 months, substan-
tially longer than the 36-45 months usually required to build similar plants
(Project Performance Audit Report No. 3582 dated August 18, 1981). Despite
the delay in construction and the large cost overrun, PFL continues to be
financially and economically viable, principally because product prices also
increased significantly more than anticipated as a result of world-wide
inflation and energy cost increases.
2. Organization and Management
3.14    PFL is headed by a Managing Director who is responsible to a Board of
Directors; the Board is chaired by the Chairman of NFC and consists of five
representatives of NFC and GOP and four representatives of ADNOC. Reporting
to the Managing Director are four General Managers, one each for manufacturing,
technical and planning operations, finance and accounting, as well as commercial
and corporate affairs. Total staffing at PFL is 1,752 people, 280 of which are
managers and engineers. PFL maintains purchasing and forwarding offices in
Lahore and Karachi. PFL's Managing Director, Mr. Zahur Ahmad Khan, has been
working in Pakistan's fertilizer industry since 1954 and at the Multan plant
since 1973. He is a knowledgeable manager who has proven his capability in
carrying responsibility for implementing, start-up and operation of the
expanded Multan plant in the face of considerable constraints and obstacles,
most importantly, the shortage of qualified managerial and technical personnel.
3. Production Facilities
3.15      The first production facilities at Multan were built in 1962 to
produce 300 tpd ammonium nitrate-limestone (ANL) and 180 tpd crystalline
urea, with intermediate facilities for 200 tpd of ammonia and 200 tpd of
nitric acid. Later, the urea plant, which continues in operation, was
modified to make prilled urea. The Expansion Project financed by the Bank
in 1974 involved installation of new facilities to produce 910 tpd of
ammonia, 1,200 tpd of nitric acid, 1,500 tpd of CAN and 1,020 tpd of NP and



- 13 -
was accompanied by the shutdown of all the old production facilities with the
exception of the urea and nitric acid plants; the Expansion Project started
commercial production in January 1979.
3.16     The old urea plant is based on Inventa (Swiss) design and the old
nitric acid plant was designed by C. I. Girdler (US). Kellogg (UK) was the
designer and engineering contractor for the new ammonia plant. Friedrich
Uhde GmbH (FRG) was responsible for design and erection of the nitric
acid, CAN and NP plants. Stamicarbon (Netherlands) acted as process licensor
for the NP plant and technical adviser to NFC during the implementation
period.
4. Production Performance
3.17     Recent performance of the Multan complex is given in the following
table, clearly reflecting the substantial increase in PFL's output following
completion of the Expansion Project:

3.18     Due to restricted ammonia availability prior to 1979, urea produc-
tion was consistently low; this was corrected when  the new ammonia plant
came on stream, allowing daily urea design capacity to be achieved, and the
attainment of a reasonable overall capacity utilization. However, several
sections of the plant and its piping and instrumentation have seriously
deteriorated (para 5.09). Without the rehabilitation of the urea plant
included in the Project, it is expected that the plant's performance would
decline rapidly over the next two to three years.
3.19     The performance of the new CAN and NP plants, both in terms of output
and product quality, is still low due to design deficiencies in the crystalli-
zation units which are now in the process of being corrected by the engineering
contractor. Completion of the necessary modifications is scheduled for late
1982. On the basis of pilot tests carried out, it is expected that capacity
utilization for the CAN and NP plants can be increased to 90%.

3.20     Annexes 3-4 and 3-5 provide PFL's summarized income statements and
balance sheets for 1978 through 1981, the period from just before to after
completion of the Expansion Project. The improved production performance
described above is clearly reflected in PFL's results with profits of US$5.3
million equivalent being generated in FY80 and US$9.7 million in FY81. In
1981 the company was generating a healthy cash flow of about US$29 million
equivalent, not counting an additional US$19.2 million in taxes deferred over
a period of eight years. PFL's current ratio was 1.8 and its long-term
debt-to-equity ratio, 55:45. The company's long-term debt consisted mostly of
loans incurred in connection with the Multan Expansion Project, including
US$28.5 million outstanding under the IBRD loan for that project.  PFL has
paid dividends out of FY80 and FY81 earnings.l/
C. Pak-American Fertilizers Ltd. (PAFL)
1. History.
3.21     The first fertilizer plant in Pakistan, producing ammonium sulphate
(AS), was built at Daud Khel (Iskanderabad) between 1953 and 1958 with
US foreign aid assistance. The original fertilizer plant's capacity was
50,000 tpy of AS, produced from locally available gypsum and coal; it was
increased to 90,000 tpy in 1969 by adding new ammonia and AS units with the
required utility facilities. In 1973, associated gas became available from
the nearby Meyal and Dhullian oil fields and replaced coal as feedstock and
fuel. Although the age of different sections of the plant now varies between
12 and 24 years, most of the equipment is in good condition and functioning
well due to PAFL's good operating and maintenance practices. However despite
careful maintenance, some items of equipment have reached the end of their
useful lives and require replacement; other items require major overhauls to
ensure continued reliable operation. The investments under the Project are
designed to improve the plant's operation and extend its economic life for
at least seven years without which the plant may have to be closed down
within a year or two. PAFL is wholly owned by NFC.
1/ As described in detail in para 4.12, PFL and other producers, under
their respective agreements with GOP, receive Government compensation for
the subsidies granted to farmers through fertilizer pricing in Pakistan.
Such compensation, which is recorded by PFL as income on an accrual
basis, amounted to the equivalent of US$27 million, US$62 million
and US$46 million respectively, for the last three years. As of
January 1982, a total of US$37 million equivalent of these subsidies
remained to be collected; once this amount is received, which is
expected to occur in 1982, PFL's financial situation will be further
improved. To compensate for certain deficiencies in the plant's
design, whose rectification is expected to be completed in late
1982, the Government agreed, for the purposes of computation of
compensation payments, to de-rate the PFL plant's capacity,
thereby in effect allowing the company to reach its 15% profit-
ability target at a production level of 61% for 1980/81.

2. Organization and Management.
3.22     PAFL is managed by a five-member Board of Directors headed by the
Chairman of NFC. The General Manager of PAFL, also a member of its Board,
has reporting to him six managers, one each for production, gypsum quarrying,
safety, internal audit, accounting and administration. Total staffing at
PAFL is 1,049 people of which 99 are in the managerial and technical super-
visory catagories. PAFL's General Manager, Mr. Chaudry Nazir Ahmed, has
considerable experience in the fertilizer industry and was Technical Manager
at Multan prior to his appointment to PAFL in 1979. The Daud Khel management
is composed of capable and dedicated individuals who take pride in the
continued functioning of their plant as is evidenced by the excellent
condition, considering their age, of the various units of equipment.
3. Production Facilities.
3.23      PAFL's production facilities consist of an original Lurgi (FRG)
coal-based ammonia plant, converted in 1973 to auto-thermal reforming of
natural gas, and a Koppers (FRG) steam-reforming ammonia plant, with a
combined design capacity of 80 tpd of ammonia. Oxygen required for auto-thermal
reforming and nitrogen for ammonia synthesis are obtained by low temperature
fractionation of air. 1/ The two gypsum-based ammonium sulphate plants,
based on ICI (UK) process design, had an original total design capacity of
330 tpd (108,900 tpy). This capacity, however, has been derated to an
official capacity of 273 tpd (90,000 tpy) due to the quality of gypsum being
poorer than originally envisaged. It is apparent, however, from production
records that the plant can operate at a production level of about 95,000 tpy.
The utilities section includes two steam turbine power generation sets with a
total installed capacity of 23 MW. Normally only one is operating at a load
of approximately 7.5 MW, which includes power supply to the adjacent cement,
penicillin and dye stuffs plants.
4. Production Performance
3.24      The table below summarizes PAFL's production of ammonium sulphate
since 1970/71 in relation to a design capacity of 90,000 tpy, showing that
for the last eight years, and as a result of the shift in feedstock from coal
to natural gas, the plant has been consistently producing at high capacity
utilization rates. Operations over the last two years, however, have been
characterized by a sharp increase in the number of unscheduled plant shutdowns
due to equipment failure that will significantly reduce future production
levels, unless the investments proposed under the Project are carried out.
1/ As a by-product, argon gas is obtained and bottled for sale.

5. Operating Results and Financial Position
3.25     Annexes 3-6 and 3-7 provide PAFL's summarized income statements and
balance sheets for the years FY79 to FY81. PAFL is one of the two smaller
NFC subsidiaries.  In FY81 sales revenue amounted to US$12.3 million and
total cash generation, to US$2.5 million.  The company's financial position is
sound, with no significant debt. PAFL has been profitable although with
significant variations from year to year due to its practice of recording
Government compensation for farm subsidies as income only when received
rather than on an accrual basis. Excess cash resulting from the high level
of operations described in para 3.24, has been declared as dividends,
at rates of 6%, 43% and 15% on capital, respectively, for the last three
years.
D. Other NFC Subsidiaries
3.26     Pak-Saudi Fertilizers Limited (PSFL) is the second largest subsi-
diary of NFC which operates an ammonia/urea complex at Mirpur Mathelo.
The plant which started commercial production in October 1980, has an
installed capacity of 1,000 t.pd of ammonia and 1,740 tpd of urea. PSFL's
production has reached about 80% of capacity and is now operating smoothly.
The company is headed by a managing director who reports to a board headed
by the Chairman of NFC and consisting of seven directors representing NFC,
the sole shareholder. Lyallpur Chemicals and Fertilizer Limited (LCFL) is
NFC's remaining producing subsidiary, with plants at Faisalabad and Jaranwala.
This company which is also wholly owned by NFC, produces 100,000 tpy of
single superphosphate. The facilities of the Hazara Urea Fertilizer Plant
Limited (HUFPL) are under construction with assistance from the People's
Republic of China; they are planned to have a capacity of 56,000 tpy of
ammonia and 96,000 tpy of urea and are expected to begin production in
late 1982.



- 17 -
3.27     National Fertilizer Marketing Ltd. (NFML) was formed in 1978 to be
responsible for sales and distribution of all the NFC Group's products. The
company has developed an extensive country-wide marketing network with
currently 1,248 dealers; it operates 31 warehouses of which two are owned
and the others leased. Partly due the recent difficulties in the fertilizer
transportation system described in Chapter IV, NFML has been encountering
growing problems in handling the NFC Group's output. The company's capability
of storing large quantities of product in the market areas has not been well
developed since in the past, off-take was never a problem. Total warehousing
capacity is currently 95,000 tons; after additional units currently under
construction at eight locations will be completed in 1982, the total capacity
will rise to 232,000 tons and thus to a level adequate under normal circum-
stances for the NFC Group's envisaged production.
3.28     NFML's income is essentially limited to handling fees charged to the
producers who in turn recover distribution costs from the Government in the
form of marketing incidental allowances. Due to the recent increases in
stocks and corresponding financing requirements, so far not reflected in
increased marketing incidentals allowed by GOP, the company in FY81 incurred
operating losses. Marketing incidentals are discussed in more detail in
paras 4.10 and 4.11.
IV. FERTILIZER MARKETS AND MARKETING
A. Historical Consumption and Production
4.01     Annex 4-1 provides data on fertilizer off-take, 1/ production and
imports in Pakistan since the 1960s which are summarized on the following
page. From 1962 to 1981, fertilizer off-take grew at annual rates of
18%, 33% and 36% respectively, for the three nutrients, nitrogen, phosphate
and potassium, while production increases lagged behind until 1979 when new
capacity began to come onstream. Imports have been increasing sharply,
reaching in 1981 a total of 711,000 nutrient tons. This level of imports,
however, was excessive and did not take into account the fact that NFC plants
were coming into production. As a result, large fertilizer stocks have
accumulated. This stock build-up was further accentuated by a reduction in
the rate of growth in fertilizer demand, mainly due to the Government's
decision to substantially raise fertilizer prices as a first step towards
eventually eliminating subsidies. Consumption has begun to grow again in FY82
and it is expected that growth will continue, provided GOP increases crop
prices to the extent required to offset future fertilizer price increases,
and adequate credit is made available to farmers.
1/ Fertilizer statistics do not provide accurate information on actual
consumption by farmers but only on "off-take" from plants and Provincial
Government agencies. These can vary significantly from consumption due
to dealer stockage which is subject to significant variation from year
to year.

B. Forecast Demand and Supply
4.02     Despite the strong growth of fertilizer consumption over the last
two decades, present application rates of fertilizer in Pakistan are still
low when compared to world-wide averages. Further increases in fertilizer
consumption are expected as indicated in Chapter II. The mission estimates
that during the 1980s, demand for nitrogenous fertilizer will grow at annual
rates gradually decreasing from 10% to 6%, and for phosphatic and potassium
fertilizers, at rates decreasing from 17% to 7%. These rates of growth are
consistent with estimates of demand made by the Government and by industrial
sources. The effect of the projected growth in demand together with current
production forecasts are reflected in the following table:

a/  Assumptions as described in para 2.12.  No new projects are assumed,
except as included under the Project.
4.03     In summary, during the 1980s, consumption of nitrogenous fertilizer
is expected to grow from 843,000 nutrient tons in FY81 to 1,652,000 tons by
FY90, i.e., at 7.8% p.a., which as noted, is below the rates achieved in
the past. Phosphatic fertilizer consumption is forecast to grow from 227,000
nutrient tons in 1981 to 692,000 tons by 1990, or 13.2% p.a. and potassium



- 20 -
consumption from 10,000 nutrient tons to 30,000 tons which represents an
annual rate of growth of 13%. On the production side, assuming that all
domestic fertilizer plants now in existence or under construction, including
the small expansion of the Multan urea plant to be financed under the proposed
Project (para 5.08), will eventually produce at normal industry levels of
90% of their rated capacities, the deficit for nitrogenous fertilizer,
presently at 31% of demand, will grow to 42% of demand by 1990, representing
688,000 nutrient tons. Regarding phosphatic fertilizer, the deficit will
grow over the same period from 74% to 91% of demand or 630,000 nutrient tons.
These deficits point to the need for further increasing Pakistan's productive
capacity for both nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer, and that there
should thus be sufficient demand for at least two new plants for each N and P
fertilizer or combinations thereof in the 1980s, even if the expected doubling
of capacity of the Dawood Hercules urea plant were to materialize.
4.04     In view of the above, NFC has initiated  surveys to determine the
types of fertilizer the next plants should produce.   Products such as
nitrophosphate (NP), mono ammonium phosphate (MAP), and diaimmonium phosphate
(DAP) are being considered; decisions hinge largely on the availability of
domestic natural gas for the production of ammonia.  Rock phosphate and/or
sulfur which, if not adequately available locally, would have to be imported.
As mentioned previously, studies concerning the exploitation of new dry or
associated gas resources and phosphate rock deposits as well as the production
of sulfuric acid are underway and should be concluded late in 1982.
4.05     Additional studies will be undertaken under the Project to establish
the technical, economic and financial viability of potential projects, and if
economic, to ensure that new fertilizer projects can be implemented without
undue delay (para 5.35).
C. Distribution and Marketing
4.06     NFML and the three private sector producers each maintain separate
marketing and distribution networks in contractual collaboration with a
large number of private retail dealers. Producers ship fertilizer directly
from their plants (or after intermediate storage in warehouses in market
areas, which are either owned or leased by producers). Dealers keep stocks
usually at their cost and under their responsibility until final sale
to farmers.
4.07     In addition to marketing their own products, manufacturers also
market complementing phosphate and potassium fertilizers; these are acquired
from the Provincial Governments' agencies responsible for distributing
fertilizer imported by the Federal Directorate of Fertilizer Imports. Most
imported fertilizer is marketed by the Provincial Government agencies directly
to farmer cooperatives.



- 21 -
4.08    Both imported and locally manufactured fertilizer is transported to
distribution points by truck or rail. Issues related to economically moving
fertilizer from domestic plants to dealers were studied by a Fertilizer
Transportation Task Force in accordance with understandings reached with the
Bank in 1978 under the Fauji Fertilizer Project, and again in 1980, under the
Fertilizer Imports Credit. The Task Force made recommendations concerning
rail and road transport, storage in the market areas with the necessary
handling facilities, and the use of unit or block trains. While transporta-
tion of fertilizer within a radius of about 300 km from the plants as well
as from railhead warehouses to consumers is recommended to be undertaken by
truck, delivery from plants to selected warehouses operated by fertilizer
producers beyond that distance would be by block trains. NFC has developed
proposals for operating schedules for such block trains from plants to
storage locations through end-1983, which were approved by Pakistan Railways.
GOP undertook to cause Pakistan Railways promptly to implement and thereafter
maintain adequate schedules for the operation of such block trains.
4.09     Road transport is handled by Pakistan's private trucking industry,
and the National Logistics Cell (NLC), established in 1978 by the Government
through the Army, which is operating a fleet of about 1,200 trucks throughout
the country. The NLC was very effective in 1978 in clearing the acute conges-
tion in the port of Karachi which occurred principally as a result of the wheat
crop failure causing greatly increased import needs in addition to other
incoming bulk shipments such as cement and fertilizer. Port congestion is
now no longer a problem but the NLC fleet continues to be available for
non-military purposes such as for moving fertilizer from domestic plants
to markets.
4.10     As noted before, during the latter half of 1981, substantial quantities
of fertilizer stocks built up at NFC's and other fertilizer plants. This
build-up was due largely to the over-supply of nitrogenous fertilizer caused
by excessive imports, rapidly increasing production at new plants, and a
temporary slowdown in demand. Part of the build-up at NFC's plants, however,
was caused by the company's inability to attract a sufficient number of
trucks to handle shipments. In late 1981, the availability of trucks from
NLC was constrained and due to seasonal factors, private truckers were
also overstretched and were demanding freight rates in excess of the amounts
approved for reimbursement by GOP as part of the incidentals which each
producer receives to cover such costs as fertilizer transportation to dealers,
warehousing, financial charges on inventories and dealer commissions. Since
the plants could not pay such freight rates significant amounts of fertilizer
were delayed in their despatch to markets.
4.11     Although adequate trucking transportation is now again available,
steps are required to prevent a recurrence of a similar situation in the
future. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government develop
a system satisfactory to the Bank for adequate compensation to NFC producers
for all costs of fertilizer transportation, maintaining inventories, dealer
commissions and other costs related to the marketing of fertilizer.

D. Pricing and Credit
4.12     Crop prices as well as retail and ex-factory fertilizer prices in
Pakistan are controlled by the Government. The pricing system makes a
distinction between the prices at which all fertilizers, whether imported or
manufactured locally and regardless of the producer, are sold to farmers,
and the prices which the different fertilizer producers are allowed to
receive for their output in line with their respective pricing agreements
with GOP. For those producers whose agreed ex-factory price is above the
price farmers have to pay (farmer prices), the difference between the two is
covered by Government compensation payments. Alternatively, this difference
is collected by the Government in the form of a Development Surcharge from
such producers whose ex-factory prices are below farmer prices. Ex-factory
prices are usually based on standard operating costs plus a profit tied to
the amount of equity. Such profits, whose levels vary from company to
company and range between 15% and 20% after tax (equivalent to over 30% to
40% before tax), are allowed if production reaches certain levels of capacity
utilization. If production falls short of such capacity levels, the price
per ton remains the same and profits are proportionately reduced. In some
cases, the unit price remains unchanged also when production exceeds stipulated
levels, allowing much higher profits and providing the necessary incentive to
the producer to maximize production; the FFC pricing agreement with GOP, the
most recently concluded, follows this system, allowing a 20% profit on
share capital and GOP is prepared to allow similar conditions for any new
future fertilizer project. In other cases, however, profits do not increase
with production above the stipulated levels. Although this mechanism ensures
the financial viability of a fertilizer producer, it suffers from the disadvan-
tages of cost-plus pricing by not providing some producers adequate returns
maintained in real terms or incentives to operate plants efficiently, or
stimulating the reinvestment of internally generated cash in plant productivity
improvements or expansions. This issue is to be addressed under the Study of
Additional Fertilizer Capacity (para 5.35) and continues to be a topic of the
Bank's ongoing dialogue with GOP on its structural adjustment program, where
the issue of farmer prices has already been considered.
4.13     During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
that as long as it controls fertilizer prices, it will set ex-factory prices
for the NFC Group in a way that will permit manufacturers, under conditions
of efficient operation, to meet their costs, service their debts, and earn a
reasonable return on equity which in the case of PFL, includes a reserve to
reflect the periodic revaluation of assets. Agreement was also reached that,
based on the findings of the Study of Additional Fertilizer Capacity (para
5.35), GOP will review with the Bank periodically the evolution of its
fertilizer pricing formula. In the Bank's view this should be designed to
(i) motivate fertilizer producers to operate plants efficiently and at high
capacity; (ii) allow them to generate adequate internal funds; and (iii)
provide them with adequate real-term incentives, taking into account interna-
tional prices, to invest in new plant and to reinvest internally generated
funds in the improvement of operations and expansion of capacity.

4.14      Annex 4-2 shows historical ex-factory prices and the marketing
margins obtained by the various producers in Pakistan. Currently, ex-factory
prices for urea, for example, range from Rs 893 to Rs 2,006 per ton and
marketing incidentals, from Rs 116 to Rs 165 per ton. These compare with the
current farmer price of Rs 1,860 per ton and the international price of about
Rs 2,500 equivalent per ton (cif Karachi).
4.15       In the past, the Government has traditionally set farmer prices
at levels that would produce acceptable benefit/cost ratios for fertilizer
use by farmers, whose crop prices are similarly controlled. In order to
compensate farmers for increases in the cost of fertilizers, the GOP has
continued to adjust crop prices, as shown in the following table:

4.16      In general, the crop price adjustments have been substantial for
all major crops. However, since domestic crop prices are still generally
below international prices, in order to maintain an adequate ratio of crop to
fertilizer prices, the domestic prices of fertilizers have been set at levels
below international prices as shown in the table above. Since most fertilizer
consumed in the country has come from imports, GOP has had to expend increasing
amounts on the resulting subsidies (US$225 million equivalent in FY80).
Under agreements reached in 1980 in connection with the Fertilizer Imports
Credit (Credit 1066-PAK), GOP is reversing the growth in subsidies to
phase them out entirely by 1985, by gradually increasing farmers' fertilizer
prices while at the same time adjusting crop prices in order to maintain
farmer incentives. As a first step, GOP increased fertilizer prices substan-
tially in 1981 (as shown on the above table), and further increases are
expected in the future.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Objective
5.01     The Project consists of five components designed to  rationalize and
expand fertilizer production of the NFC Group. The proposed investments
will help assure the continued availability and increase the supply of
domestically produced fertilizers at lowered unit energy consumption, thereby
contributing to satisfy a growing demand which otherwise would increasingly
have to be met by imports. Three of the Project's components, representing
80% of the total financing required, aim at rehabilitating, rationalizing and
expanding the NFC Group's physical production facilities and reducing their
unit energy consumption; the remaining two components are designed to help
improve the NFC Group's capability to operate and manage its facilities,
improve their productivity and energy efficiency, and to assist GOP in
undertaking a study for the establishment of additional fertilizer production
capacity. The following is a summary of the project components and their
costs 1/; they are described in greater detail in the following sections of
this Chapter:
(i) Rehabilitation and expansion of the urea plant and expansion
of the ammonia plant at Multan, combined with energy efficiency
improvements; cost: US$21.4 million;
(ii) Rationalization of the Multan plant complex, including installa-
tion of pollution abatement and monitoring equipment; the provi-
sion of critical spares; the modernization of plant maintenance
and training facilities; and additional product despatch equip-
ment; cost: US$8.2 million;
(iii) Rehabilitation, in combination with energy efficiency
improvements of the Daud Khel ammonium sulphate plant;
cost: US$9.7 million;
1/ Including adequate provisions for contingencies, price escalation,
and interest during construction.



- 25 -
(iv)  Improvements in the NFC Group's operational, management and
training facilities, including a program to employ up to nine
expatriates to assist management of the Multan plant complex, a
program to institute improved management systems and controls,
to study methods to improve productivity and energy efficiency,
and to provide management with training at foreign plants and
schools, and the establishment of a technical training
center; cost: US$10.0 million; and
(v) Study of additional fertilizer production capacity require-
ments in Pakistan. 1/
5.02     As shown below and in Chapter VIII, the Project components are
technically and economically viable and will contribute to improving NFC's
fertilizer production and assuring its continued availability on a regular
basis while reducing unit energy consumption at two complexes. The Project is
limited to the NFC Group since the three other plants in Pakistan currently
have no need for investments in rehabilitation beyond what they are financing
out of their own resources. Exxon, because of its internal corporate policies,
is not interested in capacity expansions. DH's expansion plans, mentioned
earlier, are under consideration by GOP but, if approved, would be appropriate
for implementation as a separate project, due to its large size. Both the
Exxon and DH plants are known to be well managed and have generally operated
at maximum levels of capacity utilization for many years, whereas the third,
FFC is just about to start operations.
5.03     By helping in the past in the financing of economically viable
fertilizer projects, the Bank Group aimed at alleviating Pakistan's reliance
on imports and the resulting burden on its balance of payments. The financing
of improvements in existing facilities as proposed in this Project will
allow the Bank to continue this role and its dialogue with the Government on
policies in the sector.   Also through the Project, the Bank will help in the
strengthening of the NFC Group's management capabilities.
5.04     NFC and its subsidiaries are capable of handling implementation of
the various project components which are of a limited size. The proposed
investments will not require the level of effort that was devoted to the
Multan Expansion Project in the 1970s, or the construction, at the same
time, of the new PSFL (Mirpur Mathelo) plant. Despite the outflow of experienced
managerial and technical personnel over recent years, the NFC Group has been
able to build up a small body of experienced, capable, and dedicated managers
and it is expected that the Group will be able to attract increasing numbers
of personnel needed for its growing operations (para 3.06).
5.05     Implementation of the various Project components will proceed
in parallel; it is estimated that the Project will be completed by mid-1985,
as discussed below and reflected in the Project Implementation Schedule shown
in Annex 5.
1/ The cost of this study is to be financed out of the proceeds of the
recently negotiated Technical Assistance Credit.

B. Multan - Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion
1.   Scope and Objective
5.06     This component has the objective of increasing the production of
ammonia and urea, prolonging the operating life of the urea plant and
improving the energy efficiency of the ammonia plant. Specifically it is
designed to (i) rehabilitate the existing urea plant and expand its capacity
from 180 to 280 tons per stream day while improving the unit consumption
rates of ammonia; (ii) provide for adequate spare parts inventories for the
expanded urea unit; and (iii) expand the capacity of the ammonia plant to
provide the extra ammonia for the increased urea production by adding a purge
gas recovery system and removing some other bottlenecks, which will also
reduce unit energy consumption.
5.07     The urea plant, designed by Inventa (Switzerland), was commissioned
in 1962 with a design capacity of 180 tpd of crystalline urea. In 1974, the
crystallization section was replaced with larger prilling facilities
but since other parts of the plant remained unchanged, the present urea plant
capacity remains at 180 tpd of prilled urea. Recent mechanical inspection
reports show that, despite their long service life, major parts of the plant
are in good condition, with many more years of additional life expected.
Some parts, however, require replacement and others rehabilitation in order
to assure that the plant as a whole can continue functioning for extended
periods. Also, the energy efficiency of the plant can be substantially
improved by reducing ammonia consumption per ton of urea production.
5.08     The urea plant rehabilitation work which was recommended by the firm
Cora Engineering (Switzerland), will be concentrated on the plant's older
sections which date from 1962 and will comprise: (a) renewing the instrumenta-
tion system completely and the electrical system partially; (b) replacing a
major part of the steam piping and some part of process piping along with
some exchangers and pumps; (c) reconditioning compressors and plunger pumps;
and (d) repairing the ammonia stripper.
5.09     Expansion of urea production  will be achieved by optimizing the
ratio and increasing the flow of ammonia and carbon dioxide to the urea
converters.   This will involve the installation of an additional carbon
dioxide compressor and ammonia feed pump, and increased capacity in the
ammonia recovery and recycle sections which will also be designed to improve
present unit consumption rates from 0.69 to 0.60 tons of ammonia per ton of
urea. Comparable modifications have been carried out on a similar urea plant
operating at Chung-Ju, 1! Taiwan, which achieved a capacity increase by more
than 100%.
1/  The Chung-Ju plant, designed by the same Swiss firm (Inventa) which
designed the Multan plant, was built in 1955-58 with a capacity of
90,000 tpy. In 1962, the capacity was increased to 200,000 tpy, with
similar modifications (engineered by Stamicarbon - Netherlands)
as proposed for Multan.



- 27 -
5.10     Spare parts inventories for the urea plant are depleted.  With the
assistance of the engineering contractor to be selected for this component,
existing inventories will be reviewed by PFL with a view to their replenish-
ment to the level of two years' requirements. Inventory management procedures
have been addressed under the SGV Study (para 3.08) and improvements are being
implemented.
5.11     Ammonia production and consumption within the Multan complex are at
present in balance. In order to expand the capacity of the urea unit, an
additional supply of approximately 60 tpd of ammonia is required. This
quantity will be secured by debottlenecking the existing ammonia unit
designed by Kellogg (US) and installing purge gas recovery equipment which
will increase the unit's capacity from 910 to 970 tpd. The addition of a
purge gas recovery unit permits production of the incremental ammonia with
approximately 80% of the energy input of the original facilities representing
natural gas savings of about 135 million scf per year (on the basis of
production of 910 tpd). Similar alterations were made with the help of IDA
financing (Credit 598-IN) to a Kellogg ammonia plant of the same capacity at
the Indian IFFCO complex at Kalol (Gujarat) and resulted in a capacity
increase of 10%, or 90 tpd.
2.   Implementation and Schedule
5.12     The schedule for implementing this and the other project components
is shown in Annex 5. It is estimated that the selection of the engineering
contractor will be completed by October 1982. Equipment procurement activi-
ties will commence two months after the start of engineering work. Civil and
erection work at site will begin by October 1983. Final tie-ins and overhauls
are expected to be completed during a planned but prolonged plant shutdown in
January-March 1985 and final commissioning, by May 1985.
5.13     Implementation of this component will be the responsibility of PFL.
PFL has experience from the Multan Expansion Project and the on-going project
to rectify the deficiencies in the NP and CAN units which is scheduled for
completion by September 1982. This arrangement is acceptable. For engineering,
foreign procurement, project supervision and commissioning activities, the
services of a competent international engineering contracting firm will be
secured. Due to the nature of the rehabilitation work, vendor's specialist
services will be used extensively for overhauling the compressors and renewing
the instrumentation systems. For civil and erection work, local contractors
will be employed. Temporary skilled workers will supplement PFL's maintenance
work force to carry out the overhaul work.
3. Raw Materials, Utilities and Infrastructure
5.14     It is estimated that this project component will result in a 3%
increase in maximum daily natural gas requirements, to give a new total of
51.5 million scfd. This is within the existing gas contract amount of 55
million scfd and Sui Northern, the gas supply agency, has confirmed that the
additional gas is available. Sufficient carbon dioxide is available from
the ammonia plant for the increased urea production. The additional utilities
required, i.e., electric power, steam, cooling water, treated water and
compressed air, can all be readily supplied from the excess capacity within
the existing facilities without compromising operation of the other units.
Urea bagging and storage facilities are adequate for the expanded production.



- 28 -
4. Employment and Productivity
5.15     The rehabilitation of the urea plant will ensure the continued
employment of the 80 workers presently employed in this section. As a
result of the expansion, there will be a need for some five additional people
in the bagging operation. Although this project component will result in
some increased maintenance requirements due to the additional equipment
installed, it is expected that the productivity of the maintenance staff can
be increased by training and other measures so that additional staff are not
required.
C. Multan - Plant Rationalization Program
1.   Scope and Objective
5.16     This component consists of the following investments aimed at
rationalizing and upgrading the operations of the entire Multan plant complex:
(i) pollution monitoring and abatement measures; (ii) provision of major
critical spare parts that have become necessary to ensure the continuous
operation of the plant; (iii) modernization of facilities for maintenance
and training; and (iv) additional equipment necessary for efficient and
timely product despatch.
5.17     The pollution control category includes: (a) chromate removal
facilities for the treatment of cooling tower blowdown which are required
after changes made in the corrosion prevention treatment to overcome severe
corrosion problems caused by the inadequate phosphate system originally
specified; (b) nitrogen oxide abatement equipment for the oldest of the
existing nitric acid plants, so that it will conform to modern emission
standards; and (c) monitoring equipment so that systematic reporting and
control of the sources of pollution can be implemented. Spare parts to
be provided for the NP and CAN plants will consist mainly of complete equip-
ment assemblies. In line with PFL's current maintenance philosophy, the use
of such assemblies for high frequency maintenance units reduces equipment
down-time at the time of their replacement. The assembly removed can then
be thoroughly overhauled in the workshop, ready for re-use. Facilities for
maintenance and training need to be upgraded to overcome the inadequacies
that presently exist in workshop equipment, instrument maintenance equipment
and facilities, and training equipment and materials. Equipment for the
recently formed inspection department is also needed. In order to minimise
the turn-around time for railroad block trains for product despatch, addi-
tional rail shunting and bagged product handling equipment will be installed
as part of the Project.
5.18     The above component will substantially assist in strengthening and
upgrading plant operations, particularly in the crucial areas of maintenance
and training where the physical changes included in this component will be
complemented by recent and ongoing organizational changes in these departments.
The training facilities are for the specialized training demands of the
Multan plant and will not duplicate those provided by the Technical Training
Center (para 5.32). This project component will be instrumental in ensuring
that the Multan complex will be able to operate at high capacity utilization
levels.



- 29 -
2.   Implementation and Schedule
5.19     With the exception of the pollution abatement facilities, this
component would be implemented by the relevant Multan plant operating depart-
ments, with NFC carrying out procurement of those items suitable for Inter-
national Competitive Bidding. It is estimated that these project items
will be completed by November 1983. For the pollution abatement equipment,
a package chromate removal unit will be procured through ICB; the nitrogen
oxide abatement equipment will be engineered by Uhde (FRG), the designer of
the other two nitric acid plants on site. Installation will be covered by
the team responsible for implementation of the Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation
and Expansion component. It is expected that the chromate removal system
will be in operation by July 1984 and the nitrogen oxide abatement unit, by
May 1985.
D. Daud Khel Rehabilitation
1.   Scope and Objective
5.20     During the past three years, though not yet fully reflected in the
production figures given in para 3.23 above, there has been a substantial
decline in the mechanical reliability of certain sections of the Daud Khel
plant. This is confined mainly to those units which were commissioned in
1958 and 1963. Since the major part of the sections concerned serve the
production train, the entire plant output is adversely affected and, unless
remedial measures are implemented, it is estimated that production will begin
to decrease in the current year and that the plant will have to be shut down
by 1985, at the latest. It is proposed that under the Project, these sections
be rehabilitated or replaced so that full economic production of the plant
can be maintained for at least a further seven years after project completion,
by which time NEFC is expected to have investigated and, if viable, implemented
plans for the long-term replacement of the Daud Khel plant. Preliminary
studies by consultants show that a larger ammonium sulphate plant of 244,000
tpy capacity would be economically viable.
5.21          Other objectives served by the rehabilitation of the Daud Khel
plant are to: (a) improve its energy efficiency; (b) maintain its skilled
labor force ; (c) maintain indigenous supplies of ammonium sulphate to those
areas of Pakistan - particularly the North West Frontier Province where the
alkaline nature of the soils, their sulphur deficiency and type of crops,
make AS a far better fertilizer than other types of nitrogenous fertilizers;
and (d) assure continued services supplied by the Daud Khel fertilizer plant
to the other factories in the area, including power and calcium carbonate for
white cement production at a nearby cement plant.
5.22     The investments to be financed under this component comprise inter alia:
(i) installation of a new boiler and subsequently, the retubing of one of the
existing two boilers; (ii) replacement of the existing boiler feed water
treatment plant; (iii) renewal of the converter and waste heat boiler
sections of the sulphuric acid plant; (iv) replacement of the three ammonium
sulphate crystal centrifuges in the old sulphate plant; (v) replacement of



- 30 -
the re'ormer tubes and air fractionation column internals in the Koppers
ammonia plant; and (vi) rectification of foundation vibration problems with
certain compressors.l/ The new boiler and boiler feed water treatment plant
will result in a 157% reduction (or 428 million sef /year) in the plant's
present total natural gas consumption. The list of remedial measures has
resulted from a review of present plant operations by consultants to PAFL
(IPROCHIM, of Romania) and by Bank staff and is based on minimizing the
investments required to assure continuity of full production.
5.23     The Daud Khel plant has been well maintained and operated so that,
with the exception of equipment to be rehabilitated by the Project, the
facilities are in good condition and are judged to be capable or operation
until at least 1991. Since no production expansion will result from the
project component, the existing utility and raw material supply arrangements and
infrastructure will remain unchanged. Similarly, the project would have no
adverse environmental impact.
2.   Implementation and Schedule
5.24     Project implementation will be the responsibility of PAFL where
a task force will be formed to supervise a selected local general contractor
who will be responsible for the installation of all major equipment. NFC
will be responsible for foreign procurement. A similar implementation
procedure is in use at the Hazara urea plant soon to be completed and has
worked well.  The major overhauls at Daud Khel will be carried out by the
plant maintenance department which is well organized and capable of carrying
the increased workload.
5.25     Project implementation will be carried out in two parallel opera-
tions: (i) the installation of major new equipment (boiler, water treatment,
gypsum grinder) which will require plant shutdown for equipment tie-ins
only; and (ii) the remaining work of overhauling and/or renewing existing
operating equipment that can only be executed during total shutdowls and
require a carefully planned and executed preparation period. It is estimated
that by prolonging the scheduled shutdowns of 1982 and 1983 by two months,
both operations can be completed by July 1984. The implementation schedule
for this component is included in Annex 5.
3.   Employment and Productivity
5.26     Implementation of this component will ensure the  employment until
1991 of approximately 1,000 direct employees (of which approximately 450
are skilled operators or maintenance technicians) in an isolated area where
no other equivalent employment opportunities exist.
E.  Improvements in Operational, Management and Training Capabilities
5.27      This component consists of measures to improve the operational,
managerial and training capabilities of the NFC Group. It will provide
financing to: (i) hire expatriates for a limited period to ensure that
despite the heavy losses in personnel experienced in the past, operations at
1/ The foundation problem has, in consultation with the Bank, been
studied by consultants (Soils Mechanics, of the UK) and found to be
amenable to solution by inexpensive established techniques.



- 31 -
the Multan plant are properly managed while adequate Pakistani managers and
technicians are trained; (ii) establish improved management information
systems and controls in a wide range of operational areas, particularly at
the new, technologically highly developed PFL and PSFL plants, study the
potential for improvements in productivity and energy efficiency and the
provision of technical and management training at foreign plants and management
schools; and (iii) establish a Technical Training Center which will help supply
the growing number of skilled manpower demanded by Pakistan's fertilizer
industry. The following paragraphs describe these measures in more detail.
1.   Hiring of Expatriates
5.28      Due to the heavy staff turnover experienced at PFL in the past
(para 3.04), a program is underway to hire expatriates for periods of one
to two years to assist PFL in day-to-day plant management, to provide the
necessary expertise in setting up new departments for inspection and mainten-
ance planning, and to help reorganize workshop and materials handling opera-
tions. PFL has been actively selecting internationally individuals to
fill such functions as equipment inspection engineer, process engineer, chief
mechanical engineer, NP/CAN production engineer, rotating equipment engineer,
instrument engineer and materials handling manager. Five of these positions
have already been or are currently being filled as a result of PFL's recruit-
ment drive in Europe and the U.S. in late 1981 and following the Bank's
appraisal of the Project. Candidates for two other positions are still being
sought.
5.29      In addition to managing their respective functions and developing
and implementing adequate operating controls and monitoring procedures, the
expatriates will be responsible for training Pakistani counterparts who
will eventually replace .'.em.  1.    cz... i .ed that th- .rxpatr;  's will be
required for an average length of 18 months.
2. Operational, Management and Training Facilities
5.30       The SGV Study (para 3.08) identified a number of weaknesses and
recommended measures to strengthen accounting, budgeting and internal controls,
to establish electronic data processing and other management information
systems and procedures, and to set up an effective human resources planning
and development system. The NFC Group has developed a program to implement
these recommendations as well as other measures and will undertake studies to
improve productivity and reduce energy consumption and will require the
assistance of both local and foreign consultants for the implementation of
the program.
5.31      In addition, NFC has developed a program to provide, over a period
of three years, 69 of the NFC Group's senior and middle level managers with
training at foreign fertilizer plants and management schools to familiarize
them with the latest managerial techniques available to run and operate plants
of the high level of technology with which NFC is now endowed; such training is
not available in Pakistan. This program is designed to include: (i) training
of 27 unit managers and section heads in plant operations, maintenance,
process engineering and planning who would participate in courses to be held
at overseas fertilizer plants providing hands-on training; (ii) training of
21 middle level managers in fields such as production, technical, marketing,
finance and planning to be carried out at international schools and seminars



- 32 -
organized by international fertilizer agencies; and (iii) training of 21
senior executives in international business and management schools. Managers
who are sent to any of these courses will be required to provide a bond to
ensure their remaining with the NFC Group for between two and four years.
3. Technical Training Center
5.32     As described earlier, one of the major problems experienced by the
NFC operating units, particularly PFL and PSFL, has been the drain of skilled
technicians to more lucrative jobs in Pakistan's private sector and the
Middle East. Since no reservoir of suitably skilled manpower exists in
Pakistan from which the NFC Group can draw to replace such staff losses,
there has been a clear deterioration in plant maintenance and operating
standards. Measures to train replacement personnel are presently the responsi-
bility of the individual production units which have neither the facilities
nor the qualified instructors necessary to adequately handle the number of
trainees and range of courses required.
5.33     The Project provides for the formation of a Technical Training
Center under the direct control of NFC, through a management committee on
which all operating units will be represented, to serve the basic training
needs of all the production units for maintenance and operator trainees. The
Center would be located at Multan, adjacent to the PFL production facilities
so that practical demonstrations can be readily arranged. The Center will
be designed to instruct 175 trainees per year in the 20-25 year age group who
would be graduates of the local polytechnic schools or hold equivalent
qualifications, and 25 experienced process operators for training up to the
foreman level. Since an important aspect of the training courses will be
on-the-job training (35% of total course period of about one year), the
physical facilities in the Center will be designed for 130 trainees at any
one time.
5.34     For implementation of the Training Center, NFC plans to employ an
experienced international consulting organization whose responsibilities
will include recruitment and training of the necessary local instructors,
design and provision of course material, specification and procurement
of training aids and equipment, screening systems for trainee recruitment,
and management of the Center during the initial two years of operation.
F. Study of Additional Fertilizer Capacity
5.35      As described in Chapter IV, forecast increases in fertilizer
demand in Pakistan will necessitate the installation of additional fertilizer
production capacities both for phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilizers. To
determine possible options particularly with regard to new phosphatic
fertilizer production capacity, GOP has agreed to undertake a study with the
help of foreign consultants which will assess (i) fertilizer demand prospects
over a period of ten years; (ii) the domestic availability of raw materials
for fertilizer production, such as natural gas, phosphate rock, and sulfur;
(iii) the technical and economic viability of project alternatives,
including transportation and storage facilities and other infrastructure
requirements; (iv) the amount and sources of investment required for new
production facilities; and (v) the current ex-factory pricing policies and
the adequacy of incentives provided thereby for new investment and for
efficient plant operation, presenting possible alternative pricing policies



- 33 -
for consideration by GOP. The study will also focus on the advisability of
eventually establishing a new ammonium sulphate plant to replace the existing
one at Daud Khel. Terms of reference for this study which is to be carried
out under the responsibility of GOP, are being developed and will be submitted
to the Bank for approval shortly.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost Summary
6.01     The total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$49.3
million equivalent, including US$38.5 million in foreign exchange. The cost
estimates for the various components are detailed in Annex 6-1 and summarized
below:

6.02     The base cost estimates (BCE) are made in January 1982 prices based on
the companies' and engineering firms' estimates as detailed in paras 6.03 to
6.12 below.  Physical contingencies are calculated at 10% of the base cost
estimate (BCE) except for the expansion of ammonia capacity in the Multan
Expansion and Rehabilitation project where 15% has been taken to reflect
possible scope changes.  Price escalation rates in dollar terms were assumed
as follows: 1982: 8%; 1983: 7.5%; 1984: 7% and 6% per year thereafter.
The same international escalation rates have been used for local equipment
and materials, civil works and erection assuming that the difference in the
domestic and international rates will be accounted for by adjustments in
the foreign exchange rate. The cost estimates for the various project
components are considered adequate. The cost estimates of the Multan
Rehabilitation and Expansion and the Daud Khel Rehabilitation components
include significant amounts related to energy saving investments. Regarding
the former, the ammonia expansion, with an installed cost of US$2.8 million,
will directly result in a reduction of natural gas consumption in that plant
(para 5.11). A 13% energy-efficiency improvement is achieved by rehabilitating
the urea plant (para 5.09) representing a significant portion, although
difficult to quantify, of the proposed US$16.2 million installed cost.
Regarding Daud Khel, investments of US$4.7 million will directly result in a
15% reduction   in energy consumption (para 5.22).  Following is a brief
description of the principal assumptions underlying the cost estimates for
the various project components.
1. Multan - Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion
6.03     The total installed cost of this component, including physical
contingencies and price escalation, is estimated at US$19.0 million equivalent
of which about US$14.5 million would be in foreign exchange. For the urea
plant rehabilitation and expansion (comprising 86% of total BCE), the BCE
was prepared by PFL and Bank staff on the basis of estimates by consultants
(Cora Engineering, of Switzerland) and actual quotations for main equipment.
For the ammonia plant expansion (14% of total BCE), the estimate is based on
the completed installed cost of a similar purge gas recovery unit financed
by the Bank (Credit 598-IN).
2. Multan - Plant Complex Rationalization Program
6.04     The total installed cost of this component is estimated at US$7.2
million (including contingencies and escalation) of which US$5.9 million in
foreign exchange. The base cost estimate was prepared by PFL and Bank staff
and is derived from data compiled by PFL. The pollution monitoring and
abatement equipment (44% of BCE) is based on recent quotations, with the
exception of the nitrogen oxide abatement equipment for which firm estimates
are being obtained. The estimate for spare parts (28% of BCE) is also based
on recent quotations. Costs for the modernization of maintenance and training
facilities (23% of BCE) are based on a detailed equipment and material list
for which budget type prices have been obtained. The cost of equipment for
product despatch (5% of BCE) is based on recent quotations.
3. Daud Khel Rehabilitation
6.05     The total financing required for this component is estimated at
US$8.9 million, including US$6.4 million in foreign exchange. The base cost



- 35 -
estimate was prepared by PAFL and reviewed by Bank staff, and is derived
from recent quotations obtained by PAFL for all the major equipment items,
and civil and erection cost data available from NFC's Hazara project.
4. Improvements in Operational, Management and Training Capabilities
6.06     The following table summarizes the cost of the various programs
comprising this component as described in paras 5.27 to 5.34.
Installed Cost Estimate of this Component
(US$ Million)
Local     Foreign       Total
PFL Expatriate Assistance                    0.2         1.1          1.3

Total Installed Cost                    2.5        6.5          9.0
6.07     The cost estimate of the expatriate assistance program (para 5.28)
for PFL is based on an estimated cost per man-month of US$10,000 to
cover salary, local allowances and travel.
6.08     The program to improve operational, management and training facilities
(para 5.30) is estimated to cost US$1.1 million, including US$900,000 in
foreign exchange. The management training program (para 5.31) is estimated at
US$1.4 million, including US$1.1 million in foreign exchange, on the basis of
proposals obtained from management institutions and training facilities.
6.09    The base cost of the Technical Training Center (paras 5.32 to 5.34)
is estimated at US$4.1 million, plus contingency and escalation provi-
sions and US$200,000 of working capital. US$3.4 million of the total would
be in foreign exchange. The BCE is based on data compiled by NFC from
information supplied by a number of foreign consulting groups that offer
training services, and NFC in-house estimates of building and pre-operational
expenses.
5. Study of Additional Fertilizer Capacity
6.10     Assuming it will require 40 man-months of foreign consultants to
prepare, this study is estimated to cost US$600,000, of which US$500,000
in foreign exchange (at an average rate of US$12,500 per man-month for foreign
consultants). I/
1/ The foreign exchange cost of this study is to be financed under the recently
negotiated Technical Assistance Credit.



- 36 -
6. Other Costs
6.11     Interest during construction on the proposed Bank loan was computed
in line with the anticipated disbursement schedule for the various project
components, until production start-up of the PFL and PAFL Project components.
Foreign exchange interest was assumed at a rate of 11.6% which corresponds to
the current Bank lending rate. It was agreed during negotiations that GOP
would on-lend the proceeds of the Loan to NFC at a rate of interest of 14%,
while not passing on the foreign exchange risk. This on-lending rate is
considered adequate to ensure that Bank funds are made available to NFC at
an interest which is positive in real terms. The Bank's front end fee
to be capitalized as part of the proposed loan, would also be passed on
proportionately to NFC and its subsidiaries.
6.12     Except for US$200,000 for the Technical Training Center no incre-
mental working capital will be required by the Project, since (i) at PFL,
current high inventory levels are deemed adequate to provide for the increased
inventory requirements resulting from the marginal increase in urea output,
and receivables are not carried by PFL but by the NFC Group's marketing
company, NFML; and (ii) at PAFL, production will not change from current
levels. The Project is exempt from taxes and import duties.
B. Financing Plan
6.13     The following table summarizes the financing plan for the various
Project components:
Financing Plan
(US$ millions)
Category                         PFL 1/  PAFL      NFC      Total

1/ Including the Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion, the Multan
Rationalization and the Expatriate Assistance components.
6.14     The foreign exchange cost of the Project (US$38.5 million) would be
financed with the proposed IBRD loan. This loan would be extended to the
Government of Pakistan at the prevailing rate of interest for Bank loans. GOP
would on-lend the Loan to NFC which, in turn, would further on-lend por-
tions of the loan to PFL and PAFL for their respective Project components



- 37 -
at the same rate of interest (para 6.11). The PFL portion (US$24.9 million)
would cover the foreign exchange cost of the Multan ammonia/urea, rationali-
zation and expatriate assistance components and the PAFL portion (US$7.1
million), the foreign exchange cost of the Daud Khel rehabilitation component.
PFL and PAFL would repay to NFC, and NFC to GOP, their loan portions over
periods of 11 years and 6 years, following 4 and 3 years of grace respectively,
and in line with the estimated life expectancies of their respective project
components. The balance of the loan (US$6.5 million) covering the foreign
exchange cost of the remaining components, would be repaid by NFC to GOP over
11 years after 4 years of grace. The repayment schedules of the PFL and PAFL
portions of the loan to NFC, and of the overall loan by NFC to GOP are shown
in Annex 6-2. Signing of satisfactory agreements to cover the on-lending
between GOP and NFC and between NFC and its subsidiaries, will be a condition
of Bank loan effectiveness.
6.15     It was a greed that the local cost of the respective Project com-
ponents (totalling US$10.8 million equivalent) will be financed with internal
cash generation by NFC, PFL and PAFL or from other sources as required.
GOP agreed to make available, or cause to be made available in the form
of equity, all additional funds that may be needed for completion of the
Project, whether required for foreign exchange or local expenditures and
independent of whether such additional requirements were caused by an
increase in Project cost or a shortfall in internal cash generation.
C. Procurement
6.16      All equipment, materials and services to be financed by the IBRD
loan will be procured in accordance with Bank procurement and consultancy
guidelines. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for equip-
ment and materials purchases, except for US$3.8 million of proprietary and
time- and process-critical items as well as small items costing US$100,000 or
less, to be procured under limited international tendering from qualified
suppliers from at least three countries eligible to compete for providing
such goods pursuant to the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Qualified local
suppliers, for purposes of bid evaluation, will receive a preference of 15%
or the amount of the customs duty for a non-exempt importer, whichever is
lower. Local equipment and services not financed by the Bank will be procured
under the normal commercial practices of the NFC Group which involve open
competitive bidding similar to the Bank's and are satisfactory.
6.17    In order to avoid delays in the implementation of the Project, the
Government and NFC have requested that the Bank consider retroactive financing
of foreign exchange costs for certain studies and front-end engineering
work by foreign consultants and down payments for certain critical equipment
prior to the signing of the loan but after December 1, 1981. An amount of
US$1.4 million was thus agreed to be financed retroactively.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.18    The Bank Loan will be allocated as indicated in the following table:

Totals                 24.1     7.1    7.3       38.5
6.19     For expenditures eligible for Bank financing, disbursements will
cover 100% of (i) foreign cost of equipment, materials and spares; (ii) the
ex-factory cost of locally procured items; 1/ (iii) the foreign cost of
services for training and management improvement; (iv) the front end fee;
and (v) interest on the loan incurred during construction.
6.20     As shown on Annex 6-3, disbursement is expected to be completed by
December 31, 1985. Since this Project involves only minor components with
short lead times and for which preparations are already well advanced, the
projected Bank disbursements of this loan would take place over a shorter
period than is typical for projects in this sector and as reflected in the
corresponding Bank disbursement profiles developed largely on the basis of
new projects or plant expansions.
1/ Due to the limited capabilities of Pakistani industry, local procurement
under ICB is expected to be negligible.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A. Summary
7.01     The financial analysis which was prepared in current terms, focuses
mainly on the Project's two production components, i.e. the Multan Ammonia/Urea
Rehabilitation and Expansion and the Daul Khel Rehabilitation; in addition,
the impact of the financing of all components on NFC, the holding company,
has been assessed. The principal assumptions used in the financial analyses
are detailed in Annex 7-1; salient features are described in the following
sections. The financial projections of NFC, PFL and PAFL indicate that the
cash generation and financial structures of the companies will continue to be
sound.
B.  Multan - Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion
1.    Revenues
7.02     Ex-factory fertilizer prices, as noted earlier, are set by the
Government. PFL's sales proceeds based on farm prices currently are below
the levels required to obtain a 15% after tax profit on equity (para 4.12).
The difference is made up in the form of compensation payments by the Government.
As reflected in agreements reached under the Fertilizer Import Credit (1066-PAK),
it is expected that the Government will continue to gradually raise farm
fertilizer prices to bring them closer to international levels and until the
need for farm subsidies on domestically produced and imported fertilizer
is eliminated; these farm price increases are projected to raise PFL's
sales revenues by 1983 to levels that will generate net profits in excess
of 15%; therefore, beginning in 1983, the Company is expected every year to
pay to GOP development surcharges to absorb this excess.
7.03     It is assumed that without implementation of the Project, urea
production at Multan will decrease and eventually cease by 1986, as it
cannot be economically sustained. With Project implementation, urea produc-
tion and sales are expected to rise from a level of 180 to 280 tons per day
by 1984 at which level they would continue. Production levels at the NP and
CAN units will not be affected by the Project; they will, however, increase
following completion of the design modifications to the existing NP/CAN
plants, currently underway (para 3.19).
2. Production Costs
7.04     The unit cost of natural gas, both as feed stock for ammonia
production and as principal source of energy for the whole Multan plant,
is assumed to increase by 25% per year (in nominal terms) from the 1981
level of Rs 8.16 (US$0.816) per mscf. 1/ Without implementation of the
Project, maintenance costs at the urea plant are assumed to continue
increasing in line with the trend experienced in the recent past. All other
local costs , including labor, are estimated to increase in line with the
1/ This compares with an economic value of gas of US$4.09 per mscf in
1981 (para 8.04).

currently expected local overall rates of inflation, which are projected to
gradually decrease from an annual rate of 12% in 1982 to 8% in 1985 and
therafter. Project depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis for
an assumed ten-year life. The following table illustrates the composition of
PFL's total production cost, summarizing those for FY87, the year when the urea
plant is assumed to have reached its full capacity production:
PFL - FY87 Production Costs
(in current prices)
Rs Million      % of Total
Variable Costs
Natural Gas                               186            14
Phosphate Rock                            277            20
Bagging and Other Costs                   268            19
Fixed Cost
Natural Gas                               255            18
Labor                                      77              5
Depreciation                              227            16
Maintenance and Other                     118             8
Total Production Costs                    1,408           100
7.05     The table shows that natural gas, accounting for about 32% of the
total is the principal cost item. Depreciation, despite the large cost
overrun incurred with the previous Expansion Project, only represents 16%,
and labor, despite PFL's excess staffing, a marginal 5%.
3. Financial Projections
7.06    Annex 7-2 presents the projected income statements for PFL, both,
with and without the Multan Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion component;
Annexes 7-3 and 7-4 show PFL's projected Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements,
including the effect of this component. 1/ The following table highlights
the principal aspects of the projections:

a/ Including Government compensation payments and net of surcharges.
7.07      The above table indicates that the Project will have a positive
impact on PFL's production levels and total cash generation. Total cash
generation with the Project would amount to US$377 million in FY86, compared
to US$335 million without the Project. This difference is not substantial
since the component's scope is limited in relation to the size of the company.
The Project has no impact on net profits, due to the GOP's ex-factory pricing
system (para 4.12).
7.08     The projections show that following project completion, the financial
situation of PFL will continue to be sound, with the current ratio remaining
above 2.0 and the long-term-debt-to-equity ratio, better than 31:69. When
incorporating the financial impact on PFL of the Multan Rationalization and
Expatriate Assistance components, these ratios would not change significantly:
the current ratio would remain unchanged and the long-term-debt-to-equity
ratio would decrease slightly, to 35:65. The company's cash flow is projected
at levels adequate to finance local project costs for this component.

C. Daud Khel Rehabilitation
1.    Revenues
7.09      It is assumed that without implementation of this Project component,
ammonium sulphate production at Daud Khel would gradually decrease and
eventually cease by FY85 due to the deterioration of critical sections of the
plant. Following implementation of the proposed Project, except during the
FY84 construction phase, PAFL's production and sales will be maintained
substantially at present levels until FY91 when they will begin to decrease
due to obsolescence of the facilities not rehabilitated under the Project.
2.   Production Costs
7.10     Production costs are projected on essentially the same assumptions
used for PFL (para 7.04), except that fixed Project assets are depreciated
over seven years. The following table summarizes the principal production
costs for PAFL for FY85, the year when the plant will have reached its full
capacity production:

projections without the Project for the years FY82 through FY85 which is
projected to be PAFL's last year of operation, in case the Project were not
implemented. The following table highlights the principal aspects of these
projections:

a/ Including Government compensation payments
7.12      The rehabilitation component would allow PAFL to maintain a healthy
financial situation, with cash generation at Rs 32 million per year.
PAFL currently has no debt of significance, and its fixed assets will be
fully written off by FY84. The debt to be contracted for the Project will
not overload the financial structure of the Company. Its debt/equity ratio
will be satisfactory, going down to 27:73 by FY87. The current ratio is
projected to remain above 2.0.
D. NFC
7.13      The following financial analysis reflects the impact of the Project
on NFC, the parent company. Annex 7-8 shows NFC's financial projections
in detail. In line with current GOP policy, all debt to be incurred by PFL
and PAFL in connection with the Project will, as noted above, be contracted
by NFC and on-lent on the same terms and conditions to the subsidiaries. The
impact of the total amount of the proposed Bank loan is thus reflected in the
projections of NFC, which are summarized in the following table:

Current Ratio                         1.7       2.6      3.5       4.4       5.7
Long-Term Debt-to-Equity Ratio   59:61    53:47    46:54    39:61    31:69
7.14     NFC's income consists of dividends and interest received from
subsidiaries;  expenses are mostly financial charges on its debt to the
Government and domestic financial institutions fully repayable by 2005.
NFC's existing assets consist mainly of investments in and loans to sub-
sidiaries, the latter to be repaid fully by 1985.  The Company's financial
situation is sound, with the long-term-debt-to-equity ratio projected to
gradually decrease from the FY81 level of 63:37 to 31:69 by FY90. The
proposed Project would have a positive, though limited, impact on NFC's
financial situation. Projections show the potential build-up of excess cash
balances which would be available for the NFC project component or, if
required, to finance cost overruns in this or the other components, for
future new investments, for pre-payment of debt, or for payment of dividends
to the Government.
E. Financial Rates of Return
7.15      The cost and benefit streams used in computing the financial
rates of return for the two operational project components are shown on
Attachment 3 to Annex 7-1. The real-term incremental financial return for the
Multan Ammonia/Urea Rehabilitation and Expansion is 7% and for the Daud Khel
Rehabilitation component, due to the comparatively low investment require-
ments for this component and its strong impact on PAFL's continued operations,
18%. These rates which are modest, particularly when compared to the incre-
mental economic returns of 54% (urea) and 96% (ammonia) for the Multan, and
33% for the Daud Khel components (Chapter VIII), should be seen in the
context of the controlled pricing environment in which the NFC Group operates.
It should be noted, however, that though the financial returns are low, they
are also stable, with minimum posibilities that downward variations will take
place. This is because the Government's pricing system is designd to compen-
sate efficient producers for variations in capital and operating costs.
For this reason, no sensitivity tests have been performed for the financial
rates of return.



- 45 -
F. Financial Covenants
7.16     It was agreed that covenants normally applied to Bank loans for
industrial projects will be applied to all three companies, NFC, PFL and
PAFL; they will be substantially in line with those agreed between the Bank
and PFL under the Multan Fertilizer Expansion Project. Specifically, agreement
was reached that among others, (i) no additional long-term debt shall be
incurred if in the case of PFL and PAFL, each company's net revenues for the
year preceding their incurrence shall be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirements for any succeeding year, and in the case of NFC, 1.2
times until FY87 and 1.3 times thereafter on a consolidated basis; (ii) no
dividends shall  be paid unless the current ratio, after giving effect to
such action, will be less than 1.5; (iii) a current ratio of at least 1.2 is
maintained at all times; and (iv) the ratio of long-term debt-to-equity does
not exceed 65:35 after project completion.
7.17      Agreement was furthermore reached that until Project completion,
and except for the expenditures in relation to completing the  Project, PFL
will not incur capital expenditures exceeding US$4 million equivalent, and
that such expenditures for PAFL be limited to US$2 million equivalent and for
the NFC Group as a whole, to US$25 million equivalent, unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank. Agreement was also reached with the Government that
compensation payments to NFC's subsidiaries on account of farm subsidies will
be paid promptly.
G. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.18      NFC, PFL and PAFL will be required to submit to the Bank annual
reports audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, within
six months of the end of each fiscal year. Companies will be told to give
prompt attention to audit recommendations. 1/ In addition to annual audit
reports, companies will submit quarterly financial statements within 45 days
after the end of each quarter, and monthly progress and procurement status
reports within 30 days of the end of each month during project implementation.
NFC will provide annual financial statements on a consolidated basis. Finally,
within four months after the Closing Date, NFC will prepare and furnish to
the Bank a Completion Report on the Project, dealing with its implementation,
initial operation and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be
derived therefrom.
H. Risks
7.19     Risks associated with Project technology, start-up and operations
are not significant as all components are based on commercially proven
technology. Commissioning problems after rehabilitation and difficulties in
attaining and maintaining a high operating rate cannot be ruled out. However,
considering the involvement of experienced and established engineering firms
in the design, engineering and commissioning of the Project, the risk of abnormal
problems, shut-downs and low operating rates is not considered serious.
1/  Audit reports submitted recently by PFL under the Multan Expansion
Project have been satisfactory and were prepared promptly.



- 46 -
7.20     The main risk facing the Project is the possibility of delays in
implementation due to management deficiencies. However, this risk will be reduced
with the strengthening of the operational staff and at Multan, the hiring of
expatriates and the involvement of the engineering firms for project design and
implementation. Management aspects at NFC, PFL and PAFL will require continuous
monitoring by the Bank. Given the sensitivity of the economic rate of return
of PAFL to adverse variations in revenues and cost (para 8.09), there is the
risk that the Daud Khel project component may show a low economic rate of
return. This risk, however, should be accepted for the reason given in para
8.10; to minimize it this component will be closely monitored. No commercial
risk is foreseen. Even on the basis of a conservative market forecast, the
country will continue to be deficit in fertilizer.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Justification
8.01      As described in Chapter IV, Pakistan's past consumption of ferti-
lizer has been growing rapidly. Growth is forecast to continue, albeit
at a slower pace, but still resulting in a rapidly increasing shortfall
in domestic supply unless existing production is supplemented by additional
capacities. In the meantime, the need for imports will keep growing, and it
is estimated that by 1990, some 688,000 nutrient tons of nitrogen and 630,000
nutrient tons of phosphate fertilizer will need to be acquired abroad. The
introduction of additional production capacity in Pakistan may be facilitated
by the development of new natural gas reserves, and possibly, rock phosphate
deposits and a domestic source of sulphuric acid, all currently under
investigation.
8.02      The proposed rehabilitation and expansion of the Multan ammonia/
urea and the Daud Khel ammonium sulphate plants will start to narrow the gap
between demand and domestic supply; they are expected to be supplemented in
future years by the installation of new plants, a subject to be addressed by
the Study of Additional Fertilizer Capacity, another component of this
Project. The Project will also lead to substantial improvements in the
energy efficiency of the two fertilizer complexes.
8.03      The NFC Group is the largest fertilizer producer in Pakistan
and has the responsibility of assuring that its production facilities are
used at maximum capacity levels. In the past, staffing problems have greatly
contributed to jeopardizing the attainment of this goal. Strengthening
management and staffing by implementing the various measures addressed under
the Project is thus of importance if the targeted high capacity utilization
at all NFC plants is to be attained and maintained.
B. Economic Prices of Fertilizers and Production Inputs
8.04      World fertilizer prices have fluctuated widely in the past.  This
was often caused by over-investment in new production facilities when inter-
national prices were high, and the postponement or cancellation of investments
when prices were falling. Fertilizer prices peaked in 1974/1975 and subs-
equently declined sharply due to reduced imports of fertilizer by countries
which had accumulated stocks during the preceding years, as well as the substan-
tial investments stimulated by high prices in the early 1970's. Since 1976,
prices have been generally rising and are expected by the Bank to continue doing
so until 1985 when they are assumed to have reached their long-term equili-
brium level; thereafter, price movements would follow changes in energy



- 47 -
price levels. Current projections 1/ assume that the price for urea (per ton,
bagged, fob at exporting countries, in 1980 terms) will rise from the late-1981
level of about US$230 to US$268 by 1985 and US$282 by 1990. The price for
ammonium sulphate is expected to move in a similar pattern, from currently
US$114 to US$136 by 1985 and US$147 by 1990. This latter projection for AS is
conservative: because of the likely decrease in world AS supplies, prices
could well increase more rapidly than those of urea. Furthermore, base case
projections for AS prices assume that AS will not enjoy any premium, on a
nutrient basis, over urea, even though in the past premiums of an average 15%
were common. The above fob prices, plus charges for international and local
freight to the main consumption areas, transport insurance and local port
handling, are used in the economic analysis, as detailed in Annex 8-1 which
describes basic assumptions used in the economic analysis.  Economic prices
for imported inputs (rock phosphate, sulphur) are calculated in a similar
way. Natural gas is shadow-priced on the basis of its value in the production
of urea in Pakistan, assuming urea to be valued at border prices. On this
basis, natural gas is valued at US$4.09 per million scf in 1981 and projected
to rise to US$5.69 per million scf by 1995 (in constant 1981 terms).
C. Economic Rates of Return
8.05     Annex 8-2 shows the investment, operating cost and revenue streams
used in the incremental economic return calculations for the Multan urea
plant expansion and rehabilitation, the Multan ammonia plant expansion, and
the Daud Khel ammonium sulphate plant rehabilitation, which result in
incremental economic rates of return of 54%, 96% and 42%, respectively.
These returns indicate that the effect of the implementation, particularly of
the Multan component on the two affected plants there, is highly positive.
Also, implementation of the Daud Khel rehabilitation, despite its relatively
short-run and temporary benefits of seven years, is economically attractive.
8.06     The following table shows the results of several sensitivity tests
prepared on the Project's incremental economic rates of return:

- 48 -
8.07     As shown above, the Multan components are most sensitive to a delay
in project completion, whereas in the case of Daud Khel, changes in operating
revenues and cost have the greatest impact.
8.08     In considering the basic justification for rehabilitating and
expanding the existing PFL and PAFL facilities, the economic viability of the
companies as a whole, including existing and proposed facilities under the
Project, was analyzed (Annex 8-2). The Multan facilities were assumed to
have a remaining life of ten years after the expected 1985 project completion,
and those at Daud Khel, of seven years after the 1984 project completion.
PFL's continued operation is estimated to have an economic rate of return of
19% which is testimony to that company's economic health under current
market and operating conditions, in spite of the large cost overrun incurred
in the Multan Expansion project completed in 1978 and the design deficiencies
as a result of which full capacity utilization of the NP plant has not yet
been achieved.
8.09     The Project will help to greatly improve the economics of the Daud
Khel plant which currently is a high-cost producer. After rehabilitation,
its cash cost of production will be below the import cost of AS.   Due to the
age and the small size of the existing facilities, the plant as a whole
would have an economic return of 13%, lower than the incremental return of
42% (para 8.05). The rate of return calculations for Daud Khel are based on
projected international prices for AS, in line with those projected for the
nutrient value of urea and which do not include any premium, although his-
torically, markets in Europe for example, have paid fob prices for AS which
in terms of nutrient, were an average 15% higher than for urea. If one were
to assume a 10% premium on the fob nutrient value of AS, the economic
rate of return for PAFL as a whole would rise to 27% and that of the incre-
mental project, to 52%. However, if revenues were to decline below expected
levels or capital cost were to increase, the overall economic rate of return
of PAFL could be marginal. It is therefore of importance that the implemen-
tation of the Daud Khel Project be closely monitored in order to minimize the
risk that unexpected developmentsin cost and schedules affect the economics
of this Project component.
8.10     The relatively low rate of return for the Daud Khel plant as a whole
should also be seen in the light of the desirability of maintaining in
operation a well-kept, albeit old and technologically outdated plant which
provides a fertilizer in demand for certain crops in Pakistan in a remote
part of the country and whose full substitution by other products, such as
urea, is not generally accepted. Furthermore, by enabling the Daud Khel
plant to continue functioning, its work force of about 1,000 would be main-
tained in an area which otherwise can offer only limited alternative employ-
ment. Although this benefit cannot easily be quantified, this is of particular
importance when considering that the existing ammonium sulphate plant is
intended to be replaced by a new larger and more economic unit later in the
1980s, in case the proposed studies should conclude such a course of action
to be desirable. At that time, the skilled manpower currently available at
Daud Khel will be highly valuable.

D. Other Economic Benefits
8.11     In 1987, when both the PFL urea and the PAFL ammonium sulphate
plants are expected to have reached their full production levels, incremental
production from these two companies would total 178,000 tons of fertilizer
per year, representing an estimated gross import cost (cif Karachi) of
US$39 million per year in 1981 prices. Thus, net of debt service the two
components of the Project would generate foreign exchange annually of about
US$29 million by 1987 and a total of US$250 million over their respective
lives; the foreign exchange cost of the productive components (US$31.0
million) would be more than covered with the net foreign exchange savings
of about 13 months of full production.
8.12     The managerial and operating capability of NFC would be improved
as a result of the various management development and training programs
supported by the Project. The availability of trained operators is critical
in Pakistan in view of the increasing productive capacities and the aim of
making the maximum use of the large investments in the sector. Such producti-
vity gains would directly help increase total agricultural output and improve
farmers' incomes.
8.13      Through the Project, the Bank would  be working closely with the
NFC Group and GOP, affording the Bank a continuing opportunity to assist
Pakistan in reducing its reliance on fertilizer imports and the resulting
burden on its balance of payments, to influence the future formulation
of Government policy on capacity expansions, both in the private and public
sectors, remuneration in the public industrial sector, and the economic use
of national transportation resources and investments. The energy efficiency
related investments under the Project are likely to be followed by similar
investments in other energy-intensive investments in the country.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01     The following agreements have been reached:
A.  With the Government of Pakistan, that it will:
i)  take promptly all action necessary to enable the
NFC Group to attract and retain qualified technical
and managerial staff (para 3.06);
ii)  cause Pakistan Railways promptly to implement and
thereafter maintain, adequate schedules for the operation
of block trains in order to ensure the timely and efficient
transportation of fertilizers from production plants to
storage locations in the marketing areas (para 4.08);
iii)  implement by March 31, 1983 a system acceptabale to the
Bank for adequate compensation to NFC producers for all
costs related to the marketing of fertilizers (para 4.11);



- 50 -
iv)  as long as it controls fertilizer prices, set ex-
factory prices in a way that would permit NFC manufac-
turers under conditions of efficient operations to meet
their costs, service their debts, and earn a reasonable
return on equity (para 4.13);
v) based on the findings of the Study of Additional
Fertilizer Capacity, review with the Bank periodically
the evolution of its ex-factory pricing policy
(para 4.13);
vi)  carry out the Study of Additional Fertilizer Capacity
(para 5.35);
vii)  provide, or cause to be provided in the form of
equity, any additional funds which may be needed by the
NFC Group to complete the Project, beyond the amount of
the Bank loan and the NFC Group's internal cash generation,
(para 6.15); and
viii) promptly reimburse NFC's subsidiaries the difference between
the ex-factory price and the controlled retail price of
fertilizer (para 7.17).
B.  With NFC, PFL and PAFL that they will:
i) complete promptly, based on an exchange of views with the
Bank a program for action on the recommendations made by
the SGV Organization and Management Study (para 3.09).
ii)  provide from their own financial resources or from
other sources the amounts required beyond the proceeds
of the Bank loan to meet the expectations of the Project
(para 6.15);
iii) follow financial covenants and reporting requirements
as outlined in para 7.16; and
iv)  limit non-Project investments by PFL and PAFL during
Project implementation to US$4 million and US$2 million,
respectively, and for the NFC Group as a whole, to
US$25 million (para 7.17);
9.02     The signing of on-lending agreements satisfactory to the Bank
between the Government and NFC, between NFC and PFL, and between NFC and PAFL
will be special conditions of loan effectiveness.
9.03     Based on the acceptance of the above agreements reached, the Project is
considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$38.5 million equivalent.

ANNEX 7-1

PAKISTAN - FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis for Projections
1.       Income, cash flow and balance sheet projections shown in Annexes
7-2 to 7-8 are prepared in current PRs, using domestic inflation rates of
12% for 1982, 11% for 1983, 10% for 1984, 9% for 1985, and 8% thereafter,
except as noted below. For foreign costs, an exchange rate of PR 10 per US$
was assumed which approximates the current rate of exchange, Projections were
prepared for PFL (reflecting the effects of the Multan Ammonia/Urea
Rehabilitation and Expansion component), PAFL, and NFC.
B. Production Build-up and Revenue
2.       Income projections for PFL and PAFL were prepared for both cases,
without and with project implementation, to derive the inputs for the incre-
mental financial return computations.  Without project implementation, urea
production at PFL was assumed to gradually decrease until 1986 when it would
cease since the plant would no longer be economical. With the Project, urea
production was assumed to be interrupted for most of FY84, with production
assumed to start up again in early FY85, providing three months of production
for FY85 at an average rate of 52% of capacity, and rates of 85% for
FY86 and 90% thereafter.
3.       PFL's production of NP and CAN would not be affected by the implemen-
tation of the Project; it was assumed that the ongoing plant modifications
necessitated by design corrections there, would continue on schedule, resulting
in a 65% capacity utilization for FY82, 70% for FY83 and 90% thereafter.
4.       Regarding Daud Khel, production was assumed to cease by FY85
without project implementation. With the Project, production would decline
to 55% of capacity during six months in FY84, then by FY85 return to
95% of nominal design, but slightly below the levels experienced in past
years. Production would cease altogether in 1992 due to the anticipated
obsolescence of the equipment not rehabilitated under the Project.
5.        Revenue projections are based on sales price assumptions in line
with the Government's commitment to the Bank to eliminate subsidization of
fertilizer prices by 1986 (para 4.12). The following ex-factory prices
(net of marketing incidentals) were assumed for the financial projections
(in PRs per ton): 1/
1/   As per Fertilizer Imports Credit (1066-PAK).

FY82               2,190    2,050    1,272          920
FY83               2,650    2,740    1,700        1,113
FY84               3,200    3,640    2,260        1,344
FY85               3,880    4,830    3,000        1,630
FY86               4,730    6,110    3,800        1,987
6.       As a result of increasing sales revenues, the need for Government
compensation payments to PFL would terminate in FY82. Beginning FY83,
the company would thus begin paying Development Surcharges absorbing profits
in excess of their respective return-on-capital targets.
C. Variable Production Costs
7.        Attachments I and 2 show production costs at full capacity for the
ammonia and urea plants at Multan and the Daud Khel plant, respectively.  The
cost of natural gas consumed by PFL and PAFL is assumed to increase from the
presently heavily subsidized levels, by an annual 25% until 1988 and at 8%
p.a. thereafter. This is based on the Bank's assumption that GOP will
continue to apply policies of letting energy prices gradually rise to inter-
national levels, as evidenced by the 25% price increase announced in January
1982.
8.       Consumption of rock phosphate is projected to increase with the
growing NP production; it is costed at internationally projected prices plus
international and local freight increasing at the respective inflation rates.
Bagging and other charges would vary with production volume, at prices
increasing at domestic inflation rates.
D. Fixed Production Costs
9.       The cost of maintenance stores and spares of the PFL urea plant was
projected to increase from the current FY82 level of PR 6.7 million to a
level of PR 13.9 million in real terms by the time of plant closure in FY86
and in line with the rapid increase experienced in this cost in past years;
with the Project, this cost would stabilize at the lower level of PRs 4.0
million by FY85. At Daud Khel, this cost would similarly rise from the FY82
level of PR 12.5 million to PR 22.0 million by FY85 without the Project;
with the Project, it would stabilize at PR 8.0 million. Labor costs and
other fixed charges and expenses are projected to increase at the domestic
inflation rate.

10.      Interest charges on the proposed Bank loan  are assumed at  12.8%,
on the basis that the foreign exchange risk of the Bank loan would be borne
by NFC and its subsidiaries. Provision has been made for the Bank's
"front-end" fee.
F. Financial Rates of Return
11.      Attachment 3 shows the inputs used in the financial rate of return
computations for the two productive Project components and the rates of
return derived therefrom.

PAKISTAN: FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
1.       Economic rates of return have been calculated on an incremental
basis for the Multan urea rehabilitation and expansion component, the Multan
ammonia expansion component and the Daud Khel rehabilitation component,
and on an overall company basis and incorporating the effect of the Project
for PFL and PAFL. Calculations are prepared in constant dollars of 1984;
project life is assumed at 10 years for the Multan and 7 years for the Daud
Khel components, with a 10% terminal value of the investments credited at the
two PFL plants and a 50% terminal value of the Project equipment at PAFL,
assuming that this equipment will, after seven years of operation, be
capable of re-use elsewhere, should the plant then be shut down. Duties,
taxes, depreciation and interest are excluded from all cost and benefit
streams. The assumptions for increases in production and its cost due to
the Project are explained in Annex 7-1.
B. Benefits
2.       Product prices used in the economic analysis to calculate incre-
mental revenues are based on the December 1981 projections by the IBRD
Commodities and Export Projections Division; they are expressed in 1984
terms. The following table shows the economic accounting prices used for
bagged fertilizer products for FY84, FY85 and FY90:

C. Operating Cost
3.       Except for natural gas and ammonia, all domestic input costs are
assumed at their financial values; the cost of imported rock phosphate and
sulphur is based on the Bank's projections. As explained in para 8.04,
natural gas is shadow-priced, assuming for this purpose a 1981 price of
US$4.09/mscf in 1981 terms or US$5.12 in 1984 terms, the latter increasing to
US$5.62 by 1985 and US$6.32 by 1990. Ammonia was assumed to have an input
price 90% of the corresponding urea border prices. Since closure of the Daud
Khel plant would force its labor to seek lower paying employment elsewhere,
probably in the region's agriculture, the opportunity cost for unskilled labor
was assumed at a rate of 50% of its financial value. This shadow rate is
adequate when considering that current unskilled labor wages at Daud Khel
average about Rs 15,000 per year, compared to agricultural wages in Pakistan
of Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 per year.
