HEKIORAXUD  AND RECOENDATZON OF THE PSIDE1T
OF TIM INTERNATIONAL BK FOR RECOSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REULIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A
WATER SUPPY AND SANITATION FOR LOW INCOM  COMIIUNTS PROJECT
1. *I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$80 million to help finance a Water Supply and Sanitation for
Low Income Communities Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of
$race.
2.        packeround.  Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the
world, has achieved substantial ct.nomic growth during the past decade and
succeeded in dramatically reducing poverty, notably the incidence rate of
poverty and the total number of poor people. Despite rapid urbanization,
about 125 million of the 180 million (1990) population still live in rural
areas, and about 23 percent of this group have incomes below the poverty llne,
according to recent World Bank estimates for 1990.
3.        A key aspect of poverty, particularly in rural areas, relates to
water supply and sanitation (WSS) facilities.  It is estimated that about 90
million of the rural population still remain unserved or underserved with such
basic services. While the urban WSS subsector witnessed a relatively rapid
development and an increased investment during the past Five-Year Plan
periods, progress in the rural subsector has lagged seriously behind.
Consequently, the coverage rate remains very low, with 30 percent and
25 percent for water supply and sanitation, respectively.
4.        About 55 percent of rural communities rely on unprotected open dug
wells which are usually unsafe. Other households fetch water from long
distances, with women and children carrying most of the burden. Those with
cash buy water from comercial vendors, but for many of the poor, there has
been little choice but to use unsafe water from unprotected wells and strams.
Hygiene and sanitation is also poor as households in underserved communities
rely on rudimentary latrines or use vater courses. All these shortcomings
explain why the incidence of water-borne diseases remains high, diarrhoea is
endemic and accounts for about 19 percent of total deaths. Also, as the
families in villages have to spend a fair amount of their resources to get
water, in economic terms their real incomes are adversely affected.
5.        Lessons From Past ExRerience. Until the proposed project, Bank
financing has primarily focused on urban ater supply projects in Indonesia.
The main reasons for this delayed support for rural water supply and
sanitation (RWSS) have included the followings institutional weakness In the
Ministry of Health which, until recently was the sole responsible organization
for RWSS; lack of implementation capacity in local governments to carry out
their assigned RWSS responsibility; and the absence of consensus in government
on making the beneficiaries of these schemes responsible for operating and
maintaining them.



6.        During th. last 15 yXtars or so, the Bank's involvement in RWSS was
also small elsewhere in Asia-one project each in the Philippines and China.
These projects focused on delivery systems with littl emphasis on community
devalopment and participation essential for sustainability of projects. The
work done in the 1980s by Bank staff on new RWSS projects in Pakistan, India,
Nepal and Sri Lanka has suggested that an integrated community-based approach,
recognizing what beneficiaries want and are willing to pay for, including the
choice of service levels, and providing flexibility in planning and
implementation ;rocess to take into account changing and diverse local demands
and circumstances, would be a key element in ensuring strong comitments to
project sustainability. The design of the proposed project has benefitted
from all these lessons and the newly emerging demand-based approach.  Also,
the experience under smaller RWSS schemes funded in Indonesia by UNICEF,
WHOIUNDP, USAID, the Netherlands and Australian assistance as well as the
village water supply projects serviced with the involvament of CARE, ha. also
been taken into account in designing the proposed project.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank considers the provision
of safe water supply and sanitation to the poor to be a key element in poverty
alleviation in Indonesia. The project' s poverty focus fits well, therefore,
with the Bank's country assistance strategy presented to the Board in December
1992. Furthermore, the project would provide the Bank vith the opportunity to
assist GOX in establishing approaches and procedures emphasising institutional
capacity building, integrated implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene
education programs and utilization of appropriate technologies.
S.        Prolect Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to provide
safe, adequate, and easily accessible water supply and sanitation services and
to support hygiene/health education for poor communities in unserved/
underserved rural villages outside Java and communities around a few densely
populated centers in Central Java.
9.        Proiect Desian.   Building on lessons learned, the project design
has the following distinguishing features: (a) targetins of poor,
unserved/underserved villages; (b) community participation; (c) demand-driven
interventions; (d) cost recovery; (e) programmatic or structured learning
approaches; (f) human resource and institution strengthening. These elements
in combination are expected to achieve sustainable improvements in the water
and sanitation conditions and hence in the welfare of people in poor villages.
10.       Coverage will be limited to poor villages through a screening
process based on a systematic classification of villages according to poverty
status. In choosing smong the eligible communities, selection will then be
based on incidence of water-borne diseases, water scarcity, water quality,
infant mortality and willingness to pay for operation and maintenance costs.
11.       Project Descrigtion.  The project would serve about two million
people living in selected communities in six provinces, including Central Java
and five eastern provinces (Southeast Sulawesil, Central Sulawesi, North
Sulawesi, Maluku and Nusa Tenggara Timur) where the prevalence rate of poverty
still remains substantial. The project has six components, which can be
grouped into two major categories:



- 3 -
A. Direct Infrastructure and Develonment Support
(a)  water sunplv (USS60.6 milllon)s  This componenc would provide safe
water to about two million people in about 1,400 communities in six
provinces by conetructiug piped as well as non-piped systemo.
(b) sanitation (US$16.0 million)t The project vill finance low-cost
sanitation facilities, including demonstration, training, and
promotion activities to encourage beneficiary and private-sector
participation in the construction and financing of sanitation
facilities.
B. Institutional Develooment and Cagacitv Building Suopgrt
(c) hysiene and sanitation education (HSE) (US$7.0 million): This
component would support a program of hygiene and sanitation
education through promotion and mass media campaigns on hygiene,
water, and sanitation-related issues; training for health and
project staff, school teachers and UGOs.
(d)  trainint and community/institutional develooment tUSS20e4 million):
The focus of this component will be on training, primarily aimed at
developing community-based approaches.
(e) technical assistance (USS1O.2 million): The project will provide
for comprehensive technical support for project planning and
implementation, including monitoring and evaluation.
(f) grolect management (USS9.1 million):  This component will provide
support for incremental project management costs. These include
expenditures directly related to the management of the project such
as travel, consumable materials, honoraria, meetings and office
operational cost, but excludes salaries, travel, office running.
The objective of this component is to strengthen the quality and
relevance of the supervision, monitoring activities atsd
facilitating project implementation.
12.       Total project cost is estimated at US$123.3 million, of which
US$10.0 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would
cover about 69 percent of the total cost, excluding reserved procurement and
taxes and duties; GOI would finance the rest. Schedule A shows the breakdown
of project cost and financing plan. Amounts and methods of procuremet,
allocation of loan proceeds and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11777-INS dated May 26, 1993 is
being distributed separately.
13.       Pro1ect Imlnementation.  Although the Ministry of Healtihos
Directorate General for Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health
will oversee the loan administration with the assistance of a Central Project
secretariat, the key role to implement the proposed project will be played by
local governments. The governors of the six project provinces have issued



- 4 -
decrees specifying etaffing and organizational arrangements at the provincial
and local levels. These arrsngements recognise that the project will be
executed largely through existing staff and institutional arrangements, with
funding channeled through DIP (central government development project budget)
and INPRES grant funds established under special Presidential instructions.
14.       At the village level, the LRND (the Village Development Council)
through the Village Read will be responsible for preparing and mobilizing the
community and establishing a Village Water Supply and Sanitation Committoe
which will assume full responsibility for WSS development, including the
preparation and implementation of the Village Action Plan (VAP).
15.       Pro1ect Sustainabilitv.  The factors wbich would contribute to
project sustainability include the followings First, Indonesia's economy is
expected to grow; hence, capacity to finance increasing investments in rural
water supply and sanitation is also expected to rise. Second, the project
design is based on sound principles drawn from leesons learned from Indonesia
and international experience. Third, communities will be selected if they are
highly comitted to the sustained operation and malinsnanc- of their wator
supply schemes and willing to pay. Another factor that is expected to enhance
sustainability is the project's emphasis on institutional and human resource
capacity building and changing household behavior through hygiene/health
education. Finally, there is a strong ownership and commitment to projects
success from central government officials down to the intended beneficiary
villages.
16.       Actions Taken and Agreedt  Prior to negotiations GOI selected the
three urgently needed consultants and prepared standard costs to be used for
simple non-piped water supply schemes. Provincial decrees for institutional
arrangements and staffing were also issued prior to negotiations to expedite
project start-up.
17.       During negotiations, aasurances were obtained from 001 that it
will:
(a) use agreed criteria for selecting participating communities and
agreed formats for Village Action Plans (VAP);
(b) employ NGOs in project implementation, where needed; adopt agreed
cost recovery principles; and establish cost recovery collection
mechanisms;
(c) protect the rights of indigenous people;
(d) appoint project managers at Rabupaten levels;
(e) prepare and furnish to the Bank an Action Plan to enhance women's
role in WSS;
(f) use criteria and indicators acceptable to the Bank for project
monitoring and evaluation; and



- 5 -
(g) procure pioject vehicles and computers according to a schedule
acceptable to the Bank.
18.       The following will be conditions for loan disbursement against
expenditures for civil work, and construction material.s
(a) signing of contracts with the three consultants selected prior to
negotiations; and
(b) employment of NGOs for the implementation of starter projects.
19.       nvvironmental Asgoets.  The project would have a positive impact on
the environment. Contaminated sources of drinking water supply aud poor
bygienic practices for human waste disposal add to the environmental health
problems In rural and urban slum areas. The provision of safe drinking water
and proper environmental sanitation would contribute significantly to
improviug the environment. Complementary hygiene and sanitation education
would also have a beneficial impact through promotion of a hygienic and clean
evironment.
20.       Proiect Benefits.  Roughly two million people living in about 1,400
poor villages would benefit from the proposed project. Better access to safe
and adequate water supply is expected to reduce cost of water to beneficiary
households in terms of t4me, energy, and money. Furthermore, with improved
sauitation and hygiene practices, the project is expected to have a positive
and direct impact on health and productivity. The above effects would
especially be beneficial to women and young children. At present, they bear
most of the effects of water-borne diseases and of fetching water from sources
that are difficult to access.
21.       Project Risks.  The main risks are that institutional strengthening
may not develop fast enough, leading to delays in project implementation.
Implementation capacity, particularly at the village, subdistrict and district
levels, is weak due to lack of experience and skills which may hinder the
commUnity development process. Coordination of activities is also a possible
risk, given the complexity of current bureaucratic procedures. Village
compliance with agreements regarding O&M contributions is highly likely but
not certain because of lack of sanctions.
22.       To counter the above risks, project size and phasing have been
linked to the implementation capscities of responsible agencies at various
levels. Thus, project implementation will start with only 52 villages in year
one. While helping to build institutional capacity, NGOs will be used to
facilitate project implementation in a variety of roles. Finally, the project
has been developed with a strong commitment from Indonesian policy-makers to
test out technical and institutional options, revisit project design on the
basis of lessons learned, and change strategies, if necestary.
