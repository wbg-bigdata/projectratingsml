INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PREIDENT
70 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN FOR
A SECOND INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equiva-
lent of Us $45 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign
exchange cost of industrial imports required during the period July 1,
1973 to June 30, 1974.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        In June 1972, the Association approved a $50 million credit to
Pakistan to finance the importation of industrial raw materials and com-
ponents, and some fertilizers. The objectives of that credit were to
prevent a further decline in economic activity (which had been depressed
since 1969), to support a long overdue devaluation of the rupee and lib-
eralization of imports, and to give the country time both to adjust to
its changed economic and political circumstances and to prepare a new
development program. In the year that has since elapsed, the Pakistan
economy has shown considerable resilience. The exchange reform and the
liberalization of imports have proved effective and the acute balance of
payments problems that were widely expected have not occurred. The
Government has been formulating new economic and social policies and the
work of embodying them in a new Five-Year Plan to take effect from July
1974 began early this year. At the meeting of the Pakistan Aid Consor-
tium in March 1973, the Government presented a list of public sector
projects requiring $750 million of foreign exchange and of projects in
the private sector needing an additional $230 million. However, it will
take some time for these projects to result in a substantial flow of aid,
and the Government therefore also stressed its continuing need for com-
modity aid.  Without such aid, the net flow of foreign resources to Pakis-
tan could fall very low and the recovery of output and investment now under
way could be brought to a halt. In these circumstances, the Association
agreed to consider a further credit for the purchase'of industrial imports.
The proposal should be seen against the background not only of Pakistan's
immediate economic problems and changed circumstances, but also in the
light of the Government's efforts to bring about a substantial change in
the economic policies followed in.earlier years.
3.        A year has not been enough to fulfill the objectives of last
yearls credit, and the purpose of the proposed credit is to permit the
economic recovery which has been brought about by the exchange reform to
continue. Its principal justification, as was that of the previous credit,
is that Pakistan has adopted a course of economic and social policy which



gives promise of dealing with the nation's long-standing and critical
development problems and that, until project commitments and disburse-
ments can be increased, commodity assistance is of crucial importance.
4.        Since the previous credit, a Bank economic mission has visited
Pakistan and has prepared a report on the "Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Pakistan", the first such report since 1970.   It has been dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors as 74-PAK, dated February 16, 1973.
(A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.)   The following paragraphs
include a summary of the economic background to the situation that
confronted Pakistan in December 1971, developments since that time and
the prospects of the country.
Development in the Period from 1960 to 1971
5.        The present Pakistan economy (i.e., that of the former West
Pakistan, which throughout this report is dealt with as being synonymous
with present Pakistan) grew rapidly during the Second Plan period
(1960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7 percent per annum, compared with
5.6 percent for the entire country. This high growth was spearheaded by
an industrial growth of 13.1 percent per annum. However, the agricul-
tural sector only rrew by 3.7 percent per annum. Pakistan's overall
economic performance slowed down somewhat during the Third Plan (1965-70)
to 6.2 percent, compared with 5.0 percent for the former West and East
Pakistan combined. Industrial growth fell to 7.6 percent, but the agri-
cultural sector grew 5.6 percent annually with the aid of new high-
yielding wheat and rice varieties.
6.        Though it is hardly apparent in these growth rates, Pakistan's
development was considerably less satisfactory after 1965. A new series
of import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that time
became permanent. A chronic shortage of foreign exchange and local re-
sources developed as a result of a sharp decline in foreign aid, higher
current government expenditure and rising foreign debt service. The in-
elasticity of government revenues and the periodic need to import food
(particularly during 1965-67) also contributed to these difficulties.
Tight import controls and the multiple exchange rate system slowed indus-
trial growth, distorted prices and led to the growth of idle capacity.
7.        Income inequalities also became greater during the second half
of the decade. Sharp increases in food prices, reflecting both crop
shortages (1965/66 and 1966/67) and higher agricultural support prices,
reduced the real wages of urban workers during 1965-69. The slowdown in
industrial growth and investment, along with urban population growth
rates of nearly 5 percant, produced rapidly rising urban unemployment.
In rural areas, it was the larger farmers who got most of the benefits
of the new "green revolution" in wheat and rice varieties, as the smaller
farmers lacked the credit and other resources.
8.        These trends in the distribution of income, frustration with
authoritarian government, and a growing consciousness of disparities in
levels of public investment and rates of economic growth between East and



-3-
West Pakistan, all contributed to the political and social tensions that
led to the resignation of President Ayub Khan in early 1969. These ten-
sions and resultant economic uncertainty also caused private saving and
investment to decline, with potential saving being diverted to nonproduc-
tive forms, or in some cases sent to overseas havens. Public investment
also declined in West Pakistan as the bulk of new commitments were made
to projects in East Pakistan. Investment in West Pakistan fell from 22
percent of GDP in 1964/65 to 17 percent in 1969/70, and to only about
11 percent in 1971/72. This decline, together with a drought which re-
duced the increase in agricultural output from mid-1970 to mid-1972,
contributed to a general economic recession.
9.        The situation was made more difficult in 1971 by the loss of
markets, assets and sources of supply in East Pakistan. Industry also
found it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials and spare parts
from abroad as the shortage of foreign exchange grew more acute. Power
shortages and mounting labor unrest further curtailed industrial produc-
tion, which is estimated to have declined by about one percent over the
two years. With population growing at about 2.9 percent annually, the
per capita decline in availability of physical goods was at least 6 per-
cent over the two years 1970 and 1971.
Recent Policies
10.       The problems facing the country since December 1971 have been
many. They have included restoring national morale, unity and sense of
direction, negotiating a border agreement with India, seeking the release
of the prisoners of war, and finding a new basis for relations with India
and Bangladesh. Issues of social and economic justice, such as had em-
bittered relations between the East and West Wings, had also been present
within the West. The poor felt dominated by the rich, laborers by mill
owners, farmers by industry, small farmers and businessmen by large, and
the less-developed regions by the more developed.
11.       Numerous measures of economic and social reform have been
adopted in response to these pressures. In January 1972, the Government
announced that it was taking over the management (but not the ownership)
of the 31 largest firms in 10 "basic" industries.l/ The "managing agency"
system was prohibited and existing agreements declared invalid.2/ Life
insurance companies were nationalized. Taxation of commercial 6anks was
increased, and credit was made more accessible to small farmers and
businessmen. A land reform reduced the amount of land that could be held
by an individual (though only very large farms were affected), gave ten-
ants certain rights to their land and required owners rather than tenants
to bear certain taxes and cultivation expenses. Action was taken to
1/  Iron and steel, basic metals, heavy engineering, heavy chemicals,
motor vehicle assembly and manufacture, tractor assembly and manu-
facture, heavy and basic chemicals, petro-chemicals, cement and
public utilities.
2/ Managing agency contracts gave full control over company affairs to
a minority ownership group of insiders.



guarantee workers the right to collective bargaining, to give employees
job security, to provide certain welfare and other benefits, and to
bring more equality to labor-management relations. An integrated rural
development program has been started, and is intended within a few years
to bring credit, know-how and marketing opportunities to all farmers.   A
People's Works Program is also getting underway to provide employment in
the construction of public works and in some cases new production capacity.
12.       In May 1972, the Government took a long overdue action by de-
valuing the rupee and liberalizing import restrictions. The official
exchange rate was changed from Rs. 4.76 per dollar to Rs. 11, with actual
average increases, compared with previous multiple exchange rates, of about
24 percent in the rupee price of major agricultural exports, 23 percent in
the rupee price of industrial exports, and 40 percent in the rupee price of
imports.l/
13.       These policy changes were intended to give the Government more
control over the economy and to improve the lot of small farmers, small
businessmen and lower income groups. They have, however, created some
uncertainty in the private sector although the President has called for
a vigorous private sector and has stated that there will be no further
nationalization measures. Government policy has also shown increasing
concern for problems of the private sector.
Recent Economic Trends
14.       The period from December 1971 to about September 1972 was one
of economic transition as new markets and sources of supply had to be
found for goods formerly sold in or purchased from East Pakistan, and as
the economic role of the Government and labor-management relations were
redefined. The output of most industrial commodities declined during the
first half of 1972 and reached a low point between June and August, but
by December most production was moderately ahead of, or at least equal
to, that of the previous year and production has continued to rise. Agri-
cultural output is also increasing, with consequent benefits for agro-
based industries and the rural market for consumer goods. Good autumn and
winter rains have brought an end to two years of drought and a record
wheat crop is now being harvested. Sugarcane and other crops have also
benefitted. The Government has given high priority to fertilizer imports
and is building stockpiles to prevent a recurrence of last year's short-
ages and to encourage more use of fertilizer by small farmers.
15.       A 4O percent rise in exports (excluding interwing trade) in
1971/72 and a continuing rise at an annual rate of about 30 percent in
the current year have brought total exports to a level higher than that
of the two wings combined before the separation. A near tripling of raw
cotton exports and the diversion to foreign markets of goods previously
sold in East Pakistan have accounted for over three-fourths of the increase,
but devaluation has helped exports of light manufactures and primary prod-
ucts, including textiles, leather goods, cotton, rice, fish and many others.
1/ These percentages include adjustments to export and import duties
and to sales taxes.



-5-
This expansion of exports has been considerably assisted by the exchange
reform measures which have encouraged the maximum use of existing plants.
The first several months of liberalization saw an unprecedented ordering of
spare parts to put "excess capacity" to work. Modernization and balanc-
ing investnent have also comprised a major part of new requests for
foreign machinery and equipment, as producers seek to make fuller use of
existing capacity. Capital goods imports have been less this year than
last, however, and will probably be no more than two-thirds of the annual
amounts which prevailed before 1971. Imports of raw materials for capital
goods have been similarly depressed, but have recently begun to increase.
However, this may reflect construction needs more than production of new
machinery and equipment.
16.       Industrial raw material imports during the period from July to
October 1972 were slightly below those of the same period of the previous
year. From November 1972 to February 1973, however, they were one-third
greater than in the previous four months and 56 percent greater than in
the same period of the previous year.
17.       Wholesale price indices have risen at annual rates of about 16
percent to 18 percent from mid-1971 to the present, but the increase in
the cost-of-living index has been closer to 10 percent because of sales
of wheat at fixed prices by the Government and other measures to control
basic consumer prices. Prospects are good that price increases will
slacken now that agricultural and food production has risen, imports are
increasing, and growth of the money supply is slowing. Open market prices
of wheat flour, the country's basic foodstuff, are now 15 percent below
those of a year ago.
Balance of Payments and Debt
18.       Pakistan's recent and projected balance of payments position is
shown in Annex I, Table 2. Both the total trade and current account
deficits (excluding interest payments) are expected to be about $250 mil-
lion in 1973/74. Annual foreign aid requirements are likely to remain at
about $250 million plus total debt service (interest and principal) during
the next several years. In the absence of a division of its external debt
with Bangladesh, or of a debt rescheduling, Pakistan's debt service is
expected to rise from $180 million in 1972/73 to $280 million in 1973/74
and to $400 million by 1975/76. The rapid increase reflects the conse-
quence of a short-term debt rescheduling from May 1971 to June 1973, as
well as growth of the outstanding debt. However, the Government of Pakistan
has informed its creditors that after June 30, 1973, it will cease to ser-
vice debt which it considers to have been incurred on behalf of what is now
Bangladesh. The Government estimates that this will reduce its near-term
debt service by about US $70 million annually. Thus the total resource
requirement for the trade deficit plus debt service (but excluding that
part designated by the Government as the responsibility of Bangladesh)
would probably be about $460 million in 1973/74 and $580 million by 1975/76.
This can be compared with expected new aid disbursements of about $435 mil-
lion in 1972/73, and probably much the same amount (including this proposed



-6-
credit) for 1973/74. Both the need for the proposed IDA credit and its
contribution to maintenance of import liberalization are thus very
evident.
19.       If Pakistan were to continue to service all its pre-December
1971 obligations and exports were to grow at a 10 percent annual rate,
the debt service burden (including prospective new debt) would reach a
peak of 41 percent of total foreign exchange earnings in 1974/75, then
decline to 27 percent by 1977/78. If liabilities which the Government
identifies as the responsibility of Bangladesh were excluded, these
ratios would decline to 26 percent and 22 percent respectively. There-
fore, the Government has repeated its earlier request for creditors to
consider a long-term rescheduling of the debt that would remain, on the
grounds that the burden of servicing even that portion would hamper the
economic development of the country. Both the responsibility for ser-
vicing debt after June 30 and the question of rescheduling are the sub-
jects of discussion between Pakistan and its creditors, notably through
the medium of the Pakistan Aid Consortium, of which the Bank is chairman.
Prospects
20.       The recovery now underway, led by strong export demand, rising
agricultural production and profitable import substitution possibilities,
gives ground for optimism. However, there are problems still to be over-
come. While production has been recovering, investment has remained
depressed. Production in key sectors of the textile industry is now near-
ing capacity, electric power is likely to be short over the next few years,
and congestion in the port of Karachi is slowing exports and adding to
shipping costs. New investment in infrastructure and directly productive
facilities is needed to sustain the growth of production, exports and
employment. It is important, therefore, that Government increase savings
for investment in infrastructure and public enterprises, that the private
sector be induced to put its capital to work, and that foreign capital
flows continue.
21.       Increased private saving and investment will require greater
private confidence and the continuation of favorable growth prospects.
There are some indications of a revival in private investment, and the
Government's recent success in obtaining agreement on a new constitution
may also contribute to private willingness to invest.
22.       Increased public saving will require a reduction in nondevelop-
ment current expenditure, such as urban wheat subsidies, and an increase
in budget revenues and profits of public enterprises. The Government has
taken a number of actions to increase public revenues. The 1972/73 budget
eliminated or reduced certain tax deductions to business and households.
Railway and telephone tariffs have been increased in the past year, and
further adjustments in other charges for public services are expected in
the near future. The subsidy for fertilizer has been reduced by nearly 40
percent, but the effect of this was more than offset by an increase in
the subsidy on the retail sale of wheat.



- 7 -
23.       Given the time required to increase domestic saving and invest-
ment, it is important that enough foreign resources are made available to
permit the present growth in production and exports to continue. This
means that a substantial amount of aid must be in the form of commodity
credits until the project pipeline can be increased. The aid pipeline
for ongoing projects has decreased steadily since 1971 and by June 30,
1973, it will probably be between $200 million and $325 million, of
which about $110 million will be for Indus Basin-Tarbela projects. The
need for quick disbursing aid, including food imports, has been recog-
nized by donors, and nonproject aid is expected to account for approxi-
mately three-fourths of new aid commitments and 60 percent of aid dis-
bursements from all sources in the current fiscal year. It may well be
two years before substantial disbursements from new project aid can be
expected.
2h.       If the necessary saving and investment are forthcoming, Pakis-
tan's growth prospects are bright. Exports appear to be limited more by
supply constraints rather than lack of demand (with the important excep-
tion of the textile quotas in importing countries). Exports could in-
crease at 12 percent a year for the next several years. The water from
Tarbela Dam will be available from late 1975 and the increasing participa-
tion of small and medium-scale farmers in the "green revolution" could
mean that agricultural growth in the next 5 years will match the 5.6 per-
cent annual rate of the 1965-70 Third Plan period. Capital goods, light
engineering goods and agro-based industries also have good growth prospects.
25.       In brief, therefore, the economy of Pakistan can reasonably be
expected to grow by about 7 percent annually in FY74 and the several fol-
lowing years, provided foreign capital inflows are sufficient to permit
the continuation of liberalized import policies and, together with domes-
tic saving and initiative, to provide the necessary investment. Growth
rates of 7 percent and above appear to offer the possibility of perceptible
progress in reducing unemployment and in improving economic and social con-
ditions, while growth rates much below 6 percent do not. An inflow of
foreign aid adequate to prevent a setback to the recovery now under way can
be provided in the coming year only in the form of nonproject aid. Further-
more, such assistance is required to provide long-term resources in support
of the country's development programs, and in view of the external debt
prospects, it should be on terms as concessionary as possible. I consider,
therefore, that a further IDA credit as here proposed is justified.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
26.        The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for West and East) between the start of operations in
1952 and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had then committed $1.2 bil-
lion to the country, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank
and one-half by IDA. Of this amount, one loan and 19 development credits,
totalling US $4.7 million and US $168.1 million respectively (net of can-
cellations) were for projects located wholly within what was then East
Pakistan. Of these, the loan and seven of the credits had been fully dis-
bursed, and US $95.6 million remained undisbursed under twelve development
credits. In addition, under ten loans and eight development credits for
projects involving expenditures in both East and West Pakistan, a total
amount of US $257 million, was outstanding in December 1971; part of this
amount has been used to finance goods located in Bangladesh, or services
rendered there. The right of Pakistan to make further withdrawals in
respect of expenditures for projects located in the East was suspended on
December 29, 1971 (Sec M71-60), and the undisbursed amounts for projects
in the East were cancelled on September 29, 1972.
27.        In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the International
Monetary Fund, the Bank and the Association. It was decided that pro-
posals would be submitted to the Executive Directors for reactivation of
all the uncompleted projects wholly located in Bangladesh which had pre-
viously been financed under credits to Pakistan. Accordingly, nine such
credits in an aggregate amount of US $105.4 million have since then been
made to Bangladesh. Two more, for education and highways, in an amount
of US $46.0 million should be ready for submission to the Executive
Directors in the near future. The aggregate amount of these reactivation
credits of US $151.4 million includes about US $"h.l million for the
notional repayment of amounts disbursed under the corresponding previous
credit agreements with Pakistan, thus debiting Bangladesh with this amount.
28.        Of the $1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East and West), West
Pakistan received about 72 percent. During its long association with
Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy. Until 1972, 38 percent of the total commitments were for the
public services, 29 percent for agriculture, 22 percent for industry,
10 percent for industrial imports, and 1 percent for education. Lending
for public services amounted to some $325 million and included loans and
credits for railways, electric power, pipelines, the Karachi Port, high-
ways, telecommunications and water supplies. A large part of the lending
for agriculture was for the Indus Basin projects. The lending for indus-
try has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation (PICIC). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
29.        No Bank loans or IDA credits were made for Pakistan (or for the
former W§st Pakistan) between August 1970 and June 1972, when Executive
Directors approved a $50 million credit for industrial imports; this
credit was signed in October 1972. A credit for the expansion of the



- 9 -
Port of Karachi, which will be submitted to the Executive Directors short-
ly, will mark the resumption of project lending. Further lending for PICIC
and for a fertilizer plant is now in course of preparation. Credits for
telecommunication and for an oil terminal at Karachi are also planned for
197h.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Role of the Proposed Credit
30.       The Government of Pakistan has requested this industrial imports
credit in support of the continuing adjustment of its economy to last
year's trade and exchange rate reforms. The proposed credit would comple-
ment assistance from other sources to permit the continuation of the
liberalized import policies and to provide the imports needed to maintain
the rapid growth of exports and rising domestic production. The progress
of this adjustment is reflected in the rapid growth of exports and in the
slower but growing production of goods to replace imports previously pur-
chased at unduly favorable exchange rates.
31.       Manufacturing is the second largest sector of the Pakistan
economy, producing about 17 percent of gross domestic product and provid-
ing about 16 percent of employment. About 60 percent of value added in
manufacturing comes from agro-based industries, including textiles, sugar,
edible oils, leather and tobacco. While the basic raw materials come from
domestic sources, these industries require substantial imports of chemicals,
machinery components, and other inputs. The remaining 40 percent are large-
ly dependent upon imported materials. The two largest of these are the
chemicals (mainly pharmaceuticals and fertilizers) and engineering indus-
tries, each of which accounts for about 10 percent of value added in manu-
facturing. Chemicals (including tanning and dyeing extracts and plastics,
but excluding fertilizers) accounted for 28 percent of licensing under last
year's IDA credit, and iron, steel and nonferrous metals another 13 percent.
32.       Since the late 1950's, there has been a continuing expansion in
production for export, particularly in textiles. The increase in exports
in the sixties (before the sudden increase in raw cotton exports in 1972)
was almost entirely due to expansion of sales of manufactures, which now
account for somewhat more than half of merchandise exports. Furthermore,
half of manufactured exports consist of cotton textiles.
33.       The rise in imports since devaluation has permitted an increase
in the use of industrial capacity which, in turn, has increased employment
and reduced fixed costs per unit of output. New capacity will also have
to be created for industries with good foreign exchange earning prospects
and for domestic consumer goods industries whose markets are rapidly ex-
panding. As investment revives, the demand for domestically manufactured
capital goods, which are much more competitive with imports since the de-
valuation, will increase so that these industries can be expected to add



to the demand for imports. Thus the recent opening of large new engineer-
ing plants, such as the Pakistan Machine Tool Plant and the heavy mechani-
cal complex at Taxila, are also expected to result in a substantial
increase in import demand for specialty steel and related inputs, of the
kind to be financed under the proposed credit.
34.        In addition to supporting the growth of exports and total pro-
duction, the proposed credit would help to control inflation by adding
an equivalent rupee amount to government revenues and by increasing the
supply of goods in an economy where demand has been outstripping supply.
The increased resources provided to the Government would permit an in-
crease in public savings and. investment. Private saving and investment
would also benefit to the extent that increased activity and incomes and
greater financial stability encourage businessmen and others to save more,
either by direct investment or through financial intermediaries. The dis-
tribution of income would also benefit from an increase in employment.
Such an increase seems particularly likely in present circumstances when
most of the growth in industrial production is taking place by increased
utilization of existing capacity, and when both the price effects of
devaluation and government policy are encouraging much of the growth to
take place in labor-intensive and export-oriented industries.
Use of the Proceeds of the Credit
35.        The proposed credit would be used to finance part of the im-
ports required in 1973/74 by a wide range of manufacturing industries.
The list of categories of goods to be financed out of the credit is in-
cluded in the Project Summary in Annex III. It is the same as that for
the credit approved last year (Credit 337-PAK), except that fertilizers
have not been included since they are being provided by other aid arrange-
ments. (The previous credit provided that up to US $5 million could be
used for the purchase of fertilizers.)
36.        Licensing under last year's credit started on September 23,
1972. By the end of April 1973, $48.8 million had been disbursed and
the remainder will be disbursed before the end of the present fiscal
year.
37.        Most of the imports to be financed by the proposed credit
would be direct imports by private firms through normal commercial
channels. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP), a state corpora-
ticn, is the designated importer of a limited number of items on which
economies can be secured by importing in bulk. As in the case of the
last industrial imports credit, the Government has agreed that goods
procured by TCP out of the proposed credit would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding.  Industrial users of these
imports would be charged TCP's actual import costs plus a service fee
ranging from 2 to 4 percent, depending on the size of their purchases.
38.        For the time being, Pakistan is continuing to allow Common-
wealth preferences on a limited number of items. However, in the case
of purchases by TCP, tenders wculd be evaluated on the basis of c.i.f.
prices, so that tariff preferences would not be taken into account.



39.        The credit would provide reimbursement for the c.i.f. cost of
qualifying imports with the exception that, for administrative convenri-
ence, qualifying imports costing less than $5,000 would be ineligible.
There would be no retroactive financing, but goods imported under licenses
issued before the date of the credit, and paid for after the date of sign-
ing, would be eligible for reimbursement. The State Bank of Pakistan
would be responsible for collecting, through nominated banks, invoices,
evidence of shipment and evidence that the supplier has received payment.
Such evidence would be forwarded to the Bank in support of withdrawal
applications. The State Bank would also provide a certification in each
case that the goods had been supplied from member countries of the Bank
or from Switzerland, and that they had not been financed already by any
bilateral source or by another international development finance institu-
tion. The credit should be disbursed within twelve months.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS
AND AUTHORITY
40.        The draft Credit Agreement between the Islamic   Republic of
Pakistan and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement,
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.        Under Section 7.02 of the draft Credit Agreement, as in the
case of the previous industrial imports credit, the Association would be
entitled to suspend further disbursement if, after reviewing with the
Government the progress made in implementing the various economic and
financial measures taken, it determined that the purpose of the credit,
i.e., the support of the successful implementation of the Government's
economic and financial program was not likely to be achieved.
42.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would com-
ply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMEDATION
h3.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
Robert S. McNamara
President

C. Projects in Execution-
Loan No. 266        Indus Basin; US $90.0 Million Loan of September
19, 1960; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Settlement of a number of claims and some remedial works are outstanding.
Further disbursement of this Loan will be mainly for the Tarbela Dam proj-
ect.  The original Closing Date of September 30, 1973, has been extended to
December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 50         Education; US $8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Closlng Date June 30, 1975
The project suffered serious delays from the start. Among the
reasons for delays were unsatisfactory consultants, disorganization of one
of the main contractors, shortages of building materials, lack of local
funds, cumbersome procurement methods for instructional equipment, and,
most recently, the war. Implementation is now proceeding energetically,
however, with over 90 percent of total planned construction contracts
awarded, of which about 75 percent are completed. Equipment procurement
for the agricultural university represents about 78 percent of the total
revised allocation and 90 percent of the total allocated for the technical
institutes. The training of technical teachers as envisaged by the Credit
has been satisfactorily completed. The project is now expected to be com-
pleted well before the new Closing Date of June 30, 1975. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1968, was extended first to December 31, 1970,
then to December 31, 1972, and most recently to June 30, 1975.
Loan No. 376       Karachi Port; US $17.0 Million Loan of May 14,, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially.
The total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate of
US $37.5 million to US $47.0 million but there has been no change in the
foreign exchange component of US $17.0 million. This increase has not
materially affected the economic justification of the project. The project
was first delayed by difficulties with the original design of the wharves.
In 1967 work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was
found that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant
further delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the
delay. The difficulties now appear to have been brought under control and
the works are now approaching completion. The dredging operations, although
more than 90 percent complete, are still behind schedule but are now being
expedited. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1969, was extended first
to June 30, 1972, and then to June 30, 1974, the current date.
l/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purnort to present a balanced evalua-
tiori of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 5148      Tarbela Dam; US $25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
1968; Clo:ing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are expected until FY1976. Good progress is being maintained on
the project.
Cr. No. 145        Telecommunications; US $16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Cr. No. 186        Telecommunications; US $15.0 Million Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
There have been delays in implementing both these
credits. The original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the
two credits of about US $11.3 million in the former East Wing and
US $19.7 million in the West. US $5.2 million of the undisbursed bal-
ance of Credit :145-PAK was cancelled in November 1972 after a telecom-
munications project to Bangladesh was approved. The Closing Date of
145-PAK was extended from the original date of December 31, 1972 to
December 31, 19714. This will allow GOP more time for the reorganization
of the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department, the introduction of
an effective accounting system and the completion of the installation of
equipment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590       Development Finance Compan  - PICIC; US $40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Closing Date:
March 31, 19714
This Loan has been fully committed. Except for one subproject,
disbursement in full is expectecd by the Closing Date.
Loan No. 621       Railways; US $1L.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing )ate: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and
bridges, and (b) rehabilitation and improvement of workshops and depots
has been satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the
marshalling yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri has been included instead. The change was
based on a feasibility study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France),
who indicated that a new yard at Pipri would be economically and opera-
tionally preferable. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has
been extended by three years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for
Pipri yard to be built and the balance of the loan has been-reallocated.
PWR has also reappointed the consultants for a period of 18 months.

Cr. No. 157        Agricultural Development Bank; US $30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969: Closing Date: June 30,
1974
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the
original schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in
lending for tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical
connections were mainly responsible for this delay. The original Clos-
ing Date of June 30, 1972, has been extended to June 30, 1974.
Cr. No. 177        Development Finance Company - IDBP; US $20.0
Million Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
The loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching reper-
cussions on IDBP's financial position and effectiveness in allocating
resources. Pending an assessment of the situation, IDA discontinued
approvals of subprojects under the Credit in April 1972.    A mission
which visited Pakistan in October/November 1972 found that IDBP's
effectiveness had been restored, but that the loss of its East Pakistan
assets seriously jeopardizes its financial position. The question of
resuming approval of projects is still under discussion.
Cr. No. S-9        Port Engineering; US $1.0 Million Credit of
June 10, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The major portion of the consulting and engineering studies
is completed. The remaining detailed design works will be completed
by the present Closing Date. The original Closing Date of December 31,
1972, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Loan No. 696        Gas Transmission; US $19.2 Million Loan of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3%). The project is
expected to be completed in mid-July 1973.
Cr. No. 206        Engineering Education; US $4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction cost of the N.E.D. Government Engineering Col-
lege is estimated at about 25 percent above the appraisal estimate, due
mostly to the devaluation of the rupee, a sharp increase in the price
of imported construction materials, and higher duties. After consider-
ing the increase in cost, it was agreed that the project would still be
justified and the Government agreed to assume the extra cost. Construc-
tion drawings are now being completed. The probable completion date is
now January 1975, one year behind the schedule estimated during appraisal;
equipment procurement may not be completed in phase with the completion

of the physical facilities, due to cumbersome methods and regulations
for procurement. An acceleration of the technical assistance element
of the project will be necessary to ensure completion within the Clos-
ing Date.
Cr. No. 213        Power Transmission and Distribution; US $23.0
Million Credit of August 14, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
Owing to political, economic and organizational factors (major
personnel changes in WAPDA in early 1972), the project has been delayed
by about six to nine months. In September 1972, a new Chairman and new
members of the Authority were appointed and progress with the project
has resumed. Most of the contracts for major equipment have been awarded
and the remainder will be awarded soon. Deliveries and construction will
start very shortly.   If no further delays occur, a postponement of the
Closing Date of only one year will be necessary.
Cr. No. 337        Industrial Import; U.S. $50.0 Million Credit of
October 4, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1973
Disbursement in full is expected by June 30, 1973.
