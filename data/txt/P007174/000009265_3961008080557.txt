MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT
1     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of El Salvador for US$50 million to help finance a Land
Administration Project. The currency pool loan would be at the IBRD's standard variable
rate for currency pool loans, with a maturity of 17 years, including four years of grace.
The total project cost is estimated at US$70.0 million. The implementing agency would
be the National Registry Center (CNR) under the Ministry of Justice.
2.    Background. El Salvador's economic performance since 1989 has been
impressive. Stabilization and adjustment programs and trade liberalization led to an
estimated real GDP growth of 7 percent for 1995. Inflation has been declining annually,
and it is estimated at 7.5 percent for 1995, down from 8.9 percent in 1994, 12 percent in
1993 and 20 percent in 1992. Other macroeconomic indicators are in line with IMF
standby targets. The 1995 current account deficit (excluding official grants) is projected at
2.8 percent of GDP, down from 3.7 percent of GDP in 1994. This downturn reflects a
slightly larger merchandise trade deficit (15.7 percent of GDP in 1995), which was more
than offset by private remittances (US$ 1.0 billion, equivalent to about 11 percent of GDP
in 1995). Overall fiscal performance for 1994 was significantly better than programmed.
The nonfinancial public sector deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at 2 percent of GDP
for 1994. Successive administrations have reformed the public sector to increase efficiency
and foster private-sector growth.
3.    The agricultural sector's response to macroeconomic adjustment was initially
strong, leading the recovery with 7% growth in 1990, but it has declined since due to
drought in 1991, 1992 and 1994, lingering land issues and weak agricultural support
services. Agriculture contributes now about 9% of GDP, 50% of exports (mainly
coffee and "non-traditional products") and one-third of employment. The country is
small (about 21,000 km2) with limited natural resources. With a population of 5.4
million, it has one of the highest population densities in the Western Hemisphere.
4.    Government Strategy. The Government of El Salvador (GOES) recognized in
the late 1970s that land was a serious issue, but it sought to address the issue solely by
redistribution, rather than taking a more comprehensive view that would include improved
incentives as well as tenure security, land management, and raising agricultural
productivity. About 275,000 hectares were distributed (about 14 percent of the country's
area), but the reform program paralyzed land markets, deterred investment, distorted
incentives, and did little to improve tenure security because many transfers could not be
completed due to incomplete land records.
5.    The 1970s reform was to be implemented in three phases. Phase I expropriated
farms larger than 500 hectares to collectively owned cooperatives. Landowners were
compensated by agrarian reform bonds. The cooperatives were given 30 years to repay the



government at a rate of 6 percent a year with a four-year grace period. Phase II was
intended to expropriate farms in the range of 100-500 hectares, but it was virtually
annulled by the 1983 Constitution, which mandated a maximum holding size of 245
hectares and allowed excess holdings to be sold over two years. This phase was also
interrupted by the civil war. Phase III issued titles' to people who rented land or had other
informal contracts with landowners; 90 percent of beneficiaries received plots smaller than
2 hectares, and landowners were again compensated with bonds. The beneficiaries had the
same repayment terms as the cooperatives. Phases I and III distributed 275,000 hectares
to 533,000 beneficiary families.
6.     Recognizing the need to improve agricultural policy, combat poverty, and increase
employment and incomes through better land use and secure tenure, GOES formulated a
new agrarian policy in 1994. The Bank helped organize a land policy options seminar in
February 1994 so that the new policy could take into account the views and needs of those
involved in the agricultural sector. A wide range of stakeholders participated, including
representatives of political parties, small and large agricultural producers, agricultural
workers, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. After the seminar, a Salvadoran
agrarian policy working group drafted an agrarian policy focusing on market-based
incentives and poverty alleviation. This policy was approved by the highest government
authorities as the policy context for the proposed project. Another seminar, in which the
Bank also participated in May 1994, discussed international experience in land registry2
and cadastral3 systems. A further seminar, on alternative conflict resolution methods, was
jointly delivered in March 1995 by the Ministry of Justice and the Bank.
7.     The new agrarian policy aims to (a) finalize, as quickly and efficiently as possible,
the land transfers agreed on in the Peace Accords4 and complete the parcelizations
requested by agrarian reform cooperatives; (b) ensure security of tenure to promote
investment and enable transfer of land; (c) streamline state agrarian reform institutions; (d)
consolidate and restructure agrarian debt; (e) create a free market for land to facilitate
access and create employment opportunities for the rural poor; and (f) design and install
an efficient rural finance system.
8.     In April 1991, the Legislature enacted a law allowing Phase I agrarian reform
beneficiaries to opt for individual land tenure rights (rather than ownership by the
cooperative), based on findings that yields on lands effected under Phase III-which
required individual ownership-were substantially higher than under Phase I cooperative
ownership. In 1995, the President approved measures allowing cooperatives to sell part of
1. "Title" is an instrument, such as a deed, that is evidence of a right.
2 . A "land registry" is the official record book that carries the entry of ownership rights, or title, and
encumbrances on these rights.
3. "Cadastral" is of or related to a cadastre, an official register of the quantity, value, and ownership of
real estate used in apportioning taxes.
4. The 1992 Peace Accords committed the government to distribute 166,000 hectares to 47,500
excombatants and squatters by December 1995.
2



their land to repay their agrarian debt. The proposed project would assist agrarian reform
and Peace Accord property owners in voluntarily parceling their holdings under optional
property regimes.
9.    Project Objectives. The proposed project's major objectives are to regularize5
land registration for El Salvador's estimated 1.6 million parcels6 of rural and urban land
and to create an efficient, streamlined, and financially self-sustaining nationwide cadastral
mechanism for mapping and land registration-the new National Registry Center (CNR).
Land registration would provide land owners-particularly the vast majority of
smallholders who lack clear tenure-with the security that will enable them to sell or rent
at fair market prices, and pass on their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security
would also increase smallholder access to credit, raising incentives to invest and to
manage land properly.
10.   Project Description. The El Salvador Land Administration project would finance
a six-year, US$70 million program to (a) consolidate, strengthen, and decentralize the
CNR so that it can keep records updated; (b) acquire land data to regularize the national
land registry and cadastre; and (c) carry out project administration. The project would
cover all 14 departments of El Salvador.
11.   Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization. This component (US$10.6
million) would include two subcomponents.
(a)   Institutional Strengthening (US$6.1. million). This subcomponent would
provide for civil works rehabilitation, goods and technical assistance to
consolidate and strengthen the CNR, by merging the Land Registry
(RPRH), Social Land Registry (RSI) and the National Geographic Institute
(IGN) into a single institution. The Legislature has approved a law to make
CNR a decentralized agency under the Ministry of Justice with
administrative and financial autonomy (Decree No. 462, dated October 5,
1995).  Among the functions to be strengthened during the CNR
consolidation plan are the defining of accounting norms and procedures,
staffing and skills mix, management information systems, fee and revenue-
sources diversification and marketing, and training. On January 25, 1996,
the Legislature approved changes in the Cadastre Law to make registration
obligatory.  In addition, CNR will disseminate guidelines spelling out
obligations of notaries and other public officials-with respect to
standardizing documentation for registration after regularization by about
mid 1996.
5  Land regularization makes ownership rights public knowledge by perfecting registration procedures
and making all records public.
6  It is estimated that there are 1.8 million parcels in El Salvador. This project excludes the estimated
200,000 parcels in Sonsonate, which are being regularized under PRISA.
3



The subcomponent would also provide training and technical assistance to
install staff from these agencies into their new functions and backstop
CNR's new activities. The consolidation of the CNR requires upgrading its
staff to respond rapidly to d.e transition to new functions and work
methods. The project would support training to adapt RPRHVRSI and IGN
staff skills to the new integrated legal and cadastral records and to the
computerized management of land information. The subcomponent would
also provide technical assistance to establish a national automated land
information system (LIS) by expanding the one being established under the
pilot program. The LIS is an automated database being designed under the
Agricultural Sector Reform and Investment Project (PRISA) to identify
owners, parcels, and their descriptions, rights, and encumbrances. The
entries will be geographically referenced using information obtained in the
photogrammetric process. Each parcel will have a unique identifier and
records. The system would keep track of all supporting documentation
required to establish, change, or extinguish real rights. The CNR land
registry would receive the verified files obtained under the land data
acquisition component for registration.
(b)   Institutional Decentralization (US$4.5 million). This component would
finance civil works rehabilitation and goods to decentralize CNR's legal
and cadastral services in regional offices. The implementation phase
following the consolidation would decentralize CNR functions to one
central office and three regional offices. The headquarters/Central Region
office will be in San Salvador and the regional offices in Sonsonate for the
Western Region, San Miguel for the Northern Region and San Vicente for
the Eastern region. Out of these four offices land registry and cadastre
operations will be further decentralized to 52 municipal offices.
12.   Land-Data Acquisition. The land-data acquisition component (US$48.7 million)
would carry out the barrido, that is, establish new land information for cadastral purposes,
verify and regularize land rights on identified parcels, consolidate the data for input in the
LIS and establish mechanisms to resolve conflicts. The component would be divided into
three subcomponents: (a) mapping; (b) land records regularization, and (c) alternate
dispute resolution mechanisms:
(a)   Mapping (US$15. 1 million). This subcomponent would finance works and
technical assistance to assist the government in conducting mapping
activities to establish a parcel-based database describing every parcel's
legal rights, geographic location, and boundary lines. These activities
would include aerial photography to produce base maps for field
verification. Areas not clearly captured in the aerial photography would be
subjected to topographic complementary surveys to complete basic maps.
The subcomponent would finance technical assistance to train IGN
4



photogrammetry staff on numeric restitution and using Global Positioning
System (GPS) equipment.
(b)   Land Records Regularization (US$35.4 million including the $2 million
PPF). While base maps are being produced, this subcomponent would
finance information campaigns, training, local consultants, and incremental
recurrent costs to carry out the steps required to identify parcels holders
rights, as well as the completion of the Sonsonate pilot program.7 The
updating of this information after regularization would be ensured by
legislative changes that would make registration by notaries compulsory
and universal; presentation of these legislative changes are a condition of
negotiations. During negotiations, the GOES would agree to maintain a
legal registry and cadastral framework satisfactory to the Bank.
(c)   Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanisms (US$0.1  million). This
particular subcomponent would finance technical assistance, an information
campaign and training field notaries and other staff in alternate (judicial and
nonjudicial) dispute resolution mechanisms. Rights to some parcels are
expected to be unclear or contested. These properties would be subject to,
at the request of concerned parties, a mediation process. If agreement is
reached under mediation or other means, the notary could formalize the
parties' agreement,8 or request confirmation by local judges or justices of
the peace.
13.   Project Administration. This third component (US$8.7 million) would finance
the project's management, including vehicles and equipment, technical assistance and
training. The project would finance the operation and expansion of the executing unit
(Unidad Ejecutora-UE), which was created to manage the pilot program under PRISA.
It has proven extremely effective, but it will need strengthening to take on the proposed
project. The UE would be in charge of managing information campaigns and
communications. In each region, the UE will contract out work to firms and will supervise
the firms and their implementation of the project. A monitoring and evaluation system for
the project was established under PRISA. The UE would be responsible also for auditing
requirements and hiring external auditors.
14.   Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$70 million.
Project base cost is US$56 million. Physical contingencies are calculated on the basis of
10 percent for works, information campaigns, and operating costs, and 5 percent for
equipment and vehicles. Price contingencies are estimated as 8 percent for local costs (as
estimated by government) and 2.2 percent for foreign costs. The proposed loan would
provide US$50 million, including refinancing of the US$2 million PPF-264-ES, and the
Government would be responsible to provide the balance of US$20 million. Of the total
7 These are not cost overruns; the financing available for the pilot in PRISA (US$5.6 million) was
substantially below the required to complete the pilot (US$8.5 million).
8. Under the law of voluntary jurisdiction.
5



project cost, US$60.8 million would involve investment and US$9.2 million incremental
recurrent costs over six years. The proposed loan would fund US$4.2 million (about 46
percent) of incremental recurrent costs (salaries, operation, and maintenance costs) on a
declining basis: 100 percent up to the category withdrawals of US$2.0 million (estimated
by the end of 1999); thereafter, 75 percent up to the category of withdrawals of (US$ 3.0
million (estimated by the end of 2000); and 50 percent thereafter. The proposed loan
would finance about 67 percent of total local costs, a level warranted by El Salvador's
transition to peace, its financing commitments under the Peace Accords, and the
substantial share of local project costs while implementing a program of fiscal austerity.
To ensure the maintenance of momentum achieved during project preparation, the PPF,
and pilot activities under PRISA, retroactive financing up to US$5 million (10 percent of
Bank loan) is recommended for eligible expenditures incurred after July 1995.
15.   Most of the technical assistance and training to be provided under the project is
related to skills not available in the government in sufficient depth or quantity.
International technical assistance (i.e., photogrammetry, land information systems) is to be
used mainly for developing system design and training local users. Local technical
assistance refers to skills in ample supply in the private sector (topographers, notaries) to
handle outsourced volume services that will not increase the size of the public sector.
16.   Project Implementation. The project implementing agency would be the CNR.
The CNR's governing body is its Board, headed by the Minister of Justice and composed
of the Executive Director of the CNR, the Vice Ministers of Planning, Housing and Public
Works, and the Project Coordinator. The Board is expected to be expanded to include the
Vice Ministers of Economy and Finance. The CNR currently implements both the barrido
and the Sonsonate records integration of the pilot project through its Executing Unit (UE-
Unidad Ejecutora). This set up, which has been successful during the pilot, would
continue under the proposed project; the CNR Directorate would implement the
institutional strengthening and decentralization component.
17.   Sustainability. The project is designed to make the new National Registry Center
financially self-sustaining. The Legislature has approved CNR autonomy including self-
financing by its ability to allow CNR to retain the revenues it collects and bar any fee
waiver. A cash-flow study carried out for the project shows that the fees to be collected
by CNR will be sufficient to defray its costs, including those for servicing the Bank loan.
The study also shows anticipated revenue and expense streams under that study's base
case, beginning with its 1994 experimental phase under PRISA. On the demand side,
initial parcel-based land regularization, while compulsory, will be free; CNR fees-which
are now set at levels which allow for self-sustainability-are expected to increase
sustainability under universal registration of land transfers, instead of voluntary
registration as it now does.
18.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. For more than two decades the
Bank has been involved in land reform and land tenure issues under its poverty-oriented
rural development strategy. In 1975 the Bank published a land reform paper. Evaluation
6



of projects in Thailand and Kenya9 and recent experience suggest that land reform
programs are most cost-effective and contribute to equity objectives when they are
areawide and combined with agile conflict-resolution mechanisms. The projects showed
that land titling is an important step in increasing rural productivity in areas where (a)
population densities are high; (b) freehold tenure is a reality; (c) traditional systems of land
allocation and dispute adjudication have broken down; and (d) formal credit systems are
willing and able to lend to small farmers against the security of land titles. Except for the
credit link-which was addressed under the SAL II project and is being reviewed by the
ongoing Agriculture Sector Strategy Study-these conditions accurately describe the
situation in El Salvador. There is significant synergy between titling and credit, and titling
land can lead to productivity increases from better access to formal credit.
19.   A review of World Bank experience with rural titling projects throughout the
world reported that, except for the Thailand Land Titling I and II projects (Loans 2440-
TH and 3254-TH, respectively), the 12 operations surveyed performed poorly.'° The
main problems were: lack of political support; conflicting bureaucratic priorities; lack of
institutional capacity or support; and complex multiple objectives of which titling was only
an adjunct. By contrast, the Thailand projects were relatively successful due to: full
political and institutional support; Government commitment to adequate resources; single
titling objective; and relatively favorable land policy environment. The mutual cooperation
between the Land Agency and the World Bank must also be considered a factor of the
success so far. The proposed project is also characterized by full political, institutional and
financial support, single land regularization objective, a favorable agrarian policy
environment, as well as successful pilot experience, as described below.
20.   The proposed project draws lessons from the beginning of implementation of the
pilot project under PRISA, which covered 5,800 hectares in the Sonsonate Department
municipalities of Santa Catarina Mazahaut and Santo Domingo Guzman. This first phase
showed that the registration program was highly popular, and enhanced when adequate
local publicity was given before visits by field teams. It also demonstrated the effectiveness
of the mapper/notary field verification teams, but showed up institutional weaknesses that
led to slow data entry, underscoring the need to streamline and computerize the CNR. It
also provided the first set of hard data on the magnitude of the problem and target group.
Based on data from these municipalities, GOES estimates that, at most, about 40 percent
of properties nationwide are registered, and less than half have cadastral references; of the
unregistered parcels, most were small (76 percent of the urban were below 500 m2 and 91
percent of the rural were below 3 hectares). This data confirmed the poverty reduction
potential of the proposed project. Furthermore, the pilot experience in cost minimization
yielded much lower costs per hectare for the proposed project than recent similar
experiences in East Asia.

Challenges." This paper was prepared for the World Bank Agricultural Sector Symposium, 1994.

21.   Finally, the project also draws from the experiences of the Peace Accord mandated
land transfers, financed mainly by USAID and the European Union. These transfers were
delayed due to deficiencies in the legislation and in registry records. Once the CNR was
included in the land transfer effort -financed by the US$ 2.0 million PPF, two transitory
decrees allowed streamlined procedures for adverse possession and other preventive
annotations that allowed registration.
22.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent with
the Bank Group's Strategy outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the
Board on September 14, 1993, including support for land transfers mandated by the Peace
Accords. This project would modernize the public land registry and cadastral services
under a streamlined agency with full financial sustainability; alleviate poverty by
addressing the needs of smallholders without land security so they can sell and rent at full
price and use land registered titles as collateral; enable private sector growth by allowing
investments on land obtaining secure tenure; and strengthen natural resource and
environmental management by providing the security needed for longer-horizon
investment decisions. The Bank has been supporting the Government in three key areas
leading to the proposed project: agrarian policy formulation, Peace Accords land transfers
and the pilot project under PRISA.
23.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) make no
changes to the CNR on Cadastre Laws which may adversely affect project activities; (b)
establish monitoring and evaluation (M&E) indicators satisfactory to the Bank, including
agreed formats for performance indicators and produce quarterly reports; (c) hold a
midterm review no later than November 30, 1998; (d) hire the UE Quality Control Team
before June 30, 1996; and (e) prior to initiating any project activity in a border area,
submit evidence satisfactory to the Bank, of bordering country's agreement to both
activity and area involved.
24.   Conditions of Effectiveness. As a condition for loan effectiveness, the GOES
agreed to: (a) establish a counterpart fund local currency account; and (b) enter into an
agreement with UNDP or any other agency satisfactory to the Bank, to assist CNR in the
carrying out of procurement of goods, works and hiring of consultant services.
25.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been rated 'C" because it would not
have negative environmental effects and is expected to contribute to better land
management. In the Bank's Natural Resources Management Study (Report No. 12355-
ES), soil erosion was identified as one of El Salvador's main environmental problems. By
improving land security for owners and renters, the project should improve farmer
incentives to apply soil conservation techniques and invest in perennial crops and other
attached investments.
26.   Program  Objective and Poverty Category.  The project is included in the
Program of Targeted Intervention against poverty because a significant majority of its
beneficiaries would be among El Salvador's rural poor. The project would indirectly
8



support the private-sector development objective by enhancing property rights and by
financing outsourced activities. It is expected that the land security provided by
regularized titles and well-defined boundaries will increase incentives for investment and
land management. Based on data from the pilot project, at most 40 percent of properties
nationwide are registered. Of the unregistered parcels, most were small: 76 percent of
unregistered urban parcels were below 500 m2 and 91 percent of unregistered rural
parcels were below 3 ha.
27.   Participatory Approach.  Participatory processes have and will continue to
support project preparation and implementation. Three seminars (Land Policy Options,
Registry and Cadastre Experiences and Alternative Conflict Resolution Mechanisms) were
held during preparation with a wide range of Government and nongovernment
participants. Prior to the pilot project field work, broad information campaigns and
consultations with elected Mayors were conducted. Such consultations will continue
throughout project implementation.
28.   Project Benefits. The project would enhance land security-and value-and
contribute to better land use and enhanced collateral. Secure property rights achieved
through a process of field adjudication and non-judicial conflict resolution are an
important contributor to peace and a significant step toward creating a fluid land market.
Also, because land is a store of value, land holders not currently regularized (mostly rural
and poor) who obtain registered titles under the project will be able to save in land and
convey to others their interest in land assets at the full market value.  Finally, the
establishment of a consolidated and self-financing CNR consolidating land registry and
cadastre functions, able to maintain records updated, is the condition for project
sustainability. An economic analysis of this project was not carried out because a
meaningful cost/benefit analysis cannot be expected from this type of project.
29.   Risks. The main risk lies in the difficulty of strengthening the CNR to modernize
the tasks of constituent agencies, RPRH/RSI and IGN. The difficulty stems from two
aspects, financial resources and human resources. Financial resources are expected to be
sufficient because historically, fees generated by RPRH have generated revenues for the
Treasury and new CNR financial autonomy allows it retain all of its revenues. In addition,
land regularization and universal registration effectively double its clientbase. Technical
staff are not sufficient but CNR will upgrade it by retrenching unnecessary (mainly support
or outdated) staff and hiring more technically qualified staff at higher salaries with the
salary savings. Legislative Decree No. 471 allowing civil service retrenchment with
enhanced indemnizations was approved on October 12, 1995, and CNR shed 350
positions in December 1995. Administrative unrest is not expected after these separations
are completed. Some of the retrenched staff will be contracted by the project for specific,
temporary tasks. A secondary risk is that the magnitude of the demand for field teams
(115) required under the project exceeds the available local capacity. An intensive training
program has been designed to train staff and contractors and the Government has agreed
to hire the Quality Control Team before June 30, 1996. Civil unrest is not a risk. Aided

successful. Crime-related insecurity remains, however, and are being addressed by the
recently installed civil police.
30.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
