MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 72.7 MILLION
(US$103 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE NORTHER? IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Credit for SDR 72.7 million (US$103 million equivalent) to the
People's Republic of China is submitted for approval.   The proposed
Credit, which would help finance the Northern Irrigation Project,
would be an standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity.
2.     Background.  Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance to over one billion
people, is a major source of income for some 190 million farm
families, and accounts for about 35% of the country's GDP. Major
revisions in farm policies since 1979, most importantly, a shift from
collective to household-managed farming and substantial increases in
farm prices, have led to rapid growth and diversification in
agricultural production. Over the period 1980-85, production
increased by 10% per year compared to an average of 3% per year in
the preceding 23 vears. Gviain output reached a record 407 million
tons in 1984, 34% greateL than in 1978, despite a reduction in area
sown to grain. In 1985, tnie Government began a new phase of reform,
replacing mandatory procurement quotas with voluntary contracts,
adjusting procurement prices, and greatly enlarging the role of the
market. These measures, and the price fluctuations resulting from
them, contributed to a decline in grain and cotton output and
hecterage as farmers shifted Droduction into higher-priced cash crops
and livestock. Grain production fell from the 1984 high to 379
million tons in 1985 and 391 million in 1986.
3.    Objectives for agriculture during the 7th Fiv3-year Plan (1986-
1990) are to maintain per capita grain consumption it current levels
while continuing to diversify the overall output structure to
accommodate changing consumer preferences. This means increasing
food grain output to 425 million tons by 1990 to matzh population
growth, boosting production of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry,
fish, and cash crops, and expanding output of processed products. To
achieve sector growth, Chinese planners are supporting a series of
systemic reforms which include: (a) creating a regulatory framework
consisting of price, taxation, credit, and legal mechanisms to guide
development of the rural economy; (b) allowing diverse forms of
enterprise ownership; and (c) reducing the scope of contract
procurement, reducing consumer subsidies, and increasing the role of
the market. Emphasis is also being given to improvements in
technology and management which would lead to increased productivity
of existing cropped areas and efficient development of unused or
underutilized land. Consistent with this approach, water resources
development policy has given priority to increasing the efficiency of
existing irrigation systems through completion and rehabilitation of



-2-
irrigation and drainage structures and improved water management.
The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power projects expansion
of irrigated area by about eight million ha by the year 2000, mostly
through additions and improvements to existing schemes.
4.   The Bank Group's stritegy for lending in China's agricultural
sector has been to support the Government's objectives outlined above
(para. 3). Lending to date has included 14 operations involving a
total assistance of about US$1 billion for land d.valop vnt; support
services including agricultural training, research, credit and seed
production; development of specialized product subsectors including
rubber, forestry and fisheries; and area development projects
combining crop and livestock production, agro-processing and support
services. Implementation of these projects is generally on schedule.
Future Bank Group lending would continue to support projects in large
and diverse subsectors. e.g. water resources development, agro-
processing, and rural credit.
5.    Project Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project
are (a) to increase the efficiency and profitability of agricultural
production in Nei Monggol and (b) to alleviate absolute poverty in
Ningxia. These objectives are in line with the Government's strategy
of making more efficient use of iand and water resources and reducing
regional income differentials.  The project would contribute to
increased yields and production, thus helping to ensure high and
stable grain output regionally and setting the stage for a more
diversified, profitable agriculture. It would directly alleviate
extreme poverty in Ningxia by establishing newly irrigated land for
resettlement of farmers from drought-prone or overcrowded areas who
are now largely dependent on Government welfare.
6.    Project Description.  The proposed project would improve and
expand irrigated area in Nei Monggol and Ningxia through
construction, rehabilitation, and completion of canals, drains, and
associated structures. In the Hetao area of Nei Monggol, the project
would rehabilitate and complete existing drains and canals serving
210,000 ha of presently low-yielding cropland or marginal grazing
area. In Yinnan, Ningxia, it would upgrade and complete irrigation
and drainage works on 22,000 ha and open up 14,200 ha of newly
irrigated land. The project would expand production of wheat, corn,
oilseed, sugar beet, fruits, fodder crops, and livestock. It would
supply fertilizers, plastic mulch and breeding stock and would
strengthen research and extension services. The project's training
and tecbnical assistance component would include short courses and
overseas study tours for project management staff and demonstration
and training activities for farmers and extension workers. A
resettlement component would provide housing, agricultural machinery
and inputs, electricity, water supply, roads, and social services to
11,000 poor farm families who would be relocated onto the newly
irrigated land in Yinnan. The total project cost is estimated at
US$234 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$103 million
or 44% of the total. Estimated costs, procurement and disbursements
are summarized in the attached Schedule A and B.



-3-
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project is in line
with the Government's efforts to reverse declining grain production
and offset losses of arable land to non-agricultural uses through
programs of land reclamatior, improvement and expansion of irrigated
area, and raising crop yields. It also supports the Government's
policy of increasing productive investment in poorer areas so as to
reduce geographical income disparities. Both of the proposed project
areas have the potential for marked expansion in outpvu: in Hetao,
through improvements in drains, canals and system managenent on
existing irrigated land, and in Yinnan, through system completion and
opening up new areas to irrigated crop cultivation. Expansion in
output would lead to increased incomes and living standards for
122,000 farm families, some 23,000 of them now living in extreme
poverty in Ningxia. The major rationale for IDA involvement in the
project is to make available to the Nei Monggol and Ningxia water
resources agencies the Bank Group's experience in establishing
irrigation, drainage, and rural development schemes in other parts of
the world. In particular, IDA involvement would provide access to
new technologies available within the international communi-y: e.g.,
satellite imagery and computerized groundwater monitoring devices
used in designing control measures for waterlogging and salinity,
aerial mapping to help in the design and layout of on-farm ditches
and drains, and VHF radio communication and remote control equipment
to improve system management. Project-sponsored training and overseas
study tours would provide opportunities for Chinese technicians to
study more efficient use of land and water resources and better
management of large irrigation areas.
8.   Agreed Actions.  To ensure effective implementation of the
project, the Government has agreed to the following: (i) an annual
program for provision of chemical fertilizer nutrients would be
prepared by each Region and submitted for review prior to November 1
of each year; (ii) in Ningxia, a working group established under the
Regional Project Management Office would prepare a feasibility study
of the Yinbei area for submission to IDA by June 30, 1991; (iii)
local competitive bidding procedures for each Region would be
submitted to IDA for review and approval prior to bid invitation;
(iv, in Ningxia, the resettlement component iould be carried out in
accordance with a plan acceptable to IDA; (v) in Nei Monggol, the
Water Resources and Environmental Protection Bureaus would
continuously monitor water quality in the drains and Wuliangsuhai
Lake and ensure that project activities would be in compliance with
China's national guidelines on environmental control and acceptable
to IDA; and (vi) water fees would be increased so as to cover, at a
minimum, full operation and maintenance costs in accordance with a
schedule acceptable to IDA.
9.    Benefits and Justification.  At full development, annual
incremental output is expected to include 133,000 tons of wheat,
181,000 tons of corn and other grains, 38,000 tons of oilseeds. over
600,000 tons of sugar beet, fruits and vegetables, over 12,000 tons
of lamb and other meats, 2,300 tons of wool, and additional
quantities of timber and animal hides. The value of annual
incremental output from project investments would be about US$93



-4-
million. The project would improve income levels and living
standards for about 122,600 households, including 96,300 and 15,500
families currently residing in Hatao and Yinnan respectively and an
additional 11,000 families to be relocated in Yinnan. The project's
overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 20%, ranging from 17% for
Yinnan's lift irrigation component to 21% for rehabilitation of
irrigation and drainage in both Hatao and Jinyintan.
10.   Risks.  The project faces no significant manageent or
technical risks. The project management structure is already in
place at the regional level and a parallel structure is being
established at the prefectural and county levels. The Nei Mongol
and Ningxia Water Resources Bureaus, the leading agencies involved in
planning and construction of project works, are adequately staffed
with qualified engineers and managers anc have had decades of
experience in construction, operation and maintenance of large-scale
irrigation schemes. Moreover, the reorganizatiot. of the Hetao water
resource agencies has been designed to correct for previous
deficiencies in management of drainage operations, while project-
financed programs of overseas and local training would upgrade the
management and technical skills of staff at all levels. Of concern
to Nei Monggol project authorities is the possibility that the
temporary rise in salinity levels in Wuliangsuhai Lake, as a result
of increased inflows from drains constructed by the project, would
adversely affect the ecosystem in general and fish and reed
production in particular. Project authorities have, therefore,
commissioned the Environmental Hydrogeology Research Institute to
direct an environmental impact study of the lake. Preliminary
findings indicate only minor changes in salinity levels, which would
have no adverse effects on either reeds or fish. Project authorities
plan conti- .uous monitoring of water quality with the results
submitted :o IDA annually. Market prospects for the project's
incremental output are excellent and, should the profitability of any
individual crop or product decrease to unattractive levels, project
farmers would have ample latitude to shift production toward more
profitable alternatives.
10.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

/a   As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI),
undisbursed SDR credit balances are converted to dollars at
the current exchange rate between the dolllar and the SDR.
In some Lases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates
a dollar amount greater than the original principal credit
amount expressed in dollars.

in a separate report on all Bank/IDA financial projects
in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
