Country: Burkina Faso                                  Project Title: Post-Primary Education Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1A for key performance indicators):
The project supports the implementation of the Government's Post-Primary Education Strategy (PPES). It aims to have
more and better-trained students graduated from secondary schools at reduced subsidy costs, with increased equality
between genders and income levels. Progress in achieving this development objective by 2001 will be evaluated on the
basis of the following indicators: (a) the proportion of primary school graduates who continue on to lower-secondary
education rises from 27% to 30%; (b) grade repetition decreases from 25% to 20%; (c) total student social subsidies in
higher and secondary education are reduced from CFAF 4.8 billion to CFAF 2.2 billion; (d) the proportion of girls
enrolled in secondary school rises from 35% to 40% of total enrollment; and (e) 8,000 additional students are enrolled in
secondary schools in the 10 provinces with the highest incidence of poverty and lowest school coverage.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project supports expansion of both public and private provision of services to increase access to secondary education
and promotes greater participation by girls and by low-income young people. In addition, various measures are designed
to improve the quality of education offered and enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education
and Scientific Research (MESSRS) to carry out its functions in the education sector.

3. Benefits and target population
Economic benefits
* More skilled and productive labor force through increased numbers of students educated: 45,000 additional places in
lower-secondary schools, plus increased flows through less grade repetition. (In the Economic Assessment, section
13, the value of this benefit is measured as higher earnings for secondary-school graduates. Higher earnings, in tuni,
benefit the country through higher tax payments and increased remittances from expatriate workers).
* Reduced fiscal burden: cost recovery through increase in student fees, increased tax revenues on higher earnings of
secondary school graduates, shift to private provision of education, reduction in subsidies (see section 13).
* Higher quality of education: better trained teachers, improved curricula. Higher quality improves both the skills of
the graduates and the efficiency of the system.
Social benefits
* Increased numbers of girls educated: dormitory rooms and scholarships reserved for girls.
* Greater equality of educational opportunity: government education resources concentrated on most underserved
populations, with 86% of the school construction program targeted to provinces where the proportion of poor people
is the highest.



3
Other benefits
* Institution-building: improved ability of MESSRS to manage the education sector; enhanced partnership among
government and the private sector, municipalities, NGOs, and communities.
Targetpopulations: (a) primary school graduates who pass the national entrance exam for secondary school; (b) boys and
girls in the 10 provinces with the lowest access to secondary education and in the zones with the highest percentage of
population living below the poverty line; (c) boys and girls from households in the two highest income groups and living
in urban areas, who will have increased access to nonpublic schools; and (d) girls in tertiary education.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements (details are included in the Project Implementation Manual):
The project team has appraised the draft Implementation Manual and found it substantially satisfactory.
Implementation period: Five years
Executing agency: MESSRS
Project coordination: A project coordinator (PC), to be assisted by a small administrative staff, will be posted in the
Minister's Cabinet and will report directly to the Minister. The PC will be responsible for planning and coordinating
project activities within the MESSRS, with other Government agencies/units, and with other groups. Under the PC's
guidance, MESSRS line units will be responsible for day-to-day coordination and implementation of activities for which
they have prime responsibility. Project coordination will be ensured at all operational levels (central, regional, and
community/school) through committees with representatives from relevant Government agencies/units, beneficiaries,
private sector groups, and NGOs.
Project oversight and policy guidance will be the responsibility of MESSRS' Steering Committee, which is chaired by
the Minister; the Committee will be supported by the Interministerial Committee, comprising MESSRS, Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Public Service, and the Ministry of Basic Education (MEBA).
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements: Directorate of Administrative and Financial Affairs
(DAAF)/MESSRS will be responsible for project financial management, reporting, and auditing following systems and
procedures acceptable to IDA. Accounting records will be kept for all project-related expenditures and financing
following generally accepted accounting principles. Project accounts will be audited annually, following international
auditing standards, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Disbursements under SOEs will be audited semiannually.
The annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year, and the semiannual
audit report within three months of the end of each period. The project special account will be managed by DAAF, with
the PC as a co-signator. MESSRS' decentralized administration will be complemented with decentralized financial
management controls.
Monitoring and evaluation (M/E) arrangements: The project supports the development of M/E systems and processes.
Under the PC's guidance, project M/E will be the shared responsibility of the MESSRS directorates (DBES, DEP, DGES,
and DIFPE). Relevant data collection, validation, analysis, and dissemination will be the responsibility of the DEP. M/E
will be guided by (a) the Letter of Education Sector Development Policy (see Annex IB); (b) the Project Design
Summary (see Annex IA); and (c) the Implementation Plan in the Project Implementation Manual. M/E will be
conducted through (a) monthly meetings of the MESSRS committee of concerned directorates, chaired by the MESSRS
Minister (the meetings will be open to staff of IDA and other donors); (b) IDA supervision missions; (c) annual progress
review during IDA supervision missions before the end of the first quarter of each fiscal year; (d) midterm review (MTR)
of project implementation jointly with IDA and other donors no later than 30 months after effectiveness; and (e)
beneficiary surveys and assessments at MTR and at other implementation milestones as shown in the implementation
plan. Twice each year (by July 30 and January 31), the PC will transmit to IDA progress reports on project
implementation and outcomes, using the format agreed at negotiations. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
will be prepared within six months after the Credit closing; MESSRS will contribute to the ICR its own evaluation of the
project and an operational plan.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project     (CAS: Report No. 15740-BUR, Board Date July 11, 1996)
The Burkina Faso CAS recognizes that the country's low level of human capital adversely affects the economic returns to
investments in all sectors, and that its long-term growth prospects are seriously limited by the population's low
educational attainment and skill levels. Therefore, the CAS is designed to address long-term human capital development
by providing Bank support for accelerating the provision of social services over the medium term and building the basis
for faster improvement in social indicators. The proposed operation serves this strategy by helping to ensure that
increasing numbers of students continue to secondary schools (laying the foundation for meeting the CAS objective of a
35% transition rate by 2005) and that the education they receive is of higher quality.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector issues
Enrollments at all levels of education remain low in Burkina Faso compared to international standards. Gross primary
school enrollment, which was about 5% at the time of independence in 1960, has increased to 38%. At the secondary
level, enrollments have increased fourfold over the last decade to about 9% of the relevant age group. The demand for
places in public secondary schools is far greater than the availability of places, especially in the Ouagadougou and Bobo
Dioulasso urban areas. About 8,800 students are enrolled in technical schools (73% in private schools, most in
Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso). A National University, created in 1974 with 533 students, now has over 9,400
students, or about I % of the relevant age group.
The quality of education is low, as is evidenced by high dropout and repeater rates and low examination pass rates at all
levels. It takes 9.5 years, on average, to produce a lower secondary school graduate (2.4 times longer than necessary'l, and
an additional 5.8 years to produce an upper secondary graduate (1.9 times longer). In secondary schools the instructional
year is very short; it extends only from the second week of October to the end of May.
MESSRS' capacity to use its resources cost-effectively is hampered by its weak capacity for management. It has had
limited experience with the implementation of foreign-financed projects.
Government strategy
In the late 1980s, the Government developed a five-year plan to expand and improve primary education. This plan
became a National Basic Education Program, designed to raise the gross enrollment ratio to 46% of the school-aged
population by the year 2000, improve the quality of education, increase the enrollment of girls, and promote more cost-
effective use of public education resources. Following several studies and technical discussion on the education system,
in 1994 the Government organized a national consultation (Etats Generaux de l'Education-EGE) that recognized that
resources for education will remain constrained; the EGE proposed a number of measures to increase cost-effectiveness
and recommended giving priority to primary education. In response, the Government developed a subsectoral reform
program (SSRP) to improve education within severe economic and budgetary constraints. In the context of the SSRI1, the
Government developed a Post-Primary Education Strategy (PPES) to: (a) restructure the sector to use resources more
efficiently; (b) increase the participation of the private sector in secondary education to free up resources for the
expansion of public primary education; and (c) improve quality and efficiency. The PPES was accompanied by an
Investment Plan (IP) for 1996-2005.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project is designed to support the implementation of the PPES: to increase secondary school enrollments and to
improve the quality of secondary education; and to build the Government's capacity to plan and manage resource use in
the education sector.
Strategic choices
The principal strategic choice for this project was between public and private provision of services. Analysis showecl
that, although measures to improve efficiency and access could increase intakes to some extent, the public sector would
not be financially able to support the initial planned growth in public enrollment of about 13% p.a., or to meet the
recurrent costs obligations of any significant expansion in enrollment. However, all-private provision raised serious
questions of equity of access to education by all economic classes; private school fees are well beyond the ability of most
Burkinabe households to pay. The solution was combined provision of services: expanding private provision (through



5
increased nonpublic first-grade intakes by up to 15% p.a.) where demand is high, and concentrating public resources on
lower-income and underserved groups.
A second strategic choice, which flowed from the first, involved the geographic locations of the proposed schools to best
achieve project goals. The following decisions were made: (a) building on the high demand for private education in the
larger cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, the project will encourage expansion of private schooling there; (b) to
keep fees lower, it will target nonpublic schools in secondary cities and less affluent areas for management by
municipalities, NGOs, and other nonprofit organizations; and (c) it will support public sector provision of expanded
educational opportunities in the poorest and more rural areas.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
School construction. Alternatives rejected:
* Continue existing practice whereby the community constructs school facilities, with materials supplied by the
Government when necessary. Rejected because (a) experience shows that community construction is slow, so the
project would be unlikely to achieve its targets for increased access and enrollment; and (b) the generally poor quality
of community construction presents a maintenance issue.
* Engage private contractors for the construction of all school facilities. Rejected because replacing community
participation (a long-standing tradition in the country) would undermine ownership and sustainability.
Alternative selected: Engage private contractors to build the minimum package of facilities; maintain the traditional
community/government approach to construct teachers' houses; and assign responsibility for maintenance to the
community.
Project management and implementation. Alternatives rejected:
* Create a project management unit. Rejected because the possibility of disconnect from the mainstream sector
management would make the unit ineffective.
* Assign project management to the project coordinating unit of Education IV under MEBAM. Rejected because
institutional links with MESSRS would be too weak.
Alternative selected: Mainstream project management and implementation arrangements within the MESSRS
organizational structure, with support for institutional capacity building and sustainability.
Incentives to private schools. Alternatives rejected:
* Construct matching classrooms by the Government, through credit support, at no cost to the schools. Rejected because
it would be inconsistent with cost recovery objectives and would give the appearance of favoring private schools (and
higher-income families) at the expense of public schools (and lower-income families).
* Reimburse the operators of schools built through credit in the form of student places. Rejected because of the heavy
administrative requirements for record keeping and monitoring the cost, value, and distribution of student places.
Alternative selected: Provide interest-free reimbursements into an account with MESSRS, with reasonable grace and
pay-off periods, and use these funds to further advance project objectives (for details, see the Project Implementation
Manual).

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Lesson I (see PCR, Second Education Project): the Government should, at an early stage, develop a comprehensive
policy framework that forms the basis for the intervention of all donors in the subsector. Reflecting this lesson, the
project is based on the Government's Post-Primary Education Strategy and Investment Plan developed following a
national consultation on education.
* Lesson 2 (see ICR, Primary Education Development Project): to guide implementation and build momentum,
reasonably detailed implementation arrangements covering especially the first two years should be developed before
the project becomes effective. Reflecting this lesson, MESSRS has prepared a satisfactory draft implementation
manual focusing on detailed programs for the first two years of the project.
*  Lesson 3 (see ICR, Primary Education Development Project): implementing sensitive reform measures affecting, in
particular, secondary and higher education students (e.g., reduction of scholarships) is politically risky; such reforms
are not likely to succeed unless they are preceded by extensive consensus-building efforts among the various affected
groups. Reflecting this lesson, national and regional workshops were held during project preparation; and extensive
discussions on the project's objectives, policy measures, and investment program were conducted with the Burkinabe
authorities at the national and local levels (including mayors), the teachers' union, parents' associations, NGOs, and
private sector representatives.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
A Burkinabe delegation of five technical staff, led by the minister of Secondary and Higher Education, visited
Washington in June 1995 to present and discuss both the PPES and the IP. The Government has confirmed its
commitment to the education sector reforms set out in the SSRP in its Letter of Education Sector Development Policy (see
Annex I B). In addition, to build wide understanding and ownership, it has sponsored discussion of most of the SSRP
measures at the national and regional levels and with teachers, donors, NGOs, and the unions (see section 10). Draft
implementation plans and schedules have been prepared for each element of the investment program; sites for the first
two-year school construction program are being identified; and requirements for furniture, pedagogical materials, and
equipment have been submitted to IDA and found acceptable.
SSRP measures already taken by the Government
* Support for female students: as of SY 1995/96, 60% of the 679 students' rooms in the dormitories at the university are
reserved for female students.
* Reduction in scholarships: between SY 1991/92 and SY 1995/96, the total number of scholarships awarded annually
has decreased from 6,123 to 3,407 for higher education, and from 22,750 to 11,345 for secondary education.
* Academic improvements: the school year has been lengthened to include 36 weeks of effective teaching, and
secondary schools are now required to include two hours per week of supervised homework.
. Cost recovery: public secondary school students must now pay registration fees (CFAF 20,000 for the first year and
CFAF 5,000 the following years), of which the schools themselves keep 75%; and, starting in 1997, university fees
will be increased to at least CFAF 15,000.
* Administrative changes: the "Office du Baccalaureat" (OF) and the "Centre National des Oeuvres Universitaires"
(CENOU), formerly managed by the university, have been transferred to MESSRS, leaving the university free to focus
on academic matters. Similarly, the management of a restaurant at CUPB has been transferred to a private operator.
* Support for gender equality: only female students will be eligible for new secondary education scholarships.
12. Value added of Bank support:
CAS
The preparation of the proposed project was complemented by three other Bank instruments: the CAS, a Public
Expenditure Review (PER), and a Poverty Survey. During the preparation of the CAS, both the Ministry of Secondary
and Higher Education and the Ministry of Basic Education participated in consultations about the broader aspects of the
Bank's assistance strategy and the government's own development strategy. As a result, the proposed project has
benefited from the best possible integration into the sectoral and overall strategies.



8
PER
The preparation of the PER, which was carried out by a Burkinabe team with the assistance of Bank staff, helped further to
ensure that the education strategy is consistent with the overall fiscal framework. The Burkinabe team will continue to
carry out PER work each year, thus guaranteeing close monitoring of overall expenditures to accommodate an increased
allocation to social sectors, including education.
Poverty Survey
The Poverty Survey, conducted in 1995 by a Burkinabe team with the Bank's support and discussed at the national level in
1996, helped to define the geographic location of the proposed investment and to better target provinces whose populations
are below the poverty threshold and cities whose populations have significantly lower indicators of poverty.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4):             Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 6.1 million; ERR=17%.
* The economic benefits in the cost-benefit analysis are measured by the incremental earnings of secondary school
graduates produced by the project. Other benefits identified in section 3 above cannot be quantified in monetary terms
and were excluded from the analysis.
* The economic costs include the project investment and incremental recurrent costs as well as private direct costs
(school fees and other school-related costs incurred by households in sending children to school) and opportunity costs
(the income that students forgo by attending school).
* The project is economically feasible, as indicated by its NPV of more than US$6.0 million equivalent (using a discount
rate of 10%) and ERR of 17%. Risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulations shows that project feasibility is robust
with respect to a deterioration in key assumptions, i.e., the probability that NPV would become negative (or that the
ERR would fall below 10%) is negligible.
* The project impact on Government finances is positive. The present value of net benefits accruing to the Government
is estimated at US$3.4 million. This would come from (i) the lower cost to the Government of providing secondary
education because of a reduction in its social subsidies to students, increased student fees, and more efficient use of
teachers, and (ii) additional tax revenues on the higher earnings of secondary school graduates.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex Sa):
* Incremental recurrent costs of the project to be financed by the Government would average US$1.3 million equivalent
(see Annex Table SB) per year from 1997-2001, and would be more than offset by the larger recurrent cost savings
expected under the project, averaging US$2.7 million equivalent per year. These can be easily absorbed within the
MESSRS budget. Government financing of project recurrent costs beyond the investment phase of the project would
also not be problematic as a large share of recurrent costs would be financed either through cost-recovery mechanisms
or by the private sector.
* Financial incentives in the form of subsidized, long-term credit would be sufficient to induce private school operators to
participate in the project. Assuming a fee level in line with prevailing practice (about US$107 equivalent per student
year), the financial rate of return (FRR) to a typical private school operator would be about 17%. The FRR is highly
sensitive to changes in fee level. An increase in fees by about 5% (to US$112 equivalent per student year) would
increase the FRR to 31% (see Annex Table SC).
* The NPV in financial terms that would accrue to secondary school graduates and their families as a group is estimated
at US$2.8 million equivalent or 45% of total net benefits (see Annex 4). The poorer students and girls whose education
costs would be subsidized under the project, would account for a more than proportionate share of total net benefits.
15. Technical Assessment:
The project is technically sound. Within the context of the poverty agenda, it addresses the issues of access and equity
systematically on the basis of needs, opportunities, and comparative advantages. Project components (construction
program, teacher training, textbooks, curriculum reforms, etc.) were prepared on the basis of international as well as
regional norms and practices, and will be implemented in accordance with acceptable standards. Innovations, such as
school management by NGOs and support to private schools, are based on sound technical and economic feasibility studies
(see project file).
Investments and recurrent cost estimates for the project are based on estimates of prevailing market unit cost, with
appropriate allowance for inflation. A reasonable level of physical contingencies has also been included in the cost
estimates.

16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: The 1996-97 policy reforms and the formulation of the Letter of Education Sector Development
Policy, demonstrate MESSRS' ability to formulate a policy agenda and carry it out through its decentralized organization.
The project includes measures to strengthen MESSRS' capacity at all operational levels, particularly in the areas of
planning, coordination, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.
Project management: MESSRS has limited experience in implementing donor-financed projects. Therefore, the project
includes measures to strengthen project management and reduce the procurement and accounting burden on the Ministry:
(a) appointment of a Project Coordinator in the Minister's cabinet (see Section 4); (b) recruitment of a procurement
specialist and an accountant, and the installation of an accounting system acceptable to IDA at DAAF; and (c) delegation
of about half of the construction management to Faso Baara, an experienced contract management agency.
17. Social Assessment:
Several social factors may affect the project's abilities to achieve its goals. A positive effect is likely to come from the
identified high demand for educational services in the population centers of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso.
Nationwide, however, at least three factors may make people unwilling or unable to take advantage of education
opportunities: (a) economic costs; (b) opportunity costs, particularly for girls; and (c) a high level of mobility. People in
Burkina Faso relocate in search of employment or education and for purposes of marriage: 28% of the population of 10
years or older (of whom more than half are females) have migrated at least once.
The project includes measures to reduce the economic costs of education (scholarships for girls, broadened public
provision of education, reduced cost of textbooks). The problem of high mobility challenges the design and financing of
education services; but by standardizing education throughout the country, and providing schools in more locations, the
project improves the chances that people who move will be able to continue their education.
18. Environmental Assessment:
This is a Category C project. No environmental risks are foreseen. Construction would comply with national
environmental laws. Schools would be built following acceptable standards. Many classrooms would be associated with
existing schools. Provision of latrines and promoted hygiene will have positive environmental impact. There would be no
displacement of people.

Other (specify)
Note: IS = information sharing, CON = consultation, and COL = collaboration.
20. Sustainability:
The project is designed to promote long-term sustainability by (a) developing a capacity in MESSRS to constantly
evaluate the quality and effectiveness of secondary and tertiary education, and to take immediate remedial actions as
necessary; (b) reducing expenditures on scholarships, and other social expenditures, freeing resources for improvement in
quality; (c) ensuring that all public secondary schools have sufficient resources to finance nonteaching expenditures; and
(d) ensuring quality education in nonpublic secondary schools to encourage increased enrollment without placing an
additional burden on the Government's budget.
The savings associated with the planned policy measures are summarized in Annex 5. These include (a) direct revenue
and savings from increasing university and registration fees, reduction of grants and scholarships, and a cost-recovery
scheme for textbooks; and (b) indirect savings associated with such measures as the privatization of the management of the
university restaurant canteens and of the student health insurance scheme, and the redeployment of some of the teaching
staff. These savings (13% of recurrent budget) actually outweigh the incremental recurrent costs (7% of recurrent budget)
associated with the investments proposed in the project.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Two aspects of the project may be controversial. First, MESSRS may be criticized for providing support in the form of
physical facilities to private operators and NGOs, thus helping them make additional profits. The constructive dialogue
with key stakeholders conducted by the Government during project preparation will continue during project
implementation, and benefits realized from the project's support to the private sector will be in turn directed to support the
less privileged segments of the population. It is unlikely that this policy will not be acceptable to the public. Second,
higher education students and teachers may oppose the efficiency measures that will affect them directly (reduction of
social subsidies and longer working hours for teachers). Improved quality of education will help the concerned groups
better understand the ultimate goal of the efficiency measures.

Mr. President,
This letter clarifies the objectives of the Government of Burkina Faso for the period
1996-2005, which are contained in the Post-primary Education Development Plan.
The education policy of Burkina Faso is founded on the priority given to the education
sector as a basis for development in the technological, economic, social and cultural domains,
follows the national consultation on education (Etats Generaux de I 'Education EGE)of
September 1994 and is consistent with the framework legislation for the education sector (Loi
d'Orientation de l'Education) passed by the Burkinabe parliament on May 6, 1996. From the
economic choices made by the Burkinabe government and from the strategy for poverty
reduction, it is clear that the evolution of Burkina, will be based upon the efficiency of the
education system. The development of the education system has become imperative to national
development. Such qualitative and quantitative development is based on several points of
reference.
The education system must be viewed as a whole and as a coherent system. As a result,
all levels of education, from pre-school to university, must be linked in a logical manner. Thus,
each educational level must be conceived, organized, and managed autonomously, and offer to
the students a specific and complete training. At all levels, the professionalization of education
has become a necessary yield of the education system and its appropriateness to the needs of the
society and the State. The resulting introduction of technology at all levels of education and
training is a major innovation. Additionally, professional training will be developed on a large
scale, which will allow education to offer its students real prospects.
* All of the actions envisaged for national education cannot be effectively implemented
without infrastructure developments, equipment, and teacher and supervisor training. The
strategic objective of the Burkinabe education system is to enroll all the country's children
and to make the maximum number of adults literate. A ten-year plan of educational
development, with a view to universal education, and its action programs are being
developed and will be adopted by the Government in the last trimester of 1996 or the first
trimester of 1997
* At the pre-school level, the following measures are envisaged: (a) adoption of a streamlined
program; (b) adoption of incentive measures to allow for maximum private initiative; (c)
greater organization of the structures and educational activities; and (d) training of teachers
and qualified supervisors. Whether formal or informal, non-profit, community organized
(village associations, collectivities, groups...) or private, for-profit managed (businesses),
pre-school should be a fast-growing with the goal of: (a) contributing to the educational
awakening of the children; and (b) alleviate some of the mother's child-rearing and domestic
responsibilities
* At the basic education level, the choice of ranking primary education as a national priority
will be upheld and consolidated. The enrollment effort will be pursued and intensified in
order to reach enrollment ratio of 60% in the year 2000 and 100% in the year 2010. In order
to achieve this, a certain number of action plans have already been adopted, some of which



ANNEX IB
Page 2 of 5
are currently under execution: (a) the second fifteen-year development plan; (b) a specific
plan for girls education; and (c) an "education for all" plan including two adult literacy
components: the second three-year plan (1993-1996) conducted by the National Literacy
Institution and Operation ZANU.
In conjunction with these action plans, whose ultimate goal is to increase the offer of
education and eradicate the disparities, a number of specific programs exist, notably: (a)
constructing and equipping the education facilities; (b) recruiting, training, and supervision
of the personnel; (c) periodic revision of the programs; (d) production and distribution of
textbooks; (e) implementation and experimentation with alternative forms of teaching such
as multigrade classes, double-shift teaching, satellite schools, non-formal basic education
centers; (f) organization and development of private education; (g) improved management of
available resources; and (h) improved living and working conditions for students and
teachers.
* At the secondary education level: (a) on the quantitative plan: (i) increase the student places
and correct the disparities between regions and between boys and girls; (ii) ensure the
progressive expansion of the sector which must be linked to the development level of
primary education, and achieve a 30% enrollment rate in the year 2005; (iii) realize the
objective of "one department, one CEG" between now and the year 2000; (iv) raise girls'
enrollment to a level approaching that of boys; (v) promote the CEG having more than 500
students in 1996 to departmental lycees in 1998; (vi) by 1998, open the scientific lycee in
Ouagadougou and the professional lycee in Bobo-Dioulasso; (vii) by 2010, introduce 10
CET, five agricultural lycees and three professional Iycees; and (vii) by 2010, introduce 50
CET throughout the country; and
* (b) on the qualitative plan: (i) construct and equip 26 experimental scientific laboratories by
the year 2000; (ii) undertake the training of laboratory technicians and support the
implementation of the structures; (iii) train the teachers and supervisors; (iv) improve
internal and external efficacy throughout the system; (v) give priority to teaching science and
to technical and professional teaching. This is the reason for the creation of scientific 1ycees
and "Iyce'es d'excellence"; (vi) launch a training program for mathematics and physical
science teachers; (vii) adopt discipline restoration measures, improve the evaluation system
as well as the morale; and (viii) improve the living conditions of the students and the
teachers.
* At the higher education level: (a) promote quality teaching by increasing and better
utilizing financial resources; (b) encourage and promote national expertise; (c) encourage the
development of short-term professional networks with the goal of providing the national
economy with indispensable middle-management personnel; (d) streamline and
progressively decentralize the teaching structures in order to increase and regulate the
stLdent openings at the facilities; (e) improve the living conditions of the students, teachers,
and researchers; (f) establish a dynamic and multidisciplinary integration policy which
favors inter-university exchanges and establish centers of excellence "'poles d'excellence" in
specific areas such as water, economy, chemical, biological, bio-medical, and social
sciences, and in all networks used in development. This policy will be executed in the scope
of the Ministerial Conference for Higher Education and Research in West Africa
At the technical and vocational training level: (a) define a national policy for technical
education and vocational training; (b) define and organize the diverse training structures and
institutions through legislation and implement efficient management which will better
coordinate the efforts; (c) in time, a coordination program of the national technical and



ANNEX IB
Page 3 of 5
vocational training policy will be implemented by the departments responsible for training
and employment with the objective of harmonizing the programs, recruiting students,
ratifying certificates and diplomas, and organizing the careers of teachers; and (d) restructure
and apply alternative financing formulas in order to mobilize all the available resources
With regard to using national languages: The adoption of a national language statute, the study
of the methods, and the implementation of their use in the education system as well as in
economic, administrative, political, social, cultural, etc. domains will constitute one of the
fundamental axis around which the sector programs will develop. The experimentation with new
methods of learning French, following literacy in the national languages, will be followed up and
diversified in the hope of expanding the most efficient strategies, eradicating illiteracy, and
promoting the national Burkinabe culture.
* Regarding resource planning: Conception and establishment of a quality school which
responds to the needs and aspirations of the society, necessitates the implementation of a
rigorous and functioning management system. This will entail not only resource planning,
but also personnel training. In order to accomplish this, specific strategies in each area will
be established to resolve the questions of: (a) recruitment, training, and management of the
personnel; (b) construction, equipment, and maintenance of the infrastructure; (c)
mobilization of additional resources; and (d) development of partnerships.
All education projects are found in the same framework. It is also true of the Post-primary
Education Development Project which is being submitted to IDA for financing. The strategy
aims at making post-primary education a more equitable and pertinent system, with a more
efficient use of resources, and a priority in the development of secondary education, including
the private sector, while improving its quality. This project will be the fifth in the education
sector in Burkina, but the first dedicated to post-primary education. It will be an investment
project comprised of a sub -sectoral reforms which are part of the Etats GenerazLx de I'Edlucation
de 1994. The primary axes of the project have been defined in the Development of Post-primary
Education Strategy Document; in the Post-primary Education Development Plan (PEPP) , and in
different sub-programs developed by the Government. It takes into account the macro-economic
framework documents, and the conclusions of the poverty study conducted in 1995. The PEPP
aims at pointing the education sector down a path of improving the economic and social returns
on investments, notably those foreseen by the project.
One of the major economic and social developmental problems with which Burkina Faso is
confronted is the low level of human resources. The Government has decided to place priority
on the resolution of this problem in its overall country strategy. While giving priority to primary
education, an increase in enrollment at the post-primary level is essential to the economic growth
of the country. It is necessary to ensure significant and proportional efforts are given to post-
primary education.
Measures already taken by the Government:
Reduction of social expenditures. The policy of quotas on scholarships adopted in 1994
allowed the Government to place a ceiling of 500 per year on the number of new higher
education scholarship recipients beginning in the 1994-1995 academic year, compared to 4,000
new recipients in 1992-1993. As a consequence, the total number of recipients decreased from
6,123 in 1991-1992 to 3,407 in 1995-1996. Additionally, the private management of the
restaurant at the Polytechnic University at Bobo-Dioulasso has started with the 1996-1997
academic year. With regard to secondary education, new scholarships decreased from 6,966 in
1990-1991 to 1,800 in 1995-1996. Thus, the total number of secondary education scholarship



ANNEX lB
Page 4 of 5
recipients decreased from 22,750 to 11, 345 during the same period. The Government has taken
the decision to progressively eliminate the secondary education scholarships by the year 2001.
Promotion of girls' education. To help girls in the pursuit of higher education, 600/o of the
rooms in the residence halls are reserved for girls beginning with the 1995-1996 academic year
and secondary school scholarships will be exclusively for girls beginning in 1996.
Returning Universities to academic excellence. The Office dii Baccalautriat and the Centre
National des Oeuvres Universitaires have been removed from the University and rejoined with
the central administration of the Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific
Research. This will allow the University to refocus its functions and efforts on achieving
academic excellence.
Measures envisaged for the period 1996-2002
In order to promote better use of the sector's resources, the Government envisages implementing
a sub-sectoral reform program:
Measure 1: More efficient use of teachers. Beginning with the 1996-1997 school year: (i) the
effective teaching will increase to 36 weeks or 180 days compared to the current 108 days; (ii)
two hours per week of supervised homework will be organized in each school. In 1997-1988 and
in 1998-1999, at least 200 under-utilized teachers will be redeployed to schools in the provinces,
at the rate of 100 per year.
Measure 2: Continuation of the reduction in social subsidies. The social subsidy reduction
policy will be continued by the: (i) limitation of higher education scholarships to 500 per year;
(ii) the progressive elimination of secondary school scholarships with their termination in the
year 2001; (iii) private management of the University restaurants; (iv) implementation of a
student health insurance system paid for by the students and through a Government contribution.
Measure 3: Strengthening of the cost-recovery policy. At the secondary level, school fees are
20,000 CFAF for the first registration, and 5,000 CFAF for subsequent registrations. Seventy-
five percent of these resources will be held by the schools for pedagogical inputs. At the
University, registration fees will be at least 15,000 CFAF per student beginning in May 1997.
The resources will be used in the following manner: 15% for examination fees; 15% for the
libraries; 25% for laboratories, and the remainder will be used to alleviate other constraints faced
by the University.
Measure 4: Promotion of girls education. To promote girls education: (i) 60% of the student
rooms in residence halls will be reserved for girls; (ii) and secondary school scholarships will be
exclusively for girls beginning in 1996, with priority placed on the 10 provinces with the lowest
enrollment levels.
Through these education policies, the Government will: (a) increase the access to secondary
education by increasing the primary/secondary education transition rate to 30% in 2001. This
effort will be accompanied by the development of non-public education which will represent
40% of the enrollment by the year 2001 due to the promotion of facilities managed by the private
sector, NGO, and municipalities. This growth in the private sector will: (a) allow public
resources to be better directed to disadvantaged areas; (b) improve the quality of lower
secondary education through a revision and consolidation of initial and in-service training of the
teachers, through the sufficient availability of materials to students, and by reforming the
education program; and (c) strengthening the sector's capacity at the regional and central levels

in areas such as planning, resource management, and project coordination. The framework of
the project defines the essential indicators.
The Government is convinced that the educational policy measures which would be supported by
the Post-primary Education Project will lead to an increase in the access to secondary education
and help to make the post-primary education system in Burkina Faso more efficient and equal,
and also more pertinent to the social and economic development of the country.

BURKINA FASO
POST-PRIMARY EDUCATION
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$19.5 million (total cost of component)
Support Increased Access to Lower Secondary Education. This component supports
the Government's objectives to: (a) increase total lower secondary enrollment to 42% by 2001;
(b) make educational opportunities more equitable between the two major cities and the rest of
the country; and (c) support the development of private schools. To reach the Government's
objective requires that the transition rate between primary and secondary education reaches 30%
by 2001. Given the macroeconomic constraints, the Government has agreed to introduce
measures that would encourage the increase of private 6eme intake by up to 15% p.a., which in
turn would reduce the pressure on public institutions and thus on the Government's recurrent
budget. The proposed credit would contribute to this program by financing construction and
equipment of 63 CEGs and 160 additional classrooms to provide for about 45,000 additional
students, of which 55% would be in the private schools. This component consists of the
following three sub-components.
(a)   Increasing enrollment outside Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso
Description. This sub-component provides for the development (construction, equipment,
staffing, etc.) of 50 CEGs of four classes each, financed by the Government and the
communities. The selection of localities and programming for the CEG development is based on
needs and demand. The ten provinces with the lowest coverage will benefit from 86% of the
program. The design of this component follows the approach developed by the MESSRS which
delegates more responsibility to local communities.  Communities will participate in the
development of their schools through all phases--planning, construction, and operation. Their
participation in construction will be through personal labor, provision of basic construction
materials, or contracting the work to local artisans and small entrepreneurs. Considering, on one
hand, the communities' uneven performance in construction --completion often takes too long
and quality is very poor-- and, on the other hand, the urgent need to increase access to Lower
Secondary Education, MESSRS proposes that: (a) the credit support the construction of
facilities necessary for the opening of the school (classroom block, administrative building,
director's house, latrines and a point of water) and (b) the communities, with assistance from the
Government (construction materials/technical assistance), be responsible for the construction of
teacher housing, the routine maintenance of the structures, and the construction of optional
structures (library, cafeteria etc.), if desired in the future. The minimum package of CEG
facilities is described in the Project Implementation Manual.
Implementation arrangements. The execution of the construction financed by the IDA Credit
will be delegated to Faso Baara. The DEP and DAF of the MESSRS will be responsible for
overall programming and monitoring of the construction activities and for the supervision and
management of the community supported construction.  More specifically, DEP will: (i)
prepare and update, as required, the construction program--locations, phasing, progress
monitoring system; (ii) establish a database with up-to-date information on needs, enrollment,
unit construction costs, space required; (iii) establish requirements and criteria for site selection;
(iv) prepare consolidated construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance budgets; and (v) provide
guidance and technical support to local communities including simplified plans and technical
specifications.



ANNEX 2

(b)    Increasing access in the three provinces with limited coverage
Description. This sub-component is specifically designed to (a) explore opportunities for less
costly secondary schools and (b) reduce disparities in choices for secondary schooling among
provinces.  To this effect the project will, under a management contract, provide for the
operation of CEGs by NGOs, church groups, and other not-for-profit organizations at no
recurrent cost to the Government beyond the initial investment cost for CEG infrastructure and
equipment. Because of the nature of the organizations which will manage the schools, it is
expected that the fees to be paid will be lower than those paid in conventional private schools.
The program envisages construction and equipment of three CEG with eight classrooms each by
the Government under the Credit management will be delegated on the basis of applications
solicited from eligible organizations willing and able to run a lower secondary school, including
meeting recurrent costs. The design of this sub-component is based on a technical-economic
feasibility study, on file, prepared with the participation of interested organizations.
Implementation arrangements. The DEP and the general directorate of Secondary Education of
the MESSRS will be responsible for overall supervision of this component including
implementation and monitoring of the conditions and modalities specified in the contracts
between MESSRS and the selected operator. Each year the operator and MESSRS will agree on
the maintenance and repair activities to be carried by the operator. Also each year, MESSRS
will assess the performance of schools and monitor the level of fees charged to students. A draft
protocol of agreement, relevant legal documents, and implementation details are included in the
Project Implementation Manual.
(c)    Increasing enrollment in private schools
Description. The demand for places in public secondary schools is far greater the supply,
especially in the Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso areas, where more parents can afford to pay
private school fees.  Considering the higher income capacity in these two cities, this sub-
component seeks to direct this demand into private secondary schools by supporting the
expansion of private schools through financial incentives.  The program  involves the
construction of: (a) 10 private. CEGs financed by the Government, to be operated and paid for on
easy terms by private sector operators or self-financed municipalities; and (b) 160 additional
classrooms at existing private schools, constructed under a "matching" scheme:  for each
classroom constructed and equipped at existing private schools by private financing and
according to Government standard plans, the Government will finance the construction of one
more classroom. It is expected that private schools will construct 80 additional classes and the
credit will construct 80 classrooms. Only those private schools that can demonstrate, with
concrete results, that they are seriously trying to provide a quality education will be supported by
the Government through the matching classrooms. The design of this sub-component is based on
a technical-economic feasibility study, on file, prepared with the participation of interested
private school operators.
Implementation arrangements. The Directorate of Private Education, in collaboration with the
DEP and DAF, will be responsible for the overall implementation of this component, including
evaluation of the performance of the schools and management of the contract. A draft protocol
of agreement, relevant legal documents, and implementation details are included in the Project
Implementation Manual.

Project Component 2 - US$13.8 million (total cost of component)
Support to Quality of Post-Primary Education. This component supports
implementation of reforms to be carried out under the SSRP to improve the quality and
efficiency of education. Revision of the programs for preservice and inservice training would
reinforce other aspects of the project by covering teaching methodology (including techniques
for managing large classes). The combined effort of the ongoing Education IV project and the
proposed project would achieve a target of one textbook per student in principal subject matters.
The management of the quality of education and curriculum reform would help improve
education programs. There are three sub-components: (a) reforming and improving preservice
and inservice training of teachers; (b) increasing the availability of textbooks; and (c) improving
existing education programs.
(a)    Reforming and improving preservice and inservice training of teachers
Description. Preservice training. This sub-component supports a revision of the training
programs content. Work to this end, designed to make the training more practical has already
been started by the Government. The one-year training program, totaling 30 weeks, will include
a one-week guided practice teaching session and a four-week session of unguided classroom
teaching. To allow students enrolled in preservice training programs to gain practical experience
and to develop synergy and interaction between preservice and inservice training, during their
field work, the ENSK students will share training sessions with experienced teachers who are
undergoing inservice training through teachers' study groups. In addition, the students will
receive direct support from school directors, and will be visited at least once by ENSK staff,
pedagogic advisers, or school inspectors. This new organization will allow for 120 hours of
pedagogic and education courses per trimester, and 60 hours of field supervision by ENSK staff
in close coordination with the school inspectors and pedagogic advisors.
Inservice training. Continuous pedagogic support and advice are necessary if the
quality of instruction in public and private CEG is to be improved. The current system of
subject-based inspectors, all posted in Ouagadougou, is not able to meet the needs of 3,500
teachers in more than 220 general secondary schools throughout the country (as well as in
approximately 60 technical secondary schools.). The strategy for upgrading the skills of teachers
in public and private schools would be to develop and implement a three-pronged approach: The
first level of support would be inside the school. The director, or proviseur would, as one of
his/her prime areas of responsibility, the supervise the teaching methods used by all members of
the staff and, from time to time, hold short half-day seminars to improve their quality. The
proviseurs/directors will need to receive an initial 20 days of training in their pedagogic
responsibilities, in addition to that provided by the French Cooperation--CF--to a smaller number
of schools. The training will draw on the experience of the CF and will use the manual already
developed, which clearly explains the respective roles in pedagogic supervision of the
proviseur/directors, the pedagogic advisors, and the school inspectors. The second level of
support will involve posting at the regions 20 additional Pedagogic Advisers (CP) and General
Inspectors, who will visit each school, and each teacher, at least two times a year. On the basis
of the reports from the CP, subject-based inservice training programs will be designed by the
inspectorate, and annual six-day, activity-based training given to each of the 3,500 public and
private teachers to improve their teaching methods and performance. The third level of support is
the teachers' study group established in networks of closely located schools (Cellule
d'Animation Pedagogique--CAP). The inservice training will take advantage of the half-day
midweek break to organize activities for teachers each week, alternating among different schools
belonging to one CAP.



ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 6
Implementation arrangements. The Directorate of Inspection and Training (DIFPE) will be
responsible for overall supervision and management of the preservice and inservice training
programs and will (i) organize the interaction between ENSK and school inspectorates; and (ii)
monitor the implementation of the new program. Within the regions, each Regional Director of
Education, in close coordination with the Inspectors and ENSK Director, will be responsible for
organizing and supervising the CAP, ensuring the synergy between preservice and inservice
training.
(b)    Increasing the availability of textbooks
Description. This sub-component will improve the textbook/student ratio from one book for
four students to one book per student in French, grammar, physics and chemistry, mathematics,
sciences, history and geography. The project will provide for (i) about one million lower
secondary textbooks; (ii) about 10,000 teacher's guides; and (iii) about 30,000 university library
books. Teacher's books will be issued free to staff in public schools. Private schools will be
offered the books at cost. To ensure continuous availability of textbooks, books will be rented for
an academic year for an amount of CFAF 500 per book. The rental scheme has already been
successfully tested under the ongoing Education IV Project. The resources collected from the
rental scheme, supplemented by an annual budgetary provision of CFAF 30 million, will
constitute the Textbook Fund (TF). This fund will be deposited in an interest-bearing bank
account and left to accrue over the life of the project. It is estimated that at the end of the project
the TF will be sufficient for replacing the initial stock and ensuring a ratio of one book per
student over a 5-year period.
Implementations arrangements. DAAF will be responsible for overall implementation of this
sub-component. Textbooks will be purchased off-the-shelf through ICB on the basis of technical
and pedagogic criteria and price. DAAF will be responsible for their distribution. DAAF will
also be responsible for implementing the procedures set up for the textbook rental scheme and
the Textbook Fund. Each school, through its book committee (composed of Parents' Association
and teachers), will be responsible for operating the rental scheme under the guidelines already
developed by MESSRS.
(c)    Improving existing education programs
Description. In addition to a number of important realignments proposed in the audit of
MESSRS, mentioned in the following component, two major changes are necessary if the
Ministry is to be able to carry out its mission more efficiently.
Evaluation and student assessment. The Office of the Baccalaureate, no longer part of
the university, and the Directorate of Examinations and Contests, are combined to form a new
Directorate of Examinations, Contests, and Pedagogic Studies (OCECS). OCECS will be the
one organization responsible for all examinations at the secondary level, enabling a uniform
system of printing and distributing exam questions, as well as common examination centers in
the provinces and regions to be used for all exams. The OCECS will also be responsible for
carrying out pedagogic studies on the results of the different exams to identify where the
Government should concentrate its resources and attention in the coming year to improve
quality. It should even be possible to provide particular analysis to individual schools. This
directorate will establish a pilot student assessment system.  Standardized tests in French,
mathematics, and social sciences will be administrated in grades two and four of a representative
sample of schools in four provinces. The results of this diagnostic testing--along with other
schools characteristics--would be used to (i) monitor performance changes over time among



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 6
these schools; (ii) identify problem areas in the curriculum; (iii) identify schools in the sample
that need special assistance; and (iv) evaluate the effectiveness of the longer academic year and
the supervised school-based homework. These evaluations would, in turn, be disseminated
through workshops and the media to teachers, teacher trainers, supervisors, administrators, and
parents.
Curriculum reform. Government's decision that each level of education should be
terminal (designed to meet the needs of those students who complete their education at the end
of a particular cycle as much as those who progress to the next cycle) will have significant
implications on the structure and content of the curriculum in secondary education. Before
implementation of this new policy, MESSRS will conduct two major studies. The first study
will concern a curriculum reform in general secondary education. The curriculum has changed
very little in more than 30 years and needs to be reevaluated and updated. It will be necessary to
first study the effectiveness of the existing curriculum in general secondary education to find
where there is the greatest need for change. This can best be done by mounting a special study to
analyze the examination results from the BEPC and to a lesser extent the BAC examinations.
Some accompanying changes in the new math curriculum being developed with the assistance of
the CF may also need to take place, orienting it toward measurement, cost estimation, and
accounting, and away from pure mathematics. The second stage is to identify various jobs in
which secondary school graduates are working and to carry out task analyses of their key
activities. The third stage is to analyze a number of curricula dealing with initiation to
technology from other countries with an active informal sector. Once curriculum changes have
been developed, tested, and implemented it will be easier for technical CEG to admit students
who have graduated from the 5eme, thus enabling throughputs in technical CEG to be expanded.
The second study aims at developing new and improved approaches to technical and
vocational training. There are a number of different approaches being used in Burkina Faso for
technical and vocational training. There are also a number of donors involved in the sector, each
with their own special interests and approaches. Before there is any large-scale expansion of this
sub-sector, the Government would like to mount a major study to find out which forms and types
of training have the biggest impact on employment, earnings, and productivity. This study will
be a significant undertaking and will take about two and one-half years to complete. It will
involve: (i) a sample labor force survey of formal and informal enterprises in a number of towns
throughout the country to find out the preferences of formal and informal employers; (ii)
household expenditure surveys of those trained in different programs; (iii) tracer studies of
graduates from the different programs, and (iv) cost and training analyses of the different
training programs.
Implementation arrangements. The DEP, in liaison with the DGES, will conduct the two studies.
The OCECS, with assistance from a cooperating overseas institution, will implement the testing
and evaluation system.
Project Component 3 - US$3.3 million (total cost of component)
Support to MESSRS. This component aims at improving the sectoral planning and
managerial capacities of MESSRS at the regional and central levels. It will build on efforts
begun under the ongoing Education IV Project and during preparation of the proposed project;
and on the recommendations contained in the report of the organizational audit of MESSRS
carried out by the Ministry of Public Administration in July 1995. It will upgrade MESSRS'
ability to efficiently manage scarce educational resources and meet the SSRP objectives by



ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 6
providing support for (i) educational planning; (ii) financial and personnel management; and (iii)
education projects coordination.
(a)    Educational planning. At the regional level the project will help develop an
improved monitoring system, including report forms, databases, and data collection sheets. The
Regional Directorates will be strengthened in data collection and analysis, in school mapping, in
a simple but applicable planning system that produces a clear operations plan, and in qualitative
as well as quantitative evaluation procedures. At the central level, the project will enhance
DEP's ability to plan and monitor the development of post-primary education in line with
Burkina Faso's educational development needs and resource constraints, especially in areas
related to the project's reform program. DEP will: (i) ensure the timely collection, analysis, and
publication of national educational statistics; (ii) maintain a countrywide school map; (iii)
develop guidelines for Regional Directorates; (iv) train the other directorates and the
decentralized units in basic statistics and sectoral policy analysis; (v) prepare and update on a
quarterly basis a "control panel" aimed at helping MESSRS to monitor critical development in
the sector to allow the early adoption of corrective measures; and (vi) conduct ad hoc surveys
and studies (e.g., promotion of private education, promotion of girls' education) to propose
viable options for addressing key sectoral issues and disseminating their findings within and
outside the MESSRS.
(b)    Financial and personnel management. The project will continue the support
provided under the ongoing Education IV project, which is assisting the MESSRS in (i)
reviewing its budgeting and administrative procedures; (ii) computerizing its records in the areas
of personnel management, budget preparation and control, scholarship allocation and
monitoring, and social subsidies reduction; and (iii) providing staff training.
(c)    Education projects coordination.  To enhance the institutional capacity
building of the project, the components will be executed by the institutions that would normally
conduct the concerned activities. As the project involves diverse institutions at the national and
regional levels--including NGOs, the private sector, and other donors--a senior staff member
within the Cabinet ministry will: (i) coordinate implementation of the various components; (ii)
provide professional advice and guidance to implementation services and agencies; (iii) ensure
that inputs provided by other donors contribute to the MESSRS' development objectives; and
(iv) monitor and evaluate project outcomes.
Implementation arrangements. Given its comparative advantage as coordinator of MESSRS
activities, the secretary general of the MESSRS will be responsible for overall supervision of this
component, which will be carried out by several central units. The DEP will be responsible for
implementing the educational planning activities. In addition to the management of the project
(accounting, contract administration, procurement processing and documentation), thle DAAF
will implement the activities related to the financial and personnel management of MESSRS.
The Coordinator of the project will serve as a liaison among the Government, IDA, and the other
donors.

Main results
The base estimate for the rate of return associated with the project is 17.3 percent indicating that
the project is feasible.
Project feasibility proved to be robust when tested against deteriorations in four crucial
parameters using Monte-Carlo simulations: (i) employment opportunities of secondary school
graduates; (ii) potential earnings of secondary school graduates; (iii) number of graduates
produced through expansion of coverage; (iv) gains in internal efficiency (lower dropout and
repetition rates) attributable to the project. Even when tested for simultaneous deteriorations in
the first three sets of parameters, the IRR still remained above 15%.

Main assumptions
Project benefits in the form of incremental income were measured by multiplying the number of
additional secondary school graduates produced by the project by the extra income they will earn
as a result of having completed secondary school. Calculation of incremental income was based
on earnings differences at entry of labor market rather than using an age-earnings profile.
Non-market benefits of secondary education and other externalities are excluded from the
analysis.
