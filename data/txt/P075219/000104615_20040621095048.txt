I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The development/global objective of the proposed project is to achieve more effective biodiversity
conservation in Central America (Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
Panama) by strengthening the capacity of indigenous communities to protect and manage their natural and
cultural resources, and by recuperating and promoting their cultural values and sustainable traditional land
use practices, thereby helping to (a) prevent further land degradation that threatens environmental services,
livelihoods, and economic well-being, and (b) conserve the region's high, though increasingly threatened
biodiversity resources.

The project will build on the positive cultural values and traditional practices that indigenous communities
have developed over centuries to manage natural resources, and will support and expand the initiatives of
indigenous communities that inhabit areas of high biodiversity in six priority ecoregions within the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), and whose livelihoods depend on the conservation and
sustainable use of the natural resources.

The project will (a) create a network of indigenous communities engaged in biodiversity conservation and
sustainable and culturally appropriate land uses, (b) build organizational and institutional capacity across
countries and groups, (c) promote exchanges between indigenous communities on traditional knowledge,
experiences, and lessons learned, (d) develop an enabling environment to reorient projects that deal with
sustainable rural development and conservation areas so that they include activities and approaches that
promote participatory land use planning in indigenous lands and regions, (e) consolidate culturally based
sustainable natural resource management practices and sustainable cultural land use across the region, (f)
support projects for sustainable production, promotion, and marketing of traditional products,
environmental services, and eco/ethnotourism, and (g) conduct participatory monitoring and evaluation of
progress in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.


I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project would be implemented in highly Biodiversity priority areas of the six eco-regions selected for
the project.   The project priority areas have been identified based on project preparation (Block B)
supported analyses study and consultation process. The priority eco-regions study delimited in the study,
include 558 communities and 607 organizations within the priority biological areas of the six priority

eco-zones, all with relatively equivalent Biodiversity values.        Participating communities have been
identified through a participatory social assessment which includes a regional consultation using criteria for
measuring interest and capacity for conservation (see annex 11) and over the life of the project
approximately 558 communities are expected to come forward to participate in the project activities.

Within the 558 communities universe, social assessment have been categorized a subset of communities by
their level of absorptive capacity and organizational commitment to conservation. A typology of four
categories ranging from the least organized for conservation (Category 1) to the most organized (Category
4) has been developed and activities tailored to these different levels of organization. Transparent criteria
for selecting proposals have been developed and would provide a basis for decision-making by the CMU
and the liaison organizations (LOs) located in the project area (see annex 12 Eligibility criteria for
subprojects).

The project will be implemented over a period of five years, and will finance the following components (see
detailed desciption in annex 2):

1. Cultural and institutional strengthening and capacity building
   a. Generation and strengthening of the organizational, technical and administrative capacities of the
        indigenous communities regarding the cultural values and the management of their natural resources

   b. Systematization of standards and criteria for traditional ecosystem management of indigenous
        communities, including a certification process for indigenous communities who engage in effective
        ecosystem management
   c. Strengthening of the negotiation and empowerment capacities of the indigenous community
        organizations for traditional ecosystem management

2. Promotion of sustainable cultural land use and traditional ecosystem management
   a. Development of sustainable cultural land use plans in the project intervention areas
   b. Strengthening of technical capacities for traditional management of the ecosystems in the
        community areas

        community projects

         Activities Type B:
   a. Defining and marketing consolidated, community-based eco/ethnotourism routes and projects
   b. Identifying, evaluating, and marketing community projects of traditional ecosystem management

4. Participatory Project Monitoring and Evaluation
   a. Capacity building on participatory monitoring and evaluation of both project global impacts and
        project implementation as well as human development
   b. Monitoring and evaluation of project global benefits
   c. Monitoring and evaluation of project activities
   d. Evaluation of project intervention model based on cultural values and traditional management
        practices that indigenous communities have developed over the centuries.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Central American region is a land bridge connecting North America and South America, composed of
seven relatively small countries which base their economies on agriculture and use of natural resources. As
discussed earlier, Central America has a broad natural richness and high biodiversity, a distinct,
heterogeneous character regarding terrain, climate and perhaps a higher propensity for natural disasters
than any other territory on the planet. Central America is also one of the world's richer regions in culture
and traditions. It is pluri-cultural and multi-lingual, with more than 50 distinct indigenous groups, making
up a total indigenous population of more than 6 million people. In Mesoamerica, a close relationship has
been demonstrated between indigenous territories and biologically and ecologically important areas of the
region, such as the centers of plant diversity and endemic species distinguished by the IUCN. There is a
clear correspondence in Central America between areas of remaining tropical forests and the presence of
indigenous communities (see table in Sector Issues).

From Guatemala to Panama, there are at least ten main ecological zones of importance for biodiversity
conservation. The most relevant to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor are the Atlantic Humid Forests,
the Humid Forests of Tehuantepec (Mexico, Guatemala and Belize), the various mountain forests from
Guatemala to Panama, and the coastal areas. It is necessary for the sustainable use of natural resources in
the region that these eco-regions form a physical continuum from North to South.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The B category recognizes the need to adress the social and indigenous issues of the indigenous
communities located in priority ecosystems areas. The project will demonstrate that actions to address
ecosystems community management can be linked to local community development. The environmental
impact of the management plans and community subprojects is limited and will be addressed through
Environmental Community Management Guidelines

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
There are no potential, significant or irreversible impacts associated with the project. Potential
negative impacts include: (i) overlaps between national protected areas with indigenous
territories; (ii) migration patterns from rural to urban cities; and (iii) land security and land tenure
conflicts.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
None

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
(i)      Possibility of greater overlaps between national protected areas boundaries with
indigenous territories ­ the project will use the existing mechanisms developed by the Land
Administration projects to measure this possible impact and with the existing environmental laws
of each country, clarification, and adjudication of land rights could be resolved by each
government.
(ii)     Migration patterns from rural to urban cities -- the project will coordinate with each state
agency responsible for the census of populations in rural areas, and with the righ numbers of
information regarding migration, the project will incorporate local communities into protected
areas management activities, finance institutional presence of regional organizations such as
ACICAFOC and CICA to negotiate with Government agencies the development of instruments
for regularization with appropriate restrictions to further expansion of areas of usufruct,
demarcate and delimit public lands, and monitor changes in forest cover
(iii)    Land security and land tenure conflicts --Possibility of greater conflicts and overlaps

between national protected areas boundaries with indigenous territories ­ the project will use the
existing mechanisms developed by the Land Administration projects to measure this possible
impact and with the existing environmental laws of each country, clarification of land rights, and
adjudication of land rights could be resolved by each government

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Borrower has produced an EA with an environmental management plan, and the project itself is considered
an IPDP. The project design has been developed in compliance with the applicable safeguards policies, so
no additional mechanisms will be necessary.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are indigenous communities located in the six priority areas proposed for project
implementation. All safeguard documents are public information and are posted on a website as
well as being available at the project office. During preparation a detailed social assessment and
consultation process was held with key stakeholders. Project governance mechanism includes a
Board of Directors (Wayib) with participation of key indigenous regional organizations and
Liaison Organizations with participation of local communities.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
