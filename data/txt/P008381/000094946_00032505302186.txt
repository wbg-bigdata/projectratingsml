3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project, as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), were to: (i) improve power
plant efficiency, (ii) reduce air pollution in northern Bohemia and thereby improve the environment and
health of the local population; (iii) modernize the transmission system; and (iv) facilitate interconnection of
the Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ) and German power grids. These objectives were to be accomplished
in the context of overall reform of the energy sector. To this end, the project would: (i) reduce total
consumption of pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency improvements; (ii) curtail power
plant S02 emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization; (iii) reduce dust and fly-ash pollution from
power plants; (iv) increase the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ transmission system; and (v)
assist in improving investment planning and corporate management of CEZ.
The objectives were clearly defined and consistent with the country's strategy for abating air pollution from
coal-fired power plants and for modernizing and adapting the Czech power system to the requirements -
mainly technical and environmental - of the Western European electricity grid (UCPTE), as a major step
towards the country's future accession to the Europen Union (EU). The project and its objectives were also
in line with the Bari's previous work in then Czechoslovakia: the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
of August 1990, the SAL (signed in 1990), the Energy Sector Review (Report No. 9768-CS) and the Joint
Environment Survey (Report No. 9623-CS). The Bank never prepared a CAS for the country, probably
because of the small number of projects. The project objectives were also realistic in scope, but somewhat
optimistic regarding the implementation schedule.
The borrower and beneficiary of the loan was CEZ, a former state-owned enterprise that was transformed
into a joint-stock company in 1992. CEZ at appraisal time was responsible for about 85% of power
generation in the country as well as for high voltage (HV) transmission. At that time, the company was
still under the stress of internal reorganization, following the transition from state-owned to corporate
status.
There were no unusual complexities involved with the project. There was a single implementing agency
and the range of policy and institutional improvements was moderate and compatible with CEZ's
competence. However, the size and timing of the project, and the fact that CEZ was a first-time Bank
borrower, posed a challenge to the company's management. The issues encountered were mainly: (i) the
company's lack of experience with ICB, particularly the two-stage bidding process used for the FGD
component, and its general lack of familiarity with the Bank's procurement rules; and (ii) the lack of clear
definition for the efficiency improvement components at the start of the project.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were maintained at all times; and there was no need to revise them.
3.3 Original Components:
The original components of the project as per SAR included: (i) installation of equipment and operational
improvements at Prunerov II power station and other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite
consumption; (ii) installation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment at Prunerov II; (iii) installation
of electrostatic precipitators at the worst polluting CEZ power plants; (iv) modernization of five 400 kV
substations and construction of a short 400 kV transmission line; and (v) consulting services and staff
training. The project locations are shown in Maps IBRD 30579 and 30580 (attached).
The components were reasonably well designed to achieve the objectives of the project and the borrower's
administrative and financial management capacity was taken into account. The country had no previous
experience with Bank-financed power projects.

3.4 Revised Components:
The original description of the components was not revised. However, the original allocation of the loan
funds by component (but not by category) was reviewed with the Bank in 1994 and 1995 and subsequently
modified in order to strenghten the scope of the efficiency improvement and pollution control components.
The reallocation of fumds was approved by the Bank, taking into account the considerable savings gained in
the procurement of the FGD component through intense ICB (see para. 5.4). In spite of the reallocation,
the final project cost remained below the original estimate. Hence, the remaining cost savings were
canceled.
The original and reallocated amounts by component are shown below (in US$ million):
Ori2inal       Reallocated
Efficiency Improvement                $ 33.7          $ 80.8
Pollution Control                      173.5             95.7
Transmission                            30.4             27.1
Training                                 8.4              6.2
Cancellation                                             36.2
Total Loan                            $246.0          $246.0
3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no Quality Assurance Group review conducted for this project. At appraisal, the technical and
economic preparation of the various project components was assessed to a satisfactory degree. However,
not all components were at the same level of readiness. For example, preparation of the efficiency
improvement component was deficient, and its scope had to be revised several times during project
implementation. On the other hand, the main component, the FGD equipment, was well prepared, and
bidding documents were mostly completed during project preparation, although during bid evaluation the
initial cost estimates proved too high. Therefore, the ICR rates the quality at entry as "satisfactory".
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's outcome was Satisfactory (S) for all objectives. The project achieved to a satisfactory
degree all its relevant physical and institutional development objectives, in particular, those related to the
Bank's current environmental goals. No macroeconomic or sector policy objectives were included in the
project, which were addressed by the earlier SAL operation instead. Achievement of the environmental
objectives. is discussed in more detail in Annex 8.
4.2 Outpu(ts by components:
Achievement of all components was Satisfactory (S). The design of the project was generally appropriate
for achieving the institutional and environmental objectives. There were no performance indicators
specified in the SAR, only equipment performance targets. Outputs by component are discussed below.
(a) Efficiency Improvement. Reliability and efficiency improvements at seven major power stations,
namely, Prunerov II, Detmarovice, Chvaletice, Pocerady, Tusimice, Ledvice and Melnik, were successfully
completed during 1994-1998. The improvement in power station reliability cannot be easily quantified,
but CEZ reports a decrease in forced generation outages.

The table below shows the decreasing trend in fuel consumption achieved through the boiler efficiency
improvement component. For similar boiler loads, the reduction in fuel consumption between 1993 and
1998 resulted in the saving of about 1.4 million tons of coal per year.
Year               Boiler Load              Fuel Consumption
(PJ/year)            (million tons of coal/year)
1993                  311                         31.1
1994                  293                         28.3
1995                  305                         30.6
1996                  312                         29.9
1997                  316                         30.6
1998                  307                         29.7
The reduction in fuel consumption obviously means less emission of pollutants. The improvement in
thermal efficiency allowed the plants to maintain their specific energy consumption at fairly stable levels in
spite of the additional energy consumption required by the FGD equipment (see table below):
Specific Energy Consumption (kJ/kWh)
1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998
Net   11,317 11,201 11,164 11,191 11,259 11,202
Gross  10,491 10,403 10,378 10,305 10,301 10,210
(b) Pollution Component. A major part of the project was the installation of FGD units at the 5 x 210
MW Prunerov II power station. The FGD units consistently met their guaranteed performance. The
decreasing trend of emissions is shown in the table below:
Year         Boiler Load      Dust Emission     S02 Emnission       NOx
(PJ/year)        (tons/year)       (tons/year)     (tons/year)
1993            47.7              3,646            146,569         22,849
1994            49.1              1,132            166,055         14,798
1995            39.2              813              131,790         10,404
1996            52.0              1,391            90,173          12,796
1997            47.6              1,443            11,010          11,505
1998            46.7              1,203            10,758          10,163
Other pollution control measures, such as the reconstruction of electrostatic precipitators for dust collection
were also completed successfully during 1993-1998 in power stations Prunerov II, Chvaletice and
Pocerady, CEZ's worst polluting power plants.
(c) Transmission. Under the project, CEZ upgraded ten 400-kV substations, namely, Cechy stred.,
Sokolnice, Bezdecin, Prestice Stage 1, Prestice Stage 2, Tabor, Vitkov, Malesice, Tilin and Chodov, and
built the 400-kV Chrast -Temelin transmission line. Completion of this part of the project enhanced
system reliability and contributed to the successful synchronous parallel operation of the CENTREL
interconnected system with UCPTE, the Western European grid, starting in October 1997. CENTREL is
-4 -



the association of electric utilities of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and the Slovak Republic.
(d) Training. Consulting and Training activities supported by the project provided effective assistance in
Least Cost Development Planning and Nuclear Plant Safety Assessment. In addition, they helped CEZ
design and install a state-of-the art Accounting and Financial Management Information System (AFMIS).
CEZ's thus enhanced corporate financial management tools enabled it to access the international bond
markets starting in 1994, ahead of any other electric utility in Eastern Europe.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The net economic rate of return was recalculated on a time slice of CEZ's total investment program
following the same approach as at appraisal (some small differences are listed in Annex 3). The benefits
were taken as incremental sales of electricity valued at the actual weighted average sales price (as a
measure of consumer willingness to pay), which is assumed to remain constant in real tenns at the 1999
level. Since demand for electricity is not projected to return to the 1992 level before 2007, incremental
sales were taken to be those sales that would be supplied from retrofitted plus new capacity uip to 2006 (the
same period as chosen at appraisal). The retrofitted capacity consists of all of CEZ's existing coal-fired
generating capacity, which would have been prohibited from being operated without first being altered to
meet the country's environmental standards. The costs were taken as CEZ's investment costs for
retrofitting the coal plants plus the completion of the Temelin nuclear power station plus transmission
investments during the implementation period of the project, and CEZ's fuel and other operation and
maintenance expenses. Indirect taxes were excluded. Shadow prices were not used since, as at the time of
appraisal, they were not considered to be significantly different from actual prices.
The recalculated rate of return was 6%, which is considerably below the appraisal estimate of 14%. The
main reason for the difference is that electricity prices have fallen by nearly 40% in real terms since 1992,
whereas they were assumed at the time of appraisal to remain at the end- 1991 level in real terms. If
electricity prices had remained constant, the recalculated rate of return would have been about 18%. There
were several other developments affecting the rate of retum, but they tended to offset each other. These
include: (i) a failure of demand to return to the 1992 level before 2007, whereas at the time of appraisal it
was assumed to grow by 36% over the same period; (ii) more generation eliminated by retirements and
replaced by retrofitting than forecast at appraisal, so that incremental sales are shown to be higher in the
new calculation; and (iii) the Temelin nuclear power station is not likely to begin operation until 2001,
compared with 1995-1996 in the appraisal base case.
While the 6% rate of return is below the estimated opportunity cost of capital in the Czech Republic (12%),
CEZ's investments were not necessarily uneconomic. The low estimated rate of return reflect the fact that
actual prices are likely well below consumers' willingness to pay for electricity. In addition, the rate of
return estimate takes no account of the substantial benefits from the environmental improvements
attributable to the retrofitting investments.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
There was no FRR calculation for this project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project enhanced CEZ capabilities in the following manner: (i) the installation of the AFMIS system
and related training provided CEZ with a state-of-the-art tool to improve financial management and
planning; and (ii) the interaction of CEZ staff with foreign specialists in Least-Cost Planning and Nuclear
Safety Assessment provided for transfer of advanced technical know-how. In October 1998, the UCPTE
General Conference accepted the CENTREL member companies as associate members. By satisfying the
- 5 -



operational conditions within the UCPTE interconnected network, CEZ took a major step in the process of
integrating the Czech Republic into the EU institutional structure.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The only factor outside the government and CEZ's control that affected achievement of the project outcome
and objectives/output was a lower than expected electricity consumption. This was mainly due to a slower
than expected recovery of the Czech industry during the 1990s, not due to rising prices. This factor
adversely affected the economic valuation of the project.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The development of a new regulatory system for energy utilities was reflected in a draft Federal Energy
Policy Paper presented to the Bank in connection with the Structural Adjustment Loan operation in 1991.
This policy paper also proposed that energy utilities, including CEZ, be restructured and partially
privatized after the first phase of ownership reform and privatization of large industrial companies, planned
for the first half of 1992. Surprisingly, however, CEZ was also included in the first phase and became a
joint-stock company (with private sector minority participation) between September 1991 and April 1992.
This acceleration of CEZ restructuring and privatization placed an additional burden on CEZ's
management and delayed project implementation by slowing down the decision-making process. Therefore,
this factor, which was subject to government control, partially affected the implementation of the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
At the start of the project, CEZ could not yet define the scope of the efficiency improvement component.
The number and size of the plants to be refurbished depended on the completion of plants under
construction whose schedule for commissioning was highly uncertain. This uncertainty contributed to the
two-year delay in project implementation. Therefore, this factor partially affected the achievement of the
project.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The initial cost estimate for this project was US$557.5 million, which included price and physical
contingencies but excluded interest during construction. The final cost of the project was US$397.6
million. The cost reduction was due to lower than expected price for the FGD equipment (US$165.3
million against the initial estimate of US$249.0 million), stiff competition under ICB procedures and
favorable conditions in the equipment market.
The original financing plan provided for Bank funds to cover US$246.0 million and the remaining
US$311.5 million equivalent to be contributed by CEZ. To decrease its exposure in certain currencies,
CEZ decided in 1998 to convert the initial loan into two sub-loans, namely, a US dollar-denominated loan
for the disbursed portion of the loan (US$169.0 million) and a DEM-denominated loan for the
non-disbursed portion (DEM135.0 million). In 1999, near the closing date of the loan, CEZ asked for
cancellations of about US$1.3 million and DEM76.5 million (totaling about US$36.2 million equivalent),
respectively. Therefore, the net utilization from these loans was only US$167.9 million and DEM59.1
million (totaling about US$209.8 million equivalent), respectively. Project cost estimates versus actual
cost and a comparison of initial and final financing arrangements are in Annex 2.
Project implementation and disbursement delays were significant, adding up to about two years. The
delays were caused by an unrealistic implementation schedule, which did not adequately take into account
the govemnment interference in CEZ's reorganization and partial privatization at the very start of project
-6-



implementation. This was compounded by incomplete project preparation for the efficiency improvement
component (para 3.4).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is likely. With the Czech Republic now firmly on the path towards EU membership,
the Government is committed to complying with major energy sector-related requirements. This includes
continued monitoring of pollution from power plants and their adequate operation and maintenance. In
1999, all of CEZ plants were generating environmentally clean energy based on the highter international
standard.
On the policy side, the Energy Act of 1994 will be amended by a new Energy Policy Act, to be submitted to
the Parliament shortly. This revised Energy Act would provide clear rules for the internal electricity
market, including third party access, and an adequate regulatory framework in line with EU Directive No.
96/92/EC.
CEZ's current organization is adequate to assure the long-term economic, financial, technical and
environmental viability of the project. The pollution control component had already considerable impact in
Northern Bohemia, where the local population is now enjoying improved environmental and living
conditions.
In spite of electricity prices being still under government control, the price level and adjustments over the
last years have created an adequate financial situation for CEZ, with a net profit of Kc1O.3 billion
(US$340 million) in 1997, 97% more than the previous year. Satisfactory financial performance under the
present regulatory framework is likely to continue. The financial sustainability of the project is further
supported by management's consistent usage of the AFMIS system, allowing for integrated financial
planning and record keeping.
Improvements in investment planning and system simulation achieved through the consulting and training
component of the project introduced state-of-the-art methods and procedures now regularly used by CEZ.
It is highly probable that extensive use of these improvements will continue.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
All project components are now fully operational. Appropriate technical provisions to ensure sustainable
project operation are in place. This includes adequate staffing and management in operation and
maintenance of all project components. Fuel supply to CEZ is based on long-term contracts. In 1999,
CEZ bought a 36% stake in the North Bohemian Mining Company. Financial, economic and
environmental policies required for continued operation and maintenance are also in place: the transfer
price that CEZ charges to the distribution companies is regulated by the government to ensure CEZ's
financial viability. In the near future, adequate electricity pricing will be ensured through the amended
Energy Act (probable submission to Parliament in 2000), which provides for an independent regulation.
As for continued implementation of environmental policies, CEZs business plan emphasizes strict
compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1991. As of January 1, 1999, all CEZ coal-fired plants met
applicable emission limits. No performance indicators were included in the SAR. However, the Loan
Agreement requires CEZ to continue submitting annual reports to the Bank on its progress in carrying out
further reductions of pollutants from all coal-fired power plants. No follow-up project, nor further
monitoring except for the above, are recommended.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank carried out project identification, preparation and appraisal in a comprehensive and satisfactory
manner. During the identification phase, the Bank agreed with the government's strategy for the power
sector, namely, the urgent need to decrease air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants. This was one
of the basic objectives of the project. During project preparation, the Bank provided adequate and timely
assistance to the Borrower. Of particular value were: (i) the recommendation for a diagnostic study to
strengthen CEZ's financial management capability; (ii) the recommendation to prepare a plan for
identifying, monitoring and abating pollution caused by CEZ's power plants; (iii) the recommendation to
prepare a long-term, least-cost investment program for the power sector; (iv) a procurement seminar in
Prague to familiarize the Borrower with the Bank's procurement standards and guidelines; and (v) the
selection of appropriate FGD technology based on economic and efficiency criteria.
During project appraisal, the Bank followed up on the issues identified during preparation and paid
adequate attention to technical, financial, economic, commercial, institutional and environmental aspects.
As for the Borrower's capacity in procurement and finance, the appraisal was realistic on the financial
management, but too optimistic on the procurement side, since it did not take adequetely into account the
Borrower's lack of experience in complex international bidding procedures. The project design was
adequate, but the actual FGD cost proved to be much lower than estimated (para 5.4). The project
appraisal identified two basic risks, namely: (i) deterioration of CEZ's financial condition; and (ii)
implementation delay due to CEZ being a first-time Bank borrower. The concern about implementation
delay was warranted, but the apprehension about company's finances proved to be unjustified. The
financial covenants of the loan were adequately designed.
As for the project implementation schedule, it proved to be too optimistic in some aspects. While the FGD
component was adequately timed, the same does not apply to the energy efficiency components where the
bidding process took longer than projected. The same Bank team was used for identification, preparation
and appraisal of the project, which resulted in consistent recommendations to the Borrower regarding the
execution of the physical and institutional components.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory. During the first years of implementation the
identification/appraisal team was maintained to ensure continuity of dialogue and follow-up of agreed
implementation issues. In 1996, with project implementation firmly established, a sfnaller team was put in
charge up to the closing date of June 30, 1999. Timing of supervision missions was generally adequate and
the duration of the missions was well planned. Project implementation progress was regularly reported
throughout the life of the project which was made possible by timely and regular Progress Reports provided
by the Borrower, in addition to regular supervision missions. The most important implementation issue
was procurement, which was identified in early 1993 and immediately addressed. After a series of
seminars and special meetings with Czech participants on Bank procurement rules and standard
procurement documents, the problem was solved, and project implementation progressed smoothly. The
performance ratings given in the PSRlForm 590 were realistic, and the supervision missions paid close
attention to the development objectives. The loan covenants were enforced continuously, and besides some
initial delays in report deliveries and minor deviations from covenanted financial targets, the Borrower was
in compliance throughout project implementation. The financial covenants of the Loan Agreement proved
to be instrumental for CEZ to obtain adequate bulk rate increases from the government whenever the
covenant compliance was at risk and the financial situation justified such increases. Project
- 8 -



implementation involved no deviations from Bank policies and procedures and only normal reallocation of
resources from one component to another took place. For example, the cost savings in the Prunerov FGD
component were reallocated to other power plant and transmission system improvements that met the
overall project objectives.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank planned and implemented this project carefully and with success as to the intended objectives.
Relations with the Borrower and the Guarantor were always good and productive. All problems were
addressed and jointly solved in a professional way. Therefore, the overall performance of the Bank in this
project is considered to have been satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
CEZ prepared the project efficiently. The company staff was active in assisting the Bank missions in the
overall design and providing relevant input on technical, financial, economic, environmental and
institutional aspects. Moreover, CEZ demonstrated full commitment to the project from its inception. As
one of the largest Czech companies, it was well prepared to handle a project of this size and complexity.
The company had the operating and managerial experience necessary to manage a large power system and
its expansion and modernization. Its performance is considered satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government, as the Guarantor, was fully committed to the project. The improvement of air quality in
the Northern Bohemia region - the infamous "Black Triangle" - was (and still is) a declared priority of the
Czech government, and the project was recognized as a decisive factor in the reduction of air pollution from
coal-fired power plants. During implementation, govemment interference in the project was minimal. As
Guarantor, the government was required to take all measures to enable CEZ to carry out the project and to
comply with the loan covenants. The main area where direct government action was required was in the
timely granting of increases in the transfer price of electricity from CEZ to the power distribution
companies. This was generally achieved, and therefore the government implementation performance is
deemed to be satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
During implementation from 1993 to 1999, CEZ allocated sufficient human resources to the project, with a
Project Manager in charge of each of the main components, procurement and technical aspects. Financial
and disbursement matters were centralized in CEZ's financial department in an efficienet way. This
department was also in charge of preparing the quarterly progress reports, which were of sufficient detail
and good quality to allow periodic evaluation of the project. They were sent to the Bank on time. CEZ
also complied with the timely preparation of the studies associated with the project: (i) the final report of
the "Least-Cost Investment Program 1993-2003" was prepared in 1993; (ii) the "Annual Investment
Program" was prepared and updated every year; (iii) the "Action Plan to Reduce Emissions in Northern
Bohemia" was prepared and updated periodically; and (iv) the diagnostic study to recommend measures to
strengthen the Company's financial management capability was prepared by external consultants and its
recommendations were implemented in 1993 and 1994.
The only area of initial client weakness was procurement, especially international competitive bidding. As
a result of inadequate procurement capacity, project implementation was delayed and an extension of the
closing date was granted from June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999. The financial management of the Company
(and of the project) improved through the AFMIS implementation under the loan. Financial statements and
audit reports from external and independent auditors were received on time. The technical management in
-9-



CEZ was adequate and consultants were employed effectively.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
The professional approach and commitment from the Borrower's side contributed greatly to the success of
the project. Taking the above considerations on CEZ into account and with the caveat on the initial
procurement weakness, the overall performance of the borrower should be rated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned from this project are:
*   Developing the project and setting its objectives within a macroeconomic and policy
framework based on a previous SAL operation and related sector studies was a positive factor
for its success.
*   Obtaining full commitment right from the start of preparation, from both the govermment and
the Borrower, proved to be instrumental in efficient project appraisal and implementation.
*   The setting of realistic objectives, in line with the country's strategy, sector priorities and being
consistent with the Borrower's managerial capacity was an important element in the
satisfactory project outcome.
_   The appraisal of the project should possibly have been postponed until:
(a) completion of the power sector's reorganization; and
(b) all project components had been fully defined.
*   The required strengthening of the Borrower's financial management proved to be valuable in
preparing the Borrower to access the international capital markets successfully and to obtain
additional resources for its investment program without the need for further government
guarantees.
*   Frequent and consistent supervision by the same Bank team, particularly of procurement,
contributed to the project success.

Notes:
1. The present value calculations use a discount rate of 12%.
2. Financial rates of return were not calculated at appraisal or for the ICR.
3. The present value calculations for the analysis done at appraisal are not be comparable with the latest
estimates for the following reasons:
-   The appraisal estimates included some costs and benefits for generating companies outside CEZ as
well as distribution companies, also outside CEZ, and heat-only boilers, also currently outside
CEZ. The latest estimates are for CEZ only. This approach is considered as sufficient for
re-estimating the EIRR of the investment program of which the project formed a part. Any
changes to the EIRR that would result from including the costs and benefits of power sector
activities outside CEZ would be unrelated to the project itself
*   The appraisal estimates of operating and maintenance costs included only the costs of operating
plants which met incremental demand aftr 1998 (when demand was estimated to return to the
1990 level) plus plants which replaced retired plants, and included a benefit consisting of cost
savings achieved in retrofitted capacity compared to retired capacity. The latest estimates omit the
cost savings benefit and include in operating and maintenance costs all such costs for retrofitted
and new generating capacity as well as for the transmission system. This approach serves to
capture all the costs associated with constructing and operating the power facilities needed to meet
the demand previously served by retired plant and plant that could not legally operate without
retrofitting to meet environmental standards.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results - Performance Assessment of Environment Objective
Air pollution from electricity generation causes severe health and environmental damage. The Czech power
sector relies heavily on coal-fired power plants, burning low quality, high sulfur lignite. It is the largest
source of pollution in the Czech Republic in regard to S02 and dust (fly-ash or particulate matter). The
extensive use of lignite over the 40 years before the start of the project resulted in major environmental
damage, especially in the region of Northern Bohemia, where large parts of the forests died and the health
of the population deteriorated, CEZ's plans for reducing air pollution included cleaning up the stack gases
from large point sources. Total emissions of S02 in Northern Bohemia reached about 960,000 tons in
1990, which amounted to more than 1,900 kg/person in the region, more than 10 times the amount for the
rest of the country. Lowering emissions of air pollutants in Northern Bohemia was a major objective of the
project. Specifically, the project was intended to reduce S02 emissions at power station Prunerov II by
190,000 tons/year through the use of FGD equipment, and dust emissions from 400-450 mg/Nm3 to
50-100 mg/Nm3 by means of installing electrostatic precipitators. The project achieved its environmental
objectives substantially, as shown in the table below:
Prunerov II Power Sector: Pollutant Emissions

1997                    47.6                    11,010                  1,443
1998                    46.7                   10,758                   1,203
The dust emission figure for 1998 (1,203 tons/year) is equivalent to a concentration of about 65 mg/Nm3 in the
stack gases.
In addition to financing the Prunerov II FGD system, the project was instrumental in getting CEZ started on one
of the largest environmental improvement programs in Europe during 1992-1998. The program was formulated
by the Czech authorities with strong support from international environmental specialists. A Joint
Environmental Survey carried out by the Bank, EU, USAID, and the Czech authorities, along with several other
feasibility studies, laid the ground work for the development of the National Environmental Plan, including the
CEZ pollution abatement and control program. Under the program, CEZ installed 28 flue gas desulfurization
units and seven fluidized bed combustion (FBC) boilers in 1992-1993. The program included also
reconstruction of electrostatic precipitators for dust control and upgrading of automatic controls in selected
power stations. A total of Kc 46 billion (US$1.5 billion) was invested under the program:
The environmental improvement program carried out by CEZ complies fully with the requirements of the Czech
Clean Air Act of 1991. It is aimed at cleaning up Northern Bohemia, a part of so-called Black Triangle in
Central Europe and one of the most polluted regions of the world. The program, in which the project played a
significant catalyst role in defining appropriate FGD technology, has been recognized as highly successful. The
following table shows the trend in reduction of emissions achieved through the program.

Implementation of the project had no significant unintended negative effects on the environment. On the
contrary, the project has brought about considerable improvement in the environment in Northem Bohemia. In
accordance with the Bank's Operational Directive 4.00, Annex 4, the project was rated B, taking the project's
positive impact on the environment into account.
CEZ' environmental strategy emphasizes the need for a responsible approach to the environment. An important
part of the company's strategy is to achieve compliance with CSN EN ISO 14001 Environmental Management
Quality Standards (Czech National Standards for Environment), which is identical to the international EN ISO
14001 standard. As part of its approved restructuring program, CEZ is implementing an environmental
management system (EMS). In 1998, the EMS was implemented at Prunerov power stations as a pilot project.
Another demonstration of CEZ commitment to its environmental strategy is the company's recognition of the
principles set forth in the Business Charter for Sustainable Development. The company's fundamental goal is to
achieve the following emission reductions by 2000 (in comparison with 1993 levels):
Solid pollutants (fly-ash) by approximately 90%
*     SSulfur dioxide by approximately 90%
Nitrogen oxide by approximately 55%
*     Carbon monoxide by approximately 45%
In accordance with provisions of the Loan Agreement, CEZ is committed to: (i) maintain policies and
procedures adequate to enable it to carry out the action plan to reduce S02 emissions agreed with the Bank in
December 1992; (ii) report to the Bank each year on the progress achieved in the carrying out of such action
plan; and (iii) revise the action plan as required with prior consultation with the Bank. CEZ has been diligent in
complying with this requirement and the Bank will continue to monitor CEZ's performance during the life of the
loan.
As part of the pollution monitoring system agreed with the Bank under the action plan, CEZ measures ambient
air quality in its own measuring stations located in the neighborhood of its power plants, in cooperation with the
Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. In addition, CEZ conducts studies of air pollution from its power plants
through computer modeling and simulations. All computations are based on the official methods, currently in
use for this purpose in the Czech Republic. These methods are consistent with comparable methods used in the
US and the EU.

A     PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPRION
The Project of reducing of the negative impacts of power electricity production on the
environment (Project ENERGY I) has been the first significant investment in the Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic and one of the largest ecological projects presented until that time.
The Project has been aimed at reduction the air pollution in the region of Northern Bohemia,
and thus at improving the environment and the health of the people in this region, at improving
the efficiency of power plants, and at facilitating the interconnection of our power system with
that of Western Europe.
The Project has been aimed at:
reduction of total consumption of pollution-causing lignite through power plant
efficiency improvements
* curtailment of power plant SO2 emissions by means of flue gas desufijrization
* reduction of dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants
- increase of the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ, a. s., transmission system
- assistance in improving investment planning and corporate management and organization
B     IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
From 1992 to 1998, the power company CEZ, a. s., realized what was apparently the largest
and quickest environmental program in Europe. Within the scope of this Program, a total
number of 28 flue gas desulphurization units and 7 fluidized-bed boilers were installed in its
power plants, fly-ash precipitators were reconstructed, and the power plant control systems
were modernized. Altogether, CZK 46 billion were invested in modernization and flue gas
desulphurization systems of the coal power plants.
The World Bank was supposed to advance a loan for a whole range of significant CEZ's
ecological projects. The preparation of all significant ecological projects from 1991 to 1993
was being performed in compliance with the World Bank's directives for the selective
tendering procedures. In this way, the projects of installation of the flue gas desulphurization
systems in Power Plants Prun6fov I and 1n, Tusimice II, and Ledvice, and the project of
installation of the first fluidized-bed boiler in Power Plant Ponci were being undertaken.
Finally, the fundamental part of the ENERGY I Project became the construction of the
combustion product desulphurization system in Power Plant Prunefov II. The next loan for the
ENERGY II Project was intended to finance the projects prepared for flue gas
desulphurization of the Power Plants Detmarovice and Chvaletice. The cooperation with the
World Bank on the loan for the ENERGY II Project was terminated after the World Bank's
conference in December 1993, when our government announced that it could no longer
continue to provide guarantees for additional World Bank's loans.
The preparation of projects financed within the scope of the ENERGY I Project was guided in
compliance with the World Bank's directives for the selective tendering procedures in the form
of either the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) or the Limited International Bidding
(LIB). For a limited range of projects, it was possible to use both the International Shopping



(IS) and the Direct Contracting (DC). The World Bank was continuously being consulted so
that the Tender Documents agreed with them. The ICB tendering procedures were being
announced in world trade-paper advertising. CEZ, a. s., very much appreciated that, in the
course of drawing on the loan, the World Bank agreed with the LIB organization during
implementation of the selected capital projects from the selected subcontractors, which
allowed a certain unification of the equipment purchased, as well as that during the ICB
procedure, it was possible to prefer the domestic manufacturers to the amount of 15 % of the
CIF price.
(a) installation of equipment and operational improvements at Prunerov II power station and
other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite consumption
Within the scope of the project of increasing the reliability and efficiency of CEZ's power
plants, the individual partial projects were realized as provided in the table below:

Between the years 1994 to 1999, 13 partial projects were implemented in Power Plant
Prunerov II, seven (7) in the area of the boiler, four (4) in the area of the turbine, one (1) in the
area of the Computer-Assisted Technological Process Management System, and one (1) in the
area of the generator. An additional 39 partial projects were irnplemented in other power
plants, eleven (I 1) in the area of the turbine, nine (9) in the area of the boiler, seven (7) in the
area of the electrical equipment, six (6) in the area of the generator, three (3) in the area of the
Computer-Assisted Technological Process Management System, and three (3) in other areas.
The distribution of partial projects among the individual power plants is evident from the above
table.
The projects were discussed with the World Bank and agreed upon during the negotiations in
Washington on April 5 to 8, 1994, and April 18 to 21, 1995, while other partial projects were
being agreed to as needed.
The implementation of partial projects took place from 1994 to 1999. The course of
irnplementation of the individual projects was proceeding in compliance with the conditions
determined in the individual contracts, and no negative comments concerning the activities of
the individual contractors were made.
(b) installation of flue gas desulfurization equipment (FGD) at Prun6fov II
The main part of Project ENERGY I was the installation of the FGD system in 5 x 210 MW
units of Power Plant Prun6fov II, which represented one of the major air pollution sources in
the region of Northern Bohemia. The FGD was necessitated by the need to conform to Act



No. 309/1991 Coil. under which the limits on solid airborne pollutants, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and carbon monoxide were set. The deadline for compliance with the new limits was set
at December 31, 1998. After that date, C,EZ a. s., was no longer allowed to operate any units
failing to meet the new emission limnits. Therefore, in keeping with the CEZ, a. s., mission to
produce electric power in an environmentally-friendly manner, the decision to improve the
environmental management at the power plant Prunerov II was taken.
The international selective tendering procedure for the building contractor was undertaken in
compliance with the World Bank's directives. The bidding procedure was held in two rounds.
The uniform definition of criteria set in advance resulted in maximum objectivity in the
selection of the contractors. All bidders in the tender were advised on the method of economic
evaluation and on the option to amend their bids to include additional details including the
guaranteed operating materials. The sufficient number of tender bidders, their merits and their
territorial origin allowed highly competitive conditions to be achieved and maintained, resulting
ultimately in the favorable price of 128 USD/kW of installed capacity which was less than the
expected price by USD 60.
In the presence of the World Bark's representative, the consortium of enterprises Mitsubishi
Corporation Japan, and ZVU Czech Republic, was selected out of the presented bids.
The consortium realized the construction of the flue gas desulphurization system operating on
the principle of the wet limestone wash-out by applying its own know-how in cooperation with
the other subcontractors. The milestones constituting the base of the construction progress
were adhered to with negligible deviations. The last unit was put into operation in advance,
which can be considered, in a capital construction projects of such a large extent, an
extraordinary success, especially when taking into account the fact that the capital costs were
not exceeded, and that the flue gas desulphurization units met their guaranteed values as
specified in the contract. For the whole range of parameters, considerably better values were
achieved than those specified in the performance job and/or required by the current applicable
legislation.
The construction project was financed with 45 % from the World Bank's credit, and 55% from
the resources of CEZ, a. s.
(c) improvements and equipment for dust collection, i. e., electrostatic precipitators at the
worst polluting CEZ power plants
From 1993 to 1998, the following partial projects in the area of environmental improvement
were implemented in the following power plants:
The reconstruction of electrostatic fly-ash precipitators in units B21 to B25 in the power plant
Prunerov II was performed from 1993 to 1998.
The reconstruction of electrostatic fly-ash precipitators in units B3, B4 and B2 in the power
plant Chvaletice was performed from 1996 to 1998.
The reconstruction of electrostatic fly-ash precipitators in unit B2 in the power plant Pocerady
was performed in 1995, and in unit B5 in 1998.



The implementation of the reconstruction of electrostatic fly-ash precipitators was being
undertaken in compliance with the dates stipulated in the individual contracts, and no negative
comments concerning the activities of the individual contractors were made.
(d) modernization of 400kV substations Prestice, Bezdecin, Sokolnice, Cechy stred, control
systems for substations Malesice, Milin, Vitkov, Chodov and construction of the 400kV
transmission line
From 1993 to 1998, the most important projects of capital construction of the transmission
system were implemented in Substations Cechy stred, Sokolnice, Bezd&in, Prestice Stage I,
Prestice Stage 2, Tabor, Vitkov, Malesice, Milin and Chodov. These involved the purchase and
installations of control and protection systems, transformers, surge arresters, circuit-breakers,
lightning arresters, disconnecting switches, insulators, bus-bars, digital protective devices,
cables, and failure recorders. These projects were financed out of the World Bank's credit to
the amount of 100 %.
In the course of drawing on the loan, the World Bank agreed with the use of the LIB
organizational structure during implementation of the selected capital projects by the selected
subcontractors, which allowed a certain unification of the purchased equipment.
The construction of the 400-kV transmission line - the inlet of line Chrast-Temelin in
Substation Prestice - was financed from credit amounting to 83.5 % while 16.5 % was covered
out of the resources of CEZ, a. s. This construction was added into Project ENERGY I
in May 1995.
(e) consulting services and staff training
Within the ENERGY I Project, the contract of consulting services for the AFMIS (Accounting
and Financial Management Information System) Project with Coopers & Lybrand was
financed, as was the contract for the safety audit of Nuclear Power Plant Temelin with
Halliburton NUS, which at the time of its elaboration represented the most extensive and
independent expert's report on the nuclear safety of the nuclear power plants with the
pressurized water reactors of the Russian design.
C   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
The preparation of transformation of the state enterprise Ceske energeticke zAvody (Czech
Power Company) to the joint-stock company (September 1991 to April 1992) was running in a
very excited and unstable external environment. The decision on placing (-EZ in the first wave
of the coupon privatization program initiated by the management of the state enterprise
represented, under the conditions of that time, an extraordinary significant strategic decision. It
created conditions for maintenance and further development of the power company CEZ, a. s.
The process of selection of the path of development of the production basis of the Czech
power engineering was being verified by various independent subjects, particularly by the
World Bank (as a basis for advancing the loan for Project ENERGY I) and the European
Union (Project A.3 of the PHARE Program "Power Sector Least Cost Development Study for
the Power Sector in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic"). Simultaneously, this Program
was being closely scrutinized by the relevant bodies of state administration as well as by the
public.



In cooperation with the World Bank, works on the development study concerning the power
sources and the transmission system of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic until the
year 2010 were initiated. The works were initiated and coordinated in compliance with the
terms of reference but by the middle of 1992 it was already apparent that the common solution
would not be successfully completed. Beginning in July 1992, the study started focusing
separately on the Czech Republic and on Slovakia. Under the uncertain conditions and
environment, we succeeded, thanks to utilization of results of the study, in delimitation of the
strategic path of development of CEZ, a. s., for a decisive portion of the 1990s.
The priority of restoration of the production basis became a radical reduction of negative
impacts of electricity generation on the environment. The preparatory works were initiated
in 1990, however, the Clean Air Act passed by the Parliament of the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic in 1991 represented a vast burden due to the rate of required changes, unprecedented
anywhere in the world power engineering sector. This included not only its labour intensity,
but also the demands imposed on the competency of employees, on the procurement of
financial sources, and on the implementation of the entire progranm In addition, the fact cannot
be ignored that a decrease in the economic activity and its related decrease in demand for
electricity during the first years following 1989 allowed the restoration of the production and
technical base under the time-limited conditions, and the parallel decommissioning of the most
obsolete lignite power plants.
D     PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
The mission of our company and the strategy of its implementation accepted by the general
meeting of shareholders are binding CEZ, a. s., to carefully and responsibly handle the
envirornment, its components and the natural resources. CEZ's careful handling with and
responsible approach to the environment are being supported by the attained results, especially
in air protection, by the open-door policy in supplying information, and by the step-by-step
integration of environmental protection into the company management system.
An important part of our Company's strategy is to achieve compliance with the CSN EN ISO
14001 environmental management quality standard, which is identical to the international
EN ISO 14001 standard. As part of the approved CEZ Restructuring Program, we are
implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS). In 1998, the EMS was
implemented at Prun6fov Power Stations as a pilot project. Another demonstration of CEZ's
commitment to its business strategy is the Company's recognition of the principles set forth in
the Business Charter for Sustainable Development.
Among the Company's fundamental environmental goals, it is proposed to achieve the
following emission reductions by the year 2000 (in comparison with 1993 levels):
* solid pollutants (fly ash) by approximately 90%
* sulfur dioxide by approximately 90%
* nitrogen oxides by approximately 55%
* carbon monoxide by approximately 45%
By December 31, 1998, CEZ had created conditions of compliance with the new emission
limits pursuant to the "Clean Air Act" in all of its coal-fired power stations. tEZ thus made
significant progress towards its emission reduction goals for the year 2000.



The completion of the flue gas desulphurization program of the coal power plants represents
the most significant fEZ success reached during its entire seven-year existence. All coal power
plants currently in operation already meet the demanding criteria of the Clean Air Act, and
their refurbishment has secured extension of their service life until about the year 2015.
These results will ensure that implementation of the projects financed out of the World Bank's
loan will bring a long-term benefit for the environment.
E   BANK PERFORMANCE
The World Bank has played a key role in the preparation of development of CEZ, a. s., and
of its environmental program. We take this opportunity to thank the World Bank for its
favorable attitude shown not only in advancing the loan but also in providing various
consultations, expert's reports and numerous verifications of analyses and documents
elaborated and supported by our company, as well as for the introduction of international
procedures at the beginning of the loan, which became extremely important in subsequent
years, and without which our environmental program would have been feasible only with
difficulties.
The World Bank's supervision missions have always been conducted effectively and have
contributed to a successful course for the individual projects. The support provided by the
World Bank in the course of planning the projects and their implementation has been of a high
standard. The exchange of standpoints to the individual problems has taken place effectively,
and all matters have been settled immediately without unnecessary delays.
F   BORROWER PERFORMANCE
As a result of the intensive international selective tendering procedure for the flue gas
desulphurization system of Power Plant Prun6fov II, the costs were cut by an amount equal to
approximately USD 46 million, and for this reason, (EZ, a. s., requested that USD 16 million
be used for installation of the flue gas desulphurization unit in Power Plant Ledvice II. The
World Bank was carefully following the preparation and elaboration of the tender documents
for the selective tendering procedure concerning Power Plant Ledvice II. Since the study
aimed at the environmental conditions did not prove an urgent need to invest in this area (the
values given in the study complied with those of EU), the World Bank did not allow financing
of the installation of the FGD unit in Power Plant Ledvice out of the World Bank's loan.
Owing to the time-consuming character of the tendering procedures in accordance with the
World Bank's directives and to a limited selection of partial projects that could be included in
the ENERGY I Project of reduction of the negative impacts of power engineering on the
environment, tEZ, a. s. applied for extension of the loan until June 30, 1999, and for the
approval of other projects for increasing the efficiency of power plants so that it would be
possible to at least partly finish drawing on the saving of costs attained during installation of
the FGD unit in Power Plant Prunerov Il.
Drawing on the World Bank's loan, provided in various currencies, was affecting the valuation
of the exposure to risk, and for this reason, fIEZ, a. s., with a view to secure itself against the
currency risk, made use of the World Bank's offer, and applied for the allocation of a loan and



for the conversion to the DEM LIBOR-based Single Currency Loan and the Single Currency
Pool Loan.
G     EVALUATION OF PROJECT RESULTS
* reduction of total consumption of pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency
improvements
In 1992 when the joint-stock company tEZ was formed, all power generation units were not
equipped with any high-quality and necessary environmentally-friendly technological
equipment. During the entire period from 1993 to 1998, the total (net) efficiency was
practically constant, and was being affected by an increased consumption of electric power by
the retrofitted flue gas cleaning equipment. This means that since 1994 when the new
equipment began to be gradually put into service, the efficienc"y of boilers and of turbo-
generators adequately increased.

Within the ENERGY I project, projects which provided a major contribution towards
improving the environment in the Czech Republic and which helped to enhance the efficiency
and dependability of the generating plant have been implemented since 1993 at seven power
plants of CEZ, a. s.
Thanks to repairs of boilers and turbines, replacement of parts of generators accessory systems
and exchange of control and management systems that were implemented, the net efficiency of
the power generating plants rose by 2 to 2.5%. The specific demand for fuel energy for power
supply at these plants has remained stable although the newly installed flue gas desulphurizing
equipment resulted in a 1.5 to 2.0% increase in the plant's electricity consumption.

- curtailment of power plant SO2 emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization
In accordance with the applicable acts of the Czech Republic (the Environmental Protection
Act and the Clean Air Act), C-EZ, a. s., is obliged to be aware of and monitor the impacts of
operation of its coal power plants on the atmosphere. CEZ, a. s., has been monitoring this
matter very carefully, especially by measuring emissions of air pollutants, by measuring
emissions in the neighborhood of power plants, and by monitoring each power plant's
contribution to air pollution.
CEZ, a. s., keeps measuring the emissions by applying the methods as stipulated in the
respective legal air-protection regulations of the Czech Republic. The results of measurements
confirm that, in compliance with the CEZ's and World Bank's intentions, emissions of air
pollutants (such as sulphur dioxide, solids, nitrogen oxides and carbon oxide) and
concentrations of these substances in combustion products have successfully been decreased.
This reduction is notable especially in Northern Bohemia.
CEZ, a. s., keeps monitoring the air pollution by measurements of emissions taken in its own
measuring stations situated in the neighborhood of its power plants, and in cooperation with
the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. The results of measurements of emissions of sulphur
dioxide taken in Northern Bohemia in 1991 and 1997 are depicted in Fig. I and 2, and can
demonstrate an improvement in the air conditions in Northern Bohemia between the years
1991 to 1997.
Since 1993, CfEZ, a. s., continues to monitor the contribution of coal power plants to air
pollution by applying model computations. An example of computation results is presented in
diagrams illustrating a comparison of computed emission concentrations of sulphur dioxide in



Northern Bohemia in 1991 and 1997 (Figs 3 and 4) and a comparison of the part CfEZ's coal
power plants contributed to this pollution in the same years (Figs 5 and 6). These diagrams can
also graphically document both the reduction of the emission burden of this region and the
reduction of contribution of CEZ's coal power plants to air pollution.
The computations are based on the official methods currently used for this purpose in the
Czech Republic. On the basis of recommendations of the World Bank's mission, the methods
have been proven to be applicable by their comparison with the SCREEN computation model
used for an analogue purpose in the USA and the EU's countries. The results of model
computations of emission concentrations correspond to the results obtained from
measurements of emissions.
* reduction of dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants
As compared to the year 1993, in 1998 the emission of solids (fly-ash) was reduced by 87 %.
Graph 3 demonstrates the reduction of emissions in the Czech Republic. One of the
fimdamental aims in the environmental protection is to attain reduction of fly-ash emissions by
90 % as compared to 1993 by the year 2000.

The repairs to equipment have been implemented mainly during shutdowns due to general
repairs of production units. Concurrently, the reconstruction of the electric ash precipitators
was also carried out at the different units. This type of reconstruction project has been
characterized by an increase of the precipitator efficiency from the former average of 99.60%
to the current 99.85%. For example, in a 200 MW unit, this increase means a reduction in the



concentration of solid pollutants by 160 metric tones per year at unit service utilization of 6000
hours per year.
* increase of the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ transmission system
The 1CEZ transmission system consists of all 400 kV and 220 kV equipment, i.e. equipment in
37 substations, 2,916 km of 400 kV line and 1,485 km of 220 kV line. Also part of the
transmission system are two 110 kV substations and 134 km of 110 kV line, whose purpose is
to transmit the output of CfEZ power stations to the 110 kV networks. The overall operation
of the transmission system can be described as balanced, reliable, and relatively calm, due to
favorable meteorological conditions, among other reasons. In comparison with 1997, the
number of failures during 1998 declined by 7.2%. There were a total of 130 breakdowns and
72 malfunctions during the year, of which 16 breakdowns caused equipment damage (5 of the
breakdowns damaged transformers).
The implementation of capital projects allowed CEZ, a. s., to meet the strategic goal of
creating the conditions for the synchronous cooperation of its transmission system with the
UCPTE Western-European system, including acceptance of the conceptual and operational
rules of this system, and further to stabilize the output power and frequency parameters of the
transmission system, to reduce the power failures in the transmission system, to allow the real-
time dispatching control, and last but not least to also represent the saving of labour.
On October 1, 1997, the annual operating test of the synchronous cooperation of the
association CENTREL (involving the electricity companies of the Czech Republic, Poland,
Hungary, and the Slovak Republic) was successfully finished. On the basis of affirmative
results of this test, the member electricity companies applied for corporate membership in the
UCPTE. On October 29, 1998, CEZ, a. s., was accepted as associated member of UCPTE.
The 0,EZ Central Control Center oversees the operation of the Czech power system within the
framework of the synchronous interconnection with the UCPTE (Union for the Coordination
of Production and Transmission of Energy) interconnected electricity network. Throughout the
year, quality parameters of electricity supplied through the transmission system were
maintained within prescribed limits and no failure or malfunction occurred that could affect the
reliability and availability of electricity. The CEZ Central Control Center successfully continued
the pilot projects of remote-controlled operation of the Tdbor, Chodov and Malesice
substations. Concurrently, work continued on implementing remote control systems for other
transmission system substations.
* assistance in improving investment planning and corporate management and organization
The safety audit of Nuclear Power Plant Temelin documented that nuclear power plants of the
Russian design, Type VVER 1000, can meet the requirements for securing nuclear safety, and
confirmed the expediency of changes in design planned beforehand, which should allow the
attainment of results comparable to the existing requirements of the European and American
nuclear power plants. The results of the audit were part of the documents of the CEZ proposal
to continue the construction of the Nuclear Power Plant Temelin and subsequently in 1992 and
1993 for the government's decision to continue in the above activity. The report in its
simplified form was presented to both the Czech public and the Austrian government.



The CODA-OAS 2.308 Accounting and Financial Management Information System was
implemented in all power plants as well as at the general management of our company, under
the supervision of the consulting agency Coopers & Lybrand. Putting the Accounting and
Financial Management Information System into service during the course of the year 1996
allowed the balance of accounts for the whole company to be worked out by December 31,
1996 using.the new accounting system. No reservations concerning the system's suitability
were made in the auditor's award.
H     CONCLUSSIONS/LESSONS
When drawing up the report presented to the World Bank's managers for approval of the loan,
most of the (EZ, a. s., sections were cooperating and obtained experience with the
presentation of the company and of its activities, and this experience proved to be very useful
during the subsequent negotiations with the rating agencies. The Staff Appraisal Report was a
document which included brief characteristics of the Czech Republic and presented the results
of a survey of the electricity supply sector in the Czech Republic, including its control system
and existing structure. The document also descnbed the power company CEZ, a. s., from the
point of view of production, including its environmental impacts, the future development of
supply and demand and their future trends, as well as the price policy, the investment program
and a detailed description of the project which is intended to be financed by the World Bank,
including its risk rating.
Three months after establishment of the joint-stock company CEZ, the World Bank, as the first
foreign subject, provided a loan for the ENERGY I Project. Taking this action, the World
Bank deserves full credit for the financial feasibility of the development program, for
achievement of our credibility for the other creditors, and for the creation of conditions for
financing the decisive part of the development program without any guarantees of government,
i.e. on its own account.
This emitted a signal from a financial institute with a high international authority, confirming
that CEZ, a. s., is a credible company capable of long-term maintenance of its financial health
and of meeting its accepted engagements, and that its development program corresponds to the
demands of the Czech Republic's economy. Such a signal significantly supported CEZ's effort
to subsequently provide a considerable portion of financial means on its own behalf, without
any guarantees from the government.
However, the entry into the international market of bonds was conditional on obtaining an
investment rating from the rating agencies accepted by the financial circuits. The power
company (EZ, a. s., obtained the first rating, namely BBB-, from Standard & Poors in May
1994. It was this investment rating that allowed the afore-mentioned emission of eurobonds in
1994 and the entry of CEZ, a. s., as the first company from the former Eastern block, into this
financial market.
The cooperation with the World Bank proved to be a significant benefit not only from the
point of view of financing some capital projects. The benefit also consisted in the acquisition of
know-how during the international selective tendering procedure (the preparation of the tender
documents, the declaration of the international selective tendering procedure in the form of the
world trade-paper advertising, the procedure of answering the inquiries concerning
uncertainties, the annexes to the tender documents, the procedure of opening the bids, the



memorandum of the procedure of opening the bids, the report on evaluation of the bids, and
the selection of the general contractor).
The advantage of international selective tendering procedures consisted in the fact that the
bidders were aware of the competitive enviromnent which was finally leading to optimization
of the prices of the individual bids and to the selection of a suitable contractor who was able to
offer the lowest price under comparable technical and commercial conditions.
For development of the prospective planning, the role of the World Bank was important in two
levels. Through its requirement for elaboration of the least-cost study, the World Bank
connected (2EZ, a. s., with the Belgian firm Tractebel. At that time, CEZ, a. s., already
possessed some developed partial planning procedures, and for this reason it was able to
prepare the necessary documents relatively quickly as well as to acquire the respective
procedures and connections. Of significant importance was the fact that CEZ, a. s., was given
a unique opportunity "to have a look into the laboratory" of the Tractebel team, and thus to
utilize its support when preparing CEZ's applications of its own business prospectus. Already,
in 1993, CEZ, a. s., prepared a prospectus of its own up to the year 2000, adjusting the initial
assumptions of (CEZ's future development in the areas of financing, profit formation, and the
development of economic indices.
The other level of importance of the World Bank role in tEZ's prospective planning consisted
in the provision of the credit contract, requiring (EZ to regularly inform the Bank (and the
guarantor) not only about the companys existing results but also about the assumptions of the
economic development in the near future.
