1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Iftan to the
*        Czech Power Enterprise (CEZ) for a total amount of US$246.0 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 15 years maturity, including five years of grace. It will finance power
plant efficiency improvements, pollution control, dust collection and
transmission components. The project is largely environmental in nature.
Indeed, it would be one of the largest eyvironmental projects in Bank history.
2.   Backg roun.  The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) is classified
as an upper middle-income country with an estimated per capita income of
US$3,4601 in 1989 and a population of 15.6 million. GDP, which grew at an
annual rate of 1.5X in the 1980s. is estimated to have declined by about 151
in 1991 and is expected to decline about 51 in 1992, but to recover
thereafter. CSFR has undertaken a far-reaching economic reform program to
move from a rigid centrally planned economy to a market economy. Within a
stabilization-oriented macro-economic framework, the transformation program
includes trade and exchange reform, large increases in energy prices,
liberalization of most non-energy prices, restrictive monetary and fiscal
policies and initiation of a program for rapid privatization of large and
small enterprises. The program was launched on a broad scale at the beginning
of January 1991. It is supported by an IMF standby agreement and a World Bank
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) for US$450 million.
3.   The energy sector plays, and will continue to play, an important role in
the CSFR economy because of: heavy dependence on domestically produced hard
coal and lignite in the industrial, power, and residential sector; severe air
pollution problems from use of high sulfur content hard coal and lignite;
widespread inefficiency in onergy consumption related to past misguided
industrialization policies and previously subsidized energy prices; and a
unique position as the principal transit country between former USSR and
Western Europe for natural gas pipelines (owned by TRANSGAS), but almost
complete dependence on oil and gas imported from the former USSR.
4.    The CSFR energy sector has been shaped over the years by the centrally
planned program which did not reflect sound economic decisions. The
industrial sector is dominated by heavy industry which, in most cases, uses
very energy inefficient technology. A major reason for this inefficiency is
the fact that energy prices in the past were so heavily subsidized that thare
/ owwr, pnt pe apta ieme at prevaLiU* anhange rate" is Oaideably below this 2m3.



-2-
was no incentive to economize. As a result, the ratio of energy conaumption
to GDP is more than twice the energy intensity in OECD countries.
5.    The Federal Government, which sets energy prices, has moved boldly to
increase energy prices and eliminate financial subsidies in vle energy sector.
Energy price increases (included in SAL and IMF conditionality) between May
1990 and October 1, 1991 have been vecy large, ranging from 70X (for
residential electricity) to 320X (fot residential district heat) and have
amounted to *creased costs to consumers of about 50 billion Kcs, or about 31
of 1991 GDP. This has resulted in most industrial energy prices being at or
above economic cost although most residential energy prices still are about
half of economic cost.
6.    Overall demand for energy is expected to decline as consumers conserve
energy in response to the recent sharp increase in energy prices, and also in
response to shifting industrial structure, interfuel substitution, and ways to
use fuels in a cleaner and more efficient manner. According to Bank and
federal government demand projections, energy consumption is projected to
decline until the middle of the decade and then begin to climb but, overall,
energy demand Is expected to be less in 2000 than in 1990. The largest drop
in demand is expected to be in coal consumption while electricity and gas
demand are expected to be back near 1990 levels in 2000.
7.    In addition to the recent sharp increases in energy prices, the
government of CSFR has taken a number of bold steps to reform the ecornomy and
the energy sector. The role of the government and the institutional structure
is in the process of being changed from that of exercising absolute control of
the economy to one of oversight through a new regulatory system for energy
utilities. Present plans are that energy utilities be restructured and
partially privatized, with the federal and republic governments retaining
majority ownership, following the first phase of ownership reform and
privatization of large industries planned for the first half of 1992.
8.    Air pollution from electricity production causes severe health and
environmental damage. The power sector relies heavily on coal-fired power
plants burning low-quality high-sulfur lignite, and represents the largest
polluter in CSFR in regard to sulfur dioxide (SO,) and dust (fly-ash or
particulate matter). The extensive use of lignite during the last 40 years
has resulted in a large environmental damage, which is especially pronounced
in the northern Bohemia region, where large parts of the forests have died and
the health of the population is declining. Plans for reducing air pollution
are based on cleaning up stack gases from large point sources, improving plant
efficiency, and substituting less polluting fuels, such as natural gas where
justified. CEZ is now operating with new incentives, which are to meet both
financial objectives and emission standards. The project will allow CEZ to
keep generating expenses low (and to defer investments in new generating
capacity) by retrofitting existing plants to enable them to continue using low
cost lignite fuel to generate power in an environmentally safe manner.

9.    The Bank has had, and continues to have, an active rol- in assisting in
the reform of the energy sector. This began with productive dialogu.e during
the discussion of the Country Economic Xemorandum in August 1990, followed by
draft energy issues papers and policy conditionality under the SAL (on
pricing, regulatory framework, least-cost investment planning and medium term
environmental action plan). Energy sector issues have been evaluated in
detail in the Bank's Energy Sector Review (Report No. 9768-CS, a draft of
which was discussed with the Government in October 1991 and used as an input
into Federal and Republic Energy policy papers). Environmental issues have
been evaluated in the Joint Environmental Study (Report No. 9623-CS). Energy
projects for the Slovak power enterprise (SEP) and gas enterprise (SPP) are
currently being prepared, which include components for power transmission,
power station retrofitting, as well as gas transmission, storage and
distribution.
10.   Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involveent.  The Bank's overall
objectives in Czechoslovakia are to support the transformation to a market
economy, increase efficiency, and improve the environment. The SAL supports
these objectives, as does this first Bank investment project. The Bank's
objectives in the energy and environment sectors are to introduce principles
of efficiency and economy; to reduce pollution and improve public health; to
rationalize the investment program under conditions of decreasing or flat
demand; tc introduce financial profitability, accounability, financial
autonomy and responsibility; to raise the level of capability at the
management and technical levels by introducing modern methodologies and
technologies; to support government privatization plans; and to diversify and
increase reliability of energy supplies. This project supports these
objectives, and in particular, the immediate need to rehabilitate and
modernize power plants by using technologies that increase efficiency and
improve the very poor environmental situation in northern Bohemia. Also, the
transmission component of the project facilitates exchanges of electricity
with neighboring countries, thereby satisfying Bank objectives by bringing
higher reliability and lower cost to the interconnected system of Central
Europe.
11.   Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to improve power
plant efficiency; to reduce air pollution in northern Bohemia, and thereby
improve the environment and health of the local population; to modernize the
transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection of the CEZ and German
power grids.  These objectives will be accomplished in the context of overall
reform of the energy sector.  To this end, the project will:  (a) reduce total
consumption of pollution causing lignite through power plant efficiency
improvements; (b) curtail power plant SO2 emissions by means of flue gas
desulfurization; (c) reduce dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants;
(d) increase the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ transmission
system; and (e) assist in improving investment planning and corporate
-anagement and organization.

12.   Protect flessoition.  The proposed pr,ject includes:  (a) installation
of equipment and operational improvements at the Prunerov II power station and
other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite consumption; (b) installation
of flue gas desulfurization equipment (FGD) at Prunerov II; (c) improvements
and equipment for dust collection, i.e., electrostatic precipitators at the
worst polluting CEZ power plants; (d) modernization of five 400-kV substations
and construction of a short 400-kV transmission line; and (e) consulting
aervices and staff training. The components of the project are described in
more det.sl below.
13.   The consumption of lignite and the associated emission of SO2 will be
reduced by means of small changes in operating practices and installation of
measuring devices, which will increase the plants' thermal efficiency, as
recommended by a recent study on Necessary Measures for Future Mitigation of
SO2 Emissions" from the power plants in CSFR. CEZ has already started a
program for this purpose and plans to extend it under the proposed project to
several plants.
14.  The project will finance FGDs (with high SO2 removal efficiency) to
retrofit 1,050 MW (five units each of 210 MW) at the Prunerov II power plant.
Prunerov II is the largest single source of S02 emission in CSFR which
utilizes low-cost, but high-sulfur, lignite mined close to the plant. The
electricity generation from this plant will be required under all foreseeable
electricity demand scenarios. Retrofitting Prunerov II with FGDs is the
least-cost way to decrease 502 emissions. Also, it is the lowest cost per ton
of SO0 removed (lower than all other plants in the FGD program) and is
therefore the highest priority (according to a recent study, described above
in para. 13).
15. This project will finance transmission improvements linked to an
important new interconnection with Western Europe (Bavaria, Germany). Along
with the existing interconnection through Austria, it will facilitate further
power exchanges, lower the cost of ser:ice, increase reliability of supply,
and help establish a unified and competitive European market for electricity.
16.   The technical and economic preparation of the various components of the
project have been advanced to a satisfactory degree, although not all
components are at the same level of preparation. No delays are anticipated
stemming from the lack of adequate project preparation. The FGD components
have been prepared and the bidding documents have largely been completed.
Bidding documents are scheduled for distribution to interested bidders
starting in the second quarter of 1992. The power plants and CHP plants to be
retrofitted with ESP have been identified, and CEZ has started the preparation
of Bidding Documents for procurement of the necessary equipment under ICB.
The transmission and substation component has been prepared in detail by local
consultants.



17.   Total project cost is estimated at US$557.5 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$246 million (44). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disburseme%nt schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Czechoslovakia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10071-CS is also attached.
18.  Ahnti2n  AgAree.  During negotiations the following agreements were
reached
(i)  with the Federal Government to take all measures kithin its power
to enable CEZ to carry out the project and to comply with its
obligations under the Loan Agreement; and
(ii)  with CEZ that it:  (a) will prepare and furnish to the Bank by
October 15, 1992, a draft 10 year least cost investment program
satisfactory to the Bank and will exchange views with the Bank on
the program; (b) will prepare a satisfactory action plan,
including an appropriate monitoring system, by December 31, 1992,
to deal with the remaining peak pollution problem. CEZ and the
Bank will annually review the results of the monitoring system,
and CEZ will implement the agreed recommendations; (c) will, on
the basis of a diagnostic study, recommend measures to strengthen
the Company's financial management action plan to implement
relevant measures and present this plan by March 31, 1993 for Bank
review and coments; (d) will establish by January 1, 1993, an
Internal Audit Scction with organization resources and terms of
reference all acceptable to the Bank; (e) will furnish to the Bank
by November 1 each year the proposed terms and conditions to
achieve optimal utilization of CEZs facilities for supplying
electricity to distribution companies and large consumers, give
the Bank an opportunity to exchange views on these terms and
conditions and take the necessary measures within its power to
conclude supply contracts which take into account the Bank's
comments; (f) will revalue CEZ's fixed assets by June 30, 1994;
(g) will maintain annual ratios of cash operating costs to
operating revenues not more than 0.6 after 1992; internally
generate annual cash surpluses of not less than 401 of the capital
expenditures after 1992; debt service coverage not lower than 5.0
in 1992 through 1994, 3.5 in 1995 and 2.2 in 1996 and thereafter;
(h) will forward to the Bank, not later than five months after the
end of each financial year, annual financial statements audited by
independent auditors; and (i) will forward to the Bank for review
by March 31 each year a five year investment program along with
the financial plan.

19.   Bnefits. The overall result of the project will be reduced consumption
of lignite fuel in electricity generation, a large reduction of S02, a
substantial reduction of dust and fly-ash, and lower cost, more reliable power
exchanges. The total reduction in SO2 from the proposed installations (FGDs
and efficiency improvements) will be about 218,000 - 235,000 tons/year. This
reduction will not only help to restcre the damaged environment in the
northern Bohemia region, but also reduce the total amount of S02 in
Czechoslovakia to an amount that will, in combination with other measures,
facilitate adherence to the Helsinki-Protocol and pollution reduction
commitments.
20. Savings from plant efficiency investments are lignite fuel savings of
US$20 to 40 million/year, from a reduction in lignite use of 1.2 to 1.9
million tons/year, and associated reduction of 28,000 to 45,000 tons of
S02/year.
21.   The net reduction of SO2 emissions at Prunerov II is estimated at around
190,000 tons/yr (out of the total 218,000 to 235,000 tons/year of S02 reduced
m3uder the project). Based on the total SO2 emission in CSPR recorded in V089
(2.65 million tons), the installation of FGDs covered by this project
component will reduce emissions in CSFR by about 7X, and in relation to the
Czech Republic by about 10. In northern Bohemia. the most polluted region in
CSFR, the proposed FGDs will reduce SO2 emissions by about 20X.
22.   The project also includes plant retrofitting with new electrostatic
precipitators (ESP) for effective dust control to lmprove the environment and
health of the population. Where the ESP are rehabilitated or renewed, the
emLssion will be reduced by 751 to 90X. The transmission component will
result in a lower cost and more reliable electricity supply, and will
facilitate power exchanges with neighboring countries.
23.   Environmental Asnects.  The overall environmental impact of the project
is very strongly positive with reduction in SO2 as well as other air
pollutants and dust. The installation of the FGDs will at the same time
increase the total amount of gypsum waste, which is not a hazardous material,
by about 30X. Gypsum and waste water from the FODs will be safely disposed of
and are not expected to cause environmental problems. In accordance with
Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A, Environmental Assessment, this project
has been ranked at the level B.
24.  Nisks. The main risks associated with the project are:
(a) deterioration of CEZ' financial condition as a result of adverse macro-
economic developments caused by delays such as major changes in the internal
reform process; and (b) implementation delays due to CEZ being a first-time
borrower. It is reasonable to expect that the government authorities will
continue on their present course of political and economic transformation. So
far, the stabilization program has been successful with low inflation rates
and sound budgetary policy, but certain federal and republic responsibilities
are still being worked out. Since the project is entirely within one republic
and given the technical configuration of the electric power system and joint



-7
dispatching operations, there are likely to be minimal effects on the project
due to changes in inter-republic relationships. Also, CEZ' financial
performance is believed t-o be adequately safeguarded through the proposed
covenants. The proposed close supervision of the procurement proceas is
likely to ensure smooth project implementation. Therefore, the above riska
are considered to be manageable.
25.   Recovanedation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
