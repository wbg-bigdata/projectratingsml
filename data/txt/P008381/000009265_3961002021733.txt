STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Proi2et Stumma-
BORROWER:                Czech Power Enterprise - Ceske Energeticke Zavody
(CEZ)
AMOUNT:                  US$246 million equivalent
TERMS:                   Fifteen years, including five years of grace.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:      The objectives of the project are to improve power
plant efficiency; to reduce air pollution in northern
Bohemia, and thereby improve the environment and
health of the local population; to modernize the
transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection
of the (EZ and German power grido. These objectives
will be accomplished in the context of overall reform
of the energy sector. To this end, the project will:
(a) reduce total consumption of pollution-causing
lignite through power plant efficiency improvements;
(b) curtail power plant SO2 emissions by means of flue
gas desulfurization; (c) reduce dust and fly-ash
pollution from power plants; (d) increase the
reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ
transmission system; and (e) assist in improving
investment planning and corporate management and
organization.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:    The proposed project includes:  (a) installation of
equipment and operational improvements at the Prunerov
II power station and other large CEZ power plants to
reduce lignite consumption; (b) installation of flue
gas desulfurization ecqipment (FGD) at Prunerov II;
(c) improvements and equipment for dust collection,
i.e., electrostatic precipitators at the worst
polluting CEZ power plants; (d) modernization of five
400-kV substations and construction of a short 400-kV
transmission line; and (e) ccn,ulting services and
staff training.



ii -
BENEFITS:                The overall result of the project will be a reduced
lignite fuel cost in electricity generation, a large
reduction of SO2, a substantial reduction of dust and
fly-ash, and lower cost, more reliable power
exchanges. The total reduct'.on in SO2 from the
proposed installations (FGDs and efficiency
improvements) will be about 218,000 - 235,000
tons/year. This reduction will not only help to
restore the damaged environment in the northern
Bohemia region, but also reduce the total amount of
S02 in Czechoslovakia to an amount that will, in
corbination with other measures, facilitate adherence
to the Helsinki-Protocol and pollution reduction
commitments.
Savings Zrom plant efficiency investments are lignite
fuel savings of US$20 to 40 million/year from a
reduction in lignite use of 1.2 to 1.9 million
tons/year, and associated reduction of 28,C00 to
45,000 tons/year of SO2.
The net reduction of S02 emissions at Prunerov II is
estimated at around 190,000 tons/yr (out of the total
218,000 to 235,000 tons/year of S02 reduced under the
project). Based on the total SO2 emission in CSFR
recorded in 1989 (2.65 million tons), the installation
of FGDs covered by this project component will reduce
emissions in CSFR by about 7%, and in relation to the
Czech Republic by about 10%. In northern Bohemia, the
most polluted region in CSFR, the proposed FGDs will
reduce SO2 emissions by about 20%.
She project also includes plant retrofitting with new
electrostatic precipitators (ESP) for effective dust
control to improve the environment and health of the
population. Where the ESPs are rehabilitated or
renewed, the emission will be reduced by 75% to 90%.
The transmission component will result in a lotwer cost
and more reliable electricity supply, and will
facilitate power exchanges.
RISKS:                   The main risks associated with the project are:
(a) deterioration of CEZ' financial condition as a
result of adverse macro-economic developments caused
by delays such as major changes in the internal refnrm
process; and (b) implementation delays due to CEZ
being a first-time borrower. It is reasonable to
expect that the government authorities will continue
on their present course of political and economic
transformation. So far, the stabilization program has



been successful with low inflation rates and sound
budgetary policy, but certain federal and republic
responsibilities are still being worked out. Since
the project is entirely within one republic and given
tha technical configuration of the system and joint
dispatching operations, there are likely to be minimal
affects on the project due to changes in inter-
republic relationships. Also, CEZ' financial
performance is believed to be adequately safeguarded
through the proposed covenants. The proposed close
supervision of the procurement process is likely to
ensure smooth project imp.Lementation. Therefore, the
above risks are considered to be manageable.

POWER AND ENVIRONMENT   IMPROVEME   PROJECT
I. ItrJRQDUCTION
1.01      The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) is classified as an
upper middle-income courntry with an estimated per capita income of US$3,460 in
1989 and a population of 15.6 millio.s. CSFR has undertaken a far-reaching
economic reform program to move from a rigid cen.rally planned economy to a
market economy. Within a stabilization-oriented macro-economic framework, the
tranformation program includes trade and exchange reform, large increases in
energy prices, liberalization of most non-energy prices, a tightened monetary
policy and initiation of a program for rapid privatization of large and small
enterprises. The procesb has been complicated by the need to clearly define
the responsibilities and authority of the federal government ana the
governments of the Republics. The demise of the CMEA trade structure has
resulted in much higher prices for imported oil and gas and has drastically
reduced exports on many manufactured goods. Manufactured goods production has
declined and GDP, which grew at an annual rate of 1.5% in the 1980e, is
estimated to have declined by about 35% ini 1991 and expected to decline about
5% in 1992, but to recover thereafter.
1.02      Czechoslovakia's transformation program has two central objectives:
(a) rapid transition to a market economy, and (b) restoration of economic
growth towards higher standards of living. In order to achieve theae goals,
stabilization and structural reform policies are being Implemented at the same
time. Unification of the commercial and tourist exchange rates, and price
increases for gasoline and industrial energy as well as for transport, were
implemented in the second half of 1990. In September 1990, the Government
adopted a radical transformation program consisting of a comprehensive set of
reform measures including anti-inflationary financial and incomes policies,
change of ownership of enterprises, promotion of private sector activities,
price and trade liberalization, "internal convertibility" of the currenoy
(unrestricted access by enterprises to foreign exchange for current account
purposes), and policies of protecting the population groups most vulnerable
during the transition process from undue hardship. The program was launched
on a broad scale at the beginning of January 1991. It is supported by an IMF
standby agreement, and a World Bank Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) tor
US$450 million.
1.03      The CSFR energy sector is character4zed by  heavy dependence on
domestically produced hard coal and lignite in the industrial, power and
residential sectors; severe air pollution problems from use of high sulfur
content hard coal and lignite; a unique position as the principal transit
country between former USSR and Western Europe for natural gas pipelines but
dependence on oil and gas imported from the former USSR; widespread
inefficiency in energy consumption related to past misguided industrialization
policies and previously subsidized energy prices; recent large increases in

2-
being at or above economic cost and most residential prices being about half
of economic cost); and a pucrly developed regulatory system for n>ural
monopolies (natural gas, power and heat).
1.04      Overall demand for energy ls expected to decline as consumers
conserve energy in response to the recent sharp increase in energy prices, and
also in responae to shifting industrial structure, interfuel substitution, and
ways to use fuels ..n a cleaner and more efficient manner. According to Bank
and federal government demand projections, energy consumption is projected to
decline until the middle of the decade and then begin to climb but, overall,
energy demand is expected  to be less in 2000 than in 1990.    The largeet
drop in demand is expected to be in coal consumption while electricity and gas
demand are expected to be back near 1990 levels in 2000.
1.05      The government of CSFR has taken a number of bold stepe to reform
the economy and the energy sector, sucn as the recent sharp increases in
energy prices, which are being complemented by ongoing and planned regulatory
and institution reforms. The role of the government and the institutional
structure is in the process of being changed from that of exercising absolute
control of the economy to one of oversight through a reconstituted regulatory
system. This development of a new regulatory system for energy utilities is
reflected in the draft federal energy policy paper. This policy paper also
proposes that energy utilities be restructured and partially privatized, with
the federal and republic governments retaining majority ownership. These
proposed reforms of the energy utilities are scheduled to follow the first
phase of ownership reform and priv,.ization of large industries planned for
the first half of 1992.
1.06      Air pollution from electricity production causes severe health and
environmental damage. The power se-tor relies heavily on coal-fired power
plants burning low-quality high-sulphur lignite, and represents the largest
polluter in CSFR in regard to SO2 and dust (fly-ash or particulate matter).
The extensive use of lignite during the last 40 years has resulted in a large
environmental damage, which is especially pronounced in the Northern Bohemia
region, where large parts of the forests have died and health of the
population is declining. Plans for reducing air pollution are based on
cleaning up the stack gases from large point sources, improving the plant
efficiency, and substituting less polluting fuels, such as natural gas where
justified. Proposed amendments to the Air Pollution Act contain emission
standards for new and old power plants were approved during 1991.
1.07      The Bank has had, and continues to have, an active role in assisting
in the reform of the energy sector. This began with productive dialogue
during the discussion of the Country Economic Memorandum in August 1990,
followed by draft energy issues papers and policy conditionality under the SAL
(on pricing, regulatory framework and least-cost investment planning and
medium term environmental action plan). Energy sector issues have been
evaluated in detail in the Bank's Energy Sector Review (Report No. 9768-CS, a
draft of which was discussed in October 1991 and used as an input into Fe6sral
and Republic Energy policy papers). Environmental issues have been evaluated
in the Joint Environmental Survey (jointly completed by the Bank, EEC, US AID



- 3 -
and CSFR authorities - Report No. 9623-CS). Energy projects for the Slovak
gas and power enterprises are currently being prepared, whichi include
components for power transmission, power station retrofitting, as well as gas
transmission, storage and distribution.
1.08      The Power and Environmental Improvement Project will be the first
World Bank loan to be made to the CSFR energy sector and one of the largest
environmental projects in Bank histccy. It will include funds for upgrading
the power sector generation and delivery oystem; equipment which will
substantially reduce air pollution, reaulting in improved living conditions
and increased health status, specifically in northern Bohemia where the large
lignite mines are located; improvement of power plant efficiency, resulting in
reduced lignite consumption; improvement of the economic efficiency of the
sector; and technical assistance to provide consulting services and training
to facilitate sector restructuring. The proposed project will allow CEZ to
keep generating expenses low and to defer investments in new generating
capacity without further damaging Northern Bohemia's environment, by
retrofitt.4ng existing plants to enable them to continue using low cost lignite
fuel in an environmentally safe manner.  The total project cost will be $557.5
million including $249 million for the installation of flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) equipment at the Prunerov II power plant; $60 million
for installation  -,' electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) for reduction of
particulates in several power plants; $81 million for improvement of plant
thermal eificiency; and $41.1 million for rehabilitation and upgrading of the
transmission network. It is proposed that the World Bank provide US$246
million, which represents the foreign exchange cost, approximatel.y 44% of the
total rroject cost. The funds would be useC to finance portions of the cost
of FGD equipment, equipment for the transmission network, and for technical
assistance.
1.09      The overall environmental impact of the project is very strongly
positive with reduction in S02 as well as other a'r pollutants and dust.
However, the installation of the FGDs will at the same time, increase the
total amount of waste by the generation of gypsum, which is not a hazardous
material, will increase by about 30%. This gypsum and waste water from the
FGDs can be easily and safely disposed of and are not expected to cause
environmental problems. In accordance with the Operational Directive 4.00,
Annex A, Environmental Assessment, this project has been ranked at the
level B.
1.10      The project was prepared after a pre-appraisal mission in
March 1991; an appraisal mission in June 1991; and a post-appraisal mission in
September/October 1991.

A. gaSkgXound
2.01      The CSFR energy sector was shaped in the past by the centrally
planned program which did not reflect rational economic decisions. The
industrial sector is dominated by heavy industry and much of the technology
used is highly energy inefficient. A major reason for this inefficiency is
the fact that energy prices in the past, for induatry and household consumers,
were so heavily subsidized that there was no incent4'e to economize. As a
result, the ratio of energy consumption to GDP is .  ' higher than in OECD
countries.  The recent level of energy use in the C.   was approximately 0.7
too/US$1000 of GDP, while industrial consimption was approximately 0.6
toe/US$1000 of GDP. This is more than twice the energy intensity in OECD
countries.  The Federal Government, which sets energy prices, has moved boldly
to increase most energy prices and to eliminate the negative "turnover taxes"
on energy.  Energy price increases between May 1990 and October 1, 1991 have
been very large, ranging from 70% (for residential electricity) to 320% (for
residential district heat) and have amouuized to increased costs to consumers
(industrial and residential) of about 50 billion Kcs or about 3% of projected
1991 GDP.
B. Resourc-s and Status of Develonment
2.02      The primary source of energy in the CSFR is coal.  In 1990 it
provided 55% of the gross energy consumption and recoverable reserves could
last more than 40 years at current production rates. However, most of the
coal is low quality lignite which is highly polluting.  The higher quality
hard coal contains a high sulfur level which also contributes to the pollution
problems. Coal consumption nas been stagnant over the past decade due to low
growth of the economy and increased usu of natural gas. Petroleum consumption
has declined as _he country moved to limit the petroleum products use to the
transportation and chemicals sector and eliminate its use as boiler fuel.
Hydroelectricity, which accounts for less than 4% of total electricity
production has declined slightly and the remaining undeveloped potential is
limited. Nuclear energy has grown rapidly in importance. In 1990, nuclear
power supplied 28% of the electricity produced and CSFR's power sector
development program includes the completion of two more large nuclear
stations. Steam, produced in industrial boilers and power plants, is
distributed to industrial consumers and hot water is distributed to
residential consumers through pipeline networks in 70 cities.
2.03      Oil and natural gas resources are very limited.  Indigenous oil
production provides only about 1% of the nation's requirements and natural
gas, less than 5%. Almost all of the crude oil and all natural gas imports
come from the forner USSR. Prior to 1990 oil from the former USSR had been
priced at well below world prices and payments were made in non-convertible
rubles and countertrade. The border price for crude oil now being set at
international levels. As yet, there have been no restrictions on natural gas
imports. Nonetheless, the changes in the CMEA pricing and trading structure



have prompted an effort to try to diversify to non-tormer USSR sourcee of both
oil and gas imports.
2.04      Coal is the primary indigenous energy resource.  Total production in
1990 was 116 million tons, of whickh about 81% was lignite with a heating value
of 12-12.3 MJ/kg. (The ljw cost lignite used in the Prunerov plants has a
slightly lower heating value of 10.5 MJ/kg.) Minable lignite resources are
estimated to be approximately 3700 million tona, equivalent to 47 years
requirements at current conaumption rates.  Hard coal reserves total 980
million tons or 43 years' supply at current rates of use. Due to
environmental and economic limitations, it is anticipated that consumption of
domestically produced coal will decline markedJy and bv 2005 it will provide
less than 40% of the total energy requirements. The ':oal mining induetry is
characterized by a broad range ot mining conditions. There are large mines
which supply Prunerov with low cost lignite. Geological conditions are very
difficult at some other mines where coal is mined from very thin (20 inch)
seams.
2.05      The coal sector is entering a period of transition, moving from a
fully protected and regulated environment to a free market economy where
performance will be measured by the sector's ability to compete with imported
coal and other energy sources. The course of development will be shaped
largely by market forces, which will increasingly include internalized
environmental costs. But given the negative factors, such as a general
stagnation in the economy, higher environmental penalties and substitution of
coal by less polluting fuels, it is clear the industry is entering a period of
contraction.
2.06      The CSFR consumed a total of 13.4 million tons of oil in 1990, which
was almost entirely imported from the former USSR. Prospects for additional
domestic production are very limited. The known potentially productive
reservoirs are very deep, over 6000 meters, and will require advanced deep
drilling technology which is costly and not presently available in the CSFR.
Oil imports from the former USSR were reduced by about one-fourth in 1990 and
further supply disruptions are possible. The current efforte are to diversify
oil supply sources and to expand the delivtery system and in-country storage.
The need to diversify sources of oil as quickly as possible and to provide
adequate storage has intensified because the planned increase in deliveries
via the Adria pipeline has been disrupted due to political problems in
Yugoslavia. Near-term options, which are under consideration, for increasing
deliveries from non-former USSR sources are: (a) expansion of the Adria
pipeline capacity up to S million tons/year (if disruptions in Adria supply
are overcome); (b) construction of products pipelines connecting the
Bratislava Slovnaft and Austrian Schwechat refineries; and (c) construction of
the Ingolstadt-Litvnov/Kralupy pipeline linking Germany to Czech Republic
refineries. In-country storage capacity should also be increased to a level
comparable to that of Western European countries, approximately 90 days
consumption.



-6-
2.07      Natural gas use has grown steadily since the first pipelines from
the former USSR were built in the late-1960s. CSFR location is central to the
European gas system as the transit pipelines transfer 60 billion cubic meters
per year from former USSR gas fields to Western Europe (which comprises about
one-third of Western Europe gas imports). In 1990 total CSFR gas consunption
was 13.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) of which less than 1 BCM was produced from
fields in the CSFR. Because it is environmentally much more acceptable than
lignite, natural gas is considered the fuel of choice for most small dispersed
indUBtrial, commercial and residential uses. Expansion plans which were
established prior to the political changes were based on continuation of past
growth rates and it was estimated that by 2000 the total consumption would be
approximately 20 BCM. Other demand growth scenarios, which are based on lower
anticipated economic growth project demand in the range of 17-18 BCM in 2000.
Essentially all of the gas must be imported from the former USSR in the near-
and medium-term. As in the case of oil, diversification of supply sources is
a priority goal, both to ensure long-term availability and to provide some
bargaining leverage in dealings with the former USSR. Discussions have been
held with Norwegian, Algerian, and Iranian authorities to assess the longer-
term availability of natural gas. In order to meet the growing demand for
natural gas as a replacement for low quality coal in industrial and
residential applications, the existing supply infrastructure must be
strengthened and expanded. As the residential market becomes a larger portion
of the total, temperature-sensitive demand will increase and, in order to meet
peak demands, storage capacity will have to be expanded.
2.08      The existing level of generating capacity in the power sub-sector
appears to be adequate to meet the projected demands through the 1990s. In
1990 the peak demand was about 13,000 Mw. The installed capacity, including
al3owances for retirement and conversion of some generating capacity to
district heating use, was about 22,000 MW in the same year, but available
capacity is much lower. The reserve will be adequate over the near term.
After 1995 electricity demand may increase slowly, but under the most
realistic assumptions, demand in 2000 is unlikely to exceed 1990 demand.
Assuming the stagnation of electric demand, the existing plants remaining
after retirement, together with those under const.rlction -- Temelin, 2000 MW
and Mochovce, 1760 MW -- should be adequate to mee. demands through the late
1990s. Introduction of free market principles will affect both the demand
growth and the optimum program for meeting the projected demands. The long-
range sub-sector development plan has not yut been subiected to a rigorcus
analysis based on the latest load forecasting and system development
simulation methodologies. Over the near term, the sub-sector development
program will focus on reduction of pollutants from the coal-burning stations
and upgrading of the transmission and distribution systems. A leaSt-cost
investment study is underway as part of the existing SAL operation. The study
is being financed by the EEC with consultants beginning work in February 1992.

2.09           Overall, energy consumption changed very little from 1980 to 1990,
but the entrgy mix shifted from liquid fuels to other energy forms. Oil
consumption declined as heavy fuel oil use was substituted by coal and natural
gas. Natural gas consumption ine;reased at an average rate of approximately 4%
from 1980 to 1990 as the network to additi.onal cities and towns was expanded.
Total electricity consumption increased from 73 TWh in 1980 l:o 85 TWh in 1990.
iluclear power increased most rapidly, growing from 6% of electricity
production in 1980 to 27% in 1990. Hydroelectricity supplied a very small
portion of electricity supply, less than 4%, and has remained relatively
constant throughout the decade. Table 2.1 below shows a condensed version of
the energy balance.  A more detailed energy balance is in hanex 2.1.

D. Enerav Sector Institutions
2.10      Under the centralized economy of the past 40 ye,rs, a rigid
institutional structure was imposed throughout the energy sector. Sector
development plans were controlled by the central authority with the primary
motivation being to meet pre-established )erformance or production goals.
Economic criteria were only considered within the context of overall plans and
because of the highly subsidized price structures in the energy sector, they
have little meaning in a free market economy. As the nation moves to adapt to
the market economy, the institutional structure is also in a state of flux for
two reasons. First, as the country moves toward a free market economy, the
planning function is being decentralized, so that in the future the
enterprises which will rely less on government direction and will increasingly
apply conventional economic evaluation criteria when making development plans
and investment decisions. To do this, they must adortt nevw accounting methods,
adjust costs to reflect international levels and eliminate subsidies. Second,
the republics will assume greater authority in energy sector planning while
the role of the federal government will be limited to general policy and to
those issues affecting both republics. The Ministry for Economic Policy and
Development of the Czech Republic will be responsible for sector activities in
the republic while the Slovak Ministry of Economy will be responsible for the
republic's activities.  Proposals are being considered that the natural
monopolies in the energy sector, i.e., electricity, natural gas, and district
heating services, be subject to a regulatory system which would allow prices
to eventually be set based on objective criteria and would ensure that the
monopolies do not abuse their monopolistic powers.  Options for delegation of
authority are being considered whereby each republic would eventually have
authority to approve tariffs and conditions of service for each regulated
utility.
2.11      The electric sector is comprised of two generating and transmission
enterprises, Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ) and Slovensky Energeticky Podnik,
(SEP) and 11 distribution utilities. CEZ and SEP, and some of the
distribution enterprises will be reorganized as joint stock companies.
Options are being considered to sell a minority portion of their shares to
private owners while the remaining distribution enterprises are being planned
to be operated as autonomous entities wholly owned by the republics or
municipal governments.
2.12      The gas sector is primarily concerned with distribution of natural
gas but approximately 400,000 customers receive "town gas", a lower heating
value gas produced from natura? gas or coal. The town gas systems are being
retired and will be essentially eliminated after 1995. The town gas from coal
is produced by coa) enterprises but distributed by the gas enterprise.   The
natural gas sector is comprised of the following principal enterprises:
-      The Slovak Gas Enterprise (SPP) receives natural gas from the
former USSR via the Brotherhood pipeline and delivers gas to
consumers in the Slovak Republic.



a- 9 -
The Czech Gas Works (CPP) distributes natural gas in the Czech
Republic via six regional centers.
Tranzitni Plynovod (TRANSGAS) is a CPP subsidiary (until the newly
formulated plan for formation of a joint stock company is
implemented) which delivers gas to CPP and operates the transit gas
system from the former USSR border to the delivery points at the
Austrian and German borders.
Nafta Gbely is responsible for production of natural gas and oil in
the Slovak Republic and operates the Lab natural gas storage field.
2.13      At the beginning of 1990, the coal sector consisted of 21 lignite
mines and 9 hard coal mines. The hard coal mines were operated by two
enterprises, Ostrava-Karvina (OKD) and Kladno Mining Company (KD). (See
Annex 3.12 for mine names and mine regions.) Alternatives for sector
restructuring are now under consideration. The principal issue is the extent
to which OKD and other companies will be broken into smaller, independent
joint stock companies. Several mines, notably the metallurgical (coking) co.,
mines in the Ostrava region and the underground lignite mines in slovakit and
ancillary operations such as construction, manufacture of mining equipment,
etc., will be spun off as separate autonomous joint stock companies.
2.14      At present the activities of the oil and chemical industries are
the responsibility of the Department of Oil and Chemistry in the CSFR Ministry
of Economy. The division of responsibilities with the republic governments
has not yet been resolved. The key issue, petroleum product pricing, is the
responsibility of the Fede.Lal Price Board in the Ministry of Finance. The
state oil concern, CHEMOPETROL has been dissolved with the result that the oil
industry is highly fragmented. There are six refining and petrochemical
operations, two regional distribution enterprises and two international
trading companies. The organizational structure of the oil sub-sector is in
transition. The alternatives under discussion include formation of separate
joint stock companies to manage the oil pipeline system; the refining
operationr; and product marketing. The management and operations of the
petrochemicals sector have been very closely integrated with the petroleum
sector. These are usually considered to be different types of conmercial
operations and this close linkage may make it more difficult to privatize
either activity.
2.15      District heating and steam energy play a significant role in the
energy sector.  In 1990 total consumption was 499 PJ, of which 75% was used by
industry; 15% by households; and 10% for other uses. The principal source of
heat energy was industry which produced 66% of the total consumed. Combined
Heat and Power (CHP) plants and heat-only-boilers (HOB) produced 28%, and 6%
was produced by other sources.  Major district heating networks have been
established in 53 cities in the Czech Republic and 17 in the Slovak Republic.
Originally all HOBs connected to the local boiler houses were coal-fired.  In
the 1960. several HOBs were converted to gai-fired CHP systems but this policy
was stopped by the end of the 1960s. Current plans are to replace worn-out
units and to contvert power plants to CHP where appropriate.

E. Pricing_Issues
2.16      Policy and Regulation.  Under the past centrally planned economy
all energy prices were highly distorted when compared to the economin cost of
production and delivery. Oil and gas imports from the former USSR were priced
much below international levels and were paid for with goods and services
valued at arbitrary prices. The lack of meaningful cost accounting methods
made it impossible to calculate the true 'economic coat of delivering energy to
end-users and government subsidies in the form of negative "turnover" taxes
reeulted in a pricing structure which often failed to recover actual costs.
2.17      Through its aggressive program to curtail subsidies and raise moBt
energy prices to a level at or near their economic cost, the government has
reduced or eliminated many of the distortions in the level of average prices
for the primary energy sources. As a result of the price increases adopted in
1990 and 1991, the household usere' prices are now closer to the economic
cost. It is estimated that, as of October 1, 1991, current residential energy
prices amount to approximately the following percentages of the economic cost:
heat energy, 25-30%; lignite, 57%; natural gas, 58%; on-peak electricity, 50%.
As a result of these increases, the budgetary subsidies to the utilities and
enterprises which provide the energy have beehi significantly reduced and the
distortions between residential and industrial prices have been reduced, but
not eliminated. AB shown in Table 2.2, the prices to industrial consumers of
electricity and natural gas are higher than the economic cost while the prices
to residential consumers are below the economic cost.

2.18        Hard coal and lionite pricina.  Retail coal prices increased in
May 1990 and industrial steam coal and coking coal prices were more than
doubled. Over the long term, the objective is to deregulate coal prices and
coal users should be allowed to use the least-cost source of coal -- after
taking into account environmental costs --- whether it is locally produced or
imported. However, during the transition period some special pricing
arrangements will be required. For example, the mine-mouth power plants which
use lignite cannot easily switch to another fuel. The appropriate price for
these consumers lies between the long-run marginal cost of production and the
opportunity cost. The real prices of low quality high sulfur coals and lignite
used for household heating should be raised in order to promote the shift to
more environmentally acceptable fuels.
2.19        Petroleum and products pricing.  Petroleum product prices are set
at two points: ex-refinery and at the retail level. Prices are based on crude
oil prices plus a fixed margin to cover the cost of refining and marketing.
The turnover tax at the retail level has been eliminated and replaced with a
fixed tax on selected products. The key pricing issues in the petroleum sub-
sector will be the extent to which prices are controlled by the government and
the refiners' accessibility to world markets. To have a workable system,
refiners must have free access to world crude oil and product markets and
competition must be established at the retail level. The government is taking
first steps in this direction.
2.20        Electricitv price levels.  The average industrial tariff, now
about $0.04-0.06/kWh, is above the marginal cost, while the low-voltage
consumers continue to pay only about 50% to 60% of their marginal cost. The
differentials between the tariffs for customers at different voltage levels
and in different service categories has been improved with the recent 70%
increase in residential electricity tariffs (on October 1, 1991). Tariff
structures of individual consumer categories include low-use and high-use
tariffs; time-of-day tariffs; and heat storage tariffs which are available for
off-peak (night-time) service. On the whole, this structure is suitable for
reflecting cost differentials, which will be determined with greater accuracy
in the forthcoming least-cost investment study (para. 2.23).
2.21        Natural gas tariffs.  Natural gas tariffs are divided into
wholesale (bulk) tariffs which apply to large volume consumers, such as
electric power plants and industrial users; and retail tariffs which are paid
by residential consumers and some small volume customers. Tariffs are not
geographically differentiated and the same price is paid by wholesale or
retail consumers in all parts of the CSFR. The bulk tariff is a single price
for all volumes sold; while the retail tariff is a two-part structure. After
the recent industrial price increases, the wholesale tariff iB higher than the
retail. tariff even though the cost of service is less. During the second
quarter of 1991, the border price of natural gas increased to 2600 Kcs/MCM.
To compensate for this increase, the industrial tariff has been increased to
3420 Kcs/MCM. The residential tariff, which had been 890 Kcs/MCM, includes
the allowance of a negative turnover tax (subsidy), was increased by 150% on
May 1, 1991 but is still less than the border price.

2.22        District heatina tariffs.  Residential DH heating customers pay
for the service under two tariffs: one for space heating which is based on the
number of square meters which the user occupies; the second, for domestic hot
water which is based on the number of occupants in the dwelling unit.
Usually, neither service is metered so the total quantity used by the block of
flats is determined at the secondary meter and allocated among all consumers.
New metering methods are being proposed.  The co-; of district heating at the
point of production has been based on the type of fuel used. Theoretically
the wholesale price was calculated as the average production cost plus a
profit.
2.23        SAL Enerav Conditionality.  The Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)
contains conditions which address key macro and sector pricing, as well as
regulatory and least-cost investment planning issues, particularly for the
power sub-sector. The SAL required the government to increase residential
electricity prices and thus reduce the distortion between residential and
industrial prices which has led to a miballocation of rescurces (as described
in Annex 2.2). In fact, the federal government satisfied this SAL condition
by raising residential electricity tariffs by 70%, on October 1, 1991, well
ahead of second tranche release. As a condition of the second tranche
release, a preliminary least-cost investment study has been prepared, and a
suitable pricing structure action plan is being developed, to be implemented
over the next two years. Preparatory work and progress on these studies and
action plans is being achieved.
2.24        Prior to the third tranche release a Public Utilities Law will be
submitted to the Parliament. The law will establish the legal predicate and
procedures for economic regulations (including price setting) of enterprises
which produce, transport, and distribute electric energy, natural gas, town
gas and thermal (heat) energy. The law is expected to define the scope of
regulation; and the structure, powers and jurisdiction of the regulating
bodies (see Annex 2.3 and Chapter III (Section C) for more details on the
regulatory framework).

III. THE POWER SUB3-SE9C-R
A. Overview
3.01      Projections of declining economic growth over the near term and
introduction of energy-efficient technology, point to a growing excess of
power generation capacity until the mid-1990o, particularly when new
generating plant capacity coming on stream at that time is taken into account.
Currently reserve margins are adequate so the added capacity will provide an
opportunity to retire at least an equivalent amount of capacity in older coal-
fired units which are a primary source of air pollution (see Annex 3.1).
3.02      In 1990, 56% of the ele^tric energy war generated with coal and 80%
of that was from lignite-fueled plants. Very little fuel oil is used for
power generation, and that is being phased out as quickly as possible.
Natural gas, because of its environmental benefits, has been proposed as a
growing source of energy for future new power generation when needed.
Uncertainties about the availability of imports and the higher cost, relative
to the lignite from the most efficient mines serving mine-mouth power
stations, may limit its use. It may be the most economic fuel in those
stations already equipped for gas firing and may be the least-cost choice for
inversion episode control in some locations. Its longer-term role is still to
be defined in the least-cost investment study (para. 2.23). Hydroelectric
resources are limited but three major hydro plants (two under construction),
which together will add 1400 MW of capacity, are scheduled to come into
service before 2000.
3.03      The transition to a free market economy, coupled with a greatly
changed perspective of environmental objectives, could significantly impact
the sub-sector investment program over the next decade. Any new nuclear plant
investments will have to be shown to be the least-cost option. Some of the
lignite-fired stations are obsolete and inefficient. These will be among the
units replaced by the current capacity expansion program. But several of the
mine-mouth stations have very low fuel costs. They are the stations which
have been identified as candidates for installation of flue gas
desulfurization units which will reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions to
locally acceptable levels (see Annex 3.2).
3.04      The development of the sub-sector is also likely to be affected by
recent organizational changes and future changes which result from proposed
privatization of some parts, or all, of the sub-sector. Prior to 1990, CEZ
and SEP operated as vertically integrated monopolies in their respective
regions. They operated all the generation, transmission and distribution
systems as integrated networks. In 1990, the distribution systems were
restructured as autonomous organizations. The first steps toward
privatization have already been announced. It has been proposed that CEZ and
SEP, and probably the distribution enterprisee at a later date, be converted
to joint stock corporations which will offar up to 49% equity participation by
the private sector.



- 14 -
3.05      Historically, the operations and investment program of the power
sub-sector has been closely linked to that of the district heating sub-sector.
CEZ and SEP have operated a number of stations which produce both electricity
and heat energy (steam and hot water) which were delivered to consumers
through district heating pipeline networks.
3.06      The electricity sector is, as with all the other sectors of the
economy, affected by the transformation from a centrally planned economy to a
more open, market-oriented economy. Certain major issues have, as noted, yet
to be clarified. For example, the governments of the two republics, which
have taken on new responsibilities, are not yet sufficiently eqx.ipped for the
extended tasks of sector regulation; nor is the allocation of responsibilities
between the federal government and the republics fully clear. Nevertheless,
these issues are being addressed and the overall electricity sector is
sufficiently stable and well-defined to implement the proposed project.
3.07      Another large undertaking will be the consequence of the regulation
linked to the Air Pollution Act, which become effective in 1991, in that all
power plants with a capacity of more than 300 MW must install flue gas
desulfurization equipment within a period of 5 years (see Annex 3.3).
B. Organization
3.08      The power sector of Czechoslovakia consists now of the following
enterprises:
Czech Republic
(a)     CEZ with its Power Generating Companies and the High-Voltage
Transmission Network of 400 kV and 220 kV (also see para.
4.02);
(b)     Eight independent Power Distribution Companies, as follows:
(i)     Prague Power Works
(ii)     Middle-Bohemian Power Works
(iii)     South-Bohemian Power Works
(iv)     West-Bohemian Power Works
(v)     North-Bohemian Power Works
(vi)     East-Bohemian Power Works
(vii)     South-Moravian Power Works
(viii)     North-Moravian Power Works; and
(c)     Research Institutes, CEZ subsidiaries.  Among them is a
subordinated department in Ceske Budejovice of Energovod,
Prague, which has been transformed into Energetik. Ceske
Budejovice.



- 15 -
(d)     Starting January 1, 1991, three District Heating Enterprises
which used to be part of CEZ have been separated out and
established as independent companies.
Slovak Re ublic
(a)     SEP with its Power Generating Companies and the High-Voltage
Network of 400 kV and 220 kV;
(b)     Three independent Power Distributin Comp nles which also
distribute district heating; and
(c)     Research Institutese,SEP subsidiaries.
3.09      The latest decision is that the Czech government owns CZZ and that
the Slovak government owns SEP. The responsibilities of the federal
government are confined to general policy matters. These recent developments
may threaten to separate the integrated system into two parts that could lead
to uncoordinated development plans. To ensure orderly development of the
oector, during negotiations agreement was reached that CEZ will prepare, under
jerms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. and furnish to the Bank and the
Guarantor not later than October 15.-1992, a draft federal least cost
investment program for the period 1993 through 2003, and afford the Bank and
the Guarantor a reasonable onnortunity to exchange views with the Borrower on
said least cost investment_rogram. 
3.10      The distribution companies will build and operate tha transmission
lines operating at less than 220 kV and the distribution networks. They will
purchase power from CEZ or SEP (with some limited own generation) and resell
it to the end-users.
3.11      In the Czech Republic most of the district heating systems are no
longer the responsibility of CEZ but are operated as separate enterprises.
CEZ is responsible for operation of the CHP stations and transmission of the
hot water to local distribution networks. The heat energy is sold to the
local District Heating Enterprise at the secondary heat exchanger situated at
the local district level. The District Heating Enterprise then resells the
energy to the end-users. The regional and municipally owned enterprises are
responsible for smaller heat-producing units and distribution to the end-
users. In the Slovak Republic, SEP has retained operating responsibility for
the district heating systems.
3.12      CEZ and SEP are responsible for construction and operation of all
generation and transmission facilities at the 400-kV and 220-kV level. Both
companies operate a dispatching center for ensuring the use of the most
economic capacity throughout the respective republic. A country-wide
dispatching center, superimposed on the republic internal dispatching centers
and owned by both companies, ensures the most economic use of capacity on a
nationwide basis.

C. Reaulatorv Framework
3.13      As in other market economies, there will be a need to regulate the
natural monopolies which supply electricity, natural gas and district heating
service to ensure that they do not abuse their monopoly position. The Pricing
Law provides a legal basis for public utility regulation but specific
legislation will be required to establish the jurisdictional scope of the
regulating bodies; to define their authority and responsibilities; and to
provide a legal foundation for their actions. However, public utility
regulatory bodies have not been set up yet. As described in para. 2.24, Annex
2.3 describes the specific SAL conditionality on regulation of public
utilities te begin to address these very important issues described in this
section. A study, for which the Bank helped draft the terms of reference, of
the public utility regulatory framework is being carried out. The study will
be financed by the EEC with consultants beginning work in December 1991.
3.14      The four primary objectives of public utility economic regulation
under study are:
-      All investments in facilities are needed to serve the public
interests and will be "used and useful" in public service.
-      All expenditures are prudently incurred and are necessary to ensure
that the quality of service is maintained.
-      The tariffs for each customer category are reasonable and equitable;
they promote economic efficiency; and no customer is unfairly
discriminated against.
-      Utility service is offered to all consumers who can be economically
served.
3.15      The present study is evaluating options whereby the functions of the
regulatory body would include the approval of tariffs; approval of
construction of facilities; and ensuring the protection of the public health
and safety. The regulatory body would monitor the activities of the public
utilities to ensure that environmental laws and regulations are met. A
standard system of financial accounts and periodic reporting procedures should
be followed by all regulated public utilities.
3.16      The legal foundation for the institutional structure is planned to
be established in the Public Utilities Regulation legislation (submission to
Parliament is a condition of SAL third tranche release). Sep4rate &gulatory
bodies are presently being considered by the Czech Republic and the Slovak
Republic, each to eventually be responsible for tariff approval and other
regalatory activities within their respective republics. The draft federal
energy policy (prepared in October 1991) calls for development of an
independent system for regulating the suppliers of electricity at the federal,
republic, and regional level. The Bank has provided guidelines for a
structure which would delegate primary responsibilities for tariff approval



- 17 -
and regulation to the republics while the federal government would retain
responsibility for matters affecting the national interest.
D.  Existing Electric Power  aacilties and Operations
3.17      The CSFR bulk power system is serviced by the two main electric
utilities, CEZ and SEP.  A small fraction of the generating system belongs to
industries whose plant generates for their own consumption and who Bell any
surplus to the system. A detailed list of power plants in the Czech and
Slovak Republics is shown in Annex 3.4.
3.18      The CEZ generating system comprises plant totalling about 13,350 MW.
Of this about 10,170 MW is based on fossil fuels, 1359 MW on hydro, and
1760 MW on nuclear plants. The main coal power plants are concentrated in the
North Bohemia region. The hydro component of CEZ comprises plants at Dales4.ce
(450 MW), Orlin (364 MW), and other smaller stations below 150 MW each.
Although the hydro capacity represents about 10% of total CEZ capacity, its
energy contribution is about 2.6%, indicating that hydro plants operate mostly
for peaking service. CEZ has also in operation the nuclear power plant
Dukovany with 4x440 MW units. This plant, of the VVER 440, model V213, was
commissioned in 1983-87. The nuclear capacity, which represents about 13% of
total, generates about 21% of electric energy since it is base-loaded.
3.19      The SEP generating system consists of about 5,600 MW of installed
capacity. of this, 2,200 MW is generated from fossil fuel plants, 1,655 MW
from hydro, and 1,760 MW from nuclear power plants. The major fossil fuel
plants are Vojany 1 and 2 and Novaky A and B. At Vojany 1, 6xllO MW units
operate on coal while at Vojany 2, 6xllO MW units have been converted to gas-
burning boilers. Because of the high fuel cost, these latter units are
usually kept in reserve and are only turned on when inversion conditions in
northern Bohemia force the operators to shut down some of the worst polluting
units in that region. The hydro component comprises a large number of small
plantB that make about 8.5% contribution to total generation. The nuclear
component consists of the 4x440 MW units (type VVER 440) at Bohunice, that
make up about 21.4% of total SEP capacity. These units are base-loaded and
contribute about 40% of SEP's total generation.
3.20      In addition to CEZ and SEP, there exist about 2000 MW of industrial
own generating capacity in the Czech, and about 800 MW in the Slovak Republic.
Their energy contributions to the systems are about 1% in the Czech, and about
9% in the Slovak Republic.
3.21      The CEZ and SEP transmission systems comprise all transmission lines
and substations above 110 kV. They are extensive systems that were developed
over many years. The 400-kV level was recently introduced to the system and a
conversion of the existing 220-kV level to 400/110-kV is proceeding. The
country's transmission network has a length of 17,959 km and consists of 4,010
km of 400-kV lines, 2,429 km of 220-kV lines and 11,520 km of 110-kV lines.
The 400-kV and 220-kV installations belong to CEZ and SEP, the 110-kV network
is considered part of the distribution facilities and belongs to the Power
Distribution Companies.



- 18 -
3.22      Two nuclear plants are at present under construction:  2xlOOO MW at
Temelin in the Czech Republic and 4x440 MW at Mochovce in Slovakia (para.
3.44). Both plants are of Soviet design. Tho Czechoslovak authorities
recognize the shortcomings of the Soviet-type reactors and are taking steps to
bring the two plants up to Western technology safety standards. As a first
step, CEZ has commissioned a detailed safety audit of the Temelin plant by
international consultants to define the improvements required to bring the
plant in line with Western safety practices. (This study is to be financed
under the consultancy and training portion of the proposeci loan.) The Slovak
utility, SEP, is expected to carry out a similar exercise in relation to the
Mochovce plant. SEP is also preparing a plan to decommission two of the
Bohunice units that have been identified as having safety problems. The
Czechoslovak authorities had planned earlier additional nuclear capacity: two
additional 1000-MW units at Temelin and new power plants at other unidentified
sites. These plants are no longer included in the integrated CSFR investment
program because of the forecast slow demand growth attributable to changed
economic conditions in the country, the clear perception of deficiencies in
the Soviet-designed reactors, and the heightened awareness that pressing
issues, such as safety upgrade.,, plant decommissioning and radioactive waste
disposal: must be given higher priority. Based on the above, it i3 clear that
the Czechoslovak authorities are serious about confronting and resolving the
complex safety issues of their nuclear power program. In recent years, the
Czechoslovak nuclear authorities have been in frequent contact with IAEA to
tap the agency'B technical expertise in helping evaluate the safety needs of
Temelin and other CSFR nuclear installations. A report on "Pre-operational
Safety of the Nuclear Installations - Temelin Nuclear Power Plant" was issued
by IAEA in November 1990. The ongoing comprehensive Temelin safety audit
(para. 3.44) is in line with the recomnendations of the IAEA report. In
addition, the operational safety of Dukovany nuclear power station iB being
greatly enhanced through retrofitting with modern, state-of-the-art monitoring
and control instrumentation imported from Germany. Moreover, twinning
arrangement are being made with Electricite de France (EDF) and German and
Spanish nuclear capable utilities in an effort to secure quick transfer of
operational and maintenance know-how.
E. Coal Use and Environmental Impacts
3.23      The Czechoslovak electr'c power system is heavily dependent on the
uae of coal for energy generation.  In 1989, 12,347 MW out of a total of
19,227 MW (i.e., 64%) was steam thermal plant burning coal. In terms of
generated energy, 50,452 GWh (i.e., 56%) was generated by coal. A small
quantity of hard coal with a calorific value of about 24.0 GJ/ ' and an average
sulfur content of 0.7% is also used in power. Overall, in 1989, about 40
million tons of lignite and about 3.0 million tons of hard coal were used in
power generation.
3.24      Nearly the same amount of lignite, 36 million tons, is used for heat
generation all over the country. Of total about 76 million tons, 75% is burned
in the northern Bohemia region. Up to now, flue gas desulfurization (FGD) has
been tried at two plants in northern Bohemia: Tisova and Tusimice. At
Tisova; an ineffective (40% S02 removal rating), second-hand FGD installation



- 19 -
imported from Germany is in partial operation. TI. Tusimice installation is
based on MgO Soviet technology and has never operated satisfactorily. In
spite of repeated attempts to make it wcrk, it is unlikely that this FGD will
ever be economically operated. In addition to the FGD installations proposed
for Prunerov II under the project, CEZ iB retrofitting one of the five 200-MW
Pocerady units with modern FGD as part of its ongoing pollution control
program (see para. 3.30 and Annex 3.2). At present, therefore, nearly all of
the S02, as well as the NOx generated by the lignite, is emitted tc the
environment together with large amounts of fly-ash resulting from obsolete
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). The total nationwide emission of S02 is
estimated to be 2.67 million tons for the year 1990, of which 1.73 is
generated by power plants larger than 5 MW. The emission of NOX is estimated
to 1/4 - 1/3 of the sulfur oxides and the emission of fly-ash is calculated to
be around 1.15 million tons.
3.25      Following the end of the World War II, the government decided to use
the indigenous energy resources, consisting mainly of lignite deposited in the
northern part of North Bohemia, to meet the increasing energy demand. The
excavation of available lignite increased from about 28 million tons/yr by the
year 1950 to more than 100 million tons/yr by the year 1985, and has s4 'ce
then dropped to about 76 million tons/yr.  To reduce the transportation of the
lignite, the power plants were erected close to the mines. The heavy
concentration of power plants burning lignite in a very small area has
resulted in an envirormentally disastrous situation, with adverse consequences
on the local population's health and living conditions. The location of the
lart3st S02 emission sources in CSFR (in Annex 3.5) shows the large
concentration of power plants in the coal-mine basin in North Bohemia.
3.26      The large increase in the use of lignite of relatively high sulfur
content (1.8-2.5%) has resulted in the highest specific emission of S02/person
in Europe, which, for Czechoslovakia, is 179 kg/person. The emission of 502
per capita in the northern Bohemia region is more than 1900 kg/person, which
is more than 10 times higher than for the rest of the country. The emission
of dust for the whole country is 77 kg/person and in this region 550
kg/person. The environmental impact can be summarized as follows:
-    The emission of S02 was 2.67 million tons in 1990.  Of this 36.1%,
or 0.96 million tons, are gene-ated in northern Bohemia. Expressed
as tons per km2 per year the figure, for Czechoslovakia is 22.7 aAld
for northern Bohemia, 113.4.
-    The emission of 1.15 million tons of dust during 1990, of which 24%
or 0.28 million tons are generated ir, northern Bohemia.
-    The topographical situation in the mining district in northern
Bohemia creates extreme meteorological conditions; e.g., in some
towns during the winter season, there is little or no wind for about
50% of the time. This, combined with strong inversion, results in
very high concentrations of S02 in the air.  In towns like Teplice
and Litvinov, concenLrations up to 2600 pg/m3 have been recorded.
In the winter of 1988, Teplice had a recorded average concentration



20 -
of over 1000 pg/m3 more than 10% of the time, a level that can cause
large hoalth problem, specifically for sensitive persons.
-    The effect on the population hae during the last decades resulted in
an increased sickneEs and mortality in some population groups in
some areas, particularly for men in their economically most
productive ages. Contrary to most European countries, the mortality
rate for cardio-vascular and oncological deceases has increased,
specifically in the mining region. Northern Bohemia has the lowest
average life expectancy in CSFR, for both men and women. It also
has the highest figures for missed workdays and illnesses of the
respiratory system. During inveraion conditions, the air quality
becomes so toxic that sick and old people cannot survive. The
concentration of S02 in the ambient air reaches, under the worst
inversion conditions, lethal levels. Peak pollution during times of
atmospheric inversion cause the most severe health problems. In
addition to overall reduction of SO2, steps should be taken (e.g.,
stockpiling and use of high-quality coal) to reduce peak pollution
problems. Bv December 31. 1992. CEZ aareed to preyare an action
plan. includina targets. satisfactory to the Bank to deal with the
remainina peak pollution prcblem. Also the action plan shall
include an appropriate monitoring system: and _:EZ and che Bank will
annually review (on April 1 of each year. starting April 1. 1994)
the results of the monitoring system and the agreed recommendations
for improvements will ba implemented.
-    According to a survey organized by the U.N. Economic Commission for
Europe in 1988, a total of 70.5% of the forests in Czechoslevakia
are damaged, of which 5.4% re classified as "dying' and 22% as
"medium damaged". The mopt zsuere damage is located in East and
North Bohemia and North Moravia, where large areas have been
completely deforested and the total figure for damaged, dying and
dead forest is between 96-100%. The main reasons are the extremely
low pH-value in the soil caused by the deposits of SO2 and the
emission of fly-ash. A more detailed review of the health situation
and the forest damages in the mining districts is presented in
Annex 3.5, which also includes a discussion of ambient air quality
in the surroundings of EPK Tusimice (including Prunerov plants).
3.27      The necessity to reduce the air pollution related to S02 and duat
emiW.sons is obvious to both the power-generating companies and the
environmental authorities in Czechoslovakia.
3.28      The current situat"n gives rise to great concern for the health
status and the environmental ..4amages in CSFR and particularly for northern
Bohemia. Total S02 and fly-ash emissions in 1990 were about the same as
recorded during 1988. See Table 3.1 belowt

3.29      The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic authorities are committed to
reduce the emission of SO2 and fly-ash. The proposed project is urgently
required and is part of a program to retire or retrofit plants in this region.
3.30        CEZ currently has an installed capacity of 10,170 MW, of which
1952 MW would be reduced by retirement of whole plants or certain boilers, and
another 4,500-5,000 MW will be equipped with flue gas desulfurizatioll
equipment in accordance with the program. The result of the planned program
will be that about 19% of the current installed capacity will be retired and
about 45-50% will be retrofitted with FGD and other environmental protection
equipment. With an expected efficiency of more than 90% SO2 reduction, the
program will reduce the SO2 emission from CEZ operated plants by about 50%.
The total SO2 from the CEZ operated plants is estimated to be more than 1200
ktons/yr. The program will achieve a reductlon of more than 600 ktona/yr.
3.31      The Bank has reviewed this program, which needs to be confirmed
through the ongoing least-cost investment study. Some plants date from the
1950s and the 1960s and will need to be closed down; it is not, therefore,
worthwhile to spend large sums on environmental control for such plants.
Others are relatively new and burn low-cost lignite and will definitely not be
affected by the conclusions of the least-cost study. Prunerov II, the plant
included in the project, is one of those plants.
3.32        The FGDs and ESPs at Prunerov 1I, part of the proposed project,
will result in a reduction of 190,000 tons of S02 and about 36,000 tons of
fly-ash per year. The project will also include measures to improve plant
thermal efficiency at Prunerov II and other large CEZ plants to reduce
consumption of lignite. Consequently, the emission of SO2 and f3y-ash will be
reduced by an additional 28,000 - 45,000 tons of SO2 and around 3,000 tons of
fly-ash per year. An a whole, the project will contribute with about 35-40%
of the intended SO2 reduction and about 10% of the fly-ash reduction in the
heavily polluted northern Bohemia region.

F. Electricity Demand and Demand Manageient
3.33        During the ten years 1979-89, electricity demand under the command
economy system grew at about 3% per year. The growth rate of small consumers,
particularly households, was significantly higher, at about 4.5% per year,
while large consumers such as industry, who account for the bulk of
electricity consumption, increased their purchases only at about 2.5% p.a.,
Annex 3.6. As a consequence, by 1989 small consumers had increased their
share of total final electricity consumption (excluding electricity consumers
within the energy-producing sector) to about 30%, of which almost 20% was
accounted for by households. Much of this vigorous growth in the household
sector is attributable to the spread of night-storage heating encouraged by
low tariffs. The industrial sector retains by far the largest share of
electricity consumption: it amounts to about 60% of final consumption, and
(together with the energy industry) to almost 70% of electricity delivered to
all users.
3.34        Until 1990, industrial electricity use was determined by the
output requirements of the planned economy, projected according to input-
output relationships. Although the tariff structure was designed rationally
to reflect different costs at different times, price was not a tool of demsand
management. On the other hand, households responded to the incentive of low
off-peak tariffs in the establishment of storage heating: during the 1980s,
sales at the low night tariff grew at about 6% p.a. The change in household
consumption patterns had a significant effect in many urban locations, and
became virible in the daily system load curve by creating new peak times in
previously off-peak periods such as winter nights (Annex 3.6).  As a result,
the load curve has lost its pronounced peaks, and the winter difference
between daily minimum and maximum load is about 2,000 MW out of a 13,000 MW
peak demand. Seasonality is an important demand feature, and winter demand
levels lie about 2,000 MW above summer ones: on an annual basis, therefore,
there is a 4,000 MW difference between the summer minimum and the winter
maximum.
3.35        The relatively flat load curve within each season makes it
necessary to control the potential shifting of peak periods through more
direct means than price alone. Low off-peak tariffs are now associated with
remote-control switching-off of appliances such as storage heating, to be
triggered at the times when more costly generating plant enters into
operation. As tariffs rise over time in real terms, both demand management
tools will be effective instruments to flatten tne load curve. Initial
evidence in 1991 already indicates that industrial consumers are reacting to
the significantly increased industrial tariff levels by shifting some of their
consumption to shoulder and off-peak periods.
3.36        Projections for future demand development are based on a radical
break with past growth patterns. The transformation of the economy to a
market-oriented one implies a strong decline in the output of lheavy industry,
and an overall GDP decrease for several years, followed by a gradual economic
recovery based on a different industrial structure. Although household



- 23
electricity consumption iB expected to show continued growth as residential
consumers switch out of poor-quality lignite for home heating, the dominant
effect of the economic slowdown and industrial decline is likely to be a slump
in overall electricity aales, Annex_3.7. As the pace of the economic decline
and revival is uncertain, the power utilities are assuming high and low
scenarios of electricity demand development: the high scenario expects a
shallow recession, with recovery beginning in 1994. In the low scenario, the
recession is deeper. Total electricity consumption in 1995 is projected to
still be well below the peak 1989 level, with industry showing a decline in
consumption of 15-30%. After 1995, the economic recovery is expected to lead
to a renewed power demand growth of about 2% p.a., resulting in a total
requirement of 87-100 TWhi in the year 2000, compared to 92 TWh in 1989.
G.  Electric Power Investment Proaram
3.3.        Investment program scenarios for the borrower, CEZ, outlining
their proposed plane in each of the years 1992-2000 are presented in
Annex 3.8. Whereas the individual enterprises (CEZ, SEP and the Power
Distribution Companies) prepare their investment programs independently, the
Federal Ministry of Economy (FME) prepares a strategic development plan for
the power sub-sector. This plan integrates the individual plans taking also
into cOnsideration broader issues of the expected rate of economic growth in
the country, availability of financial resources, management capabilities, and
environmental requirements. A thorough optimization of the system investment
program will be conducted under the ongoing least-cost investment study.
3.38        For a rational choice of the optimal system development strategy,
alternative investment sequences will be carefully costed, using capital and
variable costs that reflect international price levels for equipment and
fuels, and compared to obtain a least-cost sequence of system investments.
This sequence, calculated on a discounted cash flow basis with shadow-priced
economic costs, should be consistent with (i) a realistic demand forecast,
which takes into account the probable decline of energy-intensive industrial
output in the CSFR and the uncertainty involved; (ii) the new pricing regime
that will depress demand for electricity and heat; (iii) system operation
requirements to meet loads and sales commitments reliably; and (iv) applicable
new limits for emissions of pollutants.
3.39        The choice of a least-cost system development sequence for the
CEZ/SEP grid will, in turn, influence the decision on the future of the steam
coal mining industry, depending on the optimal fuel mix in the system. Rather
than starting from a decision to phase out lignite mining (forcing a
retirement of coal-fired plant), the analysis should arrive at a conclusion
about lignite only after a thorough cost comparison on how to satisfy
projected demand under strict environmental requirements.
3.40        In this system optimization exercise, load forecasts will be
firmed up using modern methodologies. A least-cost development program which
will consider all viable options, including increased end-use efficiency and
combined cycle plants using imported natural gas, will be developed with up-
to-date analytical tools. Use of imported natural gas for power generation as



- 24 -
a long-term alternative to expanding nuclear capacity would be explored on
economic grounds in line with the acknowledged need for diversification of
energy supplies and the need for flexible expansion options to meet uncertain
demand.
3.41        The environmental improvement requirements are large, and can be
met only gradually, and after examination of the economically optimal way of
doing so. Although international agreements call for the reduction of S02
emissions (from the current 1.2 million tons p.a.) by 30% by 1993, even
radical measures would reduce 502 output of the power syetem only to just
under 1 million tons by 1995. Where economically justifiable, existing coal-
fired power stations should be rehabilitated and retrofitted with flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) equipment to conform with environmental protection
regulations. In this regard, options such as conversion of existing boilers
to gas firing and substitution of poor quality local coal with higher quality
imported coal (or blended coal) should be explored and compared to the
continuing use of lignite. In the case of Prunerov II (the plant selected for
the project) these options were explored, and FGD retrofitting is the clear
economic choice (para. 7.07). A decision to move to a high share of nuclear
generation should only be taken if it is demonstrated to be the least-cost
option for reducing emissions and satisfying future demand.
3.42        A related issue is the justification of expanding district heating
through the conversion of existing coal-fired power plants to supply bulk
heating. Further economic analysis should ascertain the economic merit of the
proposed district heating as compared with an increase of natural gas use for
production of heat at local boiler plants, or for direct distribution of piped
gas to individual residential consumers. To the extent that additional
supplies of natural gas become available from the former USSR, Western Europe,
etc., this option may well result in a reduced rate of power station
conversion and a lower need for additions to district heating capacity during
the present decade.
3.43        The total currently planned CEZ investment in the period 1992-2000
is about Kcs 180 billion (US$6.4 billion), with the major categories of
investments shown in Annex 3.8. The phasing of the investment depends on (a)
the pace of demand development, and (b) the potential for exporting temporary
surpluses. Both size of investment program and phasing are subject to
confirmation following the ongoing least-cost investment study. Preliminary
capacity balance estimates (Annex 3.8) indicate more than adequace capacity
margins throughout the 1990s (although the current CEZ definition of
"installed capacity" covers significantly more than actually available
capacity). In energy (kWh) terms, the margin may be less comfortable. If
domestic demand development will take place about midway between the two
forecasting scenarios, major new capacity additions such as the Temelin
nuclear plant can be delayed by several years, unless firm export contracts
for the mid-1990. can be entered into. In the low-demand scenario, a delay of
Temelin commissioning may postpone the need for new capacity immediately after
the year 2000, thus reducing the CEZ investment expenditure 1992-2000 to about
Kcs 165 billion (USS5.9 billion).



- 25 -
3.44        Completion of Nuclear Plants.  The completion of well advanced
nuclear plants is one of the largest parts of the overall investment. Under
the CEZ and SEP investment programs, two power plants, one at Temelin (2x1000
MW) and one at Mochovce (4x440 MW) are to be completed (Annex 3.9). The
program is examined in terms of incremental expenditures, since the sunk cost
can be ignored in economic terms in the situation of a complete re-appraisal
of the program. Costs need to be re-estimated due to price and excihange rate
distortions in the past, and special arrangements within CMEA. The estimated
incremental costs for the Temelin plant are equivalent to a unit price of
about US$900-1,000/kW, as the plant is at an advanced stage of implementation,
with the first unit 60% and the second unit about 40% complete. The
incremental capital cost is higher than the cost of alternative (e.g., gas-
fired) capacity, but implies a total cost of only about US¢ 3.2/kWh, well
below the gas option. The Mochovce plant consists of 4x440 MW units of Soviet
design. Incremental cost for the four units are about Kcs 29 billion, or US$1
billion, which correspond to US5500-600/kW. The plant is at an advanced stage
of construction with commissioning possible in 1992-95. A decision to
complete the plant is pending. A comprehensive safety audit being carried out
by CEZ will help determine the desirability to complete the Temelin plant as
originally planned (see para. 3.22).
3.45        Hydro Development.  The total share of hydro development
represents about 10% of the overall CSFR investment proQram, and about 1-2% of
the CEZ program. The plan includes the development of three major hydro
plants: Dlouhe Strane, 650 Ml in 1995; Gabcikovo, 2x360 MW in 1993-94; and
Zilina, 2x44 MW in 1998-99. It also foresees the development of a number of
small hydro plants of a total capacity of 30 MW. The Dlouhe Strane project
(600 MW) is well advanced and commissioning is expected in 1995. The
Gabcikovo project has been caught in a bitter dispute with Hunaary on
environmental grounds but is well advanced on the Slovak side and is likely to
be completed in 1995. The remaining planned hydro projects need to be
evaluated in the framework of the overall least-cost study to determine the
need for this capacity.
H. Electricity Pricing
3.46        The retail electricity tariff structure is complex (see
para. 4.07). While the structure of moat tariff categories reflects the costs
of supply in different pricing periods, tariff levels until 1990 did not keep
up with costs. Tariffs for industrial and other large consumers increased
only slowly, and the tariffs for households and other small consumers remained
constant in nominal terms since 1981, a decline in real terms. The tariff
levels for high-voltage and low-voltage consumers were about equ&l, a feature
that did not reflect the cost structure. This distortion worsened in the
price adjustments of December 1990 and April 1991, as industrial tariffs were
increased by 180%, but residential tariffs were left unchanged. The :.ncreases
of residential tariffs in October 1991 by 70% have diminished the gap, but
have not yet reversed the distortion: the new industrial tariffs of about US¢
5/kWh now compare to residential tariffs of about US¢ 3/kwh.  See Annex3.10U.



- 26 -
3.47        P-aliminary estimates of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of
electricity supply indicate that high-voltage consumers impose a marginal cost
of about USt 4-5/kWh on the system, a level which has been reached by recent
tariff increases. on the other hand, household and other small consumers
incur an LRMC of about US¢ 6/kWh, a level about double the present tariff.
Major tariff increases for umall and low-voltage consumers will be necessary
to approach marginal costs even slowly. This issue is being addressed under
the SAL pricing action plan (see para. 2.23). Annex 3.11 summarizes the LRMC
estimates, and Annex 3.12 illustrates costs and prices of coal.
I. Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.48        The Bank's overall objectives in Czechoslovakia are to support the
transformation to a market economy, increase efficiency, and improve the
environment. The SAL supports these objectives, as does this first Bank
investment project. The Bank's objectives in energy and environment is to
introduce principles of efficiency and economy that were not used in past
years under a centrally controlled economy; to reduce pollution and improve
public health; to rationalize the investment program under conditions of
decreasing or flat demand; to introduce financial profitability,
accountability, financial autonomy, and responsibility; to raise the level of
cr,ability at the management and technical levels by introducing modern
methodologies and technologies; to support government privatization plans; and
to diversify and increase reliability of energy supplies. This project
supports these objectives, and in particular, the immediate need to
rehabilitate and modernize power plants by using technologies that improve
efficiency on the very poor environmental situation in northern Bohemia, which
is causing Berious health problems in the local population and severe
environmental degradation. Also, the transmission component of the project
facilitates exchanges of electricity with neighboring countries, thereby
satisfying Bank objectives by bringing higher reliability and lower cost to
the interconnected system of Central Europe.
3.49        The general movement toward market oriented economiks is expected
to affect the energy sector in much the same way as other areas of trade and
technology exchange. Currently, the CEE countries have a significant
dependence on imports of energy from the Soviet Union. While this dependency
is most significant in terms of raw energy, in the form of coal, oil and gas,
there is a considerable dependency upon the Soviet Union for electricity
imports. This is reflected in the numerous ties, at 750,400- and 220-kV, from
the southern Soviet system to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and
Poland. Ties from the west, on the other hand, are limited to one HVDC tie
between Austria and Czechoslovakia and several AC ties to electrically
isolated areas. While limited cooperation already takes place between the CEE
and Western European (UCPTE) electrical systems, the political climate now
allows a more comprehensive assessment and consideration of a greater degree
of interconnection along with associated benefits to all parties. The CEE
countries (especially Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland) are in a
geographically strategic position relative to an increase in electrical energy
traIe between themselves, the former USSR and the western systems.
Consequently, the strengthening of interconnections, specifically to the West,



- 27 -
could have a considsrable and positive impact on health in both the CEE
countries and the Southern former USSR energy sector. This could make a
significant contribution to the continuing success of the reform processes.
Furthermore, the opportunities for wheeling are a potential source of foreign
exchange, albeit possibly in kind. A pre-requisite of strengthened
transmission ties to UCPTE is that of improved power quality and reliability
in the CEE systems. This is the near-term challenge; one of modernizing the
central and eastern European supply to the point where large-scale cooperation
with the weBtern systems will be practicable. A comprehensive study on East-
West electric power interconnection and trade has been proposed by the Bank
and others under the auspices of the Central and Eastern Europe Network for
Regional Energy (CEENERGY).
J.  Bank Activities in the Energy  ector
3.50        The Bank is in a unique position, based on experience elsewhere,
to assist CSFR develop a comprehensive energy strategy. To this end, the Bank
began its involvement in the energy sector in August 1990 (as described in
para. 1.08) and has discussed and reviewed with the government the Bank's
report on thf CSFR Energy Sector, Report No. 9768-CS (Gray Cover finalized in
January 1992). Moreover, the Bank can play a catalytic role in helping CSFR
integrate its energy system with those of Western Europe and in attracting
private sector participation. The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic rejoined
the Bretton Woods institutions in September 1990. The first operation from
these institutions was the 14-month IMF standby of SDR 620 million and
financing under the CCFF for SDR 484 million. A Structural Adjustment Loan of
US$450 million was also approved in 1990. Energy policy conditionality,
relating to energy pricing and regulatory policy, is a prominent part of the
SAL. Several energy studies have been agreed upon by the government, and are
planned to go ahead under grant financing. These include: (a) Comprehensive
Energy Study, (b) Regulatory and Institutional Reform of Power and Gas Sub-
sector, (c) Least-Cost Power Expansion Plan, and Long-Run Marginal Cost, (d)
Coal Sub-sector Restructuring, and (e) Gas and Oil Storage.
3.51        This proposed project is the first energy (and first investment)
project for CSFR, but it is seen as the first of a number of operations in
this sector covering both the Czech and Slovak Republics. The proposed
project comprises a number of high-priority investments, mainly environmental
in nature, that are ready to go ahead at this time. Other investment
proposals, notably projects in the gas sub-sector and for the Slovak power
sector, are under preparation. These will be brought forward as soon as they
are ready. The coal and petroleum sub-sect.rs may be the focus of future
energy loans, but certain questions must be first resolved, regarding the
implementation procedures under the Large Scale Privatization Law and
feasibility studies to resolve technical, environmental and other cyuestions.



- 28 
IV. THB ORROWER
4.01      The Borrower for the proposed Bank loan will be Czech Power
Enterprise (CEZ). The objectives, functions, organization and managemenit of
the borrower are summarized below.
4.02      Before July 1, 1990 CEZ was solely responsible for the supply of
public electricity throughout Czech Republic. CEZ was also responsible for
supplying district heating in Prague and northern Bohemia. In addition, the
CEZ corporate organization also included related research, manufacturing and
construction activities. After July 1, 1990 CEZ statutory responsibilities
were altered to include mainly construction and operation of power plants and
400-kV and 220-kV transmission lines and substations. Sub-transmission,
distribution activities and district heating were transferred to separate
independent enterprises with the exception of three co-generation power plants
which continue to supply district heating.
4.03      CEZ, an independent state-owned enterprise, has wide autonomy in its
operational, financial and managerial decisions. Its management is free to
hire and fire personnel, to approve annual budget and investment plans, and to
decide on imports and on domestic borrowing. The supervising agency of CEZ is
the Department of Electricity in the Ministry of Economic and Development of
the Czech Republic; while it does not interfere witn the company's day-to-day
operation, it appoints the General Director. It also approves the year end
accounts and, should needs arise, acts as mediator in disputes between CEZ and
other energy enterprises such as distribution companies. In addition, the
ministry reserves the right to approve CEZ's foreign borrowings.
4.04      By the end of 1991, CEZ staff numbered just over 31,000.  If the
restructuring and privatization program including the separation of CEZ's non-
electric generation activities will be implemented over next 3-4 years, then
the number of employees will be reduced to about 20,000. CEZ is currently
managed by a General Director assisted by four Deputy Directors, one each for
Generation and Transmission; Development; Economics and Trade; and Personnel
and Social Development. The present organization chart of CEZ is shown in
Annex 4.1. While CEZ's staff can carry out their tasks competently and
efficiently in the technical field, there is a definite need for improvement
in the field of corporate policy development, financial management, planning,
accounting, and personnel administration (including remuneration policies).
The need for improvements in these fields can be traced directly to the
absence of a market economy and lack of business-oriented management during
the previous decades.
4.05      Until recently, in CSFR, financial information was neither kept nor
disclosed on the basis of generally accepted accounting standards; basic
information derived from conceptually different accounting systems which have
been in existence in the country for decades. While a substantial amount of
information was collected according to the requirements of various local,
state, or federal regulations, there has been less emphasis on developing a
basis for management decisions; for budget preparation and control; for
general performance analysis, and those of cost and profit centers; for
financial planning; and for fund flow and working capital management. In
addition, as accounting and financial functions are spread among various units



- 29 -
within CEZ, coordination botween these units need to be otrengthened within a
framework of comprehensive corporate plan. Also, internal audit is limited
both in scope and content, and needs considerable strengthening (also see
paras. 6.01 and 6.02). Recognizing this need, the management of CEZ has
agreed that an appropriate action program should be undertaken to improve the
accounting and financial management system. Conceptual Terms of Reference
(Annex 4.2) have been agreed upon and the work will be undertaken in three
phases with the assistance of consultants acceptable to the Bank. Phase I
will include a diagnostic study with the objective of identifying and
recommending necessary actions for appropriate changes in the organization of
accounting and management functions, and of improving the accountina and
financial management information system. In Phase 1I the recommendations will
be reviewed with the Bank and, for the agreed recommendations, an
implementation plan will be prepared and will include the necessary training
and human resource development program. Phase III will be the actual
implementation of the agreed program. In particular, the work would cover:
general and cost accounting; capital and operating budgets; budget control and
analysis; development of coot and profit centers; short- and medium-term
financial planning; revenue and expenditure forecasts; cashflow and working
capital management; project evaluation; fixed assets management; and internal
audit and control. To address these areas, during loan negotiations.
agreement was reached that CEZ will carry out a diagnostic studv to: (a)
identify, evaluate and recommend measures to strengthen the companv's
financial manaaement caDabilitv including imRrovements to the Management
Information System and staff training: (b) develop an action plan for the
implementation of the recommended measures and present this plan not later
than March 31. 1993 for Bank review and comments: and (c) thereafter, taking
into account Bank comments. commence implementing the Plan. In addition. it
was agreed that not later than January 1. 1993. CEZ will establish an internal
audit section with oraanization. human and financial resources and terms of
reference, all accentable to the Bank.
4.06      Most of the electricity that CEZ generates is sold to distribution
companies and SEP on the basis of annually negotiated contracts. The annual
contracts set the bulk tariffs, inter alia, on the basis of the demand,
production costs, production mix, and investment needs.
4.07      Retail tariffs of electricity in CSFR are controlled by the federal
government. The structure is complex and includes about 30 categories, many
with multi-part characters. Tariffs generally are designed to provide signals
to consumers about different costs incurred at different periods of operation,
distinguishing between peak, shoulder and off-peak periods. These periods are
defined in terms of time of day as well as the seaeon to coincide with the
plant merit order in the load duration curve. Due both to changes in the
market during the last few years and to lack of appropriate tariff actions,
some of the tariff categories may not correspond to the cost differences
incurred. Also, tariff levels may not have kept up with costs and increasing
distortions developed between residential and industrial tariffs. The need to
diminish the distortion and to update the tariff structure to bring it in line
with costs is evident. A Tariff and Marginal Cout Study, together with an
Action Program to implement the findings of the study, is to be undertaken
under the SAL (para. 2.23).

companies retain about 20%-30% of the total retail revenues and about 70%-80%
is received by the generating and transmission company, CEZ. In order to
safeguard the financial viability of CEZ aareement was reached drina loan
neaotiationB that CEZ will: (i) furnish to the Bank. not later than November

V. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Obiective and ScoDe
5.01        The objectives of the project are to improve power plant
efficiency; to reduce air pollution in northern Bohemia, and thereby improve
the environment and health of the local population; to modernize the
transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection of the CEZ and German
power grids.  These objectives will be accomplished in the context of overall
reform of the energy sector.  To this end, the project will:  (a) reduce total
consumption of pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency
improvements; (b) curtail power plant SO2 emissions by means of flue gas
desulfurization; (c) reduce dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants; (d)
increase the reliability, efficiency, and economy of the CEZ transmission
system; and te) assist in improvinig investment planning and corporate
management and organization.
B. Project Description
5.02        The proposed project includes:  (a) installation of equipment and
operational improvements at Prunerov II power station and other large CEZ
power plants to reduce lignite consumption; (b) installation of flue gas
desulfurization equipment (FGD) at Prunerov II; (c) improvements and equipment
for dust collection, i.e., electrostatic precipitators at the worst polluting
CEZ power plants; (d) modernization of five 400-kV substations and
construction of a short 400-kV transmission line; and (e) consulting services
and staff training. The components of the project are described in more
detail below (and their location is shown in Maps IBRD 23371R and 23372R):
(i)         Plant Efficiency Improvement
5.03        Through a recent study on "Necessary Measures for Future
Mitigation of SO2 Emissions" from the power plants in CSFR, it has been
established that by means of small changes in operating practices and
installation of measuring devices, it is possible to increase the plants'
thermal efficiency and thereby reduce both the consumption of lignite and the
emission of SO2.  CEZ has already started a program for this purpose.  A
calculation made for the larger units, between 100-500 MW, shows that the
lignite savings could be estimated at 1.2 to 1.9 million tons/year.
5.04        The measures mentioned above will be supported under the project
by additional actions that are also aimed, directly or indirectly, cr control
pollution, namely: (i) the addition of equipment to measure the actual oxygen
content in the flue gases by installation of measuring devices; (ii) the
reduction of the air pre-heater leakage by improved mainterance and by
applying an improved central sealing system; (iii) the sealing of boilers,
flue gas ducts and the ESP casing; (iv) the training and education of the
power plant staff; (v) the installation of fine grinding and pre-drying
equipment for the lignite; (vi) the optimization of the start-up and shut-down
operation; and (vii) improvement of net heat rate of the power station through
reduced internal power consumption. (The current CEZ program for
environmental improvement does include installation of DENOX system, exchange
to low-NO, burners.) The costs associated with items (i)-(iii) and (v)-(vii)



- 32 -
are included under this subcomponent of the project. See Annex 5.3. Item
(iL) will be included in subcomponent D - Training and Consulting (see Table
5.1). The project will provide special monitoring equipment and training both
in CSFR and abroad for staff responsible for maintenance and operation of the
power plants included in the project.
(ii)        Flue Gae Desulfurization
5.05        Out of a total capacity of about 3790 MW planned by CEZ for
retrofitting by 1999 (see para. 3.03) the project will finance a total of
about 1050 MW at Prunerov II with state-of-the-art, high removal efficiency
FGD systems (wet-limestone process). According to an independent consultant's
report (referred to in para. 5.03), Prunerov II will achieve the lowest
cost/ton of SO2 removal, lower than the rest of the plants in the FGD program,
and is, therefore, being given the highest priority.
5.06        Prunerov II is the largest single source of SO2 emissions in CSFR.
The fuel used at Prunerov II is lignite of low calorific value (10.5 GJ/ton)
and high average sulfur content (1.7%). FGD retrofitting of Prunerov II is
the least-cost option to meet the CSFR emission mitigation targets
(para. 7.07).
5.07        At Prunerov II, five units rated 210 MW each will be retrofitted
with wet limestone FGD. The net reduction of S02 emissions at Prunerov II is
estimated at around 190,000 tons/yr. Based on the total S02 emission in CSFR
recorded in 1990 (2.67 million tons), the installation of FGD covered by this
project component will reduce emissions in CSFR by about 7%, and in relation
to the Czech Republic by about 10%. In Northern Bohemia,the most polluted
region in CSFR, the proposed FGD will reduce SO2 emissions by about 20%.
(iii)       Dust Control
5.08        The project also includes plant retrofitting with new
electrostatic precipitators (ESP) for effective dust control. This
retrofitting will be done at power plants and combined heat and power (CHP)
plants, which are not currently scheduled for retrofitting with FGD systems,
as the FGD systems will indirectly reduce the fly-ash to an acceptable level.
A total of about 1650 MW would be rehabilitated at the worst polluting units.
Through this project component, dust emissions will be . -uced from 400-450
mg/Nm3 to 50-100 mg/Nm3 (milligrams per cubic meter of dry gases at normal
conditions of temperature and pressure).
5.09        The project will finance ESP retrofitting of the following plants:
Pocerady           Unit  1,2 and 6   3*200  MW
Ledvice I                1            1*200  "

(iv)        Transmission System Improvement
5.10        An important part of CSFR's energy development program is
strengthening of interconnections with neighboring countries to enhance
electricity trade. Following the introduction of 400-kV high voltage
transmission, CEZ is in the process of gradually eliminating the 220-kV
network and enhancing its interconnections with neighboring countries. Given
the reunification of Germany, the alternating current (AC) connection to the
former East Germany will be discontinued, and a new interconnection will be
established to Bavaria through an alternating current-to-direct current
(AC/DC), back-to-back conversion station. The new interconnection will be the
second tie-line to the UCPTE network. Along with the existing interconnection
through Austria, it will facilitate further power exchanges, lower the cost of
service, increase reliability of supply, and help establish a unified and
competitive European market for electricity. Through this compcnent, the
project will finance:
(a)   construction of a 13.6 km sece.ion of 400-kV, double circuit
transmission line, to loop the existing Chrast-Temelin line into
the Prestice substation; and
(b)   modernization of five existing substations to reduce losses.  The
work includes installation of new 3¢O-MVA, 400/110-kV power
transformers and associate- switchgear and protection and control
equipment at each of the following substations: Prestice,
Sokolnice, Prosenice, Cechy Stred, ard Bezdecin.
(v)         Train!.np & Consultancy
5.11        Although technical training at CEZ is extensive with a number of
training schools, the level of training has not been kept abreast of the
technological developments in industrialized nations. Therefore, training is
needed in mode-n techniques of plant operation, maintenance, fuel eourcing,
and purchasing. Training in modern finance, commercial, and planning
techniques would require special emphasis owing to their long absence from
CSFR under a centrally planned economy. Such training will be supported under
the project. The project also includes about 35 manmontha of consultancy
services to assist CEZ in carrying out a comprehensive safety audit at Temelin
nuclear power station, under constructior

5.13         Nearly 70% of project costs are for actions directly related to
the environment -- reduction of S02 emissions and control of dust.  US$249.0
million are for the FGD installations, yielding an estimated unit cost of
about US$237 per inBtalled kW. This unit cost is reasonable for high-
efficiency S02 removal installations, based on recent experiencing in CSFR and
neighboring countries. The cost of ESP and transmission and substation
equipment was estimated on th& basis of recent procurement of similar types of
equipment in CSFR. Physical contingencies were estinated at 10%. Price
contingencies are based on the assumption of a 4.9% escalation of foreign
costs in 1991-95 and 3.7% thereafter. The escalation of local costs was
assumed to be 34.4% in 1991, 8.8% in 1992, 6.7% in 1993, 4.4% in 1994, 3.8% in
1995, and 3.4% in 1996. Detailed project costs are given in Annex 5.1 and a
break-down of the cost of the FGD installations is given in Annex 5.2.
5.14         The proposed Bank loan of USi246 million would finance 100 % of
the foreign exchange cost of the project, i.e., 44% of the total cost.
Interest during construction, taxes and duties, and any other local costs
would be financed through CEZ internal cash generation and local loans.

5.15         The loan would be made directly to CEZ for fifteen years,
including five years of grace. The loan would be guaranteed by the federal
government. CEZ would bear the foreign exchange risk.
D. Proiect Prenaration
5.16         The technical and economic preparation of the various components
of the project have been advanced to a satisfactory degree, although not all
components are at the same level of preparation. The FGD components have been
prepared by local consultants (Chemopro4ekt) and the bidding documents have
been largely completed. Bidding documents are scheduled for distribution to
interested bidders atarting in early 1992. In addition, an experienced
consultant was recruited by the Bank to study the overall FGD program and to
recommend a long-term leact-cost strategy for sulfur removal based on
efficiervcy and rccnomny ( occ para. 5.03).  fliu report wan nubmittvd irn July
1991 and is part of the project file. The plants to be retrofitted with ESPn



- 36 -
under the project have been identified (see para. 5.09). The transmission and
substation component has been prepared by local consultants (Energovod) to an
advanced degree of detail. Project preparation is, for the most part,
satisfactory; no delays are anticipated stemming from the lack of adequate
project preparation.
E. Proiect Implementation and CgpLtXugjILn Schedule
5.17        The preparation of des.gn and rrocurement packages for most
project components is well advanced. An implementation schedule has been
established for each component and subcomponent, according to which all
components will be completed by the end of 1996. The schedule allows for
anticipated delays in the procurement process that may be experienced owing to
the novelty of Bank procedures for Czechoslovak authorities. The preparation
of bidding documents has started; thus, CEZ would be in a position to sign a
contract shortly after loan-signing. The FGD-technology must be imported, and
it is foreseen that foreign companies will be responsible for implementation.
However, the skilled and experienced local manufacturing industries will
probably do all site preparation and construction of parts of the equipment.
Similarly, Czechoslovak companies have already established cooperation with
foreign companies to produce ESPs under license. Therefore, significant local
contribution to this component is expected. Although the pressure to install
FGD systems is high, ample allowance for the necessary procedures and possible
delays in construction time has been made. Similarly, the implementation
schedule for the transmission and substations components are staggered from
1992 to 1996 to accommodate both the availability of financial and human
resources and the electric power system growth. The following contract
packages are planned for the principal project components:
FGDs
A single responsibility turnkey contract covering engineering
design, project management and coordination, and supply, erection
and commissioning. A two-step bidding procedure will be followed.
Transmission Line
Supply contracts for:  ;_el towers, conductors and hardware,
shied wire, and insulators.
Ubsta-tions
Supply contracts for the five substations in the project.
Plant Efficiency Imorovement
Supply contracts for this component will be mostly plant specific
and will be developed as each plant is identified and evaluated.



- 37 -
The project is scheduled for completion by December 31, 1996. The
loan closing date is expected to be June 30,1997. A summary implementation
schedule is shown in Annex 53.
5.18        The supervision "f construction of the proposed project would be
performed by CEZ through Chemoprojekt and Energovod. CEZ, Chemoprojekt and
Energovod are adequately staffed with experienced personnel in project
construction supervisioni and management. The mission reviewed the
capabilities of CEZ, Chemoprojekt and Energovod and found them satisfactory.
5.19        The novelty of procuring equipment under Bank guidelines poses a
special challenge to CEZ and may be critical in project implementation. The
technical specifications of the proposed equipment are well known to CEZ from
past experience and no difficulty is anticipated in preparing the needed
documentation.
F. Environmental Considerations
5.20        The project will undoubtedly bring about a substantial improvement
of the environment in the northern Bohemia region, which is regarded as one of
the most polluted regions in the world and part of the so-called Black
Triangle. As such, the overall impact of the project will be strongly
positive. In accordance to the Bank's Operational Directive 4.00, Annex 4,
"Environmental Assessment," this project has been ranked as level B, taking
into account the project's positive impact on the environment.
5.21        The total environmental benefit from the proposed installations
would be a reduction of about 218,000 - 235,000 tons/yr of S02 and about
36,000 tons/yr of fly-ash. Depending on the specific meteorological
conditions in the area where the power plants are located, the positive effect
from this reduction would be effective even during the worst inversion
incidents. Since the emissions occur at specific spots, the project will have
considerable local impact and be of the greatest importance for the
improvement of the environment and living conditions.
5.22        The additional amount of waste generated by the FGDs at Prunerov
II is calculated to be about 30% of the current waste volume. Taking into
account that the additional waste consists mainly of gypsum (CaSO4), which is
not regarded as hazardous, the disposal problem will be hardly affected by the
proposed FGD and ESP installations. The additional fly-ash from the more
efficient ESPs is estimated at about 0.2-0.3% of the current ash amount
collected, which is a minimal incremental impact. As a result of Decree No.
166 issued by the Czech Republic Government May 15, 1991, the ash must be
disposed of from 1997 in the mined out excavated area of the open pit-mine DNT
Nastup and in a way that the ground water resources are protected from further
contamination fronm the ash. In the meantime, the ash and gypsun will be used
to stabilize existing ash-ponds by mixing the ash with the overburden. The
coal-mine organization (DNT) has officially agreed to the disposal of a
mixture of ash, waste water and gypsum to stabilize the overburden deposits,
st arting from t1ue very beg,inning of operation of the FGD syrtem nt Prnnerov
II.



- 38
5.23        The existing water supply is ample enough to support the
installation of planned FGDs at Prunerov II without crowding out other users.
The wastewater discharge from the FGD system is not expected to create any
environmental problems since the transport of the ash is performed
hydraulically and the water discharge from the FGD plant will be used as make-
up water for the ash-transport system.
G. Procurement
5.24        A concerted effort is being made to familiarize CEZ with the
Bank's procurement procedures and Sample Bidding Documents, copies of which
have been provided to CEZ. A prc-urement seminar was conducted in Prague in
the week of April 8, 1991. It was well attended by CEZ and other potential
borrowers. Follow-up seminars are planned early in the procurement process.
5.25        All works, equipment and materials to be financed from the Bank
loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement of Equipment." Goods manufactured in Czechoslovakia procured
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB), would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price or the prevailing custom duty
applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove
that the value added to the product in Czechoslovakia exceeds 20% of ex-
factory bid price. All ICE bidding packages estimated to cost $250,000
equivalent or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation. Other contracts would be subject to ex-post review in
accordance with the guidelines. Consulting services to be financed from the
loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants." All documents relating to procurement of consulting
services would be subject to the Bank's prior review.
5.26        Procurement arrangements are slimmarized in Table 5.3.  ICB would
be used for the FGD packages (US$311.3 million), dust control installations
(US$75.0 million), transmission line (US$4.5 million), substations (US$46.9
million), and most of the contracts for plant efficiency improvement (US$101.3
million). For items of a proprietary nature or where compatibility with
installed equipment is required, direct contracting would be applied.
International shopping, based on at least three price quotations from at least
two countries, would be used for items of small value and having an estimated
value of up to US $200,000 equivalent each, with an aggregate limit of US$10
million. Installation services for dust control equipment and the
transmission line and substations, and plant efficiency improvements would be
provided locally and would not be financed by the Bank.

H. Disbursements
5.27        The proceeds of the loan would finance up to 100 percent of the
eligible direct foreign expenditures for goods, works, services and training,
as well as up to 100 percent of the eligible ex-factory costs of locally
procured goods. Disbursements would be against Statement of Expenditures for
eligible expenditures under equipment and material contracts valued at
US$200,000 or less. Supporting documentation for these expenditures would be
retained by CEZ for at least one year after receipt by the bank of the audit
reports for the year in which the last disbursement was made. The
documentation would be audited by independent auditors and be made available
for review by bank staff upon request. The annual audits would include a
separate opinion on this disbursement made under the Special Account (SA) and
Statements o4 Expenditure (SOE) procedure. All other expenditures would be
fully documen'ed.
5.28        To facilitate disbursements, it is proposed that the borrower
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, a USDollar (or any freely convertible currency) denominated SA. The
amount deposited would represent about four months of projected Bank
expenditures (US$16 million). The depository bank and currency of the Special
Account will be communicated to the Bank for its approval before opening the
account. The Special Account will be replenished on a timely basis not to
exceed every four months or when the balance of the SA is half the initial



- 40 -
deposit, whichever occurs first. Documentation for replenishment of the SA
would follow the same procedure as in para. 5.27. In addition, monthly bank
statements would accompany replenishment requests. The minimum size
replenishment request acceptable to the Bank will be about 10 percent of the
initial deposit. Modalities concerning the use of SOEs and SAB were agreed to
at negotiations.
5.29        A detailed disbursements schedule is provided in Annex 5.4.  The
Bank's disbursement profiles do not include FGD projects, and disbursement
experience with CSFR is limited.
I. Retroactive Financing
5.30        Up to US$0.750 million of the loan proceeds would be disbursed for
retroactive financing of the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant Audit Study. Work on
the study started in July 1991 and is being carried out by CEZ with the help
of foreign consultants. This provision will allow CEZ to make disbursements
for the study and apply for reimbursement as soon as the loan becomes
effective.
J. Risks
5.31        The main risks associated with the project are:  (a) deterioration
of CEZ' financial condition as a result of adverse macro-economic developments
caused by delays such as major changes in the internal reform process; and (b)
implementation delays due to CEZ being a first-time borrower. It is
reasonable to expect that the government authorities will continue on their
present course of political and economic transformation. So far, the
stabilization program has been successful with low inflation rates and sound
budgetary policy, but certain federal and republic responsibilities are still
being worked out. Since the project is entirely within one republic and given
the technical configuration of the electro power system and joint dispatching
operations, there are likely to be minimal effects on the project due to
changes in inter-republic relationships. Also, CEZ' financial performance is
believed to be adequately safeguarded through the proposed covenants (para.
8.01). The proposed close supervision of the procurement process is likely to
ensure smooth project implementation. Therefore, the above risks are
considered to be manageable.

VI. FEIANCIAL LASECTS
A. Accountina and Auditina Framework
6.01      Due to the characteristics of the centrally planned economic system,
in the past, accounting in Czechoslovakia differed significantly from
internationally accepted norms. By and large, accounting practices havs aimed
more at external reporting for statistical and regulatory purposes rather than
on providing financial information for decision-making, which is required from
the management of commercially-oriented enterprises. Consequently managers
and staff of the various enterprises were not adequately trained and
experienced in generally accepted accounting methods and, more important, in
financial management. Internal auditing was more of a verification process,
restricted to checking the use of approved budgets and compliances with
regulations. Financial and management audits by outside, independent
auditors, the type found in most of the market economies, did not exist. Even
the verification of compliances with regulatory requirements, usually was
carried out by "peer" audit type of process or by special investigations
carried out by appointees of the Ministry of Finance or other line ministries.
6.02      Both the federal and the state governments have recognized that
international standards in accounting and auditing legislations, institutions
and practices are vital for meeting the objectives of the country's economic
reform. Gradual improvements are being introduced through establishing
compulsory audit requirements. Parallel with this, basically to support the
government's privatization program, the companies are being gradually
requested to and trained to disclose financial information by use of generally
accepted accounting principles. The balance sheets, income statements and
other financial reports of a growing number of companies are now based on the
generally accepted accounting principles. Financial information is
increasingly being adapted to Western practices with the aim of improving
commercial control, bettering commercial performance, and increasing
usefulnese for outside investors as well as for internal management. Also,
the increasing number of accounting firms of international repute, which are
preaently opening offices in the country with trained accountants and
providing on-the-job training to local professionals, are also instrumental in
the introduction of internationally accepted accounting systems.
B. Pe-t Financial Performance
6.03      During the last two years, drastic organizational changes were
introduced in the power sector, re-grouping the production, transmission and
distribution functions, and changing the hierarchial-relations of the various
entities considerably. one of the effects of the changes was that the
enterprises' activity profiles were altered, largely destroying the
possibility of historic comparisons of physical institutional, or financial
performances. This, combined with the frequent changes in evolution in the
accounting practices, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
reconstruct historical financial statements of the power enterprises tor
meaningful comparisons or as basis for projections. Even if this could be
done, the usefulness of such information for analyzing current and future
performances would be substantially mitigated by the fact that the entire
centrally planned economy of the country is changing to that of a market



- 42 -
economy. The consequent structural changes will have drastLc impact, for
example, on the demand for energy, rendering the historical data for
projections largely meaningless.
6.04      Due to the organizational and structural changes in the economy
referred to above, the pre-1991 financial information has little relevance for
developing an analysis for future financial performance or for providing
direct comparisons. Nevertheless, an overview of the pre-1991 financial
situation is presented in the following paragraph, details are in Annexes 6.1
and 6.2.
6.05      Historically, CEZ was the largest electricity supplier in the
country.  Electricity oaleB during the last three years were about 52.6 GWh
per annum, providing over 90% of CEZ's operating revenues. Between 1987 and
1990, the company's operating revenues increased by 23% from 24.5 billion KcB
to 30.2 billion Kcs; while during the same period, operating expenses
increased by 32% from 19 billion KCB in 1987 to 25 billion Kcs in 1990.
Between 1987 and 1990, annual net operating incomes varied between 5.0 to
5.7 billion Kcs and CEZ' annual profits (after income tax) were between 1.1 to
1.7 billion Kcs, representing about 5 to 7% of the total revenues.
Historically, the borrowings of CEZ were modest; the company did not inherit
any substantial long-term financial debt from earlier years. The debt/equity
ratios, between 1987 and 1990 were around 20:80; the sizeable investment
programs were largely financed from internally generated funds and capital
contributions. However, the reported operating results are somewhat
misleading. Since 1962, the fixed assets of CEZ have not been revalued on an
appropriate techno/commercial basis. Consequently, the asset values in the
balance sheets are non-representative and the annual depreciation costs
charged against the operating revenues are too low to permit the companies to
accumulate sufficient funds for replacing the assets at the end of their
useful life.  Therefore, durina loan neaotiations, aareement was reached with
CEZ that the company's fixed assets will be revalued by June 30. 1994 and that
the revaluation will be in accordance with methods satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Financial Projections
6.06      One of the objectives of the project is to safeguard the financial
stability of CEZ while ensuring appropriate power-generating capacity. In the
past, the cost of investment programs and inflationary or real cost increases
were not necessarily concurrent with appropriate adjustments in retail and
bulk tariffs. The lack of cost recovery often led to undesirable reliance on
government funds in the forms of operational subsidies or non-economical
investment support. Any undesirable reliance on government funds should be
avoided in the future by assuring adequate operating margins and cash
generating capacity for CEZ. The financial targets (para. 6.10) aim to ensure
this.



- 43 -
6.07      Based upon the projected power generation, transmission and
distribution levels for the next 7 years, financial forecasts were prepared in
constant (1991) values. The projections reflect future operations including
those associated with the proposed project as well as with other action plans,
investment programs, and renewals, all aiming at capacity and efficiency
improvements. In order to assess the extent of fund generation and the
various actions that may be needed to ensure the financial stability of the
company, the projected revenues are based on October 1991 tariffs plus future
adjustments that the government is preparing to introduce in 1993. Costs,
while varying with the power generating mix and with the level of projected
supply, are also based on 1991 values. The sensitivity of the forecast
performance to changes in costs and revenues have been tested (para. 6.11). A
summary of the forecast assumptions is in Annex 6.3.
6.08      Between 1992 and 1998 the operating revenues of CEZ are expected to
grow by some 31% from 49 billion Kcs to 64 billion Kcs. The bulk of the
revenues would derive from supplying electricity: 93% of it to the
distribution companies, 3% to SEP, the Slovakian Power Company, about 1% to
large industrial and commercial customers, and about 3% for export. The
importance of the sale of heat will remain constant, between 3%-4% of total
operating revenues during the next seven years.
6.09      Operating expenses are expected to increase by 46% or 12.4 billion
Kcs between 1992 and 1998. The largest single cost item will remain the cost
of fuel, representing some 39% of the 1998 operating costs. Depreciation,
while increasing from 13% of the 1992 operatinig costs to 21% in 1998, iB Still
considered to be too low as fixed assets have not been revalued since 1962.
Due to its fairly modest past borrowings the company's interest payments will
remain relatively low, representing no more than 12% of the 1998 net income.
Corporate tax payments are forecasted at 56% of the net operating income or
about 18% of the operating revenues. Taking into account both the operating
and non-operating revenues and expenses, taxes and other obligatory payments,
CEZ, during the forecast period will have regular net profits in the order of
8 to 11 billion KCB. As for its liquidity, between 1992 and 1998, CEZ is
expected to generate regularly from its operation funds at a level of about
50% of its total revenues or on the average, about 60% of its investment
requirements. Detailed projected financial statements are shown in Annex 6.4.
6.10      From the point of view of operation, the forecast profitability is
considered satisfactory. Also on account of the proposed project and CEZ's
investment program, the forecasted (internal) cash generation is sufficient.
Nevertheless, to ensure the timely availability of funds and to provide a
cushion for possible delays in future revenue adjustments to offset cost
increases and to ensure the company's continued financial stability, durinq
negotiations, aareement was reached that CEZ will take all steps necessary to
maintain (i) annual ratios of cash operating costs to operating revenues not
more than 0.6 from 1992: (ii) from 1992. internally Qenerated annual cash
surpluses not less than 40% of the (3 vears movina averaael canital
expenditure incurred and : (iii) debt service coverace (internally aenerated
cash surpluses in relation to servicino lona term borrowina) not lower than



- 44 -
.0 in 1992 through 1994. 3.5 in 1995 and 2.2 in 1996 and thereafter. The
progress towards achievina the annual taraets mentioned (i) and (ii) above
will be monitored on a semi-annual basis and if it ap eared that using a
combination of actual and prolected data the achievement of the annual taroets
would lag, CEZ would immediatelv take all recessarv remedial actions to ensure
achievement of the annual targets. I addition. agreement was reached that
CEZ will forward to the Bank each year, not later than 5 months after the end
of its financial year. annual financial statements audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank together with the auditor's report on. inter
alia. la) the financial statements: (b) the operation of all accounts
including the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure (SOEs): and (c)
the eligibility of withdrawals made on the basis of SOEs for reimbursement by
the Bank. Also. aoreement was reached that CEZ will forward to the Bank every
year, by March 31. its investment program together with the financing plan
covering the next five years.
6.11      The major financial risk that could adversely affect CEZ' capability
to support the proposed project and maintain its financial viability could be
adverse macro-economic conditions. For example, if due to economic recessions
the distribution companies would have difficulties in collecting revenues from
their customers and therefore, in turn, to pay CEZ in a timely manner for the
electricity purchased, or if due to inflation the real values of the
contractual bulk tariffs would erode or adjustments to maintain the revenue
levels in real terms would be delayed and/or be insufficient to match cost
increases, CEZ' financial strength would be eroded. For example, a 10%
increase in cash operating costs would reduce annual profits by about 7%. To
offset such a negative impact, revenues would have to be increased by about
5%. Similarly, if revenues from electricity were to be about 10% lower than
forecasted, without commensurate cost reductions, profits would be reduced by
about 20%.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
7.01      All project components are justified as the lowest cost option to
meet the required objectives. The Prunerov II plant will be utilized ae an
integral part of CEZ base-load generation and will be required under all
foreseeable demand scenarios. None of the project components is an investment
in expansion of system generation. Moreover, the preliminary CEZ overall
investment program, which includes proposed investments under the project,
yields an overall internal rate of return of 13% to 17%, under low and high
demand scenarios, respectively. A consultant's report "Necessary Measures for
Future Mitigation of SO2 Emissions," July 1991, confirmed the selection of
Prunerov II and benefits of plant efficiency improvements.
7.02      Desulfurization and Dust Control Investments.  As described in
Chapter III, the environmental conditions in northern Bohemia are very poor,
resulting in severe impact on the local population's health and expected life
span, causing severe degradation of forests, acidification of water bodies and
streams, and economic losses to agriculture. It is clear that some measures
must be taken to improve the existing conditions quickly. Air pollution in
Notthern Bohemia is a localized problem caused mainly by the large
concentration of power plants burning local, low cost, high sulfur lignite.
Least-cost analysis demonstrates that retrofitting with FGDs at Prunerov II is
the lowest cost, most practical and timely solution as alternative options are
clearly more expensive, as described in the following paragraphs.
7.03      The available options to achieve an externally mandated objective of
emission reductions while maintaining power supply in line with projected
demand are: (i) shutting down of a number of heavily polluting plants and
replacing the supply by electricity imports into the CEZ system; (ii)
switching the operation of the existing boilers to gas, a cleaner fuel; (iii)
switching to low-sulfur imported coal for at least the periods of severe
atmospheric inversion conditions; and (iv) retrofitting suitable plants with
flue-gas desulfurization equipment. Annex 7.1 summarizes the comparative
costs of all the system options.
7.04      Option (i) is already being partially implemented to alleviate
atmospheric pollution during the worst atmospheric inversions, utilizing the
gas-fired Vojany plant in eastern Slovakia to make up the shortfall. However,
to go further and shut down major facilities immediately would deprive the
system of needed capacity that could not be removed without decreasing the
reliability or service and increasing the imports of electricity that are
estimated to be more costly (close to US¢ 5/kWh compared to about US¢ 4-
4.6/kWh for lignite in general, including the cost of environmental safeguards
and about US¢ 2.8-3.8/kWh at Prunerov II). The new CEZ nuclear capacity, now
scheduled to come on-line gradually in the years 1995-1998 at a cost of about
US¢ 3.2/kWh, will enable the retirement of some old, polluting units that are
not scheduled for retrofitting.
7.05      Option (ii), i.e., switching to gas, would entail shutting the
boilers for a period necessary for retrofitting. This would incur Additional
capital cost for the boiler modifications and additional safety facilities,
and would depend on adequate oupplies of gas. These would depend, in turn, on
the construction of new transmission facilities and on secure, long-term



- 46 -
contracts for the supply of gas. The preliminary analysiS indicates that the
economic incremental cost of continued generation from lignite including FGD
retrofitting at about ¢4.0-4.6/kWh iB well below the incremental supply cost
from new gas-based combined cycle plant at similar load factors (¢6-8/kWh) and
somewhat below tl.e cost range of supply from converted plants. In addition,
the gas-based cost does not include gas transmission investments: the
lignite/FGD option appears clearly preferable at this time.
7.06      Option (iii) must depend on the availability of imported coal with a
low sulfur content. Assuming that it would be possible to obtain coal with a
sulfur content below 1%, this option will still require the installation of
FGD equipment to meet the target of 400 mg/Nm3 dry gas as an emission level.
(Without FGD, the use of available low sulfur coal ^would result in emissions
of > 2000 mg/m3). In addition, provisions would have to be made for
transporting large quantities of coal to the power plants now burning lignite
from nearby mines via dedicated transportation systems. The cost of
generation based on imported low-sulfur coal at about 44.1-5.2/kWh, plus the
necessary transport investments, would be higher than the cost of lignite
including the investment cost after FGD retrofitting.
7.07      In conclusion, the FGD retrofitting of 1,050 MW lignite-fired
capacity at Prunerov II (at about US$240/kW) is the least-cost, practical, and
timely solution to the pressing need for quick improvement to air quality
conditions in that region and a major step in a program of reducing air
pollution. The present value of investment and recurrent CostB of the
retrofit is significantly lower than that of the import alternative, even at a
power import price lower than that currently available from the former USSR.
By the same token, it is lower in cost than the options of using low-sulfur
coal, or of converting to natural gas. As the LRMC of lignite supply to
Prunerov lies well below the weighted average LRMC of lignite in northern
Bohemian mines, the incremental unit cost of maintaining generation of
Prunerov after retrofitting is only about US¢ 2.8-3.8/kWh (,Anpex 7.1).  Thus,
this solution takes advantage of the low cost domestic lignite produced from
mines adjacent to the Prunerov plant.
7.08      The project will retrofit several power plants with ESPB for
effective dust control (para. 5.09). The reduction in dust emission will be
75% to 90% (see para. 5.08) which iB clearly justified to improve health and
improve the environment. Annex 3.5 documents tne severe health problems from
dust, which will be improved following installation of ESPs.
7.09      Plant Efficiency Improvements.  Simple cust benefit calculations
demonstrate that investments of US$81 million for plant efficiency
improvements would achieve lignite savings of 1.2 to 1.9 million tons/year
(para. 5.03), which is equal to about US$20 to 40 million/year in fuel cost
savings. This results in internal rates of return greater tnan 20% for this
component.



- 47 -
7.10      Transmission and Distribution.  The project components for
transmission and distribution constitute needed extensions and reinforcements
to an existing system that, in ivost cases, allows little flexibility of
choice. The configuration of the existing system requires the addition of
transformer stations and high-voltage transmission and subtransmission lines
to increase system reliability and flexibility for optimal dispatch, and to
reconfigure the transmission network for new capacity location and links to
Western Europe.
7.11      A CEZ least-cost analysis of the optimal high-voltage transmission
investment strategy has established that it is more advantageous to replace
the aging 220-kV system by direct transformation from 400-kV to 110-kV.
Assuming the same projected system load for the alternative strategies of (i)
reinforcement and rehabilitation of the 220-kV system, and (ii) replacement of
the 220-Kv system by 400/lln-kV, all demand scenarios yield a lower present
value for the replacement alternative. The substation and transmission line
components of the proposed project are part of this strategy.
7.12      Internal Rate of Return on Preliminary CEZ Investment Program.
Given the need for retaining retrofitted thermal capac;.ty, the preliminary 10-
year investment program of CEZ for 1991-2000 was evaluated to estimate the
internal rate of return on the overall investment program.
7.13      Investment expenditures, operating Costs, and fuel costs are
expressed in terms of international costs or border price equivalents.
Distorted domeatic cost figures have been re-estimated to approximate
international cost levels, while maintaining the real cost differentials such
as labor costs.  Benefits are defined as (i) the sales to consumers that are
made possible b; replacing or rehabilitating old generating capacity, by
retrofitting remaining lignite capacity with FGD, and by maintaining
transmission and distribution capacity, and (ii) net fuel savings from the
capacity replacement and from the replacement of heat-only boilers by
repowered combined heat and power facilities. Essentially, new nuclear
capacity now in an advanced state of implementation is seen as replacing old
nuclear and lignite-fired units that are being retired (see para. 3.44 and
Annex 3.9). The remaining thermal units are assumed as being rehabilitated,
converted to CHP, and retrofitted with flue gas desulfurization, if justified.
7.14      The individual components of the proposed project are integral parto
of the larger power sector investment program. The CEZ program, in its
preliminary optimized form as evaluated above (para. 3.43, base case
investment scenario), hae an internal rate of return of about 14%, based on
tariff levels as proxies for program benefits (_nex 7.2).  Sales to consumero
are valued at the 1992 tariff levels averaging about KCs 1.34/kWh
(US04.8/kWh). The preliminary program, relyii.g on retirement of old thermal
plant, retrofitting remaining thermal plant with environmental safeguards,
conversions to combined heat and power operations, and completing the Temelin
nuclear plant in the mid-1990s, appears sound. In addition, the analysis
indicates that tariff levels are adequate to re+Covci2 .n  :ciiiit.ai ivllntVdwent in
the 1990s.  If the high-investment scenario is imblmnbA, hut dcitnnd



- 48 -
development unexpectedly follows the low demand scenario (see para. 3.36), the
overinvestment in new and rehabilitated capacity during the early years
depresses the internal rate of return of the program to about 13%. The risk
of overinvestment, therefore, is not great enough to render the overall
program infeasible. If a pronounced and sustained low-demand scenario would
become likely, the CEZ strategy would be to delay some of the lumpy investment
packages, such as the completion of new nuclear capacity. A delay of the
investment in Temelin completion, either for financial reason6 or as reaction
to slower demand growth, would increase the IRR to about 15-17% (Annex 7.2).
In either case, however, there is no question that the retrofitted Prunero, II
plant would be retained in the future. The components of the proposed project
appear in all scenarios as parts of the optimized system investment program.
The agreed leapt-cost investment study will form the basis for a firm
optimized long-term investment program.

(f) will revalue CEZ's fixed assets by June 30, 1994 (para
6.05);
(g) will take all steps necessary to maintain annual ratios of
cash operating costs to operating revenues not more than
0.6 after 1992; internally generate annual cash surpluses
of not less than 40% of the capital expenditures after
1992; debt service coverage not lower than 5.0 in 1992
through 1994, 3.5 in 1995 and 2.2 in 1996 and thereafter

months after the end of the financial year, annual
financial statements audited by independent auditors
(para. 6.10); and
(i)  will forward to the Bank for review by March 31 each year
the investment program along with the financial plan
covering the next five years (para. 6.10).

CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUJBLIC
POWER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Energy Pricing Policy Portion of SAL
1.          An integral part of becoming an efficient market economy is
letting energy prices reflect the costs of energy. Czechoslovakia's economy
is two to three times more energy-intensive than Western European economies,
due to (a) low energy prices and central energy allocations; (b) the emphasis
on physical targets and the lack of market incentives to improve efficiency;
(c) the emphasis on heavy industries; and (d) the use of outdated equipment.
Inefficient energy use and the heavy reliance on high-sulphur coal and lignite
have also been major pollution causes, especially in Northern Bohemia.  Many
..sidential energy prices are too low, and the structure of energy prices is
distorted, strongly influenced by the low CMEA prices. Virtually the entire
petroleum and natural gas needs and about 7 percent of electricity needs have
been met through imports from the USSR under bilateral arrangements.
2.          Pricing Policies.  The Government's medium-term goal is (a) to
deregulate all prices for oil, oil products and coal, and allow free imports
and exports of these products; and (b) to establish an autonomous regulatory
process for utilities (electricity, heat, and natural gas), whereby tariffs
will be set equal to economic costs. Tariffs for tradeables (e.g., coal) will
be set equal to international prices plus transportation, storage and
distribution costs, with automatic pass through of changes in international
prices; and tariffs for non-tradeable goods and services (e.g., electricity
and heat) will be set equal to long run marginal costs (including production/
generation, transportation/transmission, and distribution costs), passing
through changes in input fuel prices based on an automatic fuel adjustment
clause. All energy products shall be subject to the Value Added Tax (VAT)
when it is established   Additional consumption taxes on transport fuels will
remain in place. The Government is also considering to charge additional
environmental taxes on coal, and possibly on some other fuels (e.g., gasoline,
diesel, and fuel oil). All environmental costs related to the production,
transportation and distribution of energy shall be borne entirely by the
enterprises causing the damage, and be covered by tariffs and prices whenever
they are regulated. During an initial transition period prices and tariffs
will be progressively adjusted towards economic cost levels. Increases shall
be made in such a way that the relative structure of prices for different
types of consumers reflect the relative structure of estimated economic costs
to avoid inefficient inter-fuel substitution.

Annex 2.2

3.          Progress to date.  Prices for oil and petroleum products were
increased in July, October, and December 1990, reaching the equivalent of
US$30 per barrel of crude oil at the then prevailing exchange rate of Kcs 24
per US$1. Import price changes for oil and oil products will be passed
through on a monthly basis. Bi-annual revisions of transport and distribution
costs, to take into account inflation and other cost changes, will enable the
Government to adjust these prices as appropriate. Taxes were changed from an
ad-valorem (330 percent over previous prices) to a specific rate, so as to
have stable government revenue and to limit the increase in consumer prices to
the increase in ex-refinery prices. Taxes are high by international standards
and produce nearly 5 percent of GDP in budgetarv revenue. At the current
exchange rate of Kcs28 per US$1, ex-refinery prices are equivalent to US$26
per barrel; should international prices continue to decline, the Government
may be advised to increase taxes slightly.
4.          Following the energy price increases in December 1990, most energy
sales to industry are now close to their economic cost, with the exception of
heat. Fuel coal (steam coal and lignite) prices for industry were increased
by 50 percent to levels around 60-80 percent of equivalent international
(border) prices. Electricity and natural gas tariffs for industry were
increased by 53 percent and 143 percent, respectively. In March 1991, the
Government and the Bank conducted jointly a preliminary review of estimated
long-run marginal costs of electricity supply. It was found that electricity
tariffs for industry (and other large high-voltage customers) and for
households amounted to about 90 percent and 50 percent of estimated LRMC
respectively. The Government increased industrial electricity prices in
April 1991, which will raise high-voltage prices to about 100-130 percent of
estimated LRMC. This is the reverse of the efficient pricing structure that
would be indicated by LRMC.
5.          Action to be taken and supported under the SAL for Energy Pricing.
Prior to the second tranche release, significant steps towards the preparation
of a least-cost investment program for the electric power sector were
completed. On the basis of this study a suitable pricing study will be
developed. Average tariffs for industrial customers will be at least equal to
their calculated long-run marginal cost. Tariffs for household consumers wire
increased by about 70% as compared to May 1990 price levels.1 These changes
result in a narrowing of the distortions between industrial and household
tariffs.
1 The price was increased by 70% on October 1, 1991.

ANNEX 2,l3
CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
POWER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Energy Regulatory Portion of SAL
Action to be taken and supported under SAL for regulation of
utilities. Utilities in charge of supplying electricity, heat, and natural
gas to consumers enjoy natural monopolistic powers and thus require some type
of governmental supervision, though not operational control. A system of
"economic regulation" shall be put into place, whereby the companies'
financial soundness and operational autonomy will be assured, but at the same
time preserving the qualit) of service provided and the rights of consumers.
Health, safety, and environmental impact shall also be regulated through this
system. The government will prepare and review with the Bank a plan of action
for establishing regulatory institutions, processes and methods for the power,
heat and gas. A Public Utilities Law would establish the legal predicate and
procedures for economic regulations of enterprises which produce, transport,
and distribute electric energy, natural gas, town gas and thermal (heat)
energy. The law would define the scope of regulation; the procedures for
implementing the legislation; and the structure, powers and jurisdiction of
the regulating bodias. The draft law, after review with the Bank, will be
submitted to Parliament prior to third tranche release. Their first
assignment will be the adoption of a code of regulations, that would define
the procedures to be used to establish and update tariffs and to monitor
operations of the regulated utilities, as well as the system of accounts and
reports to be used by such enterprises. The regulating agencies will also
codify regulations for the protection of public health, safety, and the
environment.

Total capacity equipped with FGDs:  ,720 HE
Although Prunerov II FGDs are amply justified, the overall plan is subject to
the results of the ongoing Least Cost Development Study.
During the former communist government, decision was made to install FGDs
equipment at the PPs Pocerady and Tusimice II. In the latter case, an
unproved technology based on the Magnesite process was installed by the
Soviets. They had based the technology on a system aeveloped in the US; but
due to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the transfer of technology from
the US was stopped. The result was that the installed system at PP Tusimice
II never worked, and today the equipment is regarded to be unable to operate.
In the case of Pocerady, the first unit is just under construction and is
supposed to be in operation during 1993 based on the wet-limestond process.
At the plant Tisova, a FGD system based on dry injection of limestone is under
construction. In this case, the plant was chosen by the German utility that
transferred surplus FGD equipment to CEZ as a gift.

1.1 Production  p1hdte                       Cal energy by means
oi luel combustion - eower and healtinc Ilants
The   maximum   amount   of   emissions  discharged  into
atmosphere during luel combustion  in energetic, company's and
municipai  power and  heat plants  in order  to produce steam,
heat and electrical energy is determined by emission limits
given under this paragraph.
D)uring fuel combustion in order to produce steam, heat or
eiectrical energy in power and heat plants the emission limits
for contaminants selected according to paragraph 2.2 do not
apply.
When other types of solid or liquid fuel than fossil fuel
and fuel derived (bituminous coal, brown coal, lignite, coke,
wood, luel oil and heating oil) are burned in boilers
installed in energetic, company's and municipal power and heat
plants, the limits for emission from refuse incinerating plant
must be observed (see paragraph 3.19).
1.1.1 Combustion of solid luels
1.1.1.1 Limits for solid particle emissions on new plants
- Orn boilers running on solid fuels having a heat performance
over 5u MW tne weight concentration oi solid particles in
the waste gas must not exceed 100 mg/mB.
- On  boilers  running  on  solid  fuels  and  having  a  heaL
output in the range from 2 to 50 MW the weight concentration
must not exceed 250 mg/m9.
1.1.1.2 Limits for sulphur dioxide emissions on new plants
- On boilers running on solid fuels having a heat output over
300 MW.r the weight concentration  of sulphur dioxide  in the
waste gas must not exceed 500 mg/m3. If this value cannot be
achieved without waste gas desulphurization, the emission of
sulphur dioxLde must be reduced to  a level that will not be
higher thar. 15% of the ir.itial level.
On boilers running  on solid fuels and having  a heat output
ir. the ranoe arom 50 to 3u'J MWT¶,the weight concentration of
sulphur  dioxide  in  the  waste  gas  must  not exceed 1700
mg/ma. If this value cannot be achieved without waste gaH
desulphurization, the sulphur dioxide emiseion must be
reduced  to a  level that  will not  be higher  than 30  of
initial level.
- On  boilers  running  on  solid  fuels  and  lhaving  a  heat
output in  the range from  5 to 50  MW.V the sulphur  dioxide
weight concentration  in the waste gas  must not exceed 2500
mg/m3.
- In case of failure of the equipment to limit the emissions
the combustion equipment can be operated only if the failure
period does not exceed 96 continuous hours and 360 hours in
total during a calendar year.
1.1.1.3 Limits for oxides of nitrogen emissions on new plantu
on boilers ru;lning on solid fuelB having a heat output
over 5 MW the concentration of oxides of nitrogen recalculated
to nitrogren dioxide  NO2 in the waste gaR  must not exceed 650

Dama  2n Effects of Air Pollution on Human Health and Forests
A.        Health Status of lnhab!tants
1.        Environment is composed of external factors which decisively
influence human health.  In comparison to other countries, the health status
of CSFR inhabitants is unsatisfactory, and the North Bohemian Region is
especially problematic. The environment there is characterized by a high
level of air pollution resulting from power plants and open coal mines. Thus
the most polluted areas are the "coal-basin counties", Chomutov, Most,
Teplice, Usti n.L. and part of Decin, which are particularly affected during
the winter season, November through March.
2.        There is a smog warning and control system operated in the region,
which can help to minimize acute impacts on health, but it cannot have a
positive influence on long-term negative impacts on the health of the
inhabitants. Data will be presented below for the following: average life
expectancy in the CSFR and comparisotn of the CSFR with other countries;
mortality ratec in coal-basin counties compared with other counties in
Northern Bohemia; decailed mortality rates for Teplice and Most counties;

3.        The most frequent causes of death are cardiovascular diseases (54%
in 1987) and oncological diseases (21%). Together these diagnoses represent
75% of all the causes of death. The standardized rate of mortality due to
cardiovascular and oncological diseases in the North Bohemia Region and the
coal-basin counties is the highest in the Czech Republic and has remained
stable. The gravity of this situation is particularly apparent in the rate of
premature mortality, that is between 20 and 65 years, or the productive age
(see Figs. 21-22). The standardized mortality for inhabitants of the region
inL 1980-1985 is statistically significantly higher than the rate for CSFR
inhabitants as a whole (10% for men, 13% for women). This is also the case
for premature mortality.

4.        The 1987 statistics on the health status of children from the coal-
basin counties are particularly alarming. Two thirds of all diseases studied
in children of pre-school age living in these counties were reported as
occurring at a higher rate than in the Czech Republic as a whole. The
greatest differences are found for the following diseases:

B.
1.        Roughly one third of CSFR territory (33.3% of the Czech Republic and
39.9% of the Slovak Republic) is covered by forests. Forest growth is
influenced by air pollution as well as climate and other natural phenomena.
Nearly all forest on state territory is significantly affected by gaseous
pollutants and both wet and dry deposits of harmful substances, in the form of
acid rain, fog, snow and ice. Even the impact of short term exposure to
harmful substances cannot be ignored, particularly at peak concentrations, for
example during inversions, when S02 concentrations can reach levels of several
mg/mi3.

The sicuscion is especially critical in the Ore Mounrains, on che borders of
BohoeiA and Germany, in the North Bohemia Region, where there Is tlle greatest
a.iount of industrial and mining activity. At che highest elevations, the
forest, primarily spruce, is dead or dying snd the damage is spreading to
other regions. It is probably the most serio.us degradation of forest stands
on the European continent.

Ambient Air Quality in the Surroundings to_EPK Tusimice
Background
1.   The EPK Tusimice consists of the four power plants Prunerov I, Prunerov
II, Tusimice I and Tusimice II. They are all located in a very small area
with a distance of less than 6 km between any of the plants. The area is
located in the NW part of the Northern Bohemia Region and is part of the coal-
mine counties within the North Bohemia Basin, which covers the counties
Chumotov, Most, Teplice and Usti nad Ledem. The basin is surrounded by the
mountains Krusne Hory, Dupovske Hory, Ceske Stredohoi and Decinska Vrchovina.
The topographical conditions create specific meteorological situation
resulting in a comparatively high frequency of inversion incidents and ponr
dispersion opportunities. Due to the high emission levels from the actual
power plants the ventilation should be good, but unfortunately the existing
topography prevents this essential ventilation, and instead creates a very
severe situation with regard to the ambient air quality.
Occurrence of Inversions
2.   An attempt to evaluate the frequency of inversions during the year 1989-
1990 has been done by the Fuel Research Institute. Their findings are briefly
mentioned below. The year is divided in the following periods of
meteorological conditions:
A Good Dispersion.   Well ventilated conditions and no build up of high
ambient air concentrations.
B Impaired dispersion conditions during half the day. Inversion
situation will remain for half a day, normally from the early morning
to noon.

6.   The tables emphasizes the severe situation in the Northern Bohemi.a Region and
specifically in the coal-mine counties, where the ambient air quality is over the
acceptable level 150 pg/M3 for more than 10% of the time.
7.   During July 1991 Energoprojekt together with the Czech Hydrometeorological
Institute did a study of the ambient air quality in the nearest region to EPK
Tusimice before and after retrofitting the power plants Prunerov I, Prunerov II, and
Tusimice II with FGD equipment. The study shows that retrofitting will achieve a
substantial reduction of the mean annual value. The maximum concentration during 30
minutes is shown with isolines and the difference with or without FGDs is extremely
obvious (see Attachment ).
8.   The relation between alnual loads (mean value) on the territory for the
alternatives are as follows:
Current situation                                                398 pg/rT3    100.0%
FGD at PP Prunerov l and Tusimnice II                            197 "           49.5%
FGD at PP Prunerov I, Prunerov II and Tusimice II                110             27.6%

9.    As the emission from the PP Prunerov II is larger than the total emission from
the PPs Prunerov I and Tusimice II, the resulting effect afterf retrofitting only PP
Prunerov II should be at least a reduction with 50% in the surroundings. The levels
shown above should be compared to the acceptable mean value in accordance the
existing hygienic standards which is 150 ug/m3.  In reference to this value it is
obvious that further installation of FGD equipment is necessary at the remaining
plants Prunerov I and Tusimice II.

CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
POWER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Nuclear Power Investment Program
1.          The nuclear program is by far the largest p&rt of the overall
investment program. It envisages the completion of the two 1,000-MW units at
Temelin (Pressurized Water Reactors of the Soviet VVER - 1000 model) in the
Czech Republic, the completion of four 440-MW units at Mochovce (Pressurized
Water Reactors of the Soviet VVER-213 model) in the Slovak Republic, and
additional investments for the decommissioning of the two early 440-MW units
at Bohunice (in the Slovak Republic) starting in 1995 and thi construction of
a centralized facility for the storage of nuclear spent fuel. At Temelin,
about Kcs 12,900 million has been spent so far and an additLonal Kcs 55,300
million is required to complete construction. Future expected costs are, at
an exchange rate of Kcs 28/UF$, equivalent to US$1,975 million. Taking into
account the total capacity of 2000 MW, this amounts to about US$990/kW.
Assuming that this figure is correct, it is not clear that discontinuing
construction and substituting the two 1000 MW units with another technology
would be economically preferable, since alternative technology would be equal
or more expensive. The overall cost of the plant, as estimated by the CEZ
management, seems low compared with international experience. However, if one
takes into account that a large portion of the cost is due to civil works and
labor, wlhich in Czechoslovakia have been priced low, the estimated cost is not
surprising. Construction at the site is proceeding with the first unit about
60% and the second about 40% complete. Also, the Temelin management has
decided to replace the instrumentation and control (I&C) system of the plant
with western technology and bids were rece5ved on April 15, 1991 from six
international suppliers. The cost of the .&C system, estimated at about
US$120 million, has been taken into account in the future cost estimates.
2.          The Mochovce plant, at which 4x440 MW units are under
construction, is at an advanced stage of implementation. About Kcs 16,500
million have been expended and an additional Kcs 29 billion is expected to be
invested for plant completion now scheduled for 1995. Again, the remaining
cost is equivalent to about US$1,000 million which, for a 1760-MIW plant,
correspcnds to a unit cost of US$588/kW. It should be noted that the Mochovee
plant management has also contracted with a major German firm for the
upgrading of the instrumentation and control equipment at the plant.
3.          If we apply the same cost rationale as for the Temelin plant, we
conclude that the planned complction of the Temelin and Mochovee plants, which
will add about 3760 MW of capacity, is an economically justifiable component
of the investment program, provided that demand development justifies this
glUscity. The added capacity (scheduled as follows: 440 MW in 1992; 440 MW
in 1993; 440 MW in 1994; 440 MW in 1995; 1000 MW in 1995 and 1000 MW in 1996)
will enable Czechoslovakia to retire an equivalent capacity of old and air
polluting units (both lignite and nuclear), sustain the production of adequate

electricity for the needs of the economy at reasonable cost, and reduce the
dependei.ce on imports. (It might be possible to make available a certain
amount of electricity for export to the interconnected European electricity
network).
4.          The Czechoslovak power authe_ities had included earlier additional
nuclear units: two additional 1000-MW units at Temelin and new power plants
at other identified sites. These plarts are currently not included in the
investment program owing to the forecast slow demand growth due to the new
economic conditions in the country, the perception of serious deficiencies in
the Soviet designed reactors, the financial constraints, and the heightened
awareness that pressing issues such as safety upgrades, plant decommissioning,
and a comprehensive plan for low-, medium- and high-level radioactive wastes,
must be solved first. In addition, the work on eivanced, simplified,
standardized, safer reactor designs, now proceeding by several international
consortia, mandate that any plans for new nuclear plants must be postponed
until after the year 2000. The existence of separate investment items for the
likely decommissioning of Bohunice units 1 and 2 and the establishment of
spenb fuel storage facilities indicates that th. Czechoslovak power
authorities are serious about confronting and solving the complexities of
their nuclear-power program. Future new generating capacity will have to be
selected from a number of options (gas combined cycle, nuclear, etc.), using
least-cost criteria.

POWER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJJCT
Electricity Pricing and CEZ Marginal Cost
Main AssumptionB for Mar1inal Cost Estimates
The preliminary estimates of LRMC use the following simplified assumptions:
(i)   The demand forecast for the CFZ grid has been taken as the most
recent central scenario within the range of demand projections,
indicating a dec-line of overall demand for several years (decline in
industrial consumption, modest increase in residential consumption),
followed by slow growth in the outer years of the ten-year period.
(ii) A "no growth" investment program was developed, essentially based on
the replacement or rehabilitation of existing generating capacity,
utilizing mostly work in progress and retrofitting/repowering. A
maintenance of existing levels of available capacity was achieved by
replacing the retired capacity in Northwest Bohemia (lignite) with
the commissioning of the nuclear capacity at Temelin, and the
repowering of remaining lignite-fired steam plant for combined heat
and  power.    Environmental  expenditures  were  represented  by
investment in flue gas desulfurization, spent nuclear fuel disposal,
and decomnissioning.   Some additional hydro capacity for pumped
storage was included. This preliminary investment program needs to
be updated and revised in the light of new forecasts as they become
available.
(iii) i"*<ee basic costing and pricing periods are established:   peak,
uhoulder, and off-peak. These periods include both the aaily and
seasonal fluctuations in the load curve. Because of the different
operating  character,stics  of  the  marginal  plant  during  these
periods, the generating plant fuel use as well as the system losses
in the grid are valued differently for each pricing period.
(iv) Marginal cost of energy is estimated from incremental fuel use and
operation/maintenance expenditures. LRMC of capacity was primarily
established as A'verage Incremental Cost (AIC), representing the
ratio between the discounted investment and discounted MW streams
for the decade until 2000. As very little tradeoff between base-
load capacity cost and peak fuel cost is involved, this simplified
method is sufficient for a first estimate.

Marainal capacity cost:  the investment cost necessary to maintain peak
generating capacity in the system while providing for essential environmental
measures, includes the remaining cost of pumped storage hydro plant,
rehabilitation of remaining thermal plant, ash disposal, and FGD. Sunk CostB are
not taken into account, as the investment program is being re-optimized on the
basis of incremental costs only, within the framework of radical economic reform.
The low CEZ scenario is used.
/  If the opportunity cost of lignite (i.e. cost equivalent per GJ of
imported coal minus penalty for higher sulphur content of lignite) is
used, the fuel cost amounts to $1.70/GJ or Kcs 48/GJ, implying a
fuel cost about 40% higher than that used in this preliminary
estimate. However, if the production cost of the more efficient lignite
mines (US$0.60/GI) is used, the fuel cost decreases by about 50%.

Tariffs and Marginal Cost
Tariffs valid in early 1992 provide for multi-part tariffs for larger
consumers, and simpler one- or two-part tariffs for residential and other small
conBumers. Typical tariffs for high voltage consumers consist of a monthly KW
charge of about Kcs 254-302, plus a three-part energy charge per kWh ranging from
Kcs 0.66 to 1.19, according to the pricing period. The average revenue per kWh
obtained from such consumers on the basis of this tariff amounts to about Kcs
1.23-1.75. This compares to a hypothetical marginal cost-based revenue for an
MV consumer with about 50% load factor, 70% coincidence, and mostly shoulder
period consumption of about Kcs 1.20/kWh.  It is evident that, even if marginal
capacity cost estimates are underestimated, MV consumers' tariffs are fairly
close to LRMC levels.
On the other hand, end-1991 average revenue from householQ consumers
amounts to about Kcs 0.85/kWh, ranging from 0.30 to 1.70.   The LRMC-based
hypothetical revenue from a comparable LV consumer with a, say, 40% load factor
and high coincidence would amount to about Kcs 1.60/kWh, about double the current
price. A lower load factor of, say, 20% would result in a cost of Kcs 2.00/kWh,
Significant price increases are planned for 1992/93 to approach LV marginal cost
levels.
Conclusions
The judgements at this point are qualitative, and the numbers employed
represent an order of magnitude. More precise estimates have to be made when
more detailed information on investment costs, demand forecasts, and consumer
':haracteriatics are available.
Notwithstanding the imperfect cost figures entering into the analysis, the
following p-eliminary conclusions can be drawn:
(i)   After the December 1990 and April 1991 increases in the tariffs of
industrial high-voltage consumers, the price levels for thekse
consumer categories are approximately equivalent to their category-
specific LRMC levels, and are unlikely to need substantial increases
in real terms to reach economically sound levels.



- 95 -
ANNEX 3.11
Page 5 of 5
(ii) The tariffs of residential consumers, are well below their LRMC
levels, reaching a maximum of 50% of LRMC. Significant increases in
the prices for these consumers will be necessary to come closer to
LRMC.
(iii) The main issue concerning power pricing is the inefficient relation
between high-voltage and low-voltage price levels, i.e. an
increasing distortion of the price structure. While the prices of
residential consumers have been increased by 70% (and current
government proposals call for further increases only in later 1992
and 1993), the prices for industrial and high-voltage consumers have
risen by almost 200%. This pricing strategy has created a reversal
of the optimal cost-related structure, making high-voltage
consumption significantly more oxpensive than low-voltage.   This
imbalance needs to be rectified by further price increases for the
residential categories which should be both more frequent and higher
than those for industrial/commercial consumers. Social hardships in
the implementation of this strategy can be mitigated by introducing
a modest first block of monthly kWh consumption at below-cost
prices, to protect the affordability of essential minimal
consumption levels ("lifeline rate"), with the remainder of the
consumption priced at cost.
(iv' In the medium term, financial needs of the power supply companies
are likely to require even greater price increases than would be
mandated by LRMC considerations. In pursuing this aim, care needs
to be taken to increase the price levels of low-voltage consumers,
to contribute to a steady reversal of the distorted pricing
structure.

Coal Prices and Costs
Present Domestic Coal Prices
1. After the December 1990 and Hay 1991 price increases, the present situation
of domestic prices for coal in the three major market segments is as follows:
Lignite for Power Plants.   The present a    ge price for ligi&..Le
delivered at the power plant is 340 K/t, or 12$/t. En a heat basis,
this price amounts to 1 $/GJ, or 60X lower than the price of heat in
imported steam coal (Tables 2.1 and 2.2). If the plant operator has
to cover the cost of desulphurizing the flue gas when using lignite,
and considering further the lower efficiency of using lignite, the
present lignite price is about 30X lower than the cust of imported hard
coal.
Coking Coal for Steel Plants.  The present average price for coking
coal delivered at the steel plant is 1,470 K/t, or 53 $/t. This price
is approximately in line with international coking coal prices.
Lignite for Small Consumers.  The present average pri-E for lignite
delivered at households and other small scale consumers is 600 K/t,
or 21 $/t. On a heat basis, this price amounts to 1.3 $/GJ, or only
57X of the cost of imported hard coal.
2. Other coal types account for only about 10 of the coal market. They include
primarily hard coal for power plants and small consumers, but also processed
coal, in the form of lignite briquettes and hard coal coke, for small consumers.
On a heat basis, hard coal for power plants is presently priced at 1.0 $/GJ, or
372 of import cost. To small consumers, hard coal is sold at 802 of the hard
coal price to large consumers.   In line with their higher production costs,
processed coals are sold at higher prices. However, these prices are still below
the cost of production.
Coal IMoRQt Costs
3. Czechoslovakia currently imports some 5 million tons per year of steam coal.
Current imports of coal come from Poland and former USSR. Both these suppliers
have a locational advantage. However, the future availability of coal from these
sources is uncertain, given the economic changes underway in both countries.
The Polish coal mining industry, being base in the same coal basin as the
Czechoslovak hard coal mines, and subject to similar pressures due to rising real



9. 7 -
ANNEX 3.12
costs and concern with the environment, is likely to undergo substantial
contraction in the coming years.  Coal from the Americas, Auscralia, South
Africa, or even East Asia, landed at North Sea or Baltic Sea ports and
transported through Germany or Poland may become a competitive source of supply
if the transport infrastructure is able to handle the volumes required. Other
possible routes, in the longer term, are via the Yugoslavian port of Rijeka on
the Adriatic Sea and then by rail to Czechoslovakia, and from the Black sea up
the Danube through Romania, Yugoslavia and Hungary to Bratislava.
.. The current border price is still determined by the border price of Pdlish
and Soviet coal. Assuming 10 S/t transport cost from Katovice to Gdansk, and 3
$/t from Katowice to Czechoslovakia (Ostrava) this would be $43/t (50-10+3).
However, Polish coal may soon cease to be a significant determining factor. Based
on data provided by VUPEK, transport costs for alternative overseas coal landed
at North Sea or Baltic Sea ports and transported to Czechoslovakia by rail or
barge on the Elbe river, are estimated to be in the 12-18 $/t range, with the
lower and upper estimates being for rail transport through eastern and western
Germany, respectively. Given the economic changes underway in Germany, these
estimates have to be revisited in any study of coal pricing. More information
is also required on the technical feasibility of coal transport on these and
other routes, including availability of stockyards and coal handling equipment.
Assuming a North Sea delivered steam coal price of $50/t and a transport cost to
Czechoslovakia of 15 $/t,a price of 65 $/t in Czechoslovakia would result. This
price has been used to determine the economic cost of coal in Czechoslovakia
(Lii-)  .
Lignitg ORnorrunity os
5. Determination of lignite opportunity costs requires analysis of the economics
of the power system, in particular the least cost loading order of generating
plant. Technical parameters of lignite-fired power stations are designed around
the characteristics of the lignite supply (e.g. calorific value, ash and sulphur
contents, ash fusion temperature) and are located close to their source of
lignite supply. If technical parameters do not permit much variation in cosl
quality, alternative sources of coal are not a feasible fuel supply alternative.
Consequently, direct market-based pricing of lignits, in a situation where mines
and generating plant are already in place, is not possible.l
6. In such cases, it can be shown that the economically efficient price of
lignite from a given mine lies somewhere between the cost of production of the
mine and the opportunity cost of lignite. To determine the opportunity cost it
would be necessary to analyze the combined costs of each joint lignite mine and
power plant complex.   The opportunity cost of lignite from a mine then is
determined by the cost of generation at the next more costly plant.

7. A hypothetical example is shown below for the case where the highest cost
generating plant is running on imported steam coal costing 2.0 $/GJ (the current
approximate price of Polish steam coal). The plant merit and loading order is
determined by-their respective long run marginal costs, including the cost of
lignite. The opportunity cost of power generation at the highest cost lignite

-fired plant is determined by the cost of generating more energy at the hard
coal-fired plant. Consequently, the opportunity cost of lignite is determined by
the cost of imported fuel. Adjustments would be made for the higher capital and
operating costs for lignite based power plants, including costs for necessary
flue gas desulphurization.  The appropriate price for lignite from the mine
attached to the Lignite I power plant lies in the 1.1-1.6 $/GJ range. Similar
reasoning leads to a price range of 0.7-1.1 $/GJ for lignite from the Lignite II
mine.
8. In a free market economy. determination of the position of the actual lignite
price within the marginal cost/opportunity cost range would result from the
bargaining process borween the mine developer and the power generator, who must
sell his output to the electricity grid at a competitive price, while following
environmental regulation. In the Czechoslovak situation, the price determination
would likely be a matter of Government regulatory policy.
9. In Tabie_ a hypothetical opportunity cost of lignite for power plants has
been estimated on the assumption that in a first stop the heat contained in
lignite is valued at the cost of heat contained in imported coal from overseas
sources, and that then deductions are made from the lignite price f3r lower
efficiency of lignite in combustion and plant capacity utilization and for
covering the extra cost of flue gas desulphurization which is required f.r
Czechoslovakian lignite but not for imported coal
Production Costs
10. Present average production costs are 8.7 $/t, or 0,7 $/GJ, for lignite, and
47.2 $/t, or 2.0 $/GJ, for herd coal (Table 3)2. These are financial costs as
reported, without detailed analysis. Lignite costs range from about 6 to 33 $/t,
or from 0.5 to 2.6 $1GJ. About 80 % of the lignite is mined at costs not higher
than 10 $/t, or 0.6 $/0J. There are two lignite mines at Prievidza which produce
at costs equal to or higher than the estimated cost of steam coal imports from
overseas sources (2.5 $/GJ). Czechoslovakian hard coal production costs range

from about 35 to 90 $/t, or from 1.3 to 4.2 $/GJ. Four mines in the Ostrava
region and one mine in the Kladno region have production COStS higher than the
estimated cost of steam coal imports from overseas sources.
11. Only relatively minor increases for input prices to coal production will
cause many mines to become uneconomic. This is in particular the case for the
Ostrava and Kladno hard coal mints and the Prievidza lignite mines. Some input
price increases may be compensated by productirity increases and cost reductions
at the mines. Based on the experience of similar mines in western Europe, it is
likely that only very few underground mines can remain competitive in che long
run, despite the productivity increases and cost reductions.
12. For firm decisions on mine closures, more detailed analysis is needed of
production costs, in particular future cash operating costs on a sunk cost basis,
markets, transport and other infrastructure, distribution costs, environmental
impact, and development potential of the mines concerned. Such analytical work
could be executed by local institutions separately for each of the six regional
group of mines.

Draft Terms of Reference for Accountina and
Financial Management Information Systems Studv
Obiectives
1.    As a result of the new laws on enterprises and accounting regulations
supporting the government's policy to restructure the economy, the Czech and
Slovak enterprises will have to carry out changes in their organization,
accounting systems and financial functions.  CEZ therefore wishes to carry out
the appropriate changes in the organization of accounting and financial
management functions and to improve the accounting and financial management
information systems.
Scope of Work
2.    The study should cover CEZ's organization, and in particular, the
following areas:
(i)         general and cost accounting;
(ii)        project cost estimation, monitoring and control;
(iii)       annual capital and operating budget preparation;
(iv)        budget monitoring, control, and analysis of variances
between actual and planned performances;
(v)         cost/profit center performance monitoring;
(vi)        short-term (up to 1 year) and medium-term (up to 3 years)
financial planning and management including preparation of
detailed revenue and expenditure forecasts, cash flow
forecasts (monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual);
(vii)       medium- and long-term receivables and payables management;
(viii)      working capital management; and
(ix)        internal audit and control.

financial functions between different units;
(ii) data and information collcction and processing
practices and procedures;
(iii) types of analyses performed and reports prepared for
external reporting to government and other agencies
and for internal use in the organization;
(iv) existing staffing levels and skills;
(v)   existing electronic data processing capabilities
including hardware and software.
(b)   Based on discussions with the relevant management and staff,
identification of the informational needs of the various levels of
management and staff; and
(c)   Identification of alternatives to be considered for examination in
Phase II.
Phase II. _Design and Installation

POWER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Notes and Assunitions for Financial Prolections
1.    All projections are in constant 1991 values.
jncome Statements
2.    The sale of electricity is projected on the basis of expected
macroeconomic situation throughout 1998. It is assumed that: (i) total demand
for electricity in short-run will drop by about 9% from 1991 to 1993 mainly
because of restructuring and ownership changes in the industrial sector, and
(ii) export/import is the result of surplus/deficit after meeting domestic
demand. CEZ has signed a contract to export 910 GWH per year to Italy through
1997.
3.    Station consumption, transmission and distribution loses are assumed to
stay at a similar level as 1991.
4.    The average revenues per KWH from 1992 to 1998 are forecasted on the
basis of 1991 year end tariffs plus 60% domestic tariff increase in 1993.
5.    In forecasting the revenue from the sale of heat, the level of sale
corresponding to the 1991 year end reorganization and the 1991 year end tariff
were used.
6.    Other operating revenues include revenues from activities in
construction, engineering and research and development.
7.    Fuel expenses are estimated on tha basis of current structure of usage
in production and current purchase prices: 827 Kcs/t for hard coal and 4436
Kcs/t for heating oil, in parity with international prices. Transportation
costs are included in the "other operating costs".
8.    Depreciation is calculated according to the permissible rates set by the
Ministry of Finance:
Buildings           - 4.0%     Heating and steaming pipes - 3.3%
Transmission lines - 5.0%      Transformer station          - 5.0%
Boilers             - 6.0%     Substations                  - 6.0%
Steam turbines      - 4.0%     Nuclear reactors             - 5.0%
9.    Other costs of operations, including wages, water, transportation,
administrative costs and fines for environmental pollution etc., are
forecasted on current level, commensurate with production levels.

Page 2 of 2
10.   Interest payments related to other than the Bank's loans are calculated
by assuming 10% annual interest rate, 10 year repayment period with 3 years
grace period.
11.   Tax rate is assumed to stay at current level (about 56% of net profit).
12.   Calculation of IDC (not financed under the Bank's loan) is on the basis
of 7.8% annual interest rate, 0.75% rate for commitment fee.
Balance Sheet
13.   Projection of fuel and other stock levels are based on past experience,
and related to production needs at 1991 price level.
14.   Accounts receivables are estimated on the basis of current schedule of
collections from distribution companies. Each month the distribution
companies pay CEZ 85% of electricity delivered in four installments, the
balance is paid after four weeks.
15.   Projection of account payables schedule (including trade and investment
accounts) is assumed at the current (about two weeks) level.
Fund Flow Statements
16.   Capitalized interests are included in borrowing and investment.

Power Sector Investment Options with Pollution Reduction
I. Economic Cost of Continued Lianite Use With Environmental Safeguards
Lignite energy content: about 11.13 MJ/kg
Large power plant fuel use: about 12-13 GJ/MWh
International opportunitv cost:
EEC importers' CIF price early 1991 for low-sulphur (less than 1%) coal: about
$1.70-2.00/GJ.
t   S/GJ
NW Europe CIF price May 1991 for low-S, 6,000 kcal/kg steam coal: 44    1.76
Additional freight to CSFR:  about            21    0.84
Total at CSFR consumer:                       65    2.60
Adjustment for high sulphur content:  usual discount about 15-20% for coal
with 0.5 percentage points higher sulphur. Assume CSFR lignite at least 1
percentage point above international steam coal, therefore reduce by 35%:
Si.70/GJ
Mar nal cost:
Domestic marginal cost of lignite production: about $1.20/GJ delivered to
consumer. (At efficient surface mines: about $0.60-1.00/GJ.)

II.  ElectricitymISorts
The paBt arbitrarily low export and import prices of electricity within
Eastern Europe have now been changed to prlces based on market considerations.
The current price of importing from the USSR at high voltage is ASL 4.8/kwh.
Imports from Western Europe (even before the necessary investments in
transmission reinforcement) are likely -to be available at similar prices.
III. Low-sulfur Coal Xm prts
As the lignite-fired thermal plants in NW Bohemia are equipped to handle
low-quality lignite, no major plant investments would be necessary to handle
higher-quality, low-sulfur (less than 1%) coal. Import options are:
(i)   Overseas imports through NW Europe (US or South African coals)
available at about US$1.80/GJ CIF and about US$2.60/GJ delivered
at the plants.                                                     0
(ii)  Polish coal (subject to capacity constraint):  available at about
US$45/t (USS1.80/GJ) FOB Baltic ports. Rail transport cost from
Polish mines to NW Bohemia generating plants may make Polish coal
available there at a similar price, if such transport capacities
can be made available.
Based on the current fuel efficiency of the generating plants (12-13 GJ/MWh),
the fuel cost of imported coal alone would be in the range of US¢ 2.3 -
3.4/kWh output.
FGD equipment has to be installed even with lower-sulfur coal use (to
reach the target of 400 mg/m3 dry gas), but the higher-quality coal allows a
lower-cost solution, say US¢ 1.0/kWh. O&M would add about 1 0.8/kWh. Total
incremental cost of using imported coal would then be USt__4.1-_52/kWh. Non-
marginal investments in rail or barge transport would have to be added.

(ii) Conversion of existing lignite plant to gas
Fuel conversion of existing lignite fired boilers to natural gas firing
is technically feasible without derating.
Major items of design modifications are as follows:
(a)   adjustments and modifications in heating surfaces in furnace water
walls, superheaters and reheaters, if necessary;
(b)   additional provision of gas firing facilities and gas burners;
(c)   explosion proof facilities;
(d)   modifications in control equipment including purge interlocks; and
(e)   modificiations in fire fighting facilities, etc.
Significant reduction in auxiliary power consumption is obtained.
(Auxiliaries for lignite facilities and ash handling equipment ae not used).
(Existing forced and induced draft fans can be used for gas firing boilesj.
Environmental emissions will be reduced:
(a)   NOX:  100 to 200 ppm for conventional gas burners, 50 to 100 ppm
for low-nox burners;
(b)   S02:   0
(c)   Dust:  0
Cost for the modification of the existing lignite fired boilers to
natural fired boilers is estimated to approximately 35% of new gas fired
conventional boilers (about US$300/kW), subject to confirmation of various
local conditions.
Capital cost: US¢ 1.3/kWh
O&M cost:      USC 1.1/kWh
Fuel:          assume lower efficiency, say 9,000 Btu/kWh
Fuel cost US¢ 2.4/kWh

The comparison indicates that (i) the completion of the nuclear plants under
construction for base load operation is economically attractive, and (ii) the
retrofitting of the remaining lignite-fired plant. with FGD and other
environmental safeguard. is a competitive option for non-base-load system
operation: the incremental cost per kWh in at the lower end of the range of
options much as power imports, change to low-sulfur coal, or boiler conversion
to gas firing.

generate from the existing lignite-fired plant. From 1996
onwards, the alternative to FGD retrofitting is imports from
the USSR or the Went at US¢ 4-5/kwh, while retiring Prunerov II.
1/ With a lignite opportunity cost of S1.70/GJ (equivalent to the cost of
an alternative fuel) rather than the marginal cost of $1.20/GJ, the PV
of Prunerov II operation rises to US$707 m. With a mine-specific LRMC
of lignite of about US$0.80/GJ, it falls to US$520 m.
