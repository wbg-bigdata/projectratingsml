PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
NATIONAL FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2156-PH)
PREFACE
This  is the Project Completion Report  (PCR)  for the National
Fisheries Development Project in the Philippines, for which Loan 2156-PH
in the amount of US$22.4 million was approved on May 25, 1982.  Effective
November 12, 1986, the loan amount was reduced to US$2.1 million. The last
disbursement was made on December 22, 1989 and the loan was closed as
planned on December 31, 1989, at which time an undisbursed balance of
US$0.2 million was cancelled.
This PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of
the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Copies of an FAO-CP draft report were sent to the Borrower in late 1989,
but no comments were received.
The  PCR  is based  on a draft  report  'y  an FAO/World  Bank
Cooperative Program Mission that visited the Philippines in April-May 1989,
on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, a field visit to
the project area, discussions with staff of the Bank and the borrower who
have been associated with the project, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
NATIONAL FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2156-PH)
Evaluation Summarv
Obiectives
1.       The principal objectives of the project were to raise the incomes
of artisanal fishermen in the adjacent Samar Sea and Ticao Pass areas of
the Philippines, and to offer consumers an increased supply of better
quality fish, which accounted for about 60 percent of all animal protein
consumed in the country.   This was to be achieved by implementation of:
(a) an area development component, including construction of landing points
and support facilities (ice plants, ice and chill storage, and carrier
boats), incrementa'l working capital and input supplies for the target group
in seven sites in the project area; and (b) an institutional development
component, including staff training, equipment, studies and technical
assistance to strengthen the operations of the main public sector fisheries
agencies. The project was to be implemented over an eight-year period, at
a total cost of US$37 million; the Bank loan in the amount of US$22.4 mil-
lion was approved on May 25, 1982.
Implementation Experience
2.       Although the Bank loan closed on schedule, only a few of the ori-
ginal project activities were actually carried out.   Midway through the
project period in November 1986, the entire area development component was
dropped after only very limited implementation and expenditures, and the
scope of the institutional development component was sharply reduced.
3.       Area Development Component.   This component was designed on the
basis of two major assumptions which proved to be inaccurate:   that fish
resources in the project area were under-exploited, and that marketing
arrangements and infrastructure used by artisanal fishermen were inade-
quate. The first assumption was not based on proper fish resource surveys,
a matter which had been of some concern to the FAO-CP preparation team and
the Bank's appraisal mission. However, when this was raised by the Bank's
Loan Committee, the staff replied that the project emphasis was on improv-
ing marketing rather than increasing catches, and it was therefore decided
to proceed. The feasibility of enforcing restrictions on commercial fish-
ing was not seriously questioned, although existing laws and regulations on
the subject were not being implemented at the time. In the event, far from
being unde:2-exploited, there is now evidence that the project area was
already belvx over-fished at the time the project was conceived, a situa-
tion whic, :;as only worsened in the interim.   On the issue of marketing
arrangements, the project assumed that artisanal fishermen were handicapped
by inadequate facilities, ice and cold storage; poor insulation of vessels;
and heavy dependency on unscrupulous traders, resulting in excessively low
prices. However, the completion mission observed that landing places are



- iv
not neeessary since the traditional fishing vessels are built so that they
car. aasily be hauled up on beaches; fishing trips rarely exceed more than a
fovy hours, so that ice is not needed and poor insulation is irrelevant.
Tho beaches are visited regularly and competition is extremely intense,
wyhich ouggests that prices are not unreasonably low.
4.       The Samar Sea-Ticao Fisheries Development Corporation (SEATI) was
established to wanage and implement the area development component, as a
rondition of loan negotiations; it was to be run like a private enterprisc,
with the Government as majority shareholder.   A private consulting firm
selected to manage SEATI wvas to be paid for its management services and was
also required tc invest equity in the Corporation.   The organization and
legal personality of SEATI are not described in detail in the SAR, and
there appears to have been little discussion of these matters during loan
negotiations.  In any event, the Government decided to terminate the ser-
vices of the first consulting firm retained to manage SEATI, when it
proposed a major change in the project work plan after studying the project
area more carefully.  A second firm (RKM) was selected, but it too proposed
changes ?-ter conducting a preliminary study of the project area and
conc2udirng that the resources were being over-fished.   specifically, the
firm proposed the- the infrastructure for the landing points was no longer
needed, but that "brush-parks" and artificial reefs should be established
to address the over-fisn4ng problem, that the number of sites for fish
landing and collection should be increased, ice carriers purchased and
certain improved technologies introduced.
5.       The Government and the Bank approved these changes early in 1984,
bur there was very little implementation during the succeeding two years.
The project suffered chronic funding delays, the combined result of the
difficult fiscal situation facing the Philippines and possibly internal
questioning within the Government as to the relative merits of the project.
Also, from the start, the Office of Budget Management determined that
project funds should be channelled through one of the fisheries agencies
and released to SEATI as and when necessary, which limited the Corpora-
tion's ability to function as flexibly as a private enterprise. On Novem-
ber 12, 1986, loan proceeds allocated to the area development component
were cancelled; slightly less than US$0.3 million had been spent (US$0.2
million for consultant services, US$0.1 million for equipment, materials
and vessels, and nothing for civil works) out of an original allocation of
US$12.1 million.
6.       Institutional Development Com2onent.   Preparation of this compo-
nent assumed no major organizational changes for the main fisheries agen-
cies, although for some years there had been rumors that they would be
transferred from one ministry to another. Just before appraisal the Bank
did become aware that a transfer was indeed likely, but there is no indica-
tion in the record that this subject featured prominently in the appraisal
discussions or loan negotiations. Implementation was later delayed because
of the transfer and re-definition of the support requirements of the agen-
cies; in 1986, when the area development component was terminated
(para. 5), the loan amount allocated to institutional strengthening was
reduced to US$1.5 million, from an original US$7.7 million.



P.esuxlts
7.       The institttional development component eventually had some posi-
tive impact.   About two-thirds of the respective loan disbursements went
toward the procurement of equipment and materials; the facilities provided
were urgently needed and are no- in full use; consultants were retained to
develop what Was reported to have been a useful training program for head-
quarters staff, which served as the basis for expanded training activities;
and 459 months of local fellowships were awarded after the Bank agreed that
funds earmarked for study abroad could be used instead at local universi-
ties.  Nonetheless, many of the trainees either left the fishery agencies
or were not placed in positions where their training could be used to the
best advantage.   A resource assessment study of small pelagics in the
Philippines provides some useful information about the fisheries resource
base.
Sustainability
8.       Since the area development component was never really implemented,
it had no impact on fisheries activities in the project area during the
period before related loan proceeds were cancelled, and its sustainability
therefore is not an issue.   However, all evidence indicates that if the
component had proceeded as planned, it would not, today, be judged sustain-
able.  Substantiating the view that project interventions would have been
irrelevant and not likely to be maintained, the completion mission observed
that despite the failture to implement this, or any other major government
schemes, fishermen in the area use relatively efficient methods and receive
a reasonable price for their catch.   Over-fishing is still a serious
problem, although some out-migration from the area has helped.
Findinps and Lessons Learned
9.     (a)  Fisheries projects generally,  and those concerning artisanal
fishing in particular, must be designed on the basis of well-
founded technical information concerning basic fish resources,
marketing practices, technology, etc.
(b) The institutional framework for a project is as essential to
its successful implementation and eventual sustainability as
are economic, financial and technical considerations.   In all
cases, but particularly when new entities are being created,
there needs to be a clear consensus among the Bank and all
parties involved on the Government side about the nature
(public/private orientation), objectives, organization, financ-
ing and operating principles of the bodies.
(c)  There is no substitute for devoting adequate resources and time
to careful project preparation and appraisal, and the failure
to do so carries heavy risks.  In this case, the results were
not more wasteful only because of the fortuitous cancellation
of the main project component before impi-mentation had really
begun.

Subsector            : Fisheries
2.    Background
2.1       When the project was  identified in 1979,  Philippine annual fish
production amounted to about 1.6 million m Lons and was valued at some US$1.3
billion, or approximately 5% of GNP. Per capita domestic fish consumption was
estimated at a relatively high 34 kg, or 602 o;: all animal protein consumed in
the Philippines. About 952 of the domestic catch, mainly low priced fish such
as scads, sardines, perch, etc., supplied this internal market. In addition,
about 27,000 tons, mostly In the form of canned sardines and makeral, were
imported to help meet the national demand for fish.
2.2       In the late 1970s, there were an estimated 12,000 commercial fisherman
operating about 2,100 vessels, and about 500,000 artisanal fisherman with about
250,000 vessels (60% without engines).   Artisanal fisherman were defined as
subsistence or small-scale producers who operated boats of less than 3 Gross Tons
(GT), with or without engines, both in inland waters and within 3 km of the
coast, and who produced only for the local market.  They contributed 55Z-60Z of
total annual marine fish supplies.
2.3       Through the National Fisheries Development Project, the Government
aimed to assist artisanal fishermen, who comprised one of the lowest income
groups in the Philippines. Previous World Bank support had been channelled only
to commercial fisherman (through Fisheries Projects I and II, Loans 891-PH and
1270-PH, respectively).  It was recognized that earlier Government credit and
extension programs for artisanal fisherman had been limited in scale and had run



-2-
into problems: few loans were repaid, incremental catches were reported to be
unmarketable and extension was hampered by lack of trained staff, transport and
equipment. Nonetheless, a case was made for further assistance to artisanal
fishermen on the grounds that rapid pupulation growth would increase the demand
for protein and that there was under-exploitation of fish resources.
2.4       The Government and the Bank considered that artisanal  fishermen
incurred excessive losses due to poor market access, inadequate marketing
facilities and lack of institutional support. The proposed Fisheries Education
and Training Project (Loan 1786-PE), under appraisal at the time, was expected
to be only partly helpful in addressing institutional problems, with
complementary measures needed to establish sound administrative structures for
the relevant institutions, provide additional staff training and supply essential
transport and equipment. It was therefore reasoned that investment in marketing
facilities, in areas where there were still under-exploited fish resources,
together with training in marketing operations and other institutional support,
would provide the necessary stimuli for development of the artisanal fisheries
subsector. The National Fisheries Development Project was to be the first phase
of a program of support, following a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, it
was to be area specific, in that testing a new marketing strategy would be
concentrated in the adjacent Samar Sea and Ticao Pass areas where resources were
believed to be adequate and accessible to artisanal fisherman; at the same time,
by strengthening fisheries institutions, the project was to have a national
impact.
3.        Projet  Objectives and Description
3.1       The principal objectives of the project were to raise the incomes of
artisanal fishermen in the Samar Sea and Ticao Pass areas and offer consumers an
increased supply of better quality fish, by reducing fish marketing losses and
strengthening the operations of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
(BFAR), the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA) and the Fi,hery
Industry Development Council (FIDC).
3.2       The project consisted of two components, as follows.
(a)   The area development component included the construction of
landing points with supportive facilities (ice plants, ice and
chill storage, and carrier boats), incremental working capital
and input supplies for the target group in seven sites in the
adjacent and depressed areas of Masbate/Ticao and Western Samar.
(b)   The institutional development component included staff training,
equipment, studies and technical assistance, to strengthen BFAR,
PFDA and FIDC.
The project was to be implemented over an eight-year period, at a total cost of
US$37 million, including a foreign exchange component of US$16.9 million (462 of
total costs); the Bank loan was US$22.4 million.



- 3-
4.        Project Design and Organization
Project Design
4.1       The project was designed on the basis of two major assumptions which
proved to be inaccurate:  that fish resources in the project area were under-
exploited, and that marketing arrangements and infrastructure used by artisanal
fishermen were inadequate.
4.2       Availability of Fisheries Resources.  The assumption during project
preparation and appraisal that the intensity of fishing could be increased in the
Samar Sea and Ticao Pass area was not baqed on adequate fish resource surveys.
The related assumption that commercial fishing could be restrained through
regulatory action in order to preserve existing resources for artisanal fishing
was also unrealistic   In the course of its field work, the completion mission
observed overfishing in relation to sustainable yield, that the dividing line
between artisanal and commercial fishing was far from clear, and that commercial
activities were still quite prevalent in the project area (see Annex for
details). The record indicates that the paucity of resource information was of
concern to those designing the project: an FAO-CP Preparation Progress Report
mentioned that resource information had been based only on catch data collected
during interviews and that more substantial evidence was therefore necessary.
The appraisal team also Leferred to the declining availabil'ty of sustainable
fish resources in some coastal waters because of overfishing, and growing
competition from commercial fishermen operating in those waters. Finally, the
Bank's Loan Committee queried the resource issue and whether Board presentation
of the project should not be deferred until adequate fish resource surveys were
undertaken.   The staff replied that the project emphasis was on improving
marketing rather than increasing catches, and it was therefore decided to
proceed. The feasibility of enforcing restrictions on commercial fishing was not
seriously questioned, although existing laws and regulations on the subject were
not being implemented at that time.   It would appear that once the project
concept had gained momentum, both in the Bank and the Government, the pressure
to proceed with what appeared superficially to be an attractive poverty
alleviation response to the low incomes of small fiphermen led to understatement
of fundamental issues. In the event, early on during project implementation,
b:)th independent consultant firms retained to manage the area development
camponent concluded that the project area was overfished and that the project
design needed to be completely revamped. Ultimately, the entire area development
component had to be dropped from the project, after virtually no implementation
(see Section 5 below).
4.3       Marketing of Catches by Artisanal Fishermen.  Marketing of fish landed
by artisanal fishermen was considered to be handicapped by inadequate landing
facilities, ice and cold storage; poor insulat'on of vessels; and heavy
dependency on unscrupulous traders, resulting in excessively low prices.
However, the completion mission observed that landing places are not necessary
since the traditional "bancas' used as fishing boats and carrier vessels are
built so that they can easily be hauled up on beaches (see Annex). Fishing trips
by these "bancas" rarely exceed three to four hours, and therefore ice is not
needed and poor insulation is not relevant. The beaches are visited regularly
by middlemen, with such intense competition that small carrier boats often
purchase fish catches at sea from both artisanal and commercial fishermen before
they are landed. In these circumstances, it is not likely that prices are



- 4 -
unreasonably low. In summary, there was probably very little need for most of the
equipment and infrastructure that was included in the project to 'solve" the
marketing problems.
Project Ozganization
4.4       The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) is somewhat ambiguous in describing
project management and execution machinery, but essentially the two project
components, although inter-dependent, were to be administered separately:   a
public Corporation was established specifically to implement the area development
component, and a Project Unit was created to carry out institutional
strengthening activities.
4.5       Area Development Component.  The Samar Sea-Ticao Fisheries Development
(SEATI) Corporation was established as a condition for loan negotiations; it was
to be run like a private enterprise, but with the Government (through PFDA) being
the majority shareholder.   Wh3le the intent to operate SEATI on a purely
commercial basis was laudable, this was never achieved in practice. From the
start, the Office of Budget Management determined that project funds should be
channelled through PFDA and released to SEATI as and when PFDA deemed necessary,
which limited SEATI's ability to function flexibly as would a private enterprise.
The private con~ SIting firm selected to manage the Corporation was paid for its
management services and was also required to invest equity in SEATI, but had no
seat on the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board designated another
Board member to serve as President of SEATI, but there was no clear delineation
of the functions of the President and Manager, and this created numerous problems
in the decision-making office.
4.6       Institutional Development. Component.  Rumors that the main fisheries
agencies in the Philippines would be transferred from the Ministry of Natural
Resources to the Ministry of Agriculture  (later known as the Department of
Agriculture, DA) had been circulating for several years, and therefore were
perhaps justifiably ignored during early project preparation.   However,  just
before appraisal the Bank did become aware that such a transfer would indeed take
place, but there is no indication in the record that this subject featured
prominently in the appraisal discussions or loan negotiations. With the benefit
of hindsight, it is evident that some delay would have been advisable, so that
the support which the fisheries agencies needed could have been better defPned
after their transfer.
4.7       In many respects this project was very poorly conceptualized and
therefore doomed to fail from the start, whether administered by the Government
or private enterprise (paras. 4.1-4.3). Nonetheless, the separation of the two
components, the failure to examin2 thoroughly the organizational and legal
features of SEATI and reach suitably detailed agreements beforehand, and the
premature decision to proceed with appras -al and loan negotiations before
clarifying the details of the planned transfer of the main fisheries agencies,
certainly added to the implementation difficulties which the project later
experienced.



- 5-
5.        Project Implementation
5.1       Area Development Component.  The first major implementation problem
occurred very early on when the private consultant selected to manage SEATI
proposed a major change in the project work plan, reportedly after studying the
project area more carefully. Although SEATI had been established and the Manager
selected before loan negotiations, the Manager's consultant firm had not yet made
the required equity contribution. When the firm continued to delay payments and
ask for different conditions, the Government terminated the contract and salected
another  firm,  with  the  approval  of the Bank.   This  firm,  RKM Fisheries
Enterprises, conducted a preliminary study of the project area and also concluded
that the resources had been overfished and therefore the project design had to
be changed. The firm proposed that the infrastructure at the landing points was
no longer needed, but that "brush-parks" and artificial reefs should be
established to address the overfishing problem, that the number of sites for fish
landing and collection should be increased, ice carriers purchased and certain
improved technologies introduced. The Government and the Bank approved these
proposals in early 1984.
5.2       The completion mission was unable to locate any feasibility study to
support the revised project proposal. Given that the fish resource position was
clearly confused, it is not likely that RKM could have produced realistic catch
estimates.  Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed brush parks and
artificial reefs had not been determined and, even if these structures would
eventually have helped to stabilize fish resources, they would have done little
at the time to improve the incomes and welfare of the artisanal fishermen who
were supposed to be the principal project beneficiaries. Clearly the project
should have been cancelled or fully reappraised at this stage, but the Bank and
the Government chose instead to proceed.   SEATI's operations, including the
practice of recruiting local fishermen as workers, became quite controversial.
Eventually, the Board asked SEATI for an analysis of catch results to determine
whether the initial brush-parks and artificial reefs which SEATI claimed to have
installed were proving effective. When this information was not forthcoming, in
1985 the Government ordered a review of SEATI's operations.   The completion
mission was also unable to find a report of the review, on the basis of which it
was recommended that management of the SEATI should shift to the Government,
since the Corporation was essentially development-oriented and not a commercial
venture. This recommendation was rejected by both the new Government which came
to office in 1986 and the Bank, and the balance of the loan allocated to the area
development component was finally cancelled on November 12, 1986. Slightly less
than US$0.3 million (US$0.2 million for consultant services and US$0.1 million
for equipment/materials/vehicles and vessels) had been spent, out of an original
allocation of US$12.1 million; no loan funds had been disbursed for civil works.
5.3       Institutional Development Component.  Implementation of this component
was delayed because of the transfer of BFAR and PFDA from the Ministry of Natural
Resources to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the establishment of the FIDC
per Executive Order No. 967 in June 30, 1984 and the subsequent transfer of its
functions to the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture. In 1986, when the area
development component was terminated (para. 5.2), the loan amount allocated to
institutional strengthening was reduced to US$1.5 million, from an original
US$7.7 million. disbursed.

6.        Project Results
6.1       Since the area development component was never really implemented, it
had no impact on fisheries activities in the project area during the period
before related loan proceeds were cancelled. The ompletion mission observed
that despite the failure to implement this project, or any other major government
interventions, the fishermen in the area use relatively efficient methods and
receive a reasonable price for their catch (see Annex). Over-fishing is still
a serious problem, although some out-migration from the area has helped.  The
institutional development component eventually had some positive impact. About
two-thirds of the respective loan disbursements went towards the procurement of
equipment and materials; the facilities provided were urgently needed and are now
in full use; consultants were retained to develop what was reported to have been
a useful training program for headquarters staff, which served as the basis for
expanded training activities; and 459 months of local fellowships were awarded
(after the Bank agreed that funds earmarked for study abroad could be used
instead at local universities). Nonetheless, many of the trainees either left
the fishery agencies or were not placed in positions where their training could
be used to the best advantage. A resource assessment study of small pelagics in
the Philippines, financed partly under this project and partly under the
Fisheries Training Project (Ln. 1786-PH), provides some useful information about
the resource base and extent of over-fishing.
7.        Sustainability
7.1       The institutional development component has provided some assistance,
mainly to BFAR, and therefore may indirectly yield some sustainable benefits, to
the extent that other efforts are made to further strengthen that agency and to
adequately fund its programs.   Since the area development component was not
implemented, its sustainability is not an issue. However, all evidence indicates
that if this component had proceeded as planned, it would not, today, be judged
sustainable.
8.        Bank Performance
8.1       This project was very poorly prepared and appraised without properly
addressing fundamental issues, despite the fact that some of these were actually
raised by the FAO-CP and the Bank's appraisal mission and Loan Committee. In
particular, knowledge of the fisheries resource base in the project area was
wholly inadequate and resulting assumptions that overfishing was not a problem
proved to be incorrect. SEATI was established too hastily, without reaching a
clear consensus among all parties on the extent to which it should or would
function as a private enterprise, or carefully considering the possible inherent
contradiction between the obectives of maximizing artisanal fishermen's incomes
on the one hand and realizing maximum profits for the Corporation on the other.
The institutional development component was appraised and negotiated despite
knowledge that the fisheries agencies would be transferred and that this might
well change the kind of assistance that each would need. Supervision missions
did detect the malfunctioning of the project and signalled the need for quick
action, but without analyzing the underlying reasons. On the face of it, SEATI
did not function well due to excessive government interference, but actually the
basic rationale for the project was weak and at some stages the government was



reacting to an apparent deviation from original objectives, in the sense that the
proposals for project revision put forward by the RKM consulting firm would not
necessarily have improved the welfare of the artisanal fishermen.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.1       The  Government  agencies  involved  in  project  identification  and
preparation also bear a major part of the responsibility for the development of
a conceptually unsound project proposal. In retrospect, the Government's strict
supervision of SEATI, although heavily criticized by the Bank missions and not
consistent with the objective of permitting the entity to function on private
sector principles, did nonetheless prove useful in detecting problems and
preventing a greater outlay of expenditures. The decision to cancel the
area development component was most certainly a sound one.   Concerning the
institutional development component, there are indications in the record that at
least some part of the Government was aware of the planned transfer of the
fisheries agencies; these intentions should either have been made clear to the
Bank or the loan negotiations should have been postponed until the matter was
clarified. The Office of Management and Budget should have been more closely
involved early on during project preparation and appraisal, to avoid subsequent
misunderstandings about the project's financial operations. The project suffered
chronic funding delays, the combined result of the difficult fiscal situation
facing the country, a cumbersome budgetary process, and possibly internal
questioning within the Government about the relative merits of project
activities.
10.       Project Relationships
10.1        The Bank-Borrower relationship was good at all times throughout the
project, even during supervision when opinions differed regarding SEATI's
operations. The excellent relationships at the higher management levels of the
Bank and Government may, however, have put too much pressure on the operational
levels of both, leading them to ignore or understate issues of fundamental
importance to the justification and design of the project.
11.       Consulting Services
11.1      The consultants contracted to prepare the training program under the
institutional development component performed their services in a timely and
satisfactory manner.  The consultant study, Assessment of Pelagic Fish Stocks,
was competent. The performance of the consultants retained to manage SEATI was
unsatisfactory, but both firms labored under the burden of a poorly conceived and
designed project.
12.       Project Documentation and Data
12.1      All documentation on this project which is available at FAO-CP and
Bank headquarters and in Government offices was made available to the completion
mission.  However, several important items could not be located, including a
feasibility study apparently prepared by the Go-erriment with FAO-CP assistance



- 8 -
as part of project preparation; some of the studies which were reportedly carried
out by the RKM consulting firm, including the study or analyses which led RKM,
to propose _. major revision of the project strategy and content; and certified
financial accounts of the operations of SEATI.
13.       Lessons Learned
(a) Fisheries projects generally, and those concerning artisanal fishing
in particular, must be designed on the basis of well-founded technical
information concerning basic fish resources, marketing practices,
technology, etc.
(b) The institutional framework for a project is as essential to its
successful implementation and eventual sustainability as are economic,
financial  and  technical  considerations.        In  all  cases,  but
particularly when new entities are being created, there needs to be
a clear concensus among the Bank and all parties involved on the
Government side about the nature (public/private orientation),
objectives, organization, financing and operating principles of the
bodies.
(c) There is no substitute for devoting adequate resources and time to
careful project preparation and appraisal, and the failure to do so
carries heavy risks. In this case, the results were not more wasteful
only because of the fortuitous cancellation of the main project
component before implementation had really begun.

D Deferred repeatedly during this period.
Comments.       The following issues were raised at the different stages of project cycle:
A. Identification
- organization and management of marketing facilities. The success of the proposed marketing facilities would be
dependent on the quality of the management and the organization within which they would operate.  Government wished to include the
private sector to the extent possible, and envisaged some form of purchase/leasing/management contract/joint venture basis,
invoLving the PFDA only to the extent necessary. Agreement on the ownership and commercial operation of the facilities was cited
as a prerequisite for further project preparation.
B. Preparation Assistance
- Allocation of resources to artisanal fishermen. Unless Government excluded large commerciat vessels from fishing
grounds reserved for artisanal fishermen, it was felt that project support would be unsuccessful. Enforcement would be difficult
and would need to involve local groups.
- Economic rate of return.  The increased output from artisanal fishing resulting from the project would be possible
because of regulations limiting commercial fisheries intrusion. This increase, coupled with reduced marketing losses, would
provide a satisfactory ERR if compared with current levels of artisanal output, but a poor return assumning that without the
project commercial fishing would increase to fully utilize the resources. The social rate of return would, however, be
satisfactory if factors such as income distribution and employment generation were weighted adequately, because of the poverty of
the beneficiaries.
- Institutional problems. The fisheries groups within MNR had an unsatisfactory record of achievement, and would be ill-
equipped to handle expanded functions without the support, including new equipment and facilities, recurrent cost financing, and
changes in organization and staffing procedures.
C. Appraisal. No new issues were raised.

The pelagic assessment study

Bank's Fishery Training
Project (Loan 1786-PH).
Since the area development component was cancelled before anything
significant had been achieved, there were no benefits or impact.

REPORT ON PROJECT ;OMPLETION MISSION FIELD VISIT
1.        This report is based on a field visit by the FAO-CP completion mission
to the four locations where the Samar Sea-Ticao Fisheries Development Corporation
(SEATI) attempted to launch its activities: Magallanes and San Jacinto (Ticao
Island) on both sides of the Ticao Pass, and Santo Nino Island and Tarangan in
the Samar Sea. At all four sites, the mission interviewed local authorities,
fishermen, boat-builders, fish traders, shopkeepers and other entrepreneurs.
2.        General View of the Area.  The main activities in the area are fishing
and farming.   The latter is predominantly small-scale farming based on rice,
vegetables,  small  livestock and coconut.    Fishing  is artisanal,  but has
progressively shifted from a subsistence to a market orientation, with most
operators now selling their catch to traders who supply the urban and export
markets. In recent years some small and medium-scale fish and prawn farming
enterprises have also been established. The development potential of the area
relative to its basic natural resource endowment (land, water, fish stock, etc.)
appears to be fully, or nearly fully, exploited. New activities such as tourism
or labor-intensive industries do not seem viable. Emigration therefore seems to
be the only solution to decreasing resource availability and worsening poverty.
In fact, emigration is already taking place, with a growing proportion of young
people leaving for other parts of the Philippines or to become foreign workers,
repatriating part of their revenues back to the area.
3.        Fishing Techniques.  There are an estimated 35,000 fishermen in the
area. Their fishing techniques are artisanal, but denote a profound knowledge
of the behaviour and vulnerabilities of the fish. In that sense, they are highly
efficient and probably optimal from a technical standpoint. Unlike many hunting-
catching activities in the world, most fishing operations in the area rely on
more subtle techniques for attracting, concentrating and stabilizing the fish
prior to the catching operations. Fish attraction and aggregation are obtained
through many devices operating at the surface (payaos), or in mid-water and on
the seafloor (arongs), through lights at night (lamparos), chumming, live bait,
etc. Catches are made through set nets (fish traps), purse-seines, lift nets,
ring nets, encircling gill nets, drag nets, etc.  Even explosives, which are
certainly detrimental to the environment, are skillfully used not only for
killing fish, out also for guiding schools outside the arongs structures, and
thus making them accessible to purse-seines or other nets.
4.        The traditional boats (bancas, pump boats and basnigs) are the optimum
type of vessel for the area.  They require little power for propulsion, have
great stability, a good carrying capacity and an extremely shallow draught,
allowing the crafts to be beached in any sandy place and making landing
infrastructure unnecessary. Most of the boats have no insulated fish storage
capacity since they make only short trips, turning their production over to
traders within two to four hours after capture. These boats cost little and are
well adapted to any sea-going activity in the area.

5.        Fish Resources.   There is no precise fish stock assessment and no
reliable statistics on efforts and catches of the area.   However,  several
symptoms support the view that fish resources are exploited in excess of their
maximum sustainable yield:
(a) fishermen, traders and entrepreneurs report that catches per unit
of effort have been constantly decreasing in recent years;
(b) boat-builders confirm that the demand for fishing boats is
stagnating;
(c)  small bancas (one or two people) can be observed outside the
coastal waters at distances of 10 to 15 km from the shore, in fact
in the middle of the channels and passes, in areas formerly
exploited only by larger boats;
(d)  fishing by the larger bancas, mostly purse-seiners, has been
decreasing outside the good mackerel season (from about May to
November); and
(e)  smaller size fish, particularly the benthic and demersal species,
are being commercialized.
Artificial structures such as sunken reefs, arongs or payaos, are efficient at
concentrating fish for catch purposes and eventually stabilizing resources, if
effectively managed, but they will not substantially increase resources because
the quantity of basic nutrient (primary production) in the waters does not
change.
6.        Fish Marketing.  Fish marketing in the area is competitive.  Sea-going
fish traders operate in every landing place and in the open sea. About a dozen
fish carrying bancas were observed in Magallanes. The same number were seen in
San Jacinto and in Calbayog.   Three were noted in Santo Nino and four in
Taragnan. All were similar to those of the fishermen, although generally bigger
and equipped with insulated ice boxes. They seem to be cost-effective and able
to beach at any place where the fishermen have based their operations.   Fish
carriers are posted at every beach landing site, and the landings are stored in
ice as soon as they are brought in by the fishermen. This system is so efficient
that fish are actually a scarce commodity in local markets, and fish consumers
aften resort to canned sardine and mackerel since the fishermen obtain better
prices for their catch from urban traders. Therefore, fishermen do not complain
about the price they receive for their catch, except on rare occasions during the
peak of the mackerel season when average producer prices decrease by 30 to 50Z.
Rather, their main complaint is that the total annual catch is too small to
generate a satisfactory income.
7.        The larger and more powerful fishing bancas and pump boats belonging
to small local entrepreneurs also have low capital intensity and are of
traditional design, with no full deck, no insulated fish hold and no deck
mechanization. There is no clear cut distinction in the area between commercial
and artisanal fishing. From the big banca operating a purse-seine, down to the
small unit powered by paddles and sails and equipped with hand lines and/or gill

Page 3 of 4
nets, there is a complex variety of intermediary combinations making it difficult
to classify any of these into one or the othler category. For example, many non-
motorized small bancas well under 3 GT are equipped with huge gill nets, which
give them a relatively great catching power. Also, many small units, often non-
motorized, are operating at mid-channel (para. 5) and sell a large proportion of
their catch (para. 2).
8.        Local Views on SEATI's Performance.  Local authorities and operators
interviewed bjy the mission viewed SEATI as an unrealistic experiment, doomed from
the very beginning. The most common criticisms made were the following. SEATI's
permanent staff were not from the area, and local people felt they would never
integrate on a long-term basis. SEATT did not take into account local traditions
and professional skills, and ignored the opinions and advice of the local people.
SEATI's staff had little knowledge of commercial activities, and even less so of
fishing. SEATI's management exercised insufficient control over operations and
expenses; staff were therefore lackadaisical and their presence at the fish
landing sites was irregular. SEATI's brush parks, although apparently efficient
in attracting fish, were too weak and were expensive to maintain.
9.        Conclusions  on  Project  Concept.    Based  on  its  interviews  and
observations, the mission concluded that little had changed in the area since
appraisal (1980). At that time, the natural sea and land resources were already
in a state of full exploitation and emigration was occurring. Fishing techniques
were, as today, highly efficient. Fish marketing was probably less efficient,
but improvements which have taken place should have been foreseen given the
active traditional fish marketing network in the area and the strong increase in
demand for fish in boLh the local and export markets.
10.       Perhaps the main error in project identification and design, which is
common to many artisanal fisheries projects, was that low catches of the
artisanal fishermen were attributed to their traditional fishing methods, their
reluctance to exploit distant waters and to the competition with commercial
fishermen.  In fact, traditional fishing methods were highly efficient, and could
actually be introduced in many tropical countries.   Small bancas under 3 GT,
often non-motorized, are operated in mid-channel, and this efficiency (combined
with a growing local population) has led to over-fishing and presently low
catches. The shallow draught of the vessels enables the fishermen to land almost
anywhere on the sandy beaches, which means that they can follow the spatial
movement of the fish (ie, because they are not dependent on a port for
unloading). Fish traders, who operate from carrier bancas, can also follow the
fishing effort in all its movement.   For this reason, investments in fishing
ports should never have been proposed. Fortunately, this point was discovered
by SEATI and the facilities were not actually built. The wisdom of this decision
is obvious, considering that present marleting arrangements are quite able to
absorb total production efficiently.   The port component had been justified
because of the planned procurement of carrier boats, ice plants, ice stores,
chill rooms, etc. This was a serious misjudgement of the traditional marketing
system. Moveover, a corporation managing industrial marketing activities and
staffed with outsiders would never have competed with many small sea-going fish
traders living continuously in close contact with the small fishermen.   This
point was missed during project preparation and appraisal, because the
traditional fish traders were seen as rapacious intermediaries responsible for
the low incomes of the fishermen, who therefore had to be "liberated" from their

hold. This may be true in cases where there are only a few middlemen, but it did
not apply in this area.
11.       In the event, SEATI did not attempt to compete with the traditional
fish traders as suggested in the SAR. Instead it tried to establish production-
oriented fisheries through fish culture and brush parks. The former was a long-
term exercise which was not at all viable in the short period during which the
Corporation existed. Brush parks are underwater structures implanted in great
density in near-shore waters with the aim of increasing the stock of fish and
therefore ensuring better catches and incomes to the artisanal fishermen. Also,
since these structures would hinder larger vessels from entering in shallow
waters, they were supposed to protect small fisherman from their more commercial
colleagues. From August 1984 to March 1985, SEATI claimed to have installed more
than 10,000 underwater structures in the four locations where it was operating.
However, no catch records were available, although SEATI's Board Minutes show
that the Board had persistently asked for this information. In similar tropical
waters and when natural conditions are favourable, such devices generally attract
commercial concentrations of adult fish after 3-4 months at the very most. The
fact that no increased catches were recorded could imply either that these
devices were not properly controlled or that the area was over-fished to such an
extent that fish attracting devices did not help. In addition, the local people
incriminated their structural weaknesses and SEATI's lack of commercial know-how,
management skills, understanding of local society and culture, etc., as important
main reasons.
