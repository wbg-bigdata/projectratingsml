PROPOSED ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:                 The Slovak Republic
Amount:                   Euro 200 Million
Terms:                    Euro single currency fixed spread commitment linked loan.
Annuity repayment with a final maturity of 14 years and grace
period of 5 years. Expected disbursement period of 0-3 years.
Front End Fee:            One percent of the loan amount.
Commitment Fee:           Standard terms as applicable for fixed spread loans, less any
waiver.
Objectives and Description:   The objective of the proposed loan is to support the Government
of Slovakia's comprehensive program of bank and enterprise
reforms. The program contains four broad components: (i)
restructuring and privatization of the banking system, centered on
the privatization of the three large State banks, but also including
the resolution of all troubled medium banks; (ii) substantial
strengthening of banking regulation and supervision; (iii) full
implementation of a strategy to workout the large stock of
classified claims; and (iv) substantial improvements in the legal
framework, centered on the bankruptcy and collateral regimes,
and the laws dealing with corporate governance.
Benefits:                 The reform actions sought under the EFSAL would improve the
stability and efficiency of the banking system; promote enterprise
restructuring through the workout of bad assets and the
improvements in the legal framework; attract foreign investment;
and ultimately contribute to the growth of output and
employment in the longer-run.
Risks:                    The risks to the proposed EFSAL arise mostly from the political
situation. The broad coalition could interrupt the implementation
of some components, if faced with adverse short-run effects of
the reform such as unemployment or a very low price for the bad
assets.  However, this risk seems to be modest, given the
advanced implementation stage of the reforms.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC
I. INTRODUCTION
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL) to the Slovak Republic in the amount
of Euro 200 million equivalent to support a comprehensive program of enterprise and financial
sector reforms. The loan would be a Euro single currency fixed spread commitment linked, annuity
repayment loan with a final maturity of 14 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an expected
disbursement of 0-3 years. The loan would be disbursed in three tranches of Euro 60 million, Euro
70 million, and Euro 70 million, respectively.
1I. OVERVIEW
2.    Slovakia became independent from the former Czechoslovak Federation in January 1993,
after a peaceful process of separation.  Slovakia's initial economic achievements after
independence were impressive, and the country seemed poised to become a star performer among
transitional countries. However, in the mid-1990s the country experienced severe internal and
external imbalances, leading to episodes of instability in the balance of payments, and ultimately to
a deterioration of growth performance. The faltering economic performance was accompanied by
an increasing isolation from the international community, and the exclusion of Slovakia from the
first group of candidates for EU accession.
3.    The faltering economic performance and the increasing isolation from the international
community were the result of the dirigiste and nationalistic policies followed during the 1994-1998
period. During the period, Slovakia privatized a large number of enterprises but the privatization
program was fraught with problems, favoring politically connected parties and practically
excluding foreign investors. The pervasive presence of the State in the banking system opened
room for extensive political interference in lending decisions. The legal framework for banking,
enterprises, and capital market activities remained weak, depriving supervisors, creditors and small
shareholders of the most essential rights. The final outcome of these policies was devastating, as
indicated by large enterprise losses, the insolvency of the banking system, large contingent fiscal
liabilities, and the incapacity of the economy to generate growth and employment despite large
investment outlays.
4.   In September 1998, Parliamentary elections resulted in the victory of a broad-based
coalition of parties led by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda. The new Government immediately
announced its intention to reverse the policies that threatened the country's economic and political
stability, and moved rapidly to rebuild the ties with the international community. There were initial
doubts on the coalition's capacity to implement a coherent program, but the results to date have



-2-
been impressive. Since coming to power, the new Government has successfully stabilized the
economy and has launched an ambitious program of structural reforms, including the privatization
of banks and utilities, the overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework, and the reformn of public
administration. The Government's efforts have been recognized by the international community,
as indicated by the resumption of accession negotiations with the EU in November 1999,
Slovakia's entry into the OECD in May 2000, the continuous improvement in the country's credit
ratings, and the sharp decline in borrowing spreads.
5.    Early in its tenure, the new Government requested support from the World Bank and other
donors for the design and implementation of its program of bank and enterprise reforms, which
commanded the highest priority in its overall reform agenda. Since early 1999, Bank staff have
been collaborating closely with the Govemment in all aspects of program design and
implementation. The preparation of the reforms has been supported by a PHRD grant. During this
time, Bank staff has also liaised closely with the other donors (EU-PHARE, USAID, UK-DFID)
supporting the Government's program.  The program  has reached an advanced stage of
implementation, as indicated by the recent privatization of the largest State bank, the resolution of
most troubled small and medium banks, the finalization of a new Banking Law and of amendments
to several other laws, and the initial implementation of a scheme to workout a large volume of non-
performing assets. The Government intends to complete the bank and enterprise reforms within the
next 18 months. The proposed EFSAL will contribute to the successful conclusion of the
Government's reform program, by helping the Government finance the initial fiscal costs of bank
restructuring and providing the necessary technical assistance to all components of the program.
1II. SLOVAKIA'S SITUATION BEFORE THE REFORMS
A.   Macroeconomic Performance After Independence
6.    Slovakia registered one of the best macroeconomic performances in Central Europe after its
independence from the Czechoslovak Federation in 1993. As shown in Table 1, inflation declined
to single digits in 1995, one of the lowest inflation rates in the region. At the same time, the
economy initiated a strong, export-led recovery, despite a contraction of fiscal and investment
expenditures. The initial output recovery seemed sustainable, as it was based on exports, and took
place in a context of small fiscal deficits and current account surpluses. The prospects of high
growth were reinforced by the highest investment ratio in the region, and the expectations of
improved investment efficiency driven by fast privatization. By early 1996, Slovakia seemed
destined to become one of the leading performers in Central Europe.
7.    In the 1996-1998 period, however, the current account shifted to persistent deficits of about
10 percent of GDP, driven primarily by a dramatic increase in fixed investment (Table 1). The
sharp investment expansion did not raise much concern initially, as there were hopes that such
large investment outlays would increase export capacity and eventually repay themselves.
However, it became apparent that much of this increase in investment included sub-optimal
projects driven by perverse incentives, generous public guarantees on foreign borrowings,
extensive political interference in bank lending, and weak corporate governance. The inefficiency



-3-
of many investment projects was progressively revealed by the widespread reports of corruption
and the lack of enterprise restructuring (reflected in growing enterprise losses).
8.     The increase in the current account deficit was exacerbated by an expansionary fiscal
policy, as indicated by the shift from a fiscal surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP to deficits of around 5
percent of GDP. These numbers understate the full extent of the expansionary policy, since large
contingent liabilities were also built up in the form of extensive guarantees on foreign borrowings
of enterprises and extra-budgetary funds.
9.     In an effort to offset increasingly lax fiscal policies, and prevent the current account from
deteriorating even further, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) progressively tightened monetary
policy from 1996 to 1998. The tight monetary policy did contain the current account at 10 percent
of GDP, but at the cost of very high real interest rates (real lending rates in excess of 20 percent
p.a.) and repeated periods of turbulence in the foreign exchange market. Moreover, the tight
monetary policy was ultimately not able to sustain the exchange rate in the face of speculative
attacks related to the Russia crisis, forcing the NBS to float the currency in October 1998.

B.    The Banking Sector at the End of the 1990s
10.    The Size, Structure and Performance of the Banking Sector.  Slovakia has a large
banking sector, as indicated by bank assets and loans of 83 and 50 percent of GDP, respectively.
The large size of banking assets relative to other transitional countries is not necessarily an
indication of banking sector development, however, but simply of a smaller real erosion of balance



-4-
sheets in the early transitional period, due to lower inflation than other transitional countries. In
fact, the Slovak banking system arrived at the end of the decade plagued by inefficiencies and
deeply insolvent. As shown in Table 2, classified loans accounted for more than half of total
banking assets or the equivalent of 27 percent of GDP. The banking system was largely
unprofitable and had an average.capital adequacy ratio (CAR) close to zero.
11.    At the end of the 1990s, the Slovak banking system consisted of 24 banks and 2 branches of
foreign banks. The 3 large State banks suffered a sharp loss of market shares during the 1990s, but
still accounted for nearly half of total bank assets in 1999, as shown in Table 3. The group of
medium and small banks comprised 8 banks with substantive foreign ownership and 9 domestic
banks with varying degrees of State participation. This group increased its share of total assets to
35 percent in mid-1999, due primarily to the rapid growth of the better managed foreign-owned
banks, but also included several inefficient and insolvent banks. The other groups accounted for,
less than 20 percent of assets in the banking system. The group of special State institutions is,
dominated by Konsolidacna Banka (KOB), a State workout institution created in the early 1990s to
handle bad assets. The branches of foreign banks include the Slovak branch of CSOB, a former
Czech State bank that was recently privatized.

12.    The Financial Situation of the Large Banks. The financial situation of the three large
banks (SLSP, VUB, and IRB)' became critical in 1999, as a result of the continuing deterioration
of their asset portfolios. Classified loans accounted for almost three fourths of their total loans by
IVseobecna Uverova Banka (VUB), Slovenska Sporitelna (SLSP) and Investicna Rozvojova Banka (IRB).



-5-
mid-1999, or the equivalent of 20 percent of GDP (Table 3). Even excluding loans in the second
category (watch loans), the ratios were still very high-loans in categories 3, 4 and 5 (substandard,
doubtful and loss loans, respectively) amounted to almost half of their total loans, or 13 percent of
GDP. The large stock of classified loans held by the large banks originated from a variety of
factors, including bad loans inherited from the former regime, weak lending practices, political
interference in lending decisions, and weak collateral and insolvency regimes.
13.   The CARs of the three large banks were significantly negative in 1999, and would have
been even more negative, if credit portfolios had been subject to stricter classification criteria and if
collateral had been accounted for at realizable value. Moreover, the trends in 1999 pointed to a
continued deterioration of their capital position, due to the increasing competition from the foreign-
owned banks and the lack of a supportive tax environment, which prevented the deduction of
provisions from taxable income. The large banks were allowed to continue operating under a
special clause of the Banking Law which granted them regulatory forbearance, but which expired
in December 1999. LRB had already suffered a major deposit run in December 1997, and was
under conservatorship by the NBS.
14.   The Financial Situation of the Small and Medium Banks. The group of small and
medium banks generally performed better than the large banks in the 1990s, as indicated by the
lower share of classified loans on their portfolios (17 percent in June 1999) and higher CARs. The
better performance of these banks was due to a variety of factors, including the absence of inherited
problems (they started operating in the early 1990s), less political interference in lending decisions,
and better corporate governance due to the presence of foreign strategic investors. However, this
group is not homogenous and included 7 medium and small banks with deep financial problems.
These were primarily domestic banks with a significant State participation.  Although the
combined assets of these 7 banks were not large enough to pose a systemic threat (about 10 percent
of total banking sector assets), it became apparent that resolution of the troubled medium and small
banks would have to be a component of the Government's reform program.
15.   The Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for Banking Activities. Following
independence, banking legislation consisted of two fundamental laws, the Banking Law and the
National Bank of Slovakia Law. The Banking Law included basic banking provisions, and was
complemented by four prudential regulations on major borrowers, liquidity, loan loss provisions,
and foreign exchange. The National Bank of Slovakia Law contained basic provisions on
independence, and defined the NBS' powers and responsibilities in the areas of monetary policy
and bank supervision. The legal framework for banking contained several flaws, however. One
key problem was the shared responsibility of the NBS and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for bank
supervision. The legal framework also failed to properly address key regulatory areas such as the
requirements for strong board governance, supervisory and remedial powers, risk-based capital
requirements, accounting and audit requirements, financial disclosure rules, and restrictions on
connected and affiliate transactions. The regulation on loan loss reserves was particularly weak, as
it focused on delinquencies, allowing banks to understate their asset quality problems.
16.   Throughout the 1990s, regulations were adopted and refined.  In particular, several
amendments to the Banking Law were passed in October 1999, which included elements of board



-6-
governance, additional remedial measures (allowing the NBS to charge down bank capital against
losses), financial disclosure requirements, and certain aspects of insider transactions. However, the
1999 amendments still left serious gaps in all the above areas and in their implementation.
17.   Bank supervision also remained deficient throughout the 1990s. The NBS established a
bank supervision department after independence from the Czechoslovak federation, but the
independence of the supervisory function was not well established. Many critical supervisory
decisions were shared with the MOF. Bank supervision was severely understaffed and lacked
leadership and organizational structure. The NBS initiated a development program with foreign
technical assistance, and by the end of the 1990s the supervision department housed many of the
supervisory functions practiced worldwide. However, these improvements were insufficient to
contain unsound banking practices and mounting bank distress. Significant improvements in
identifying problems at an early stage and initiating corrective actions had not been accomplished,
and bank supervision remained severely constrained by the pervasive presence of the State in
troubled banks, and the continued shared responsibilities with the MOF.
C.   The Enterprise Sector at the End of the 1990s
18.   Progress at Privatization. By the end of the 1990s, most enterprises in Slovakia, excluding
those in the utilities sector, had been privatized and the private sector accounted for more than 80
percent of GDP. The privatization program was implemented in two major waves. The first
wave-concluded in 1993-comprised the sale of about 9,500 small establishments for cash and
the privatization of more than 1,000 medium and large enterprises, primarily through a mass
voucher privatization program. People could bid for enterprise shares with their vouchers, or place
them in newly created investment funds, designed to take the population's vouchers, bid for
enterprise shares, and drive enterprise restructuring. However, due to the lack of adequate
company and capital market regulation (adequate board governance, prohibition of insider trading,
proper disclosure, minority shareholder protection rules), voucher privatization was followed by
fraud and stripping of enterprise assets by insiders.
19.   The second wave of privatization was expected to be implemented in 1995 through voucher
methods, but the Government of Prime Minister Meciar, formed in December 1994, canceled the
second voucher privatization in favor of direct sales to domestic buyers. Unfortunately, the second
wave of privatization was also marked by lack of transparency and corruption. The selection of
buyers was heavily influenced by political considerations, and these buyers acquired the enterprises
at very low prices and with generous financing terms. In January 1996, the Government exchanged
the outstanding second wave vouchers held by the population for 5-year privatization bonds with a
total value of Sk33 billion. About Sk3O billion remains outstanding and the bonds are due in
December 200 1.
20.   The major utilities in the energy, telecommunications, and water sectors, as well the
railways and a number of enterprises in the armaments, machinery, and pharmaceuticals industries
were excluded from privatization by the Strategic Companies Act of 1995. At the end of the
1990s, many enterprises in the utilities sector suffered from a number of technical and economic
problems, including low administered tariffs and substantial cross-subsidies from industrial and
commercial users to households. A number of the utilities were suffering from severe financial



-7-
difficulties, and were proving to be an increasing burden on the State budget, which had to cover
ongoing operating losses while honoring State guarantees in most of their foreign borrowings.
21.   Financial Performance of Enterprises. The financial performance of Slovak enterprises
remained poor throughout the 1990s, as indicated by the decline in gross profits and the increase in
gross losses (Table 4). By 1999, Slovakia had one of highest ratios of losses to GDP in Central
Europe, and 35 percent of loss-making enterprises were not able to cover material and labor costs.
The reasons for the insufficient restructuring and the persistence of large enterprise losses were
rooted in the poor governance structures that emerged from the two waves of privatization, and the
lack of creditor discipline that resulted from the lack of progress in bank privatization and the
dysfunctional collateral and bankruptcy regimes. As in the case of other countries experiencing
situations of corporate distress, loss-making firms in Slovakia have financed their losses through a
variety of sources, including unpaid interest, arrears on loan principals, tax arrears, and arrears to
suppliers.

22.   The Legal Framework for the Private Sector: Corporate Governance. The corporate
governance architecture in Slovakia is defined by a number of laws, including the Commercial
Code, the Accounting Law, the Auditing Law, the Securities Law, and the Law on Collective
Investments. Despite some amendments to these laws during the 1990s, the corporate governance
architecture remained poor through the decade, including weak accountability of boards to
shareholders, poor financial disclosure rules, weak auditing standards, few constraints on insider
trading, and weak minority shareholder protection. Supervision of capital market activities was
conducted inside the MOF and also proved weak. The extensive stripping of corporate assets
associated with the two waves of privatization, and allowed by weak regulation and supervision of
companies and capital market activities, generated a loss of confidence of the population on capital
market institutions that will take time to restore.  At present, the equity market is barely
operational, with less than a dozen corporations traded in the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE),
down from the initial 1,000 enterprises from the first wave, and there have been no capital
increases or initial public offerings.
23.   The Legal Framework for the Private Sector: Bankruptcy and Collateral Regimes. As
mentioned before, the poor financial performance of Slovak enterprises was also due to weak
monitoring of enterprises by creditors. The lack of creditor discipline was partly due to the
presence of large State banks subject to political interference, but also to the failure of the legal
system to provide strong rights to creditors. Indeed, both non-bankruptcy enforcement procedures
and the bankruptcy framework remained dysfunctional throughout the 1990s, constituting a
separate and powerful obstacle to creditor-imposed discipline.



-8-
24.   Although the bankruptcy law was improved by a number of amendments in the 1990s, the
bankruptcy system remained inefficient and dysfunctional, due to serious remaining problems with
the law itself, the weak institutional infrastructure, and weak enforcement. On its face, the law
allowed for both financial restructuring (compositions in Slovak parlance) and for liquidation
(bankruptcy in Slovak parlance). However, the restructuring track was rarely used, and the
liquidation track proved very inefficient, as indicated by the long period of completion (3-7 years),
and very low recovery rates (3 percent of the claims). One of the most serious problems with the
law was the lack of creditor rights under bankruptcy. Once the enterprise was declared bankrupt,
the court selected a liquidator without input from the creditors, and the liquidator carried out the
procedures with very little participation from creditors. Several liquidators were criticized for
lacking the requisite expertise to effectively carry out their tasks, and even for engaging in self-
dealing. This problem, combined with the fraudulent transfer of assets prior to or in the context of
bankruptcy, resulted in long administrative delays and unsatisfactory outcomes.
25.   Amendments to the Foreclosure (Execution) Law introduced in 1998 allowed more
possibilities for banks to foreclose on collateral. This strategy increased the bank's rate of
collection of bad claims somewhat, but it did not necessarily produce optimal results for the
economy as a whole. This is because foreclosures sometimes involved piecemeal liquidation of
enterprises, some of which could have been preserved as "going concerns", if submitted to proper
restructuring under a well functioning bankruptcy framework. At the same time, collateral
remained essentially restricted to real estate, because pledges over movable property remained
difficult to achieve due to the absence of a modem secured transactions law and central registry for
recording pledges in movable assets. Due to these deficiencies, the collateral regime produced
unsatisfactory outcomes throughout the 1990s. On the one side, distressed enterprises that could
have been preserved as going concerns were frequently liquidated piecemeal, due to some
improvements in the foreclosure of collateral (real estate) not matched by improvements in
bankruptcy procedures. On the other side, creditworthy enterprises were frequently deprived from
credits due to the narrow range of allowable collaterals.
IV. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
A.    Overview
26.   The Government has started to implement a comprehensive program of bank and enterprise
reforms that comprises four basic components. The first is a program of bank restructuring and
privatization.  The second is a substantial set of improvements in banking regulation and
supervision. The third is an ambitious scheme to workout the large volume of non-performing
loans and tax arrears. Finally, the fourth component is an overhaul of the legal framework for
companies and capital market activities. The Government intends to implement its reform program
under a stable macroeconomic framework, and has demonstrated its resolve by implementing a
successful stabilization program in 1999 and 2000, and by adopting a macroeconomic program for
2001 and 2002, endorsed in an IMIF Staff Monitored Program (SMP).

B.    The Macroeconomic Framework
27.   Stabilization Efforts Since 1999.  Following a renewed bout of currency turbulence in
May 1999, the new Government introduced a package of stabilization measures which resulted in a
nearly 2 percent of GDP improvement in the primary deficit (Table 1). The new Government also
significantly increased administered prices (gas, electricity, heating, post, and railways) in two
rounds, curtailed the granting of guarantees, and began structural reforms in the enterprise and
financial sectors. These reforms resulted in a sharp decline of fixed investment from 38 to 31
percent of GDP which, together with the tightened fiscal stance, contributed to a significant
reduction in the current account deficit to 5.0 percent of GDP in 1999. The tightened fiscal stance
allowed the NBS to ease monetary policy somewhat. The improved policy mix and the structural
reforms contributed to a sharp reduction in real interest rates, a nominal appreciation of the koruna,
an increase in foreign reserves, and a rapid decline in the spreads on Slovak eurobonds (Figure 1).
28.   The deficit of the General Government was essentially unchanged in 2000, but the current
account deficit declined further to 3.7 percent of GDP. This improvement was underpinned by
strong export performance, following the acceleration of growth in the EU and strong productivity
growth in exporting industries. At the same time, import growth was contained by a further decline
in fixed investment (to 30 percent of GDP) and by a sharp 3.4 percent reduction in real private
consumption resulting from a third round of increases in administered prices and the decline of real
wages. Most importantly, FDI flows reached 10 percent of GDP, exceeding the current account
deficit by a wide margin and leading to a reduction in net external debt for the first time since 1993
(Table 1). The large FDI flows were in part the result of the successful privatization of the Slovak
telecom company. However, non-privatization related FDI reached nearly 4 percent of GDP in
2000, reflecting the Government's policy of encouraging the entry of foreign capital.
29.   The successful stabilization of the economy has come with large short-term costs, however.
The contraction of domestic demand slowed GDP growth to about 2 percent in 1999 and 2000.
The unemployment rate has risen from 13 percent to 19 percent, as a result of lower GDP growth
and stronger financial discipline. Inflation has temporarily accelerated to an average of about 11
percent in 1999 and 2000 following the overdue liberalization of administered prices and the
increase of VAT rates. Fortunately, these short-term costs do not seem to have decreased the
political will to consolidate the stabilization and complete the reform program.

30.   The Medium-term  Macroeconomic Framework.  The Government's medium-term
macroeconomic framework is expected to consolidate the positive results of the 1999-2000
stabilization program, and has been designed with two major objectives in mind: first, to ensure a
stable environment for the successful completion of the structural reforms and a resumption of
growth on a sustained basis; and second, to demonstrate the country's capacity to join the EU by
the middle of the decade. The Government's macroeconomic program for 2001 and 2002 has been
elaborated in collaboration with the IMF, as reflected in the Statement of Economic Policies
approved by the Slovak Cabinet on March 28, 2001. The Fund has agreed to monitor this program
in the context of a Staff Monitored Program (SMP). Macroeconomic policies in the period 2003-
2005 will be primarily driven by the Government's objective to join the EU at the earliest possible
date. Meeting this objective will require a demonstrated capacity to maintain a stable economic
environment and, shortly after accession, to comply with the terms of the EU's Stability and
Growth Pact which, inter alia, calls for structurally balanced budgets.
31.   The 2001 budget was elaborated under difficult initial conditions, including a substantial
loss in projected revenues and increases in expenditures due to external commitments. The
revenue loss-projected at 2 percent of GDP-is due primarily to the reduction in the corporate
income tax rate from 40 percent to 29 percent (a measure expected to promote foreign and
domestic investments) and the elimination of a temporary import surcharge introduced in 1999. At
the same time, expenditures related to structural fiscal reforms will increase, including civil service
reform (though such a reform should result in savings in the medium-term), as will expenditures
related to EU and NATO commitments.
32.   The 2001 budget contains a number of measures designed to offset these revenue losses and
expenditure increases, but the offsetting is not full, because Parliament was reluctant to adopt a
very stringent budget after two consecutive years of contracting real domestic demand and slow
growth. As shown in Table 5, the 2001 budget agreed with the IMF in the context of the SMP
implies a small increase in the general government deficit (excluding privatization revenues, called
guarantees, and bank restructuring costs), from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 3.9 percent of GDP
in 2001. The modest fiscal expansion in 2001 does not raise concern, however, because it is taking
place in a period of large privatization-related FDI, and because it is being underpinned by a strong
package of structural public sector reforms agreed with the 1MF in the SMP (Annex 1). Such
reforms are expected to put Slovakia's public finances in a much sounder footing in the medium-
term.
33.   During the first quarter of 2001 the Government issued SK105 billion in special bonds to
restructure the banks, the equivalent of nearly 11 percent of 2001 GDP, as shown in Table 5.
These explicit Government bonds will replace temporary loans from the banks to the workout
agencies that were issued at the start of the bank restructuring program, and that have been
guaranteed by the Government (see the banking restructuring section). The increase in explicit
Government debt will amount to only 5 percent of GDP, however, as the Government intends to
use part of the large proceeds of privatization in 2001 (estimated at around 10 percent of GDP)2 to
2 The privatization of the gas sector will account for a large share of the total revenues expected for 2001.

retire its explicit debt, as well as the privatization bonds issued by the NPF.3 The Government also
intends to use the large privatization revenues for the repayment of other outstanding liabilities of
the public sector, including the arrears of some social funds, and some borrowing guarantees.

34.   GDP growth is likely to increase slightly to 3 percent in 2001, driven by the modest fiscal
expansion, a resumption of private investment, and an increase in consumption resulting from the
redemption of NPF bonds and a return to positive real wage growth after 2 years of decline. As a
result of the expected increase in domestic demand and the slowdown in exports due to slower EU
growth, the current account deficit is projected to increase to about 4.8 percent of GDP in 2001, up
from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2000. However, the larger current account deficit projected for 2001
does not present much concern, as it is expected to be more than covered by the substantial FDI
flows projected for the year-FDI is conservatively estimated at 12 percent of GDP due to large
privatizations and a sustained increase in greenfield investment. As a result, external vulnerability
should decline further as net external debt continues to decline in 2001 and international reserves
are expected to exceed 4 months of imports.
3The remaining 2.7 percent of GDP in outstanding NPF bonds will be redeemed in 2001. About 1.5 percent of GDP
in NPF bonds are held by households.



-13-
35.   GDP growth is expected to accelerate further to 4-6 percent p.a. in 2002-2005, driven by an
increase in private investment and consumption. The envisaged growth rates can be comfortably
achieved, given Slovakia's high ratio of investment to GDP and the expected increase in efficiency
that will result from the structural reforms. A prudent fiscal stance would call for a steady
reduction in the fiscal deficit to ensure that the current account deficit remains in a sustainable
range of 4 to 4.5 percent of GDP, despite the growth of private investment and consumption. Such
a level of current account deficit would be consistent with a declining path of the ratio of net
external debt to GDP if, as seems likely, greenfield investment continues to flow at about 3 to 4
percent of GDP in the years following 2002, when privatization revenues are expected to taper off.
36.   The Government recognizes the need to tighten the fiscal stance in 2002, and has agreed
under the SMP to reduce the 2002 budget deficit to a range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent of GDP (excluding
privatization revenues, called guarantees and bank restructuring costs). Such a fiscal tightening
would allow the authorities to rebalance the policy mix and relieve pressure on monetary policy in
2002, which will have to continue to cope with large expected capital inflows (due primarily to the
privatization of electricity utilities). Such a fiscal tightening would leave more room for a
resumption of growth in real credit to the private sector, following several years of decline, thus
facilitating a moderate increase in private investment.
37.   In subsequent years the budget deficit is expected to be trimmed further by about 0.5
percent of GDP per year, to fall below 2 percent of GDP by 2005. The fiscal path envisaged for
the 2002-2005 period involves an accumulated fiscal adjustment of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP,
opening room for a moderate expansion of private investment and consumption relative to GDP,
concurrent with a slight reduction in the current account deficit relative to GDP. The fiscal path
would also ensure a steady reduction in public debt and total external debt relative to GDP, and
would place Slovakia closer to the balanced structural budget required by the Stability and Growth
Pact (in the years following EU accession).
38.   The medium-term macroeconomic framework includes a build up of official international
reserves to nearly 5 months of imports, designed to strengthen Slovakia's external position and
reduce further the country's vulnerability to external shocks. Such an annual build up of reserves
together with current account deficits of 4 to 4.5 percent of GDP and the stream of scheduled
external amortizations define Slovakia's medium-term financing requirements (Table 6). FDI is
expected to cover more than half of these financing requirements during the 2001-2002 period and
about one third during 2003-2005, after the privatization program ends. With conservative
assumptions on portfolio investment and net short-term capital, an average of about US$1.7 billion
per year in medium and long-term debt disbursements would be required during this period.
Slovakia should have no difficulty in meeting such a level of debt financing, which is one third the
level of new disbursements sustained in the mid- and late-1990s. The proposed EFSAL would not
only help Slovakia meet its financing requirements, but would also strengthen Slovakia's
creditworthiness and ability to borrow in private international markets on termns more favorable
than in the late-1990s.

C.   Banking Sector Reforms
39.   The Government is aware that the pervasive presence of the State in the banking system had
devastating effects on the financial health of the banks and on the allocation of resources in the
Slovak economy.  To break this negative historical pattern, the Government has started
implementing a banking sector reform that is based on the divestiture of the State from the banking
system and on the establishment of sound governance structures in the banks. Specifically, the
banking sector reformn has the following components: (i) the restructuring and privatization of the
three large State banks; (ii) a program to resolve troubled small and medium banks; (iii) the reform
of the deposit insurance system; and, (iv) the substantial strengthening of the regulation and
supervision of the banking sector. The Government intends to complete the bank privatization
component by the end of 2001, and to achieve substantial progress in improving the regulatory and
supervisory framework during the same period.
40.   Restructuring and Privatization of the Three Large State Banks. In 1999 and 2000 the
Government restructured the three large banks (VUB, SLSP, and IRB) through two basic
operations. The first was a Skl8.9 billion direct equity infusion, conducted at the end of 1999, and
the second was a SklO5 billion carve-out of bad assets, conducted in December 1999 and June
2000. The bad assets were transferred to the Slovak Consolidation Agency (SKA) and to
Konsolidacna Banka (KOB), and were replaced by State-guaranteed loans, from the restructured
banks, to SKA and KOB earning an interest rate of 10 percent p.a. As shown in Table 7, these
operations have restored the banks' profitability and increased their CARs to levels above 12
percent, according to IAS. Although a residual stock of bad loans has remained in their balance
sheets, these loans are adequately covered by collateral and provisions.
41.   The recapitalization of the large State banks was implemented in the context of a sound and
transparent privatization program, and was accompanied by the imposition of conditions and
controls on the banks during the pre-privatization period. At the end of 1999, the Government
selected reputable privatization advisors for the three banks. To ensure the improvement of these



-15-
institutions during the pre-privatization period, the Government replaced the management of the
banks, and created an intra-agency bank privatization and control unit. This unit, which resides
inside the MOF, also receives foreign technical assistance. Since these measures were introduced,
the banks have undergone a process of self-restructuring, incorporating cost reductions, layoffs, and
technological improvements.

42.   The State-guaranteed loans to SKA and KOB were converted into State bonds in early
2001. The first bond issue amounted to Sk83.7 billion and took place in January 2001. It was
followed by a bond issue of Sk2l.3 billion in March 2001. The bonds were issued with maturities
of 5, 7, and 10 years with a combination of fixed and floating interest rates. The bonds will pay
interest twice a year, with the first payment being made one year from the date of issue. The
conversion of guaranteed loans into State bonds was done to facilitate the privatization process and
to assist the banks by providing assets which can be used to address liquidity and other risks.
43.   The issue of SklO5 billion of State bonds (the equivalent of 11 percent of the 2001 GDP)
implies a substantial increase in the Government's domestic debt. However, as mentioned before,
the total public debt is not excessive-32 percent of GDP at end-2000-and will be reduced
through the use of privatization revenues. The interest payments on the special bonds will amount
to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2002, but will decline over time with GDP growth. Overall, the costs of
bank restructuring in Slovakia seem to be in line with the costs observed in some of the leading
transitional countries-by way of comparison, Hungary and Slovenia spent initially the equivalent
of 1.6 and 1 percent of GDP per year in interest payments, respectively, to restructure their banking
systems.
44.   The privatization of the large State banks gained momentum in early 2001, with the sale of
4
a 87 percent stake in SLSP to Erste Bank of Austria in January for US$400 million, and the sale a
25 percent stake in VUB to the EFC and the EBRD in February. The Government intends to
complete as quickly as possible the privatization of VUB and IRB. In the case of VUB, the tender
process commenced in early February 2001, two reputable strategic investors have been qualified,
and have initiated due diligence procedures. The Government expects to complete the sale of a
controlling stake in the bank to a strategic investor by mid-2001. The privatization of IRB has also
reached an advanced stage, with the near completion of due diligence by a potential strategic
4 The revenues from bank privatization are expected to reduce the net costs of bank restructuring by at least 20 percent.
The sale of SLSP alone amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP, or more than 15 percent of the total stock of recapitalization
bonds.



-16-
investor, and divestiture of the Government's stake should be completed by mid-2001. Conclusion
of Privatization of VUB through sale of at least 67 percent of the bank's shares to private strategic
investor(s), is a condition of second tranche release. The sale of not less than 67 percent of IRB's
shares to strategic investor(s) or initiation of alternative resolution procedures is a condition of
second tranche release.
45.   The Consolidation of the Medium and Small Banks. In 2000, the Government and the
NBS made substantial progress in implementing a plan to resolve the 7 medium and small banks
which had become insolvent as a result of poor governance and political interference in credit
decisions. Three banks were placed in liquidation, one was sold to a foreign strategic investor, and
a third was merged with SLSP (which was subsequently privatized). Two troubled medium banks
with assets amounting to 4 percent of total bank assets remained to be resolved in early 2001.
Plans to resolve these two banks are already advanced, and the Government and the NBS have a
commitment to complete their resolution by mid-2001. Full compliance of all banks with NBS'
prudential regulations or initiation of conservatorship or liquidation for non-compliant banks is a
condition of second tranche release. Full compliance of all banks with NBS's prudential
regulations is a condition of third tranche release.
46.  In addition to progress in resolving the troubled medium banks, the Government is also
making progress in divesting from two other public banks that have been compliant with prudential
regulations. Komunalna Banka (a medium bank owned by several Slovak municipalities) was sold
to foreign strategic investors in 2000, and the Government intends to complete the privatization of
Banka Slovakia (a small State bank) by end-2001. Sale of at least 67 percent of Banka Slovakia's
shares to private strategic investors is a condition of third tranche release.
47.   Reform of the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks. As mentioned before, during
the second half of 1999 the regulatory framework for the banking sector was significantly
improved, through amendments to the Banking Law and amendments to the Act on the Tax
Treatment of Reserves and Provision. The amendments to this latter Act introduced for the first
time full deductibility of required loan loss provisions for banks. This eliminated a historic
distortion in the tax system that had led to the taxation of fictitious bank profits, encouraged the
misclassification of bad loans, and hindered the build up of prudential reserves.
48.   While the October 1999 amendments to the Banking Law represented meaningful steps
forward, it still failed to address weaknesses in key areas, including: (i) supervisory powers and
independence; (ii) responsibility and accountability of management and supervisory boards; (iii)
special relationships (connected parties); (iv) affiliate relationships; (v) large exposures; (vi)
regulatory reporting; (vii) financial disclosure, including, inter alia: financial statement amendment
and redisclosure in the event of mistakes in statements; (viii) risk management; (ix) capital
adequacy, and (x) bank closure rules and deposit insurance.
49.   The NBS and the Government are aware of the need to strengthen all these areas of banking
regulation, in order to put an end to the culture of regulatory forbearance that has prevailed in the
banking system, enhance the accountability of all economic agents, and set the foundations for a
robust banking sector. To this end, the Government and the NBS have prepared an impressive
package of legal reforms that amount to an overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking



-17-
activities. The package includes amendments to the Slovak Constitution and the NBS Law, a new
Banking Law, amendments to the Accounting Law and the Auditing Law, amendments to the
Deposit Insurance Law, and several new NBS Decrees. These comprehensive reforms are
summarized below. More detailed information is provided in Annex II.
50.   Amendments to the Slovak Constitution and the NBS Law. The first round of reformns to
the legal framework for banking has already taken place, with the Adoption by Parliament of
amendments to the Slovak Constitution and the NBS Law in the first half of 2001. These
amendments will become effective in July 1, 2001 and May 1, 2001, respectively, and were aimed
at strengthening the powers and the accountability of the NBS in the area of bank supervision. The
constitutional amendments clarify the NBS powers to issue binding regulation, while the
amendments to the NBS Law eliminate the role of the MoF in banking supervision, improves the
legal protection to NBS bank supervisors, and allows supervisors to share information with other
supervisory agencies. These amendments complement in a substantive way the strengthening of
supervisory powers introduced by the new Banking Law.
51.   The New Banking Law. The new Banking Law was drafted with the participation of the
World Bank and addresses all the weaknesses identified above. In particular, the new Law
strengthens effectively key areas of regulation, including bank governance rules, enforcement
powers, and accounting and auditing rules. The main improvements in these areas is summarized
below, whereas a more detailed account is provided in Annex II.
52.  Improved rules for bank governance constitute an important part of the new Banking Law.
The duties and responsibilities of management and supervisory boards will be much more clearly
defined. Supervisory boards will be made responsible for providing effective governance and
supervision, appointing qualified management teams, and approving key business strategies and
risk control policies. Management boards will be required to develop internal policies and
procedures to address the bank's risks. The failure of a bank's governing bodies to fulfill their
responsibilities will be subject to legal action by the supervisor and bank investors.
53.   The new Banking Law also contains several provisions that will strengthen the enforcement
powers of bank supervision in a fundamental way, and that complement the improvements
introduced by the amendments to the Constitution and the NBS Law. Among other new
provisions, the new Law introduces prompt corrective action (PCA) rules which trigger supervisory
responses based on certain capital thresholds. Additional powers to direct capital increase in cases
of capital deficiency or higher risk conditions will be included. In addition, the new Law enables
the NBS to enter into enforceable agreements with boards for plans of corrective action, and directs
the NBS to introduce conservatorship whenever the bank's CAR falls under 4 percent.
54.   The new Banking Law also introduces several improvements in the areas of banking
accounting, disclosure, and auditing, designed to enhance transparency and market discipline, and
improve the effectiveness of the supervision function. These include a number of new provisions
that improve the frequency and quality of disclosure, including obligatory quarterly financial
disclosure, and obligatory re-disclosure in the case of material rnistakes. The new Banking Law
also introduces important improvements in bank auditing, including increased independence of
auditors vis-a-vis bank management, greater control of bank supervisors over the appointment of



-18-
the auditor, and obligations for the auditor to report to the supervisor any breaches of law or risk of
material insolvency of the bank. A new draft Banking Law containing all the improvements
described above has already been submitted to Parliament. Adoption by Parliament of a
satisfactory new Banking Law is a condition of second tranche release. Adoption of the Decrees
and regulations necessary to support implementation of the new Banking Law is a condition of
second tranche release.
55.   Amendments to the Accounting Law and the Auditing Law. The Govemment is aware
that some of the required improvements in bank accounting and auditing cannot be introduced by
the Banking Law alone, and is preparing the necessary amendments to the Accounting Law and the
Auditing Law. In the accounting area, the Government is engaged in a major effort to harmonize
Slovak accounting standards with LAS, and expect to conclude this exercise during 2002.
However, the Government intends to accelerate the harmonization with IAS for banks, in order to
protect the large public sector investment in the financial sector. Two critical improvements that.
will be introduced ahead of the planned full transition to IAS include the mark to market valuation
of securities in banks' portfolios on a quarterly basis, and the suspension of interest accrual for
assets 90 days past due and longer. The first improvement will be introduced through an NBS
Decree that will be enacted in the second half of 2001. The second improvement will be
introduced through amendments to the Accounting Law that will be submitted to Parliament in the
second half of 2001. Enactment of an NBS Decree improving valuation of securities will be a
condition of second tranche release. Completion of draft amendments to the Accounting Law and
other relevant legislation stopping accrual of unpaid interest on assets past due 90 days or longer
is a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of these amendments is a
condition of third tranche release.
56.   In the auditing area, several improvements will also be introduced. These will include
introducing a code of conduct for auditors, strengthening the licensing and monitoring
responsibilities of the Chamber of Auditors, and clarifying and increasing the legal liabilities of
auditors for negligence and misconduct. The Government will submit the necessary amendments
to the Auditing Law to Parliament in the second half of 2001 and expects these amendments to be
adopted in the first half of 2002. Completion of satisfactory amendments to the Auditing Law and
other relevant legislation that, inter alia, increase the accountability and legal liability of auditors
will be a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of these amendments will be
a condition of third tranche release.
57.   Reform of Bank Closure Rules and the Deposit Insurance System. The payment of the
insured deposits of the bankrupt small banks depleted the resources of the Deposit Insurance Fund
(DIF) and forced the institution to borrow from the NBS in order to honor its legal obligations.
This also placed an undue burden on the solvent banks, which have been subject to high
contributions to the DIF. Although these problems were due in part to the failure of bank
supervision to intervene promptly in troubled banks, they were also due are deficiencies in the rules
for bank closure that resulted in an excessive level of net liabilities to the DIF, and in the design of
deposit insurance that reduced the incentive of depositors to monitor banks.



-19-
58.   To address these problems, the Government will change the rules and procedures of bank
closure and deposit insurance, to avoid abuse, enhance market discipline, and improve the long-run
viability of the DIF. These measures are particularly important given the need to increase the
deposit insurance coverage to EU norms in the future. First, in the second half of 2001 the DIEF
will start implementing a financial plan that will allow the institution to repay its liabilities to the
NBS and build up its reserves to adequate levels. Second, by mid-2001 the new Banking Law will
become effective, introducing much stricter rules for bank conservatorship. Adoption by the DIF of
a financing plan that restores its long-run financial viability will be -a condition of second tranche
release. Satisfactory implementation of this plan will be a condition of third tranche release.
Adoption by Parliament of a new Banking Law introducing stricter conservatorship rules is a
condition of second tranche release.
59.   Finally, by mid-2001 the Government will submit to Parliament several amendments to the
Deposit Insurance Law that will limit the liability of the DIEF, by, inter alia, reducing coverage of
insured deposits to 90 percent of insured deposits above five times the average monthly wage,
while maintaining the current limit of thirty times the average monthly wage.5  Submission of
satisfactory amendments to the Deposit Insurance Law to Parliament is a condition of second
tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of satisfactory amendments to the Deposit Insurance Law
is a condition of third tranche release. Completion of a study for structural reform of the DIF
comparing the Slovak system to systems in the OECD and EU, and drawing recommendations for
structural re-design and improvement is a condition of third tranche release.
60.   Improvements in Supervisory Capacity. Efforts to strengthen banking regulation and the
enforcement powers of supervision are being supported by improvements in the skills, techniques,
and resources of bank supervisors.  In order to identify areas requiring improvement, a
comprehensive evaluation of bank supervision (based on the Basle 25 Core Principles for Effective
Bank Supervision) was jointly carried out by World Bank and NBS staff in mid-2000. Using the
results of this evaluation, the NBS supervision department elaborated a comprehensive supervisory
concept that has been endorsed by NBS Board, and that will be the basis for a multi-year
supervisory development plan (SDP). The SDP refines the mission and focus of supervision,
adopts an improved and more proactive approach to bank oversight through further developing of
on- and off-site functions, and the design of supervisory strategies for each institution. The NBS
and the Government have a commitment to fully implement the SDP in 2001 and future years, and
will provide the necessary operational independence and the allocation of additional financial'and
human resources to the supervision function. Adoption by the NBS Board of a satisfactory
Supervisory Development Plan agreed with the Bank is a condition of second tranche release.
Satisfactory progress in designing the policies and procedures for a proactive approach to bank
supervision is also a condition of second tranche release. Satisfactory implementation of the SDP
is a condition of third tranche release.
5The current limit is equivalent to roughly Euro 8,500. The Law prescribes a gradual increase in coverage to Euro
20,000, which is the minimum level specified in the relevant EU directive.

D.    Enterprise Sector Reforms
61.   The Government has adopted a strategy to promote enterprise restructuring and reduce
enterprise losses that has two central components. The first component is a comprehensive
program for the workout of bad assets, including the large volume of non-performing claims held
by SKA and KOB, and the large stock of tax and social contribution arrears. The second
component is a comprehensive set of legal reforms, designed to improve the collateral and
bankruptcy regimes, and the internal mechanisms of corporate governance. These reforms,
combined with the banking sector reforms described above, are expected to lead to a transfer of
weak enterprises and/or their assets to better owners (through reorganization or liquidation),
improve financial discipline in the enterprise sector, increase the access of small and medium
enterprises to credit, and ultimately result in a much better allocation of resources, with positive
consequences for Slovakia's growth performance in the long-run.
62.   The Workout Strategy. As mentioned before, in 1999 and 2000 a total of SklO5 billion of
claims was carved out of the large State banks into SKA and KOB in support of the bank
restructuring program. Out of this total, approximately Sk95 billion were transferred to SKA and
the remaining SklO billion were transferred to KOB. Before the recent carve-outs, KOB already
controlled an additional Sk3O billion of claims carved out of banks prior to 1999, of which Skl2
billion consisted of distressed assets. Therefore, the total volume of distressed assets to be worked
out amounts to Skl 17 billion, or the equivalent of 12 percent of 2001 GDP, as indicated in Table 8.
The other assets held by KOB consist of old housing loans and other assets that do not require
prompt resolution.

Sources: SKA, MOF
Notes: 1/ Estimated for end-2000
63.   The Government is aware that the restructuring of the enterprise sector will depend to a
large extent on a rapid transfer of ownership and management of SKA's and KOB's distressed
assets to the private sector, where superior skills, resources, and incentives can be brought to bear.
To achieve this, the Government has designed a multifaceted workout strategy using a combination
of sales of pools of loans to private investors, auctioning of individual loans to smaller investors,
the outsourcing of collection through asset/legal management contracts, and, where appropriate
after suitable due diligence, the writing off of non-collectable claims. The legal framework is also
being strengthened, in order to facilitate the restructuring of distressed enterprises by investors, and
to improve the price received in the sales.
64.   The Government is setting up an institutional framework that will allow it to implement this
diversified strategy in a relatively short period of time. In July 2001, KOB's banking license will
be withdrawn and its Sk22 billion of distressed assets will be transferred to SKA. The housing



-21-
loans and other assets will be transferred to the Guarantee Bank (a special, small State bank). KOB
staff experienced in workouts and restructuring will also be transferred to SKA. The main
rationale for transferring KOB's distressed assets to SKA lies in the fact that the two institutions
have several common borrowers, and consolidating these claims will both enhance their value to
private sector purchasers and provide efficiencies in their management where sale is not possible.
The scarcity of workout skills in Slovakia is another reason to combine the resources of the two
institutions. Finally, SKA has been created with more transparent governance structures and
should be able to handle the assets more independently and efficiently. Removal of KOB's license
and transfer of its distressed assets to SKA is a condition of second tranche release.
65.  In order to achieve the objective of the rapid resolution of distressed assets by SKA, the
agency was established with good governance rules and transparent tendering procedures, required
to attract the best qualified firms and investors to the purchase and management of its claims.
These policies and procedures have included the creation of an investment board empowered to
provide advice to management and review and control decisions made by the management board.
The investment board is composed of five independent members, at least two of whom are foreign
experts sponsored by donors, and will function using super majority voting rules designed to create
public confidence in its decisions.
66.   With extensive technical assistance by donors (EU-PHARE, USAID, UK-DFID), the
Government has established ambitious workout targets for SKA, and expects most of the workouts
to be concluded by the end of 2002. Two tenders were completed in the first part of 2001. The
first comprises a pool of Sk 12.6 billion targeted for sale to specialized foreign investors, while the
second consists of an auction of Sk3.6 billion of smaller loans to domestic investors and trade
purchasers. SKA has successfully concluded the sale of more than 10 percent of its assets to the
private sector through these two pilot programs. These programs will provide useful experience for
the SKA in designing and executing further asset sales. Sale to the private sector or outsourcing to
the private sector, or writing off after appropriate due diligence, of not less than 30 percent of SKA
assets is a condition of second tranche release. Sale to the private sector or outsourcing to the
private sector, or writing off after appropriate due diligence, of not less than 50 percent of SKA
assets is a condition of third tranche release. All sale and outsourcing contracts will be conducted
through open tenders. The Government intends that this total will rise to 70 percent by end-2002
and to 100 percent by end-2003.
67.   The Government has also started consolidating claims held by the Tax Authorities, the
Health Insurance, Social Security, Pension, and Unemployment Funds. The consolidation of these
tax and social contribution arrears with claims held by SKA and KOB will eliminate
counterproductive competition between various State agencies, reducing administrative expenses
and increasing the revenues generated by the sales of claims (by enabling investors to purchase all
of the state's claims against a debtor in a single package). The Government intends to submit
enabling legislation to Parliament in the second half of 2001, to remove legal obstacles to
consolidation, and expects this legislation to be adopted by Parliament in the first half of 2002, at
which time management responsibility for all state claims will be passed to the SKA. Submission
to Parliament of a special law allowing the resolution of tax and public fund arrears including
provisions allowing forgiveness, compromise, third party management of claims, and sale at a



-22-
discount is a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of a special law
allowing the resolution of tax and public fund arrears including provisions allowing forgiveness,
compromise, third party management of claims, and sale at a discount is a condition of third
tranche release.
68.   The Reform of the Insolvency Regime. In August 2000, a new set of amendments to the
bankruptcy law became effective, which are designed to correct some the most serious problems
with the law, reported by creditors and practitioners alike. The new amendments provide creditors
with more reliable enforcement mechanisms for commencing bankruptcy procedures, based on a
stiffer test of insolvency that allows commencement within 30 days of default, and affords creditors
a stronger voice and role in the process, by calling more frequent meetings of creditors and in
selecting a trustee of their choice. The process itself is also streamlined by imposing maximum
time limits for administration and by allowing for more flexible and transparent procedures for
operations pending a sale of the business or auction of assets. The amendments have only been in
force for a short period of time and it is premature to assess the benefits. However, it appears that
some advances are already being made to strengthen the credit culture and impose greater financial
discipline on the corporate sector, as reflected by an increase in the number of voluntary debt
workouts that are being negotiated between lenders and their borrowers. Likewise, lenders report
higher recovery rates from borrowers, which they attribute to the benefits achieved through the
recent amendments.
69.   Despite these preliminary signs of improvements, the Government is aware that there is still
scope for improvements in the bankruptcy framework. The recent amendments have introduced
significant improvements in liquidation mechanisms, which will speed the resolution of unviable
enterprises and promote out-of-court restructurings (due to a more credible bankruptcy threat).
However, whereas the amendments have also improved the rules for court-led restructuring
mechanisms, there is still scope for improvements in this area.  There is also scope for
improvements in the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures, through a better regulation of the
professionals (e.g., trustees and liquidators) and improvements in the court system. In order to
implement a modern and fully functional bankruptcy system  in Slovakia, an inter-agency
commission comprised of public and private sector representatives has been established to oversee
the next phase of reforms in the insolvency process. The Commission will have a broad mandate
to formulate recommendations for further reforms to the bankruptcy framework. The work of the
Commission will proceed with funding and assistance provided under a grant from the Institutional
Development Fund of the World Bank, and will comprise the following major tasks.
70.   The first task of the Commission will be an assessment of the effectiveness of recent
amendments to the Bankruptcy Law. This assessment is expected to identify the remaining legal,
regulatory, and institutional weaknesses in Slovakia' s bankruptcy regime, and will provide
important inputs for the work agenda of the Commission in 2001 and 2002. Elaboration of this
assessment by the Commission will be a condition of second tranche release.
71.   The second task of the Commission will be creation of a suitable regulatory framework
governing the qualification, training, appointment and monitoring of trustees, liquidators, asset
valuators, and other professionals operating in the bankruptcy system. The regulatory framework



-23-
will establish a supervisory authority with full oversight responsibility for: (i) licensing liquidators
and trustees and regulating and supervising their work; (ii) setting and enforcing professional
standards for the administration of insolvency proceedings; (iii) maintaining a publicly accessible
record of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings; (iv) recording and investigating complaints
regarding wrong doing by liquidators and administrators; and (v) appointment of interim
liquidators and trustees.  Enactment of a Decree introducing interim  improvements in the
regulation of liquidators and trustees will be a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by
Government of the concept of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the insolvency system
containing a satisfactory implementation timeframe will be a condition third tranche release.
72.   The third task of the Commission will be the elaboration of a modem and well articulated
insolvency law, containing, among other things, procedures that promote effective enterprise
rehabilitation. Elaboration of a report by the Commission, including identification of core
principles for modernizing the insolvency law based on the World Bank's Principles and
Guidelines for Effective Insolvency Systems, and engagement of a drafting team for preparation of
new insolvency legislation are conditions of second tranche release. Preparation of initial draft of
new insolvency legislation is a condition of third tranche release.
73.   The Government is aware of the need to change other laws in order to eliminate all the
obstacles to enterprise restructuring, especially restructuring achieved through workouts conducted
voluntarily outside the court system. As mentioned above, an amendment has already been made
to the Law on the Tax Treatment of Bank Reserves and Provisions, in order to give banks tax
deductibility of their obligatory loan loss provisions. The Government now intends to change tax
rules in the second half of 2001, to allow creditors and debtors to negotiate debt reductions and
debt-equity swaps without facing adverse tax implications. Submission to Parliament of changes
in tax laws allowing proper tax treatment of debt write-offs and debt/equity swaps is a condition of
second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of changes in tax laws allowing proper tax
treatment of debt write-offs and debt/equity swaps is a condition of third tranche release.
74.   The Reform of the Collateral Regime. With the assistance of the EBRD and the World
Bank, the Government has undertaken a review of the laws that regulate the creation, registration
and enforcement of secured rights. Based on such a review, the Government drafted amendments
to several laws that regulate the collateral system in Slovakia, and will submit these amendments to
Parliament in the second half of 2001. The new legislation will incorporate the basic core
principles for a modem collateral law articulated by the EBRD in its model law on secured
transactions. More specifically, the new collateral legislation will include, inter alia, introduction
of concept of non-possessory pledge in movable assets; establishment of a registry for pledges in
movable assets; effective non-judicial procedures for enforcement of collateral rights (including
Public Auction Law); and amendments governing priority of tax liens. These procedures will be
integrated and harmonized with those under the Bankruptcy Law governing treatment of secured
rights and collateral in bankruptcy. Completion of satisfactory draft amendments to the laws
regulating collateral is a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of
satisfactory amendments to the laws regulating collateral is a condition of third tranche release.



-24-
75.   Improving the Legal Framework for Corporate Governance. As mentioned above,
strengthening the mechanisms of corporate governance will contribute significantly to
improvements in the future performance of Slovak enterprises. Some progress has already been
made in this area, by establishing a new agency to regulate and supervise the securities market and
the insurance sector. This agency, however, lacks the necessary independence and powers to fully
enforce its mandate. The Government intends to improve the corporate governance architecture
further, and is preparing important changes in three pieces of legislation in order to achieve this
objective. The first is a new law designed to strengthen the independence and the operational
capacity of the new supervision agency. The second is a set of comprehensive amendments to the
Commercial Code, and the third is a new Securities Law.
76.   The amendments to the Commercial Code will enhance corporate governance by
introducing or improving: board duties and liability provisions; regulation of mergers and
takeovers; minority shareholder protection rules; and introduction of shareholder legal action. The
Government will submit these amendments to Parliament in the second half of 2001, and expects
these amendments to be adopted by Parliament in the first half of 2002. Submission to Parliament
of satisfactory amendments to the Commercial Code is a condition of second tranche release.
Adoption by Parliament of satisfactory amendments to the Commercial Code is a condition of third
tranche release.
77.   The new Securities Law is expected to enhance further the governance of publicly traded
companies by improving, inter alia, disclosure requirements, insider trading rules, the regulation of
brokers and dealers, and the registration of securities. The Government will submit these
amendments to Parliament in the second half of 2001, and expects these amendments to be adopted
by Parliament in the first half of 2002. Submission to Parliament of a satisfactory new Securities
Law is a condition of second tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of a satisfactory new
Securities Law is a condition of third tranche release. Adoption by Parliament of a new law
strengthening the legal, financial, and operational autonomy of the securities and insurance
markets regulator is a condition of third tranche release.
78.   Privatization and Regulation of Utilities. The new Government has demonstrated its
resolve to address the problems of the utility sector through a number of concrete steps. The
Government has significantly increased administered utility tariffs in four steps since June 1999.
Cross subsidies still remain, especially in the gas sector, but the Government is committed to
reducing these. A new regulatory body for telecommunications was established in May 2000, and a
new  regulatory body for the energy sector will be established in May 2001.   The
telecommunications regulator is due to merge with the new utilities regulator in 2002, and may also
take over the remaining utilities.
79.  In September 1999 the Government amended the Large Privatization Act, abolishing the
Strategic Companies Act and removing the biggest obstacle to the privatization of utilities. The
privatization of utilities started in the summer of 2000, with the sale of a 51 percent stake in Slovak
Telecommunications to a strategic foreign investor for Eurol billion. In November 2000, a
privatization advisor was selected for SPP (the gas transport and distribution company which owns
and operates one of the main pipelines from Russia to Western Europe) and the privatization



-25-
advisor for Transpetrol (oil company) was selected in January 2001. The Government intends to
complete divestiture of a 49 percent stake in both companies by October 2001. Privatization plans
and pre-privatization restructuring plans for the Slovak Electricity company and the water
companies will be adopted in 2001 and minority stakes will be sold in 2002.
E.    Unemployment and the Social Safety Net
80.   The rise in unemployment rates started in 1998, with the slowdown in GDP growth, and
became more pronounced in 1999, as a result of the stabilization program implemented during that
year (Table 1). The unemployment rate is currently around 19 percent and can be expected to
remain so over 2001 and 2002, according to forecasts released by the Ministry of Labor, Social
Affairs and Family. The reason for the expected stability in the unemployment rate at high levels is
due to the combination of two offsetting factors. On the one hand, the ongoing bank and enterprise
reforms will result in the reduction of loss-making activities and inevitably in some layoffs. On the
other hand, the economy is expected to grow at higher rates in the next few years and absorb part of
the unemployed. The ongoing restructuring of the Slovak economy should lead to higher growth
rates and a sustained decline in unemployment after 2002. Recent experience in Hungary, which
was at a similar point of high unemployment and restructuring in 1994-1996, and now enjoys
unemployment rates lower than 7 percent, would suggest that the unemployment rate in Slovakia
should fall significantly by the middle of the decade.
81.   During this transition period the wellbeing of the population during the next few years will
depend, in part, on the strength of the social safety net. This consists of (i) employment programs
managed by the National Labor Office (NLO); (ii) social assistance administered by a network of
regional welfare offices; (iii) social insurance (pensions and short-term benefits) administered by
the Social Insurance Agency (SIA); and (iv) a new Guarantee Fund to pay back wages to workers
in bankrupt companies. Recently, the NLO has administered a special jobs program funded out of
the budget. Further, the NLO receives notification of redundancies from companies. This enables
analysts to assess future caseloads. Overall, these programs provide a strong social safety net
similar to those in developed market economies in Western Europe.
82.   The safety net, except for pensions, is generally affordable, and government has been
responsive to budgetary problems in the past. For example, unemployment benefits were reduced
in both size and duration after the unemployment rate started to reach its current peak. Social
assistance expenditures, which provide means-tested benefits when unemployment runs out, are
more than 1 percent of GDP, an unusual figure in transition economies, which have tended to
under-finance their anti-poverty programs. While Government needs to take steps to reduce the
number of recipients, especially among young people, the excess does not represent an undue
burden on the budget. In the case of old-age pensions, contributions have not covered outlays in
recent years. Nonetheless, Government is aware of this situation and is currently preparing a
pension reform, which is to be sustainable in the long run.

V. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.   The Bank's Assistance Strategy
83.   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Slovakia was discussed by the
Executive Directors on February 6, 2001. The overarching strategic objective for the proposed CAS
is to put Slovakia on a path of rapid and sustained growth that will promote convergence with
Western European countries and improve living conditions, particularly among the most vulnerable
groups in the population. Specifically, the CAS entails three clusters of activities: (i) completing
Slovakia's economic transformation to restore and sustain high growth rates; (ii) strengthening
public institutions and public governance; and (iii) ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of the
social sectors including health, education, and social protection.
84.   The EFSAL plays a prominent role in the Bank's assistance strategy to Slovakia, and the
Bank has been working closely with the Government since early 1999 on the design of the bank
and enterprise reforms. The loan will help the Government finance the costs of bank restructuring
and to address major outstanding structural bottlenecks, placing Slovakia on a sustainable growth
path. The reform program to be supported under the loan will help the Government finalize the
restructuring and privatization of several domestic banks, develop a robust banking regulatory and
supervisory framework; resolve a substantial amount of problem loans through an efficient market
based mechanism; and implement a comprehensive set of legal reforms, designed to enhance
creditor rights and to improve the internal mechanisms of corporate governance.
85.   IFC has played an important role in supporting private sector development and in helping
the country conclude its transition to a full market economy. IFC expects to make significant
contributions to bank privatization, financial markets development, infrastructure financing and
industrial restructuring. At the request of the Government, IFC has recently invested together with
the EBRD in VUB. IFC's participation in VUB is expected to strengthen the bank's corporate
governance and financial and environmental risk management in the pre-privatization period. It is
also expected to enhance the credibility of the bank privatization program, and improve the
salability of VUB by attracting more reputable strategic investors. EFC is also expecting to
participate in the restructuring of the classified claims being auctioned by SKA, by teaming up with
the bidding winner. Finally, IFC is exploring the opportunity to promote Slovakia's nascent
mortgage finance market, and support the development of secondary market institutions.
B.    Loan Amount and Borrower
86.   The proposed Bank loan, in the amount of Euro 200 million, will be made to the Slovak
Republic. The loan would be a Euro single currency fixed spread commitment linked, annuity
repayment loan with a final maturity of 14 years and grace period of 5 years and an expected
disbursement of 0-3 years. The loan would be disbursed in three tranches of Euro 60 million, Euro
70 million, and Euro 70 million respectively.



-27 -
C.   Loan Design
87.   The principle objective of the proposed loan is to provide timely and responsive support to
Slovakia's efforts to implement effective reform of its banking and enterprise. The loan would
provide fast-disbursing funds for fiscal assistance in support of the Government's reform program,
specifically the interest costs associated with the recapitalization of the banks as a precondition for
their successful privatization. The Government, in cooperation with the Bank and the IMF
(through a Staff Monitored Program), would aim at maintaining a stable macroeconomic
framework essential for the successful implementation of the structural reforms.
88.   The main elements of the enterprise and financial sector reform program are:
*  Reform of the Banking Sector
- restructuring and privatization of the three large State-owned banks;
- resolution of all troubled small and medium sized banks;
- reform of the deposit insurance system; and
- substantial strengthening of banking regulation and supervision.
 Reform of the Enterprise Sector
- workout of a large volume of bad assets;
- improvement of the legal framework for debt enforcement and bankruptcy,
in order to promote market-based debt and enterprise restructuring; and
- improvement of the legal framework for corporate governance.
D.   Financial Management and Monitoring
89.   The MoF will have in place adequate accounting and financial management reporting
systems for the Deposit Account. The MoF will maintain records of all transactions under the loan
in accordance with sound accounting practices. The Government will submit to the Bank a
monthly receipts and payments account showing the transactions on the Deposit Account, starting
with the receipt of Bank funds and ending when the balance on the Deposit Account has been
reduced to nil. The Borrower shall: (a) have the Deposit Account audited in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank;
(b) furnish to the Bank as soon as available but in any case not later than three months after the date
of the Bank's request for such audit, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors of
such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have reasonable required; and (c) furnish to the
Bank such other information concerning the Deposit Account and the audit thereof as the Bank
shall have reasonably requested.
90.   The audit will be carried out at semi-annual intervals as agreed with the Bank, calculated
from the date of first tranche release, with suitable adjustments of timing depending on the dates of
subsequent tranche releases and the funds left in the Deposit Account at any point in time. The
terms of reference for the audit will be agreed between the Bank and the Borrower. Audits would
end once all funds have been transferred from the Deposit Account. In addition to the above, the
Bank may request that its own staff (or a specialist contractor working on its behalf) carry out



-28-
special reviews of the Deposit Account. If, after deposit into the Deposit Account, the proceeds of
this loan are used for ineligible purposes, the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (i) return
that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii) refund the amount directly to the
Bank.
E.    Project Implementation
91.   The EFSAL will be implemented in accordance with standard Bank procedures for
adjustment loans. The financial sector program will be implemented by the MoF and the NBS.
Implementation arrangements will be fully consistent with Bank practice for adjustment loans.
Upon notification by the Bank of loan effectiveness, the proceeds of the loan will be deposited by
the Bank into the designated Deposit Account at the request of the Borrower. In accordance with
the Operational Directive on the Simplification of Disbursement Rules under Structural
Adjustment and Sector Adjustment Loans (February 8, 1996), disbursements will not be linked to--
specific purchases. Therefore, there will be no procurement requirements.
F.    Monitoring Arrangements
92.   The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Slovakia will be responsible for the
monitoring and implementation of the program. The Bank will monitor the implementation of the
program through periodic reviews.
G.   Environmental Assessment Requirements
93.  In accordance with the Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (OD
4.01), the proposed operation has been placed in category "C" and does not require an
environmental assessment.
H.   Release of Funds and Tranching
94.  It is proposed that the loan be released in three tranches of Euro 60, Euro 70 and Euro 70
million equivalent respectively.  The first tranche will be eligible for disbursement upon
effectiveness of the loan. The second and third tranches will be eligible for disbursement upon
satisfaction of the proposed conditions for their release, as detailed in the attached Matrix of Key
Actions (Annex IV). Loan tranches are expected to be approximately 6 months apart.
I.    Benefits and Risks
95.   The reform actions sought under the EFSAL would encourage private and financial sector
development by accelerating reform in key structural areas. The Government's reform action will
restore the solvency and efficiency of the banking system, promote enterprise restructuring through
an ambitious workout scheme and improvements in the legal framework, and attract foreign
investment. Restoring sustainable growth based on stronger microeconomic foundations should
lead to more rapid employment growth with irnproved labor market performance.



-29-
96.   The risks to the proposed EFSAL could be related grouped into political, macroeconomic,
and absorption capacity risks.
*  Political Risk. The governing coalition may not hold together if the political costs of
decisive reform become too high. Alternatively, the perception of political risks could lead
to delays in concluding some components of the program. For example, there could be
adverse political reactions from increased unemployment or a very low price in the auctions
of bad loans. However, these risks seem to be low due to several reasons. First,
implementation of some of the key reforms supported under the EFSAL are quite advanced.
SLSP has already been sold to a major European bank, and VUB has been partially sold to
IFC and EBRD with a view to successful sale to a strategic investor by mid-year. The
consolidation of the small and medium banks is well underway, and new legislation in both
banking and enterprise sector is expected to be submitted to Parliament this year. Second,
the social safety net seems to be adequate. A labor market and social assistance assessment
of the impact of the EFSAL has been completed and findings indicate that the increase in
unemployment will not be pronounced and that potential negative impacts can be largely
mitigated by the existing social assistance programs. Finally, political risk is substantially
mitigated by the broad-based desire of the population to join the EU.
a  Macroeconomic Risk. The severe external imbalances have been eliminated through the
1999 stabilization program and the current account deficit is currently at a sustainable level.
Moreover, the large FDI inflows expected for 2001 and 2002 should exceed the current
account deficit by a wide margin, leading to sizable reductions in Slovakia's net external
debt. The 2002 elections raise the risk of larger fiscal deficits and a resumption of external
imbalances, but this risk will be contained by two factors. First, agreement with the IMF on
Staff Monitored Program has reduced the risks of macroeconomic imbalances in 2001 and
2002. Second, Slovakia's objective to join the EU in the middle of the decade implies a
commitment with the European Commission to implement a stable medium-run
macroeconomic program compliant with the Maastricht criteria.
* Absorption Capacity Risk.  Implementation of the reforms could be substantially
undermined by the weak institutional capacity in the country. To mitigate this risk, a
number of initiatives are well under way. EU-PHARE, USAID and the UK-DIFD have
been providing technical assistance for bank privatization and the work out of the bad debt,
including development of policies and procedures for SKA, and packaging and auctioning
of debt to private sector. The three donor agencies will provide assistance to an ambitious
program to strengthen bank supervision. Finally, an IDF grant has been provided by the
Bank to strengthen the institutional capacity for the implementation of the bankruptcy
reforms, including training for judges, administrators, and court clerks.

Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Statement of Economic Policies
The Government of Slovakia has agreed with the IMF on a Staff Monitored Program
which articulates a number of key economic goals for the years ahead and policies
envisaged in 2001 and 2002 to support these goals. These goals and policies are spelled
out in the Government's Statement of Economic Policies (SEP) submitted to the IMF,
and are summarized below:
*  Privatization revenue in 2001 could exceed 10 percent of GDP. This revenue will be
used to retire government liabilities with the exception of 0.1 percent of GDP
earmarked for development projects. The Government intends to adopt a law in 2001
on state debt and guarantees which will require that, beginning in 2002, all future
privatization revenue will be used to retire state debt and finance pension reform.
* The Government will strictly control the issue of new state guarantees in 2001. The
aforementioned law on state debt and guarantees is envisaged to contain provisions
which will ensure a reduction in the stock of guarantees (from current levels of 16
percent of GDP) over the next few years.
* The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the budget process and
increase fiscal transparency. In 2001 most extra-budgetary funds will be merged with
the state budget. New rules expected to be adopted by Parliament will prevent
members of parliament from submitting proposals that would result in an increase in
the agreed budget deficit. Medium-term financial planning which began in 2001 will
be strengthened. A functional classification of state expenditures will be introduced
and a treasury system will be created in 2002 to improve overall public finance
management.
* The Government will subordinate the economic management of all sections of the
general government and state-owned enterprises to the control of the Ministry of
Finance.  The Act on Financial Control which will provide the rules and
organizational structure for internal financial control will be drafted in 2001 and
become effective in 2002. All companies receiving state subsidies will be thoroughly
supervised by financial control bodies. The Ministry of Finance will also have
representatives on supervisory boards of companies that received state guarantees.
* The Government will continue to implement a comprehensive reform of tax
administration with technical assistance from the IMF.
* The Government will prepare a comprehensive pension reform including the
introduction of multi-pillar pension system which is expected to become effective in
2004.



Annex I
Page 2 of 2
* The Government will begin to prepare a comprehensive reform of the health care
sector to improve the efficiency and quality of health care services. The Government
will review the existing health insurance system and the establishment of a
supplementary health insurance system. Also, the costs of medical procedures and
pharmaceuticals will be minimized and co-payments for medical services will be
introduced. The Government will define an optimal network for institutional
healthcare facilities, and for primary and secondary outpatient care.

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC
Nam. slobody 1, 813 70 Bratislava 1
Bratislava June 28, 2001
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington DC 20433
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
1.    We are writing this letter on behalf of the Government of the Slovak Republic.
As you know, Slovakia became independent in 1993 and continued implementing the
structural reforms that had been initiated under the former Czechoslovak Federation. At
the time of independence the universe of small enterprises had already been privatized.
The first wave of privatization of large and medium enterprises had been completed as
well, through a mass coupon scheme that was considered innovative at that time. The
second wave of privatization was basically completed in 1998 through a different
strategy, based on direct sales. The conclusion of the second wave of privatization in
1998 increased the share of the private sector in GDP to over 80 percent. The banking
sector also experienced a fast transformation during this period, due primarily to the entry
of new domestic and foreign banks. By 1997 the number of new banks and branches of
foreign banks had increased to 28. As a result, the share of the three large, State-
controlled banks in total bank assets had dropped to roughly half of total bank assets, and
two of these three banks had been partly privatized. Also, during this period the National
Bank of Slovakia made progress in developing a modem regulatory framework for the
banking sector and building its supervisory capacity.
2.    Since the current Government took office two years ago, we have reviewed the
progress of the bank and enterprise reforms and concluded that much remained to be
done. While the two waves of privatization allowed a rapid transfer of State enterprises
to the private sector, they did not generate the expected gains in efficiency, as indicated
by the increase in enterprise losses and in the number of loss-makers after 1993, and the
large accumulation of arrears to banks and the tax authorities. The enterprises privatized
in the first wave suffered from weak internal governance due to a variety of causes,
including the lack of skills and incentives of investment funds, fragmented ownership,
and weak company and capital market regulation. In particular, the lack of transparency
and minority shareholder protection allowed controlling insiders to strip enterprise assets,
to the detriment of minority shareholders, creditors, and workers. The second wave of
privatization, from which foreign investors were practically excluded, did not produce
much better results because it was largely dominated by political factors.

3.    The absence of creditor discipline also contributed to the mismanagement of large
numbers of enterprises. The three largest banks remained under State control and were
subject to political influence in their lending decisions. The extent of mismanagement
and political interference in these banks is clearly reflected in their non-performing loans,
which reached half of their loan portfolios in 1998, and which made these institutions
deeply insolvent. The performance of several new medium and small banks also proved
disappointing. Many of these banks were partly or totally controlled by State enterprises,
local governments, and branches of the central government, and also suffered from asset
stripping and political interference in their operations. In some other cases the weak
governance was due to the presence of inexperienced private investors, who were able to
enter the system in the early 1990s when licensing criteria were lax. As a result of years
of weak governance, several medium and small banks arrived at the end of the decade
with large volumes of bad loans and deeply insolvent. Finally, the lack of creditor
discipline was also due to the weak legal framework for bankruptcy and debt
enforcement, which deprived creditors of the most essential rights and tools to monitor
their clients.
4.    We are aware that the poor performance of banks and enterprises implies a
substantial loss of efficiency to the Slovak economy, with adverse consequences for the
growth of output and employment in the long-run. In order to correct these deficiencies,
and place Slovakia on a path of sustainable growth and successful entry into the
European Union, we are now implementing an ambitious program of bank and enterprise
reforms. This program, which started in the Spring of 1999, comprises the restructuring
and privatization of the large State banks, the consolidation of the group of small banks
through privatization, mergers and liquidations, the workout of the large stock of bad
assets, and substantial improvements in the regulatory framework for banks and
enterprises. We are determined to fully implement the reform program under a stable and
consistent macroeconomic framework. We intend to achieve these objectives over a
relatively short period of time, and request the assistance of the World Bank in the
finalization and financing of our reform program, through an Enterprise and Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan.
Macroeconomic Framework
Current Efforts at Stabilization
5.   In the years following our independence from the Czechoslovak Federation in
1993, our macroeconomic performance was among the best in Central Europe. Inflation
declined from 23 percent in the first year of independence to single digits in 1995, one of
the lowest inflation rates in the region. At the same time, the economy initiated a strong,
export-led recovery, despite a contraction of fiscal expenditures and of fixed investment.
The initial output recovery seemed sustainable, as it was based on exports, and took place
in a context of low fiscal deficits and current account surpluses. The prospects of high
growth were reinforced by the highest investment ratio in the region (about 26 percent of
GDP in 1995), and the expectations of improved investment efficiency driven by fast
privatization.



Letter of Development Policy                                              Annex III
Page 3 of 15
6.    In 1996, however, the current account abruptly shifted to persistent deficits of
about 10 percent of GDP, driven by a dramatic increase in fixed investment to 34 percent
of GDP in 1996 and to 38 percent of GDP in 1998. The sharp investment expansion did
not raise much concern initially, as we hoped that such large investment outlays would
increase export capacity further and eventually repay themselves. However, it became
progressively clear that much of this increase in investment included sub-optimal projects
driven by distorting incentives, generous public guarantees on foreign borrowings,
extensive political interference in bank lending, and weak corporate governance. The
inefficiency of much of the investment and the lack of enterprise restructuring were
progressively revealed by the growing volume of enterprise losses and the number of
loss-makers.
7.    The expansionary fiscal policy in the mid-1990's also contributed to the increase
in the current account deficit. The deterioration in the fiscal balance from a surplus of 0.4
percent of GDP in 1995 to a deficit of 5.0 percent of GDP in 1997 and 1998 actually
understates the full extent of that expansionary policy, since large contingent liabilities
were also built up in this period in the form of extensive guarantees on foreign
borrowings of loss-making enterprises and extra-budgetary funds.'
8.    In an effort to offset increasingly lax fiscal policies, and prevent the current
account from deteriorating even further, the NBS tightened monetary policy from 1996 to
1998. This policy did contain the current account at 10 percent of GDP, but at the cost of
very high real interest rates (in excess of 20 percent p.a.) and repeated periods of
turbulence in the foreign exchange market. The tight monetary policy was ultimately
unable to sustain the exchange rate in the face of speculative attacks related to the Russia
crisis, forcing us to float the currency in October 1998. Also, the high real interest rates
made it increasingly difficult for enterprises to service their debts and contributed to a
further deterioration in the loan portfolios of domestic banks.
9.    Recognizing the extent of the macroeconomic imbalances, we introduced a first
package of stabilization measures in January 1999. Following a renewed bout of
currency turbulence in May 1999, we introduced a second package of stabilization
measures which resulted in a 2 percent of GDP improvement in the primary deficit. We
also significantly increased administered prices (e.g. gas, electricity, heating, post, and
railways) in three rounds, tightened financial discipline (by limiting the issuance of new
guarantees), and began structural reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors. These
reformns resulted in a sharp decline of fixed investment to 31 percent of GDP, which
together with the tightened fiscal stance contributed to a significant reduction in the
current account deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1999. The tightened fiscal stance allowed
us to moderately ease monetary policy. The improved policy mix and the structural
reforms contributed to a sharp reduction in real interest rates, a nominal appreciation of
' All fiscal figures quoted in the letter follow the definition adopted in the Staff Monitored Program agreed
with the IMF, which excludes privatization revenues, called guarantees, and the fiscal cost of bank
restructuring.

the koruna, a significant increase in foreign exchange reserves, and a rapid decline in
secondary market spreads on Slovak eurobonds.
10.   The deficit of the General Government was essentially unchanged in 2000, but the
current account deficit declined further to 3.5 percent of GDP. This improvement was
underpinned by strong export performance, following the acceleration of growth in the
EU and strong productivity growth in our exporting industries. At the same time, import
growth was contained by a further decline in the investment to GDP ratio to 30 percent,
as tight credit markets continued and increased financial discipline took hold. The third
round of increases in administered prices in February 2000 and the decline of real wages
led to a decline of real consumption by about 3.4 percent and also helped to contain
imports. Most importantly, FDI flows reached 10 percent of GDP, exceeding the current
account deficit by a wide margin and leading to a reduction in net external debt for the
first time since independence. The large FDI flows were in part the result of our
successful privatization program. However, non-privatization related FDI reached nearly
4 percent of GDP in 2000, reflecting our policy of encouraging the entry of foreign
capital.
11.   The successful stabilization of the economy has come with large short-term costs.
Unemployment has risen from about 13 percent of the labor force in the mid-1990's to 19
percent in 2000. Inflation has temporarily accelerated to an average of about 11 percent
in 1999 and 2000 following the long overdue liberalization of administered prices, the
increase of the lowest rates of VAT, and the temporary implementation of an import
surcharge. Finally, GDP grew by about 2 percent in 1999 and 2000, down from an
average of 5.6 percent p.a. in 1994-1998. We consider these short-term costs to be
inevitable, and expect the stabilization and the structural reforms outlined below to create
the conditions for a long period of high rates of GDP growth and low rates of
unemployment. However, we also want to point that we have a proper safety net in place
to mitigate the short-term impact of the stabilization and the reforms on the population.
The Macroeconomic Framework for the Medium-Run
12.   Our medium-term macroeconomic framework is expected to consolidate the
positive results of the 1999-2000 stabilization program, and has been designed with two
major objectives in mind:  first, to ensure a stable environment for the successful
completion of our structural reforms and a resumption of growth on a sustained basis;
second, to demonstrate our capacity to join the EU by the middle of the decade. Our
macroeconomic program for 2001 and 2002 has been elaborated in collaboration with the
IMF, as reflected in our Statement of Economic Policies approved on March 28, 2001.
The IMF has agreed to monitor this program in the context of a Staff Monitored Program
(SMP). Macroeconomic policies in the period 2003-2005 will be primarily driven by our
objective to join the EU at the earliest possible date. We are aware that, in order to meet
this objective, we will have to demonstrate our capacity to maintain a stable economic
environment and, shortly after accession, to comply with the terms of the EU's Stability
and Growth Pact which, inter alia, calls for structurally balanced budgets.

13.   The 2001 budget was elaborated under difficult initial conditions, including a
substantial loss in projected revenues and increases in expenditures due to external
commitments. The revenue loss-projected at 2 percent of GDP-is due primarily to the
reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 40 percent to 29 percent (a measure
expected to promote foreign and domestic investments) and the elimination of a
temporary import surcharge introduced in 1999. At the same time, expenditures related
to EU and NATO commitments will increase, as will expenditures related to structural
public sector reforms, including civil service reform (though such reforms should result
in savings in the medium-run).
14.   The 2001 budget contains a number of measures designed to offset these revenue
losses and expenditure increases, but the offsetting is not full, because we were reluctant
to adopt a very stringent budget after two consecutive years of contracting real domestic
demand and slow growth. The 2001 budget agreed under the SMP implies a modest
increase in the General Government deficit to 3.9 percent of GDP, from 3.3 percent of
GDP in 2000. We are not overly concerned about this modest increase in the
Government deficit, however, because it is taking place in the context of large
privatization-related FDI flows that will be used to retire public debt, and because it is
being underpinned by a strong package of structural public sector reforms agreed in the
SMP. We expect such reforms to put our public finances on a sounder footing in the
medium-term.
15.   We expect a modest increase in GDP growth to 3 percent in 2001, driven by the
modest fiscal expansion, a return to positive real wage growth, and the one-off impact on
consumption resulting from the redemption of NPF bonds. As a result of the expected
increase in domestic demand and the slowdown in exports due to slower EU growth, the
current account deficit is projected to increase to about 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001, up
from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2000. However, the larger current account deficit projected
for 2001 does not present a concern, as it is expected to be more than covered by the
substantial FDI flows which we expect this year-FDI is conservatively estimated at 12
percent of GDP due to some large privatizations and a sustained increase in greenfield
investments. As a result, we expect external vulnerability to decline further as net
external debt will continue to decline in 2001 and international reserves will exceed 4
months of imports.
16.   We expect GDP growth to accelerate further to 4-6 percent p.a. in 2002-2005.
We expect such growth rates to be driven primarily by a moderate increase in private
investment and consumption, and to be underpinned by an increase in efficiency resulting
from our structural reforns. We understand that a prudent fiscal stance would entail a
reduction in the fiscal deficit to ensure that the current account deficit remains in a
sustainable range of 4 to 4.5 percent of GDP, despite the recovery of domestic demand.
Such a level of current account deficit would be consistent with a declining path of net
external debt to GDP ratio if, as seems likely, greenfield investment would continue to
flow at about 3 percent of GDP p.a. in the years following 2002 as the privatization
program is completed.

Page 6 of 15
17.   We will start tightening the fiscal stance in 2002, in order to open room for an
expected expansion of private investment without adverse consequences for the current
account. We have thus agreed in the SMP to reduce the 2002 budget deficit to 3.0 to 3.5
percent of GDP. Such a fiscal tightening will allow us to rebalance the policy mix and
relieve pressure on monetary policy in 2002, when large privatization related inflows are
expected to continue as the electricity utilities are privatized. Such a fiscal tightening
would open room for a resumption of growth in real credit to the private sector following
several years of decline, thus facilitating an increase in private investment.
18.  In subsequent years we intend to trim the budget deficit further by about 0.5
percent of GDP per year, in order to reduce it to levels below 2 percent of GDP by 2005.
This fiscal path entails an accumulated fiscal adjustment of 1.5 percent of GDP during
the 2003-2005 period, opening room for a further moderate increase in the ratios of
private investment and consumption to GDP, concurrent with a gradual decline in the
current account deficit to around 4 percent of GDP. This would enable a reduction in the
ratios of gross and net external debt to GDP and reinforce Slovakia's external position.
The fiscal path would also place Slovakia closer to the balanced structural budget
required by the Stability and Growth Pact in the years following EU accession.
Banking Sector Reform
19.   We are aware that the pervasive presence of the State in the banking system had
devastating effects on the financial health of the banks and on the allocation of scarce
resources in the Slovak economy. To break this negative historical pattern we have
designed, and made significant progress with the implementation of, a banking sector
reform program that is based on the divestiture of the State's ownership stakes in the
banking system and on the establishment of sound governance structures for banks
operating in the Slovak Republic. Specifically, our program of banking sector reform has
four main components: (i) the restructuring and privatization of the three large State-
owned banks; (ii) a program to resolve troubled small and medium sized banks; (iii)
reform of the deposit insurance system; and, (iv) substantial strengthening of the
regulation and supervision of the banking sector. We intend to complete the bank
privatization component by the end of 2001, and to achieve substantial progress in
improving the regulatory and supervisory framework during the same period. Completion
of the reform will give Slovakia a stable, competitive, well-capitalized and well-managed
banking sector, subject to a supervisory regime which meets international standards, and
able to prudently meet the financing needs of the restructured enterprise sector.
The Restructuring and Privatization of the Three Large State Banks
20.   As mentioned before, prior to 1999 the three large State-controlled banks, VUB,
SLSP, and IRB, suffered from political interference and poor decision making. As a
result, the banks accumulated large amounts of poor quality assets and became deeply
insolvent. In 1999 and 2000 we restructured these banks through two basic operations.
The first was a Sk 18.9 billion direct equity infusion, conducted at the end of 1999, and
the second was a Sk 105 billion carve-out of bad assets, conducted in December 1999 and



Letter of Development Policy                                      Annex III
Page 7 of 15
June 2000. The loans were transferred to the Slovak Consolidation Agency (SKA) and to
Konsolidacna Banka (KOB), and were replaced by loans to SKA and KOB guaranteed by
the Government. These operations have restored the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of
these banks to levels above 12 percent, according to IAS. Although a residual stock of
bad loans has remained in their balance sheets, these residual loans are adequately
covered by collateral and provisions.
21.   We also wish to point out that the recapitalization of the large State banks was
implemented in the context of a sound and transparent privatization program and was
also accompanied by the imposition of conditions and controls on the banks during the
pre-privatization period. To ensure the improvement of these institutions during the pre-
privatization period, we replaced the management of the banks and improved their
governance through the creation of an intra-agency bank privatization and control unit.
This unit, which resides inside the Ministry of Finance (MoF), also receives foreign
technical assistance. Since these measures were introduced, the banks have undergone a
process of self-restructuring incorporating cost reductions, layoffs, and technological
improvements.
22.   A further measure supporting the privatization of the banks was the conversion of
the banks' state-guaranteed loans to SKA and KOB into state bonds in January and March
2001. The bonds were issued with maturities of 5, 7, and 10 years, a combination of fixed
and floating interest rates, and will pay interest twice a year with the first payment being
made one year from the date of issue. The issuance of these bonds facilitates the
privatization process and will assist the banks in the future by providing assets which can
be used to manage liquidity and other risks.
23.   We intend to complete as quickly as possible the privatization of the three large
State-owned banks. At the end of 1999, we selected reputable privatization advisors for
the three banks. In January 2001 a controlling share of SLSP was sold to a reputable
foreign strategic investor. In the case of VUB, in February 2001 we completed the sale
of 25 percent of the bank's shares to multilateral investors and simultaneously
commenced the tender process to complete the sale of a controlling stake in the bank to a
private strategic investor by mid-2001. In the case of IRB, we are committed to
completing the divestiture of State shares to a private strategic investor in the second half
of 2001 or, if this cannot be achieved, to divesting state control of the bank by altemative
methods within the same time period.
The Consolidation of the Medium and Small Banks
24.   During 1999, it became apparent that seven medium and small banks were deeply
troubled as a result of poor governance and extensive political interference in credit
decisions. This interference was facilitated by pervasive direct and indirect public sector
participation in the ownership of these banks. In 2000, we made substantial progress in
implementing a plan to resolve small and medium troubled banks, placing three in
liquidation, selling two to foreign strategic investors, and merging a third with SLSP. We
will ensure that, by mid-2001, the whole banking sector will be in full compliance with



Letter of Development Policy                                       Annex III
Page 8 of 15
NBS prudential regulations. The new banking law which is expected to become effective
in July 2001, will ensure that the NBS will have the powers to enforce prudential
regulations and achieve this objective.
25.  In addition, we have commenced the privatization process for Banka Slovakia (a
small bank owned by the NPF which is compliant with prudential requirements) in 2000
and will complete the divestiture of State-owned shares in this bank in the first half of
2002.
Reform of the Deposit Insurance System
26.   Payment of the insured deposits of three bankrupt small and medium sized banks
has depleted the resources of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIEF) and forced the institution
to borrow from the NBS in order to honor its legal obligations. It has also placed an
undue burden on the solvent banks in the system, which have been subject to an increase
in their contributions to the DIF. We are aware that these problems have been partly due
to the failure of bank supervision to intervene promptly in troubled banks. The NBS and
the Government will correct these supervisory deficiencies by strengthening substantially
the supervisory powers of the NBS, and by building supervision capacity, as described
below. However, we also acknowledge that there are deficiencies in the design of deposit
insurance and in the rules for supervisory intervention. Deposits are fully insured (up to a
value of thirty times the average monthly wage), which tends to reduce the incentive of
depositors to monitor banks.  In addition, the current legal framework for bank
conservatorship and liquidation contains loopholes that result both in an increase in the
liabilities of the DIEF and a low recovery of bank assets, burdening the DIF from both the
expenditure and the revenue sides.
27.  In 2001 we will change the rules and procedures of bank closure and deposit
insurance, to avoid abuse, enhance market discipline, and improve the long-run viability
of the DIF. These measures are particularly important given the need to increase the
deposit insurance coverage to EU norms in the future. First, in the second half of 2001
the DIF will start implementing a financial plan that will allow the institution to repay its
liabilities to the NBS and build up its reserves to adequate levels. Second, by mid-2001
the new Banking Law will become effective, introducing stricter rules for bank
conservatorship. These stricter rules will, inter alia: (i) reduce the maximum period of
conservatorship from 2 years to 1 year; (ii) reduce the deadline for the submission of the
conservator's plan, from 60 days to 30 days; (iii) impose on conservators the obligation
to preserve the assets and property of the subject institution(s) without causing further
liability or loss of revenue to the DIF; and (iv) empower the NBS to impose precise
guidelines for conservatorship, including stricter audit and reporting requirements. Third,
by mid-2001 we will submit to Parliament several amendments to the Deposit Insurance
Law that will limit the liability of the DIEF, by, inter alia, reducing coverage of insured
deposits to 90 percent of insured deposits above five times the average monthly wage,
while maintaining the current limit of thirty times the average monthly wage (although
the Law also prescribes a gradual increase in coverage to the minimum levels of Euro
20,000 specified in the relevant EU directive). Finally, we plan to complete, by mid-

2002, a study comparing the Slovak system to systems in the OECD and EU, providing
recommendations for structural improvement of the deposit insurance system.
Bank Regulation and Supervision
28.   The fundamentals of banking legislation and supervision have been in place since
independence, and many improvements have been introduced over the past few years.
The latest round of improvements happened in 1999, through amendments to the Banking
Law and other related legislation. The amendments to the Banking Law were adopted in
October 1999, and have strengthened the NBS supervisory authority, some elements of
corporate governance, and financial reporting. The amendments also advanced the
process of converging our banking legislation with that required by EU directives. The
1999 amendments to the Banking Law were supported by amendments to the Law on the
Tax Treatment of Reserves and Provisions. These amendments have allowed full
deductibility of required loan loss provisions for banks, finally eliminating a distortion in
the tax system that had led to the taxation of fictitious bank profits and hindered the build
up of prudential provisions.
29.   While the 1999 amendments to the Banking Law represented meaningful steps
forward, the regulatory framework still contains weaknesses in key areas, including the
rules of bank governance, the enforcement powers and obligations of bank supervisors,
and the quality of bank accounting and auditing. We understand that it is essential to
strengthen all these areas of banking regulation, in order to put an end to the culture of
regulatory forbearance that has prevailed in the banking system, enhance the
responsibility and accountability of all the relevant economic agents, and set the
foundations for a robust banking sector. To achieve this objective, Parliament has
already passed amendments to the Constitution that clarify the NBS powers to issue
binding regulation, and has also passed amendments to the NBS Law that strengthens the
enforcement powers of the NBS, by removing the MoF's responsibilities in bank
supervision, strengthening the legal protection to NBS supervisors, and allowing
supervisors to share information with other supervisory agencies.
30.   We have also completed the draft of a new Banking Law that incorporates
substantial improvements to all areas of banking regulation, and would like to elaborate
on the key improvements that are being introduced. The duties and responsibilities of the
management and supervisory boards will be more clearly defined under the new Banking
Law (as well as under the proposed amendments to the Commercial Code, as noted
below). Supervisory boards will be made responsible for providing effective governance
and supervision, for appointment of a qualified management team, and for the
communication and approval of key business strategies and risk control policies.
Management boards will be required to develop internal policies and procedures to
address the risks posed by a bank's business strategy. The failure of a bank's governing
bodies to fulfill their responsibilities will be subject to legal action by the supervisor and
bank investors.
31.   The enforcement powers and obligations of NBS bank supervisors will be
strengthened by, inter alia, introducing prompt corrective action (PCA) rules in the new



Letter of Development Policy                                      Annex III
Page 10 of 15
Banking Law that oblige the supervisor to act whenever the banks' CAR fall below
certain pre-defined thresholds. The independence of the supervision function will also be
enhanced by eliminating or substantially reducing the level of involvement of the MOF in
banking supervision. The new Banking Law containing all the improvements described
above will be submitted to Parliament in the first half of 2001, and is expected to be
adopted by Parliament during the summer of 2001.
32.   We are also aware that bank accounting and auditing need to be substantially
improved, in order to enhance transparency and market discipline, and improve the
effectiveness of the supervision function.  Some improvements are already being
introduced by the new Banking Law. These include a number of new provisions
designed to improve the frequency and quality of disclosure, including obligatory
quarterly financial disclosure, amendments and re-disclosure in the case of material
mistakes, and error materiality tests. The new Banking Law also introduces important
improvements in bank auditing, including increased independence of auditors vis-a-vis
bank management, greater control of bank supervisors over the appointment of the
auditor, and obligations for the auditor to report to the supervisor any breaches of law or
risk of material insolvency of the bank.
33.   We are aware that some of the necessary improvements in bank accounting and
auditing cannot be introduced by the Banking Law. For this purpose, we preparing
amendments to the Accounting Law and the Audit Law. In the accounting area, we are
engaged in a major effort to harmonize Slovak accounting standards with IAS, and expect
to conclude this exercise during 2002. However, we understand that it is essential to
accelerate the adoption of IAS for banks, in order to protect the large public sector
investment in the financial sector. Two critical improvements that will be introduced
ahead of the planned full transition to IAS include the mark to market valuation of
securities in banks' portfolios on a quarterly basis, and the suspension of interest accrual
for assets 90 days past due and longer. The first improvement will be introduced through
an NBS Decree that will enacted in the second half of 2001. The second improvement
will be introduced through amendments to the Accounting Law. We will submit these
amendments to the Accounting Law in the second half of 2001 and expect them to be
adopted by Parliament in the first half of 2002.
34.  In the auditing area, several improvements will be introduced. These will include
introducing a code of conduct for auditors, strengthening the licensing and monitoring
responsibilities of the Chamber of Auditors, and clarifying and increasing the legal
liabilities of auditors for negligence and misconduct. We will submit the necessary
amendments to the Auditing Law to Parliament in the second half of 2001 and expect
these amendments to be adopted in the first half of 2002.
35.   We are fully aware that our efforts to strengthen banking regulation and the
enforcement powers of supervision will not achieve their objective if they are not
supported by improvements in the skills, techniques, and resources of bank supervisors.
In order to identify supervisory weaknesses, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of
bank supervision (based on the Basle 25 Core Principles for Effective Bank Supervision)



Letter of Development Policy                                      Annex III
Page 11 of 15
was carried out in mid-2000. Using the results of this evaluation, the NBS supervision
will elaborate a comprehensive, multi-year supervisory development plan (SDP) that will
be endorsed by the NBS board in the second half of 2001. The SDP refines the mission
and focus of supervision, adopts an improved and more pro-active approach to bank
oversight through further developing of on- and off-site functions and the design of
supervisory strategies for each institution. The NBS and the Government have a
commitment to fully implement the SDP, and will provide the necessary operational
independence and the allocation of additional financial and human resources to the
supervision function.
Enterprise Sector Reform
36.   The financial performance of Slovak enterprises worsened in the second half of
the 1990s, leading to further increases in the number and value of classified loans and tax
arrears. By 1998 enterprise losses had increased to 10 percent of GDP (up from 7 percent
of GDP in 1995), leading total classified loans and tax arrears to reach 27 and 10 percent
of GDP, respectively. This poor financial performance was largely due to severe
weaknesses in the mechanisms of corporate governance in Slovakia. The internal
mechanisms of governance were weak due to flaws in the design and execution of the
privatization program, and a weak regulatory framework for companies and capital
market activities. The external mechanisms of governance were weak due to the poor
lending practices of commercial banks and the weak framework for bankruptcy and debt
enforcement, which deprived creditors of essential rights and tools to enforce their
claims.
37.  In 1999 we adopted a strategy to promote enterprise restructuring with two central
components. The first component of our strategy is a comprehensive program of workout
of bad assets, including the classified loans carved out of the banks in 1999 and 2000 to
SKA and KOB, the loans that were already in KOB's books, and also the arrears to the
tax authority and social funds. The second component is a comprehensive set of legal
reforms, designed to enhance creditor rights inside and outside bankruptcy, and to
improve the internal mechanisms of corporate governance. These reforms, combined
with the banking sector reforms described above, are expected to substantially improve
financial discipline in the enterprise sector and lead to a much better allocation of
resources in the Slovak economy, with positive consequences for our growth
performance in the long-run.
The Workout of Bad Assets
38.   As mentioned before, in 1999 and 2000 a total of SK 105 billion of claims was
carved out of the large state banks in support of the bank restructuring program. Out of
this total, SK 95 billion was transferred to SKA and SK 10 billion to KOB. In addition,
KOB controls SK 30 billion of claims carved out of banks prior to 1999. Therefore,
SKA's portfolio currently amounts to SK 95 billion, all of which consisting of distressed
assets, and KOB's portfolio amounts to SK 40 billion, of which SK 22 billion consisting



Letter of Development Policy                                         Annex III
Page 12 of 15
of distressed assets requiring resolution. The remaining assets held by KOB consist of
housing loans and other assets that do not require prompt resolution.
39.   We recognize that the efficient resolution of the large stock of distressed claims
may contribute significantly to the restructuring of the enterprise sector, by transferring
ownership of the underlying assets to new owners. We also recognize that the best
method of ensuring the rapid resolution of both SKA's and KOB's claims is to transfer
ownership and management of these assets to the private sector, where superior technical
skills and resources can be brought to bear. The reform of the bankruptcy framework and
the collateral system which we are undertaking will provide support to this process and
improve the realizable value of the two institutions' and other state claims.
40.   We are setting up an institutional framework that will allow us to achieve our
objectives for the rapid resolution of SKA's and KOB's distressed assets, which together
amount to SK 117 billion. In July 2001 we will remove KOB's banking license and will
transfer all of its SK 22 billion distressed assets to SKA. KOB staff experienced in
workouts and restructuring will also be transferred to SKA. The main rationale for
transferring KOB assets to SKA lies in the fact that the institutions have several common
borrowers, and consolidating these claims will both enhance their value to private sector
purchasers and provide efficiencies in their management where sale is not possible. The
scarcity of workout skills in Slovakia is another reason to combine the resources of the
two institutions. Finally, we also believe that SKA has been created with better
governance structures and will be able to handle the assets more efficiently.
41.   We are ensuring that the SKA will have the financial stability, good governance,
and transparent tendering procedures, required to attract the best qualified firms and
investors to the purchase and management of its claims. In late 2000 the supervisory
board of SKA approved a budget for 2001 containing adequate provision for hiring asset
management and legal firms to manage and service its assets. Recognizing the timing
uncertainties inherent in cash flows from distressed assets, the SKA also established an
adequate reserve from revenues received in 2000 which it will be permitted to draw upon
in order to provide operational funding when shortfalls arise due to these timing
uncertainties.
42.   In order to ensure the good governance and transparency of SKA we have ensured
that it has policies and procedures meeting best standards for similar institutions. These
policies and procedures are supported by the creation of an investment board empowered
to review and control decisions made by the management board. The investment board
will be composed of five independent members, two of whom are foreign experts
sponsored by donors, and will base its decisions on super majority voting rules designed
to create public confidence in its decisions.
43.   With the support of extensive technical assistance resources already committed by
donors (EU-PHARE, USAID, UK-DFID), we have already initiated the resolution of the
problem assets of SKA. Two pilot transactions have already been completed and not less
than 10 percent of SKA's claims have been sold during the first half of 2001. By late



Letter of Development Policy                                       Annex III
Page 13 of 15
2001, after the transfer of KOB's distressed assets to SKA, we will complete tenders for
the sale andlor private sector management, or written off after appropriate due diligence,
of 30 percent of SKA's claims. By mid-2002, not less than 50 percent of SKA's assets
will have been sold or placed under private sector management, or written off after
appropriate due diligence, and we intend that this total will rise to at least 70 percent by
year end 2002.
Resolving Other State Claims
44.   We also intend to consolidate the claims held by the Tax Authorities, the Health
Insurance, Social Security, Pension, and Unemployment funds, with claims held by the
SKA. The consolidation of claims against individual debtors from these sources with
claims held by SKA will allow the rationalization of claim management and improve the
revenues generated if they are sold to the private sector or placed under private sector
management on a consolidated basis. Harmful competition between various state
claimants and the duplication of administrative expenses should be eliminated in the
consolidation process, and an additional obstacle to the transformation of the enterprise
sector removed. Using SKA as the institution responsible for selling or arranging the
private sector management of claims would take advantage of the skills and programs
being developed by the agency and the extensive technical assistance resources being
provided to it.
45.   We intend to move forward as rapidly as possible with the consolidation process.
Legal and regulatory obstacles to consolidation and to the use of workout techniques
have already been identified. In the second half of 2001, we will submit enabling
legislation to Parliament to remove legal obstacles to consolidation and sale of State
claims. We expect that this legislation will be passed by Parliament in the first half of
2002, and that management responsibility for all state claims will be passed to the SKA
within the same period.
The Legal Framework for Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy
46.   As mentioned before, we are fully aware of the need to improve debt enforcement
and bankruptcy regimes to promote more efficient liquidations, facilitate restructuring of
distressed enterprises, enhance financial discipline, and improve the access of enterprises
to credit, particularly small and medium enterprises. To achieve these goals, we have
embarked on a number of legal reforms, including reforms to strengthen creditor rights to
collect debt or foreclose on collateral, and also reforms to the bankruptcy system.
47.   Improvements in the Bankruptcy Framework  Although the Bankruptcy Law was
amended several times since independence, the bankruptcy system remained inoperative
throughout the 1990s, due to a number of obstacles in the law itself, conflicts with other
laws, and a weak judicial infrastructure and enforcement. The Law allows in principle
for both liquidation (bankruptcy) and for financial restructuring (compositions).
However, the restructuring track has been rarely used, and the liquidation track has



Letter of Development Policy                                         Annex III
Page 14 of 15
proved very inefficient, as indicated by the long period of completion (3-7 years), and
very low recovery rates (3 percent of the claims).
48.   In order to make the bankruptcy system a more effective tool, we introduced a
number of amendments to the Bankruptcy Law that became effective in August 2000,
designed to correct the most serious problems in the Law. These amendments provide
creditors with stronger enforcement mechanisms for commencing bankruptcy procedures,
based on a stiffer test of insolvency that allows commencement within 30 days of default.
It affords creditors a stronger role in the process, in calling more frequent meetings of
creditors and in selecting a trustee of their choice. The process itself is also streamlined
by imposing maximum time limits of 18 months for administration and by allowing for
more flexible and transparent procedures for operations, pending a sale of the business or
auction of assets. Although the amendments have only been in force for a short period of
time, they have already resulted in changes in attitude promoting a more responsible
credit culture and imposing greater financial discipline on the corporate sector. This is
reflected by the significantly higher number of voluntary debt workouts that are being
negotiated between lenders and their borrowers. In many instances, these workouts are
being initiated by the borrowers themselves. Likewise, lenders report higher recovery
rates from borrowers, which they attribute to the benefits achieved through the recent
amendments.
49.   Despite these preliminary signs of improvements, we are aware that there is a
wide scope for further improvements in the bankruptcy framework. To that end, we have
established an inter-agency commission comprised of public and private sector
representatives that is responsible for overseeing the next phase of reforms in the
insolvency process. The Commission will have a broad mandate to identify the needs
and formulate principles and recommendations for: (i) a new modem insolvency law, (ii)
strengthening of the institutions that oversee the process, and (iii) creating a suitable
regulatory framework that governs the qualification, training, appointment and
monitoring of trustees. The Commission will also undertake a review of the institutional
framework to identify ways and means for strengthening institutional capacity, improving
efficiency in court operations, and imposing greater transparency, accountability and
predictability in the system. Finally, the Commission will make recommendations to
better integrate and harmonize the insolvency law with the broader legal and commercial
framework. This work will proceed with funding and assistance provided under an
Institutional Development Fund grant from the World Bank.
50.   Improvements in the Collateral Regime. With the assistance of the EBRD and the
World Bank, we have undertaken a review of the laws that regulate the creation,
registration and enforcement of secured rights. Based on such a review, we are drafting
amendments to several laws that regulate the collateral system in Slovakia, and will
submit these amendments to Parliament in the second half of 2001, and expect adoption
by Parliament in early-2002. The new legislation will incorporate the basic core
principles for a modem collateral law articulated by the EBRD in its model law on
secured transactions. More specifically, the new collateral legislation will include, inter
alia, introduction of concept of non-possessory pledge in movable assets, establishment



Letter of Development Policy                                       Annex III
Page 15 of 15
of a registry for pledges in movable assets, effective non-judicial procedures for
enforcement of collateral rights (including Public Auction Law), and amendments
goveming priority of tax liens. To the extent possible, we intend to integrate and
harmonize these procedures with those under the bankruptcy law governing treatment of
secured rights and collateral in bankruptcy.
51.   Other legislative changes to promote debt and enterprise restructuring. We are
aware of the need to change other laws in order to eliminate all the obstacles to enterprise
restructuring, especially restructuring achieved through workouts conducted voluntarily
outside the court system. As mentioned above, we have already amended the Law on the
Tax Treatment of Bank Reserves and Provisions, in order to give banks tax deductibility
of their obligatory loan loss provisions. In the second half of 2001 we will submit to
Parliament legislation to allow the write-down of classified loans and the conversion of
debt into equity without adverse tax implications for the parties engaged in restructuring,
and expect Parliament to adopt these amendments by mid-2002.
The Legal Frameworkfor Corporate Governance
52.   As mentioned above, strengthening the mechanisms of corporate governance will
contribute significantly to improvements in the future performance of Slovak enterprises.
We have already made some progress in this area, by establishing a new agency to
regulate and supervise the securities market and insurance companies, and are currently
preparing a new law to strengthen its legal, regulatory, and budgetary independence. We
expect this law to be adopted by Parliament in the second half of 2001. The Cabinet has
approved amendments to the Commercial Code that will make members of statutory
bodies more accountable to shareholders and creditors, that will enhance the rights of
shareholders, particularly minority shareholders, that will improve the regulation of
mergers and takeovers, and that will enable legal action by shareholders. We submitted
the amendments to the Commercial Code to Parliament in April 2001, and expect
adoption by Parliament by Fall 2001. Finally, we have also started drafting. a new
Securities Law, to improve further the govemance of publicly traded companies. The
new Securities Law will improve, inter alia, disclosure requirements, insider trading
rules, the regulation of brokers and dealers, and the registration of securities. We will
submit the new Securities Law to Parliament in the second half of 2001 and expect
Parliament to adopt the new Law by early 2002.

Countiy and Sector Background
1.    The Government of Slovakia that took office in October 1998 inherited an
economy in critical conditions. Macroeconomic imbalances were very large, as indicated
by current account deficits of more then 10% of GDP, and structural reforms were largely
unfinished, as indicated by large enterprise losses (more then 9% of GDP), and extremely
large volumes of non-performing loans in the major banks (around 27% of GDP). The
economy had grown by 6% p.a. in the mid-1990s, but these growth rates were not
sustainable, as they were achieved through massive foreign borrowings and were not
underpinned by deep structural reforms. There is a risk that the economy will enter a
phase of stagnation.
2.    The new Government has demonstrated its willingness to take the challenge of
restoring macroeconomic stability and preventing a balance of payments crisis, while also



Annex VI
Page 2 of 4
sustaining growth in the long-run. In May 1999, the Government introduced a package
of stabilization measures that was able to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and
stabilize Slovak koruna. The new Government started to implement an agenda of
structural reforms, which is concentrated in a comprehensive program of bank and
enterprise reforms, and that also includes a program of pension and health reforms, public
administration reforms, and an anti-corruption program.
3.   In early 1999, the Government requested support from the Bank in designing and
implementing its ambitious reform program through an Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (EFSAL).
4.    The objective of the program is to establish sound microeconomic foundations for
the Slovak economy and open room for a resumption of sustained growth in the near
future. The restructuring program would contain four broad components: (i) restructuring
and privatization of the banking system, centered on the three large troubled banks; (ii)
strengthening of banking regulation and supervision; (iii) designing and implementation
of a strategy to workout the large stock of classified claims; and (iv) the improvement in
the legal framework centered on the bankruptcy and collateral regimes, and the laws
dealing with corporate governance.
The Proposed Loan
5.    The EFSAL plays a central role in the World Bank's program in Slovakia. The
Government and the Bank have agreed on a loan amount of Euro 200 million which
would help the Government finance the fiscal costs of bank restructuring in the first two
years of the program implementation.
6.    Conditions for Board presentation include: (i) the recapitalization of the three
large banks, designed to restore stability in the financial sector and reduce the risk of a
banking crisis; conclusion of the privatization of at least one of the large banks;
substantial progress in privatizing the other two large banks; substantial progress in
resolving troubled small and medium banks; (ii) submission of new Banking Law to
Parliament with contents reviewed and agreed by the Bank, agreement on an institutional
development program for bank supervision; (iii) Approval by the Government of a full
and coherent strategy for the workout of bad loans; the establishment of an agency
designed to coordinate the various workout components; and initial implementation of
the workout strategy; (iv) substantial progress in legal reforms, including passage by
Parliament of improvements in the bankruptcy law; improvements in the relevant tax
laws, and agreement of improvements in the commercial code and the securities law.
7.    Conditions for second tranche release include: (i) successful privatization of the
two remaining large banks; resolution of all troubled small and medium banks; (ii)
submission of amendments to the deposit insurance law; progress in implementing the
supervision development plan; (iii) substantial progress in working out a significant share
of the stock of bad loans; (iv) enactment of Decree improving the regulatory framework
for the bankruptcy system; submission to Parliament of amendments to the commercial
code and the securities law.



Annex VI
Page 3 of 4
8.    Conditions for third tranche release include:  (i) substantial progress in
implementing the supervision development plan; (ii) substantial progress in
implementing the workout of bad assets; (iii) adoption of amendments to the commercial
code and the securities law, and drafting of a new insolvency law containing functional
reorganization track.
Implementation
9.    The proposed EFSAL, financed by the IBRD, would be implemented by the
Ministry of Finance of Slovakia. The tentative Loan amount is Euro 200 million. The
Loan funds will be released in three tranches of Euro 60 million, Euro 70 million and
Euro 70 million, respectively, following Board presentation and upon fulfillment of
specific tranche release conditions thereafter. The State Secretary of Finance has been
appointed chairman and an advisor to the Minister of Finance has been appointed as the
EFSAL Program Manager who will ensure overall project coordination among all
agencies involved in the design and implementation of the reform program.
10.   The program is coordinated with other donors and international organizations,
particularly IMF, EU-PHARE, DIFID and USAID. MoF officials and donors meet
regularly to ensure appropriate coordination.

Project Benefits and Risks
13.   The reform actions sought under EFSAL would encourage private and financial
sector development by accelerating reform in key structural areas. The Government's
reform action will help improve the stability and efficiency of the banking system;
promote enterprise restructuring through the workout of bad assets and the improvements
in the legal framework; and attract foreign investment.
14.   The risks to the proposed EFSAL arise mostly from the political situation. The
broad coalition could interrupt the implementation of some components if faced with
adverse short-run effects of the reform, such as unemployment or a very low price for the
bad assets. However, this risk seems to be modest, given the advanced stage of the
reforms.
