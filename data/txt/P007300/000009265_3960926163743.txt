HAITI
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPPRMISAL REPORT
I.  CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMiARY
Country:            Republic of Haiti
Beneficiary:        Electricite d'Haiti (EdH)
Amount:             SDR 18.6 million (US$24.0 m..llion equivalent).
Terms:              Standard IDA, 40 years maturity.
Relendina Terms    The credit would be onlent by the Government to EdH for
20 years, including five years of grace, at 7.01
interest rate. Interest during construction would be
capitalized. EdH would bear the foreign exchange risk
of Gourdes to the U. S. dollar and the Government the
risk of SDR to U. S. dollar.
Description:        The project comprises: (a) installation of two 20-MW
gas turbine generating units in Port-au-Prince; (b)
construction of a single-circuit, 42 km-long
subtransmission line of 23 kV from the Peligre hydro
plant to Hinche; (c) procurement of equipment and tools
for maintenance of distribution systems and a loss-
reduction program; (d) preparation of feasibility
studies for future medium-speed diesel units; (e) a
preinvestment study to assess the economic merits of a
frequency conversion (from 50 Hz to 60 Hz) of the
Ciment d'Haiti plant, to serve this plant from EdI's
main grid; (f) preparation and implementation of a
program to reduce non-technical losses; (g) carrying
out a program for EdH's institutional development,
including the implementation of a training program.
Benefits:           The proposed  project would: (a) contribute to
restoring economic growth in Haiti, as it will provide
the reliable electricity service needed for the
expansion of industrial production and commercial
activities; (b) improve the efficiency of the power
sector; and (c) strengthen EdH's management.



-2
Risks:              The project is not complex technically nor a major
financial burden on EdH. The main project risk is that
potential socio-political instability may hamper EdH's
efforts to reduce electricity theft and sustain stable
management, and thus prevent EdH from achieving the
expected financial and institutional performance. The
above risks, however, are considered manageable and
acceptable given the important potential benefirs of
the project, the interest shown by the Government in
stabilizing EdH's management, and EdH's record of
generallv satisfactory management. No negative
environmental impacts are expected from the project.

II. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. The Enerxy Sector
Energv Resources and. Supply
2.1      Haiti has limited energy resources,  Wood, the primary source of
fuel for domestic use, accounted for 74% of total energy supply in 1988.
Haiti has no identified petroleum deposits. Imported petroleum products
represented 182 of the country's total energy consumption in 1988, and are
the main source of commercial energy. Another 5% of Haiti's erergy was
derived from bagasse, while hydropower supplied the remaining 3% of Haiti's
energy needs. Deforestation has led to serious soil erosion problems which
threaten the development of hydropower resources. The problem is
officially recognized, but progress in controlling grazing or in
afforestation is t1.adequate. Potential new hydro capacity is estimated at
only about 120 MW. About 85% of this amount is located on the Artibonite
river, downstream of the Pe'.igre dam, and on one of its upstream
tributaries, the Guayamouc river. Haiti also has about 750 thousand tons
of proven lignite reserves in the Central Plateau region, near Maissade.
This lignite is best suited for industrial use.1
2.2      The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Bank
joint energy assessment report of 1982, updated in 1985, concluded that the
most critical issues in Haiti's energy sector are: (a) the depletion of
forest resources, with ensuing soil erosion and reduction of agricultural
productivity; and (b) the increasing burden of costly oil imports. To
address these issues, the report recommends: (a) development of indigenous
energy resources to the extent possible; and (b) management of demand and
stimulation of higher efficiency in energy use. The Government, with IDA
financing, has undertaken an integrated study of Ha!t-i's severe
environmental deterioration. The study will propose policy changes and
investments to reduce soil erosion and reverse deforestation. Completion
of the study's final draft is scheduled for mid 1989. IDA's review will
follow and the appropriate recommendations of the study could begin to be
carried out early in 1990. In 1987, the Government also created the
Petroleum Technical Committee (PTC) under the Ministry of Commerce to
procure the rountry's oil supply. PTC is being supported by consultants
funded unOjr a USAID project.
Erneriv Sector Organization
2.3      Three ministries share responsibility for energy.  The Ministry of
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (HARNDR) deals with
forestry. The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications
handles commercial energy, including electricity, through Electricite
d'Haiti (EdH), and non-conventional energy sources and energy efficiency
through the Bureau of Mines and Energy Resorrces (BMRE). The Ministry of
Commerce and Industry is responsible for the Petroleum Technical Committee
(PTC).

B. The Power Sector
Organization
2.4      EdH, an autonomous government agency created in 1971, is the sole
body responsible for electric power generation, transmission and retail
distribution in the country. EdH's Board of Directors is appropriately
made up of the Minister of Public Works, Transport and Communications
(Chairman), the Minister of Economy and Finance, the Minister of Commerce
and Industry, the Minister of Planning and External Cooperation, the
Governor of the Central Banks and EdH's General Manager. Policy directives
are set by the Minister of Public Works, Transport and Communications; the
Board approves major investment plans, borrowings and policies, as well as
electricity tariffs. This approval process has worked well.
2.5      EdH's current organizational structure (Annex 1), which is based
on a 1981 study by consultants financed under the Second Power Project,
worked satisfactorily until '98.,. However, improvements are now required
because: (a) the activities of the Technical and Commercial Directorate
need to be redefined to permit better coordination; and (b) the
Administrative Directorate faces structural problems.
Management
2.6      EdH's management performance, commercial activities, and energy
losses have deteriorated during the last two years, despite improvements
achieved in the company's administration, maintenance and distribution
expansion under the Fourth Power Project. The difficulty in coordinating
the functions of the Technical and Commercial departments plus inadequate
control of the consumer-related activities are undermining EdH's
efficiency. A redistribution of responsibilities between the Technical and
Commercial Departments is therefors necessary in order to transfer to the
Commercial Department all customer-related activities and responsibilities.
The action plan (Annex 2) addresses this problem.
2.7      The management problems in the Administrative Department are the
result of a shortage of qualified staff and inadequate coordination among
the various departments. The creation of EdH's labor union makes it more
difficult for the Administrative Director to manage his activities. To
resolve these problems, the Administrative Department will be split into a
Financial Department and an Administrative Department. In September 1988,
the Administrative Manager was promoted to General Manager. This is
expected to be a short-term assignment since he is already above retirement
age. The position of Deputy General Manager was recently created to assist
the present General Manager. This position is expected to be filled soon
by one of the present department heads, who most likely would succeed the
General Manager once his caretaker's duties are completed. Through this
arrangement and the creation of a Financial Department by May 1989, the
performance of EdH's uanagement is expected to significantly improve. To
ensure continued sound managerial performance EdH confirmed that it will
continue filling its key managerial positions with persons whose
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA.



- 6 -
2.8      Therefore, in order to consolidate its institutional development
initiated under the Fourth Power Project, EdH has agreed to continue
implementing the Plan of Action for Institutional Development agreed with
IDA in 1987 (Annex 2). This plan is geared oto (a) strengthening EdH's
management; (b) improving comaercial activities; and (c) correcting some
administrative and financial weaknesses that still exist. EdH has also
agreed to submit to IDA by September 30 of each year, starting in 1989, a
progress report on the status of this plan; and to engage, by December
1989, consultants satisfactory to IDA to work with EdH's staff in the
implementation of the plan of action. A detailed assessment of EdH's
institutional aspects is presented in Annex 3.
Staffin2
2.9      By December 1938, EdH had about 1,667 employees, which is too
many. Only 62 had university degrees. EdH's ratio of number of customers
per employee decreased steadily from 67 in FY84 to 62 in FY88. EdH and the
Government agree that this can and should be improved. Given the
characteristics of the EdH system, a long-term target of about 100
customers per employee appears reasonable. Therefore EdH, taking into
account the planned expansion of its system and the training program for
its staff, has agreed to limit increases in its number of staff and improve
productivity levels to meet the following targets for the ratio of number
of customers per employee: 64 in FY89, 72 in FY90, 78 in FY91, 83 in FY92,
88 in FY93, 92 in FY94, 97 in FY95 and 100 in FY96 and thereafter. EdH
also agreed to prepare annually by August 15, starting in 1989, a detailed
plan of action for recruitment of staff for the following fiscal year.
Such plans, which will include a temporary restriction on hiring of staff
to professionals and technicians, will be implemented taking into account
IDA's comments. Submission to IDA of the action plan for FY90 will be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
2.10     Salaries are competit- ye by local standards, but skilled
professionals often leave the country attracted by higher salaries in
developed countries. The main constraint to sector development is the
shortage of skilled, experienced personnel, particularly in management,
administration, finance and maintenance. Therefore, EdH's use of foreign
consultants needs to continue until skilled professional staff are trained
and have acquired enough experience to take over their assignments. The
project will assist EdH to resolve these problems by providing: (a)
consulting services to help EdH implement the Plan of Action (Annex 2); and
(b) a comprehensive training program for EdH's staff.
Accounting and Audit
2.11     EdH's accounts are kept in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, but improvements in accounting and internal auditing
procedures are needed. An accounts-payable procedure should be established
and the inventory-control management needs to be improved. EdH does not
prepare long-term financial plans. Annual budgeting procedures are
inadequate and controls need to be strengthened. Monthly financial
statements are issued too late (four months after closing) to be useful as
a management tool. Consultants financed under the Fourth Power Project,
assisted EdH to analyze its inventory, payroll, management information



- 7 -
system, internal auditing procedures and project accounting. The Plan of
Action for institutional development (Annex 2) incorporates their
recommendations, plus those of EdH's external auditors.
2.12     EdH has had satisfactory arrangements for external audits since
1976. Annual audits of EdH accounts will be required under the proposed
project. Purther, EdH has agreed tos (a) continue engaging independent
auditors satisfactory to IDA: and (b) submit the audit report on EdH's
accounts to IT)A not later than five months after the end of each fiscal
yea .
EdH ODerational Performance
2.13     Operation and maintenance constraints have been addtessed under
credits 1281-HA and 1527-HA. These have financed distribution system
renovation to reduce technical losses and rehabilitation of diesel
generating plants to reduce the cost of operation and mainte;ance. EdH's
consultants recently assessed the effects of the distribution systems
renovation and determined that technical losses had been significantly
redt,ed in the distribution network to a satisfactory level of 6%.
However, non-technical losses and operation and maintenance costs are still
excessively high. It is estimated that, as a result of clandestine non-
metered users, low-reading meters, corrupt meter readers and accounting
collusion, total losses reached in 1988 a level of about 40% in the Port-
au-Prince area, and about 25% in the isolated provincial systems. The main
causes for such high proportion of non-technical losses are: first, the
high level of electricity tariffs (average tariff in 1988 was 0.157
US$/kWh), which makes electricity a highly valuable commodity
disproportionately expensive to a large segment of users, and second, the
local attitude that 'voler l'Etat ce n'est pas voler, 2 which is
exacerbated under civil unrest. The high level of tariffs is due in part
to the high operation and maintenance cost of the diesel plants which in
the last two years reached levels substantially higher than in similar
plants in other developing countries. However, the rehabilitation of EdH's
plants has recently been completed under Credit 1527-HA and by year-end
1989 operation and maintenance costs should drop to satisfactory levels.
To monitor whether such satisfactory levels are sustained, EdH has agreed
to prepare and send to IDA quarterly reports within 30 days after the end
of each quarter, starting in January 1990. Su^.h reports to contain a
comprehensive assessment of its operating, maintenance and fuel costs, and
measures applied in preventive and continuous maintenance, as well as in
monitoring sound and economical operation. Substitution with hydro of
thermal generation, which now represents 48S of the total in the Port-au-
Prince system, would further reduce expensive thermal generation. Raising
of the existing Peligre dam by about 5 meters could double this plant's
generation. With financing from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) of France the consulting firm of Coyne et Bellier
(France) will begin in April 1989 a comprehensive study to assess the
merits of increasing the height of this dam.
21 To steal from the State is not stealing.



- 8 -
2.14     The obje tive of reducing electricity theft to acceptable levels
and sustain such levels is a difficult one to achieve. Nevertheless, in
February 1988, EdH began a program to neutralize these thefts based on an
in-house diagnosis of the situation. As a result, a well-organized team
has been instituted in EdH to solve the problem and the following measures
are currently being enforceds a) inspection and calibration of meters; b)
detection of billing anomalies; c) disconnection of clandestine
connections; d) expediting connection requests to prevent illegal
connections motivated by service delays; and e) tightening control of
materi 's and equipmernt for customer connections. In addition, this team
is handling a public relations program to educate the publilc, with special
attention to low-income consumers, on the serious consequences to all
concerned of electricity thefts. The results of these efforts have
produced a reduction in non-technical losses of about 6% during the second
semester of 1988. On this basis, EdH expects to reduce its total losses to
about 30% in FY89.   EdH has agreed to meet the following targets for the
technical plus non-technical losses which it intends to achieve in Port-au-
Princes 252 in FY90, 20% in FY91, 182 in FY92, and 16% in FY93 and
thereafter; and in the provinces, 20% of gross generation in FY89, 18% ir
FY90, and 15% in FY91 and thereafter. Further, EdH has agreed to prepare
by December 31, 1989, with the assistance of consultants, a plan to
strengthen its on-going loss reduction program. EdH will exchange views
with IDA on the recommendations of the consultants and carry out the loss-
reduction program in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to IDA. The
Government has agreed to support EdH in the loss-reduction program by
taking all necessary measures to enforce EdH's actions against electricity
theft.
Power Demand and Suvply
2.15     In 1988 electricity service continued to be unevenly distributed,
with only about 10% of the population connected to the power grid. About
45% of the population in Port-au-Prince has electric service, compared to
only 3% in the rest of the country. Total sales in 1988 amounted to 318
GWh of which industry accounted for about 45%, residential customers for
about 38%, public sector institutions for 12M, and commercial
establishments for 5%. Port-au-Prince, with 85% of sales, dominates the
market.
2.16     Electricity consumption in Haiti has increased at rates very close
to the rate of increase in the number of connections. Active users in
Port-au-Prince increased by 4.0% p.a. between FY82 and FY88 while total
sales of electricity increased by 4.3% p.a. Sales growth was greater in
the provinces, as a result of investments in distribution and the
conversion of unaccounted-for consumption into saies.
2.17     EdH's total installed capacity is 186 MW, but real capacity is
only 130 MW. The reduction of capacity is the result of limited output
from old and poorly maintained diesel units, siltation in the reservoirs
and reduced river flows to the hydroelectric power plants during t' t dry
season (Annex 5). EdH has an effective generating capacity of 103 MW (148
MW, nameplate) to meet Port-au-Prince's demand of 74 MW. Despite
apparently large reserves, EdH has had difficulty meeting dry season demand
in recent years. rainfall and the effects of siltation have reduced the
production of the 47 MW Peligre hydroelectric station to 21.6 MW. The four
thermal plants that serve the Port-au-Prince area (Janvier, Delmas, Varreux



-9-
and Carrefour, totalling 101.3 MW) are either old and unreliable or poorly
maintained. Extensive rehabilitation work was carried out under the Fourth
Power Project, including complete overhauling of the Delmas' four units as
well as maintenance and improvements of the Varreux and Carrefour plants.
After this rehabilitation, the effective diesel plant capacity in the Port
au Prince area will be about 111 MW.
Electricity ?ricinx
2.18     With the assistance of consultants, EdH implemented in 1976 and
updated in 1982 a satisfactory tariff structure (Annex 6). The structure
is based on marginal costing, but is modified to allow social pricing for
low-income families. The average tariff for FY 1988 was 0.157 US$/kWh,
which is very high for the region.3 However, this tariff level is in line
with long-run marginal cost. The tariff structure also reflects the cost
of supplying electricity to customers at different consumption levels. The
tariff includes a fuel surcharge which is adjusted quarterly and is
incorporated into the basic tariff at the end of each fiscal year.
2.19     The social component of the rates (Annex 6) is reflected in a
fixed charge of US$3.50 for low-income residential users with consumption
of less than 30 kWh/month. Because some 32% of EdH's customers consume
less than 30 KWh/month, there is a large element of cross-subsidization
from the higher-income segments of the population. Such cross-
subsidization is being maintained.
EdH's Past Financial Performance
2.20     EdH's financial performance has been on balance unsatisfactory in
the recent past. Extremely low rainfall in 1985 forced EdH to derive most
of its electricity from the higher-cost thermal plants. As a result, EdH
incurred high operating costs and achieved a low rate of return of 3% in
that year, compared with one of 5-6% in the early 1980's. With the
normalization of rainfall, EdH managed to achieve a rate of return of 52 in
1986. In this year, however, the break-down of civil discipline consequent
on the change of government started undermining EdH's ability to generate
revenues. Consumers of all classes resorted in large numbers to making
illegal connections or bypassing their meters to reduce readings. Energy
losses escalated rapidly, reaching an average of 352 of total production in
1987 compared to 30% in 1986. Mainly as a consequence of these losses,
EdH's rate of return on revalued fixed assets was only 1.5% in 1987.
Aggravating the shortfall in billings, EdH found it more difficult to
collect its billings from regular customers who relaxed their payment
standards in tune with political uncertainties and the generalization of
theft of electricity. A-counts receivable from private customers increased
from 60 days equivalent as an average in 1986 to 75 days in 1987. In late
1987 the Government provided some relief to EdH by cutting in half, in the
context of its commitments to IDA, the arrears of public entities with EdH.
EdH, however, was short of cash at the end of 1987 and had to delay
payments to suppliers. As a result, EdH's internal contribution to
investment out of own revenues decreased from 352 in 1986 to a mere 3% in
1987. This performance, although not yet critical, was poor for EdH's own
past standards.
31 As compared to US$0.069/kWh in the Dominican Republic, US$0.120 in
Jamaica, US$0.029 in Bolivia, US$0.03 in Chile, and US$0.04 in
Colombia.



- 10 -
2.21     Mainly because of continued high electricity losses, EdH's
financial performance remained weak in 1988. Amidst political unrest,
increasing civil undiscipline made total losses, mostly non-technical,
increase to about 40% as an average that year. In that political climate
EdH, despite initial agreements with IDA, failed to increase tariffs by 8%.
As tariffs were already perceived as very high, increases would have, more
likely than not under the prevailing circumstances, further aggravated the
theft of electricity and arrears. EdH thus achieved a rate of return of
only 2% in 1988. Mainly because it reduced its investments to about half
of previous annual levels, EdH managed to contribute about 30% of the cost
of those investments out of its own revenues. The change in government of
September 1988 (end of EdH's fiscal year), with accompanying unrest among
military ranks and government laborers and clerical personal, set the stage
for continued financial problems for EdH in FY89.
2.22     But by January 1989, the Government started coming to grips with
the public sector and EdH in particular with the -estoration of discipline
among public employees and consumers of public services. A clear stand in
refusing to comply with demands of EdH's labor union on matters which are
management's privilege, rapidly restored calm and even committed the union
in collaborating with management in combatting the theft of electricity.
With strong Government support and police assistance to protect EdH's crews
from aggression, EdH started a massive campaign of disconnecting services
to illegal consumers and customers who bypass their meters or are in
arrears. Continuation of this campaign with the energy with which it has
started should rapidly reduce power losses to pre-1986 levels and
eventually to standards of more efficient power utilities. It should
moreover reduce outstanding receivables from the private sector to no more
than 60 days of billings, which is acceptable.
2.23     The reduction of energy losses is essential for the recovery of
EdH's financial health and future consolidation as a sound power utility.
Resort to substantial tariff increases is not a viable course of action in
the short nor in the long run, as tariffs in Haiti are not only perceived
as high but indeed are very high for international and Latin American
standards (electricity tariffs in Haiti are about three and two times
higher, respectively, than the averages in the United States and Latin
America). Potential increases in operational efficiency and optimization
of investments, albeit substantial, will take time. By concentrating now
on the recovery of energy losses, EdH is rightly laying the financial basis
for successfully carrying out the project and its investment program during
the project execution period.
IDA Participation in the Sector
2.24     Since 1976, IDA has supported the development of the power sector
in Haiti through four credits totalling about US$80 million. In 1976, IDA
made its first credit (645-HA, US$16 million) to partial'+ finance the
first stage of a two-stage development program for 1976-1981, covering the
installation of diesel generating units at Varreau station and distribution
network expansion. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR No. 3265)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 30, 1980. The
second credit (895-HA, US$16.5 million) helped finance expansion of diesel
generating capacity and renovation of the distribution network in Port-au-



- 11 -
Prince. The Project Completion Report for this project was distributed on
June 5, 1986; no PPAR has been issued. The third and fourth credits
(1281-HA, SDR 23.1 million and 1527-HA, SDR 26.0 million) have helped
finance expansion of thermal generation, completion of the renovation of
the Port-au-Prince distribution network, construction of EdH's headquarters
and other miscellaneous works. The first, second and third projects were
completed with delays of 18 and 20 months. The original components of the
Fourth Power project were completed in December 1988, without significant
delays. With a remaining balance resulting from appreciation of the SDR
vs. US$, additional project components are beir; executed and should be
completed by June 30, 1989, the credit's original closing date.
2.25     Tne development of Haiti's power sector has allowed the growth of
a manufacturing sector that has become the most stable economic activity in
Haiti.   It has employed a substantial part of the labor force migrating
from the countryside to the capital. Although EdH has become one of
Haiti's most efficient public enterprises, IDA's technical, managerial, and
financial assistance will remain necessary until EdH reaches an adequate
level of performance. Threa problems were only partially solved by these
past projects: high energy losses, Government arrears to EdH, and EdH's
managerial and institutional shortcomings. The preparation of the proposed
project took into aucount the lessons learned in the previous operations:
the reduction of technical and non-technical losses are being handled
separately; the settlement of arrears is in force; and the managerial and
institutional reforms are being carried out through a specific program.
IDA Ob1ectives, Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
2.26     Key elements of IDA's strategy for Haiti include supporting
improvements in infrastructure necessary for the reactivation of the
productive sectors and the strengthening of institutions important to the
development process. IDA's objective in the energy sector of Haiti is to
foster energy conservation, the reduction in the lorng-run cost of
electricity, and improvement of EdH's institutional and financial
performance and, in the longer-run, to assist Haiti in develtping its
indigenous energy resources. IDA's involvement in the power sector is
crucial to rationalize highly capital-intensive investments. To achieve
these objectives, IDA is supporting the Government and EdH to:
(a) supply least-cost electricity at adequate reliability levels;
(b) continue organizational reforms to enhance institutional and
financial efficiency and cost savings; and
(c) ensure timely preparation of and adherence to sound least-cost
power expansion planning.

III. THE PROJECT
Backgtround and Obiectives
3.1      The proposed project is part of EdH's expa.nsion program for 1989-
1997. It aims to provide the additional generation capacity required to
meet the needs of the Port-au-Prince area by 1992. It would support
Haiti's economic development strategy by providing the reliable supply of
power necessary for economic growth and, in particular, for industrial and
commercial activities. The project was identified by an IDA mission in
September 1986, was prepared by EdH's technical and planning departments
with the assistance of consultants, was appraised in June 1987 and
negotiated In November 1987. The project was updated in March 1989,
following the visit of an IDA mission to EdH in 1989. The project was
renegotiated in April 1989.
3.2      The main project objectives are:
(a)   to expand the generating facilities in the city of  Port-au-
Prince, in accordance with a least-cost expansion program;
(b)   to supply electricity to the cities of Hinche and Thomonde;
(c)   to improve EdH's efficiency through the execution of:
(i)   a program to reduce non-technical losses;
(ii)   institutional imprevements; and
(iii)   training programs to strengthen EdH's managerial and
technical capacity;
Power Market
3.3      Power sales in the Port-au-Prince area grew by 16.41 p.a. between
1972, when the Peligre hydroelectric plant was completed, and 1980. The
growth rate declined to 4.0% p.a. in 1980-1988 because of an increase in
theft of electricity, EdH's limited installed generating capacity and, in
1983, supply restrictions caused by drought.
3.4      EdH, with the help of consultants, has prepared acceptable
forecasts of future energy sales (Annex 8). Because of the low coverage
rate, the load growth depends largely on the ability of the power company
to increase its generation capacity and the number of customers and,
therefore, does not show a strong correlation to economic growth of the
country. EdH forecasts that, commensurate with the growth of its capacity,
sales will increase by 8.01 p.a. for the Port-au-Prince area and by 8.21
p.a. country-wide in 1988-95.



- 13 -
3.5      Energy losses in Port-au-Prince are very high.  The load forecast
is based on the assumption that the loss-reduction program will decrease
overall losses to 16% of net generation by 1993 and thereafter. The
forecast power requirements of the Port-au-Prince area would then be as
follows:
1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  1995
Sales (GWh)          271   286   309   334   360   400   442   473
Generation (GWh)     449   381   386   407   429   473   526   563
Peak (MW)           70.0  70.2  71.1  74.9  79.0  86.3  95.4  102.1
3.6      In accordance with recommendations of the 1982 UNDP/World Bank
energy assessment, as updated in 1985, EdH completed in 1987-88 the
feasibility studies of the St. Christopher coal-fired steam plant (financed
by IDB), and of the Artibonite 4C hydroelectric plant (financed by Credit
1527-HA). Acceding to Government's and EdH's requests, IDA financed in
1988 under Credit 1527-HA the preparation of EdH's long-term least-cost
generation expansion plan. The plan, prepared by the Deutsche Energie-
Consult (DECON) consulting engineers (Federal Republic of Germany), is
sumuarized below.  Concurrently with DECON's study, a consultant's study
financed by IDB and completed in January 1989 using the Wien Automatic
System Planning Package (WASP) program has reached conclusions quite
similar to those of DECON.

3.7      The proposed program would be the least-cost solution when
constant oil prices or annual increases of up to 52 are assumed (which is
acceptable).  With help of its consultants DECON, EdH has also defined a
satisfactory investment program for the rest of the country (Annex 9).
Proiect Description
3.8      The proje.t would consist of:
(a)    acquisition and installation of two gas turbines of about 20 MW
each;
(b)    construction of a single-circuit, 42 km sub-transmission line at
23 kV from Peligre hydro power plant to the city of Hinche;



- 14 -
(c)    procurement of equipment and tools for maintenance of distribution
systems and the loss-reduction program;
(d)    preparation oft (i)  a feasibility study for future medium-speed
diesel generating units; (ii) a detailed feasibility study for
frequency conversion from 50 Hz to 60 Hz at the Ciment d'Haiti
plant; and (i4i) a program to reduce non-technical losses;
(e)    carrying out a program for institutional development of EdH,
including, inter alia: a review of its by-laws; a revision of its
organization, accounting and inventory control systems; and
(f)    development of a three-year training program for managers and
higher-level staff, aimed at (i) strengthening the management
capability at EdH, mainly in the financial, administrative and
technical areas, including scholarships abroad; and (ii) improving
EdH's training capabilities, including the acquisition and
utilization of teaching materials and equipment.
3.9      The  installation of the gas turbines in Port-au-Prince will
provide additional capacity urgently required to supply the energy demand
in Port-au-Prince starting in 1992. Preparation of tender documents for
the gas turbine plant is being financwd under Credit 1527-HA.
3.10     Construction of the proposed 23 kV sub-transmission line from the
Peligre hydroelectric plant to the city of Hinche is the least-cost
solution to supplying electricity to the city of Hinche. The solution was
recommended in a study prepared by consultants.
3 11     Proper distribution network maintenance is essential to control
losses and maintain system efficiency. The project will finance the
acquisition of the necessary equipment, tools and safety devices to permit
EdH's maintenance crews to work efficiently and achieve this goal.
3.12     The cement plant Ciment d'Haiti, a company of mixed public and
private ownership, has an installed capacity of 2 x 3.2 MW in diesel units
at a frequency of 50 Hz, and has ordered 2 x 5 MW units to meet growing
demand and provide an adequate reserve margin. Given that th, frequency of
EdH's system is 60 Hz and in order to permit the interconnecti)n of the
cement plant to the EdH system in the future, the new units are designed to
permit an easy conversion from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. The interconnection would
be through a single-circuit transmission line about 20 km long, insulated
at 115 kV but initially operated at 69 kV, which would be the first section
of the proposed Varreaux-Gonaives line (135 km), scheduled for operation in
1997 (see Map). A preinvestment study including cost estimates for the
frequency conversion are required and will be prepared under the project.
Detailed designs and cost estimates for the Varreux to Gonaives
transmission line are being prepared under IDB financing.



_ 15 -
Trainint Program
3.13     EdH's training unit and the Center for Vocational Training were
created under previous projects to provide in-house and overseas training
to EdH's staff. In the last six years, 637 empleyees have received
technical training in the center, and 89 were trained abroad. IDA will
continue to support EdH's training efforts by financing under the project a
comprehensive three-year training program (Annex 13) for about 260
management, technical, administrative, financial and accounting staff at
all levels. The program would include: (a) a management development
program; (b) specialized training in Haiti and abroad; (c) training of
instructors and procurement of teaching materials and equipment for EdH's
training centerl and (d) services of consultants and short-term experts to
provide local and overseas training. EdH has agreed to: (i) update
annually by March 31 its detailed program of training activities for the
following fiscal year, taking into account IDA's comments; and ii) engage
no later than December 31, 1989, training consultants under terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA.
Project Execution
3.14     EdH will be the beneficiary and executing agency for the project.
EdH's Planning Director will be the project coordinator and the head of a
Project Unit responsible for implementing the project. EdH has confirmed
that managerial positions will continue to be filled by competent and
experienced persons with qualifications satisfactory to IDA, a condition
with which EdH has complied under previous Credit agreements.
3.15     EdH will require about 32 man-months of consulting services to
carry out detailed engineering, procurement snd supervision of the gas
turbine installation, construction of the Peligre-Hinche subtransmission
line, feasibility study for medium-speed diesel units, and the feasibility
study of the frequency conversion of the cement piant. Management
consultants (20 man-months) will continue to assist EdH with the
implementation of the plan of action to improve EdH's finances and
administration. Consulting services will also be necessary to prepare and
supervise the Loss-Reduction Program (24 man-months).
3.16     The proposed project is scheduled to begin in July 1989 and
conclude by June 1995 (Annex 10). During execution, EdH will continue to
promote lenders' meetings to coordinate the various projects in the sector
financed by IDA, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) (Federal Republic of Germany), and CCCE (France).
Proiect Cost and Financing
3.17     The total cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$27.6 million, of which US$24.0 million
vould be foreign cost (Annex 11). The cost estimate does not include taxes
and duties (EdH is exempt). Costs are in December 1988 prices and are
based on experience in similar projects in the country. Physical
contingencies are 6% for gas turbines and 10% for transm_ssion lines and



- 16 -
spare parts, and 52 for distribution equipment. Price contingencies were
calculated by applying the following annual escalation rates to base costs
and physical contingenciess 1989: 5.62, 1990t4.31, 1991: 3.0b, 1992: 3.31,
1993:4.0%, 1994-1996: 5%. These rates reflect expected local and
international inflation. The impact of differential local inflation, if
any, will be negligible.

3.20     The proposed IDA credit of SDR 18.6 (US$24.0 million equivalent),
would be made to the Government of Haiti on standard IDA terms. The
proceeds of the Credit would be onlent to EdH for a term of 20 years
including a 5-year grace period at 7.01 interest rate. A subsidiary credit
agreement, acceptable to IDA, would be signed as a condition of
effectiveness for the proposed Credit. Interest during construction,
estimated at US$2.5 million, would be capitalized and added to the
subsidiary loan. The Government will assume the exchange risk of the SDR
to the US$, and EdH will assume the exchange risk of the Gourde to the US$.

a/   ICB - International Competitive Bidding
Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed by IDA.
3.22     Gas turbine equipment and installation, subtransmission line
equipment, materials and civil works, and equipment and tools for
distribution crews would be procured by ICB following IDA guidelines for
procurement. Consultants would be engaged in accordance with IDA
guidelines for the use of consultants.
3.23     Procurement documents for all bidding packages estimated to cost
US$50,000 equivalent or more (about 95% of the estimated total value of
contracts) would be subject to IDA's prior review. To expedite
procurement, EdH and IDA reached preliminary agreement during project
preparation on three bid packages which would be procured by ICB: (a) gas
turbine equipment and installation, including step-up substation and spare
parts; (b) equipment, materials and civil works for the Peligre-Hinche
subtransmission line; (c) distribution equipment and tools.
Disbursements
3.24     The proceeds of the IDA credit are expected to be disbursed over 6
years. The disbursement schedule reflect the standard profile for all IDA
credits to Haiti. Proceeds from the credit would be disbursed for:



- 18 -
(a)    1002 of foreign currency expenditures for goods;
(b)    1002 of foreign currency expenditures for works;
(c)    1002 of foreign currency expenditures for consulting services; and
(d)    1002 of total expenditures for EdH's training program, including
fellowships.
3.25     All disbursements will be made against full documentation.  The
closing date would be December 31, 1995, six months after estimated
completion of the project. A detailed estimated disbursement schedule for
the proposed IDA credit is shown in Annex 12. Retroactive financing for
expenses incurred after March 30, 1989, for up to US$150,000 is proposed
for payment of engineering services that EdH will have to engage fo,:
project design.
Financial Prospects
3.26     Mainly through actions taken for curtailing electricity losses
(paras. 2.14 and 3.30), EdH is expected to improve its financial
performance significantly in FY89. Energy losses are expected to decrease
from 40X to about 302 during that year. As a result of this, the rate of
return on revalued fixed assets is estimated at 3.52, compared with 22
prevailing in the recent past. These results are far from satisfactory,
but constitute a good beginning for achieving EdH's medium-term ob4ective
of becoming again able to contribute over 302 of the financial requirements
of its investment program, out of its intarnal cash generation.
3.27     The terms of the onlending agreement between the Government and
EdH should be consistent with both EdH's long-term financial objective and
current financial limitations. EdH should thus repay the Government in 20
years including five years of grace. The subsidiary loan agreement should
carry a market-based rate of interest of 7%, but allow for financing of
interest during the grace period. The Government should assume the Dollar-
-DR exchange risk to avoid imposing on EdH a difficult-to-manage
variability of returns. EdH should assume the Gourde-Dollar exchange risk.
These arrangements would impose on EdH substantial financial discipline,
but allow time to adjust during a period of five years, in which EdH will
be both carrying out substantial investments and rebuilding revenue-
generating capacity. Before thie end of project execution, on account of
the loa. subsidiary to the IDA credit, EdH would be making additional debt-
service payments of some US$3 million per year, or about 302 of current
total debt payments.
3.28     During the project execution peri ., in addition to covering
operating costs, increases in working capital and debt service, EdH will
have to carry out total investments of about $300 million, including $28
million under the present project. Government transfers specifically
assigned for low-income neignborhoods will finance about 42 (US$12 million)
of the total cost of those investments; contributions from developers and
upper-income customers will finance another 3 % (US$11 million)
approximately. Government sub-loans out of foreign loans and transfers,
for an estimated total of US$163 million, would finance about 522 of the
cost of the total investment program. EdH will cover the remaining US$130
million of total investments (402) out of its internal cash generation.



- 19 -
3.29     To cover the requirements of its investment and financing plan,
EdH will have to achieve progressively higher rates of return on revalued
fixed assets during the project execution period. In support of EdH's
overall investment and financing plan, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that EdH will achieve a rate of return on revalued fixed
assets of 3.5X in FY89, 4.52 in FY90, 5.02 In FY91, 5.52 in FY92, 6.0S in
FY93, 7.0S in FY94, and 8.0% in FY95 and thereafter. These rates are about
the maximum EdH could realistically achievel that of the later years of
project execution is fully consistent with EdHl's long-range expansior.
requirements. Thle experience with a rate-of-return covenant with EdH is
positive, as EdH has a highly reliable system for revaluing fixed assets
and computing the rate of return.
3.30     To achieve the above rates of return SdH, in addition to
implementing minor tariff increases, will have to improve its commercial
and operational efficiency substantially through the project period. In
support of this, assurances were obtained during negotiations that EdH will
maintain its total energy losses in Port-au-Prince at no more than 25X in
FY90, 202 in FY91, 182 in FY92 and 162 in FY93 and thereafter, and in the
provinces at no more than 182 in FY90 and 152 In PY91 and thereafter.
Likewise, in support of upgrading EdH's operating efficiency, particularly
in the area of use of human resources, assurances were also obtained during
negotiations that EdH will maintain ratios of customers per staff of no
less than 64 in FY89, 72 in FY90, 78 in FY91, 83 in FY92, 88 in FY93, 92 in
FY94, 97 in FY95 and 100 in FY96 and thereafter.
3.31     The difficulty of raising tariffs, inter-alia, substantially
constrains EdH's ability to carry out additional investments and incur
additional debt. Thus, to help ensure that EdH's financial plan will
adhere to main priorities, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that EdH will seek IDA's consent to: (i) carry out any investment costing
over 12 of the value of EdH's revalued fixed assetst and (ii) contract debt
other than the project if after contracting the new debt its service
coverage ratio were to fall below 1.5.
3.32     Accounts receivable are expected to be in average at less than
sixty days of billing, because: (1) balances of receivables from the
private sector would be at no more than 60 days of billings, partly as a
result of measures required to'comply with above-mentioned loss targets;
and (il) receivables from public entities are expected to be in average at
30 days given that, in order to prevent excessive arrears, the Government
and EdH have agreed thats (a) the Goverrment commits itself and its
agencies to pay their current electricity bills within 30 days of billing;
(b) Government will submit to IDA, prior to effectiveness, a satisfactory
action plan specifying all measures necessary to ensure that such bills are
paid, including satisfactory monitoring arrangements; (c) Government will
grant EdH authority to suspend electricity service to agencies in arrears;
and (d) the onlending agreement between the Government and EdH will provide
that the Government will deduct from EdH's interest payable, the arrears of
its agencies to EdH of over three months old;
3.33     In order to allow for proper monitoring by IDA of EdH's financial
condition, investment program and operational performance targets,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that EdH will: (i) furnish to
IDA each year before June 30, for its review and comment, an investment
plan, financial projections and monitoring indicators similar to those
under the format of Annex 14, for the current and the following five years;



- 20 -
and (Ui) propose measures, including adjustments to tariffs and other
charges, if needed to comply with the above financial covenants.
Assurances were also obtained during negotiations from the GoverWnent that
it will support EdH in taking the measures needed to meet its institutional
and financial commitments under the project.
3.34     Based on compliance with its financial commitments to IDA, EdH, as
portrayed in the financial projections, should be in a solid financial
position and satisfactorily finance its total investment program during the
project execution period. The average contribution to annual investments,
which will about double the present ones, will be 40%. By the end of
project execution that contribution would be equivalent to over 1.5 times
revalued depreciation, which is compa:.able to high international standards
of financial performance for power utilities and somewhat better than EdH's
best historical performance.
Economic Justification
3.35     The proposed project includes investments necessary to supply
electricity to the Port-au-Prince area in 1989-1995, and to supply
electricity to the city of Hinche. Since it is difficult to allocate
benefits to each component of the EdH expansion program, an economic
evaluation of the individual components of the proposed project was not
done. Instead, the internal rate of return for 'UH's overall investment
program for the period 1989-1995 was computed as the discount rate
equalizing the present value of the stream of costs and benefits associated
with it. The cost stream, in 1988 constant prices, comprises the capital
cost of the development program for generation, transmission and
distribution and the associated incremental operation and maintenance and
fuel costs. Revenues derived from incremental sales were used as a proxy
for benefits. The benefits stream represents revenues generated by the
investment program using average tariffs, also in constant prices, and
assuming that these benefits are attributed to the program at 101 of the
increase of sales in 1989, 20% in 1990, 401 in 1991, 601 in 1992, 80X in
1993 and 100X from 1994 on. Shadow pricing was not used. Other benefits
to society and the economy of the country, such as those derived from
Improvement of quality of service to customers and availability of energy
to industry and commerce, were not evaluated. On these assumptions, the
internal rate of return for the program is about 16% (Annex 15).
3.36     Standard sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the
Impact on the base case rate of return as a result of variations on the key
parameters. The result of these analyses were:
Scenario                      Rate of Return (1)
1.  Base Case                        16
2.  Investments 102 higher           14
3.  Benefits    102 lower            13
4.  Benefits    101 higher           17
5. Investments 102 higher
and Benefits 10% lower           12
6.  Fuel Cost   202 higher           14

Environmental Aspects
3.37     Haiti faces an environmental problem with very serious economic
effectst deforestation. Since the resulting soil eros.Jon threatens the
long-term productive capacity of land, control of erosion is one of the
country's most critical needs. This problem affects the power sector
because erosion-induced siltation is reducing the useful volume of the
Peligre hydroelectric plant's reservoir. The Government has undertaken an
integrated study, under the IDA-financed Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 1786-HA of May 20, 1987), with a view to proposing policy changes
and investments to reduce soil erosion and reverse deforestation.
3.38     The project would be executed with due regard to protection of the
environment. Specifications for equipment and design of installations
would limit gas emissions and noise to acceptable levels. No environmental
problems are expected to result from the project.
Risks
3.39     The project is not complex technically nor a major financial
burden on EdH. The main project risk is that potential socio-political
instability may hamper EdH's efforts to reduce electricity theft and
sustain stable management, and thus prevent EdH from achieving the expected
financial and institutional performance. The above risks, however, are
considered manageable and acceptable given the important potential benefits
of the project and EdH's record of generally satisfactory management. No
negative environment4l Impacts are expected from the project.
Performance and Financial Indicators
3.40     Project execution will be monitored against target dates shown in
the implementation schedule in Annex 10. EdH's operational, financial and
managerial performance will be monitored against the annual indicators
shown in Annex 14.

a rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in
operation of not less than 3.5% in FY89, 4.5% in FY90, 5.0%
in FY91, 5.5% in FY92, 6% in FY93, 72 in FY 94 and 8% in FY95
and thereafter (para. 3.29);
(g)    undertake no investment prior to the completion of the
Project which would exceed the equivalent of 1% of the
current net value of EdH's fixed assets in operation, unless
it has furnished IDA with satisfactory evidence that such
investments are technically and economically justified and
that EdH would have adequate financial resources to carry out
the investments (para. 3.31); and
(h)    prepare and send to IDA starting in January 1990 quarterly
reports with a comprehensive assessment of its operating,
maintenance and fuel costs, and measures applied in
preventive and continuous maintenance, as well as in
monitoring sound and economical operation (para. 2.13);
the Government that it will:
(a)    enable EdH to carry out the plan of action for institutional
development (para. 2.8 and Annex 2);
(b)    take all necessary measures to support EdH's actions to
eliminate electricity theft (paras. 2.14 and 3.30);
(c)    tak, all measures necessary to ensure that all its agencies
and offices and autonomous public agencies pay their
electricity bills within 30 days of billing; the onlending
agreement between Government and EdH will provide that the
Government will deduct from EdH's interest payable, the
arrears of government agencies to EdH of over three months
old; allow EdH to suspend service to agencies in arrears
(para. 3.32); and
(d)    allow EdH to set tariffs at levels &afficient to earn a rate
of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation
of not less than 3.5% in FY89, 4.5% in PY90, 5% in FY91,
5.5% in FY92, 6% in FY93, 72 in FY94 and 8% in FY95 and
thereafter (para. 3.29);
4.2      The following main provisions of the Project Agreement for Credit
1527-HA would be maintainedt
(a)    EdH will at all times fill its key managerial positions with
persons whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to
IDA (para. 2.7);
(b)    EdH will contract independent auditors acceptable to IDA to audit
EdHts annual financial st.!tements and statements of expenditures;



- 24 -
(c)    EdH will review, before December 31 and June 30 in each of its
fiscal years, whether it would meet the covenanted rate of return
in respect of such fiscal year and the next following Fiscal year,
and would furnish to IDA the results of such review;
(d)    EdH will revalue its assets every year; and
(e)    EdH will seek IDA's consent before incurring any new debt if its
debt service coverage were thereby to fall below 1.5.
4.3      Before declaring the credit effective, the following conditions
shall have been met:
(a)    an action plan specifying all administrative and monitoring
arrangements required to ensure that electricity bills of
government entities are paid within 30 days of billing shall have
been presented to the IDA (para. 2.32);
(b)    a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and EdH shall have been signed (para. 3.20); and
(c)    EdH's plan of action for recruitment of staff for FY90 shall have
been submitted to IDA (para. 2.9);
B. Recommendation
4.4      With the above agreements the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of SDR 18.6 million (US$24.0 million equivalent).

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
EdH's Institutional Aspects
Institutional and Manatement Framework
1.       EdH is a Government-owned public utility created in 1971.  EdH
began its operation in 1971 by taking over the Government-owned Peligre
hydro plant and the privately owned Compagnie d'Eclairage Electrique of
Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien; since then, it has gradually taken control
of all electric service in provinces.
2.       The President of EdH is the President of the Republic, who
delegates authority on a permanent basis to the Minister of Public Works,
Communications and Transport, who acts as the Chairman of the Board of
Directors. Other members of the Board are the Minister of Finance and
Economy, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Governor of the Central
Bank, the Commisaire a la Promotion National et a l'Administration Public
and EdHIs General Manager. Policy directives are set by EdH's President;
the board regulates and approves tariffs modifications, major investment
plans, borrowings and broad policies.
3.       EdH's current organization (Annex 1) based on a 1981 study by
foreign consultants funded by IDA requires to be improved. The General
Manager, appointed by the President of the Republic has reasonable autonomy
and is assisted by four Directors (Planning, Administrative/Financial,
Technical and Comercial).  Responsibilities for administrative and
financial management will be divided between two directors as the workload
is excessive for a single director.
4.       EdH's original by-laws were approved in July 29, 1971, and amended
on April 9, 1977 to modify the composition and the scope of the Board, A
revision of the by-laws is advisable, mainly to make the Board of Directors
more operational and institute organizational changes. The plan of action
(Annex 2) provides for an amendment of EdH's by-laws.
Information System
5.       EdH has a rudimentary information system to monitor the utility's
operation. Furthermore, the recording and processing of financial data
lack uniformity and are delayed. Within the context of the Fourth Power
Project (1527-HA), EdH installed new computer facilities, replacing the
WANG computer model VS80 by the VS90-3A1 with 3072 kB memory of CPU. The
VS80 peripheral equipment was preserved. EdH has modern data processing
systems for customer billing, accounting, payroll and inventory. Some
microcomputers were installed in the planning department to prepare

Annex 3
Page 2 of 2
production statistics and economic evaluation of expansion plans and in the
Comptroller department to prepare the payroll of the executive staff and
some financial tables. Under the proposed project, EdH plans to implement
the following systems: (i) financial projections (para 6); (ii) a budgeting
system (para. 6); (iii) budgeting control process; (iv) management of human
resources; and (v) monthly technical and financial report required for
management purposes.
Budgeting and Financial Proiections
'6.       The annual budgeting process has not been developed appropriately
and the medium and the long term range financial planning is non-existent.
This stems from lack of qualified personnel in the Comptroller department.
Financial Planning activities have been recently transferred to the
Planning Department and the needed professional staff is under training
with IDA assistance. The tasks of incorporating the budgeting process in
the data processing system (para. 5) and introducing a financial projection
capability in EdH are included in the Action Plan.
Billint and Collection
7.       EdH, with the assistance of consultants financed by IDA, has
installed modern data processing system for customer billing and
accounting.   EdH personnel has quickly become acquainted with the new
system, which is working satisfactorily. Billing for customers in the
entire country is processed in Port-au-Prince and monthly bills are
distributed by carriers and by mail. Within 20 days of receipt consumers
should pay their bills at EdH's offices (which are somewhat lacking in
adequate facilities) or banks located throughout the country.
Accountinx and Auditing
8.       EdH is in the process of Improving its accounting system, assisted
by consultants (funded by the last IDA credit) and by external auditors.
Due to lack of qualified personnel, several accounting subsidiary systems
(bank reconcilement, account payable, long-term debt, and fixed assets and
depreciation) have not been implemented.
9.       EdH's internal auditor reports directly to the General Manager.
Its functions are limited to supervise cash transactions and inventories
because of lack of qualified personnel. The internal control report of the
independent auditors asks for the attention of deficiencies in the
accounting and internal control systems. The proposed Action Plan (Annex
2) addresses the needs of the internal auditing department.
Insurance
10.      EdH's major installations such as generation plants (excluding
dams) and substations are insured against major risks. EdH has adopted a
self insurance policy to cover accidents on transmission lines and
distribution network, which is acceptable.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Ron-technical Loss Reduction Protram
Past Experience
1.       Energy losses have been at high levels for a long time in Haiti.
These losses were originated from an inadequate and old distribution system
(technical losses) and to unauthorized use of electricity through illegal
connections (non-technical losses). To reduce technical losses, IDA's
previous projects have financed the renovation of the distribution system
of Port-au-Prince with works scheduled to be completed by the end of 1987.
A technical study prepared by DECON which IDA required during the
preparation of the Fifth Power Project, shows that the technical losses are
at low levels (2.9Z in the distribution system) but that non-technical
losses in some circuits about equal total sales. For the period April
1986-April 1987 the total losses in Port-au-Prince have reached 30g of the
net production of electricity.
Origin of Non-technical losses
2.       During  appraisal the mission made a preliminary diagnosis of the
origins of the non-technical losses. The largest share of non-technical
losses is due to illegal connections and theft of electricity. Other
causes include: (i) division of responsibility of relation with customers
between the Technical and Commercial Directorates; (ii) inadequate
commercial procedures, particularly delays for connection of new customers;
(iii) possible irregularities and inadequacy of meters; (iv) inadequate
accounts receivable control; (v) lack of authority to disconnect illegal
customers and customers in arrear. Based on this preliminary diagnosis IDA
suggested a program for loss reduction as detailed below.
Outline of loss Reduction Proaram
3.       The loss reduction program would consist of five groups of
activities: (i) Technical Study; (ii) Field Survey; (iii) Commercial
Procedt-res; (iv) External Actions; (v) Review of Results.
Technical Study
4.       This study would be a continuation of the study already initiated
by DECON in the renovation of the distribution system. It would consist of
a simulation study (using micro-computers) of the operation of the
distribution system based on actual data of the system and field
measurements of load in the transformers, in the circuits and comparison of
measured and simulated flow of energy with the billed energy sales.



- 31 -
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3
This computer program is already available at EdH and has successfully been
used in some circuits. After the use of this program to all circuits, EdH
would have as a results (i) the level of technical and non-technical losses
per circuit; (ii) the localization of the areas of the city where the
losses are concentrated; (iii) the possible overloads in circuits and
transformers and the corresponding necessary reinforcements.
Field Survey
5.       Oriented by the result of the technical study, EdH would take
field actions beginning by the more critical areas to find out the
irregularities (direct connections, by-pass of meters) and take actions to
eliminate them. Field actions should be oriented to solve the problem and
to avoid confrontation with the public, so, it is very important to
interview the residents of the houses to get information on the causes of
the irregularities (lack of money to pay the bill or difficulty to become a
regular customer). It should also be pursued to regularize the situation
of the connections (by the transformation of an illegal into legal a
connection).
Commercial Procedures
6.       The actual organization of EdH divides the responsibility of
relations with customers between the Technical and Commercial Directorates.
This division of responsibilities weakens the coordination of actions
against fraud. EdH should change its organization transferring from the
Technical Directorate to the Commercial Directorate all the units and
services that are customer related (meters department and connection of new
customers)
7.       The procedures for connection of new customers are very
bureaucratic and time consuming. They should be changed drastically to
simplify and speed up the process. Analyses of the procedures should be
made to eliminate difficulties to the connection cf new customers.
8.       The metering system should be audited to verify: (i) possible
irregularities in the meters; (ii) adequacy of reading crews; (iii)
adequacy and accuracy of meters; (iv) meters management control.
9.       The billing process should be reviewed including the data
gathering system, billing procedures, and bill collection. The possibility
of simplification in the payment of bills should be investigated. The
accounts receivable control and the disconnection of customers in arrears
should be enhanced.
External Actions
10.      The Government should support EdH in the loss reduction program.
This support should include political, legal and police support for the
actions to be taken. Some governmental administrative procedures EdH is
obliged to follow before connecting a new customer should be eliminated.



- 32 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 3
11.      EdH should implement a public relations program in accordance with
the loss reduction program. This public relations program should explain
to the public the procedures to request electricity connection and the
associated costs.
Review of Results
12.      As soon as the program has been applied in each part of the city,
an analysis of the results obtained should be made. This would include the
updating of the technical study of the related circuits and the comparison
of the achieved results with the desired goals.

The Power Market
Historical Data
8.2     Since the Peligre hydro plant was completed in 1972, sales in Port-
au-Prince area have grown at 16.41 per year in the period 1972-1980, and
4.5S per year in the period 1980-86. This second period corresponds to
years of reduction in economic activities in the country, increase in theft
of electricity and power restrictions due to a very dry year (1983) an;. EdH
limited capacity to meet the demand. Sales in the provinces have gown
steadily at high average rate of 12.2Z per year. The following table shows

Energy Losses
8.3      Energy losses have been at high levels for a long time.  After
reaching a peak of 32.2S in 1983 in Port-au-Prince losses declined slowly
but increased again in 1986 both in Port-au-Prince and in provinces. By the
end of 1987 EdH had completed the renovation of Port-au-Prince distribution
network and as a consequence technical losses are declining and should
decline even more. The increase in total losses is due to non-technical
losses including increase of theft. The proposed project has a non-
technical loss reduction program as a component. EdH would implement this
program to reach decreasing loss level to about 161 by 1992 and thereafter.
These values of losses were considered in the forecast of future generation
requirements.

Forecasts
8.4      EdH's consultants Fichtner forecast energy sales and generation
requirements using a model that considers macroeconomics inputs and
historical data. Two scenarios were considereds one conservative,
considering the maintenance of actual level of employment and another,
optimistic, considering the creation of 10,000 new jobs per year in industry
between 1988 and 1997.  Later on, the distribution study consultant of EdH
(DECON) umade also load forecasts following a different approach, that is,
taking into consideration the expected number of new connections per
distribution circuit and the globalization of this value. The results of
DECON study and the evolution of the electric market during 1986 and the dry
seasons on 1987, led to a revision made during appraisal which is
approximately the conservative scenario of Fitchner. Based on these studies
and the expected improvement of losses levels the following sales and
generation were forecast:

Generation Expansion Program for Port-au-Prince area
8.5      Under credit 1527-HA IDA financed the expansion of Carrefour disel
plant (the units initiated operation in December 1985 and January 1986), as
well as the feasibility study of hydroelectric projects in the Artibonite
river basin. As a first step of these feasibility studies, a board of
consultants was hired to analyze all existing studies and to make
recommendations. The Board of consultants recommended to install a diesel
plant in 1989 and to prepare the final design of Artibonite 4C Hydro
electric plant and the feasibility study of the coal-fired steam plant.

8.6      EdH hired consultants for both studies: Artibonite  -  (Sogreah-
Lahmeyer), financed by IDA, and coal-fired thermal (Pichtner), financed by
IDS. These studias were concluded in January 1987.
8.7      In January 1989 DECON performed a long-term least-cost expansion
program which included as alternatives medium-speed units, low-speed diesel
units, Artibonite 4-C and the Saint Chistophe coal-fired steam plant.  The
resulting program appears belows
