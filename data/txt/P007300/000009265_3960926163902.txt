MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum  and  recommendation  on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Haiti for  SDR 18.6 million (US$ 24 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance a fifth power project for Haiti.
2.       Background.  Haiti has limited energy resources.  Fuelvood accounted for
74Z of total energy  supply  in  1988.    Deforestation  has  led to serious soil
erosion, which has resulted in siltation of existing reservoirs and threatens
future hydropower  development.    No  petroleum  deposits  have been identified.
Imported petroleum products represented 18S of the country's total energy
consumption in 1988, and are the main source of commercial energy. Another 52 of
energy was derived from bagasse. Hydropower supplied 32 of Haiti's energy needs.
Hydropower potential that can be economically developed is limited to about 120
MW, but will involve high investment costs which make thermal and diesel capacity
more attractive.   Only  about  102  of  Haiti's  population  of  6.2 million has
electricity service. About half of the people in the capital city of Port-au-
Prince and about 32 in the rest of the country are connected to Electricite
d'Haiti's (EdH)  systems.    Power  sector  development  has  been constrained by
shortages  of  foreign-exchange  financing,   limited  qualified  staff  and  the
country's social and political instability. The structure of electricity tariffs
is satisfactory and in line with long-run marginal costs, but average tariffs are
now very high (about 0.16 US$IkWh), as a result of high operational costs and
electricity theft.
3.       EdH, an autonomous government agency  created  in 1971, is the sole body
responsible for electric power generation, transmission and distribution in the
country. The Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of Public Works,
Transport and Communications, approves major investment plans, borrowings and
policies, as well  as  electricity  tariffs.    Under  good management, EdH has
improved electricity service and reduced its technical losses, mainly through
programs undertaken under the Fourth Power Project (Credit 1527-HA). These
included rehabilitation of generating plants and distribution systems and a
better control of operations in the provinces. However, as a result of political
events in late 1988 and subsequent social disturbances, EdH experienced a setback
in key areas: a) highly qualified top managers had to leave the company under
pressure from EdH's labor union; b) electricity theft climbed to high levels,
causing total losses to increase from 302 to 40X and the rate of return on
revalued fixed assets to decrease from around 42 to 22; and c) financial
airangements for investments in urgently required generating capacity expansion
suffered considerable delays. As a consequence of the latter, some rationing is
anticipated for 1990 and 1991.
4.       However, the Government and  EdH  have  taken quick, sound measures with
encouraging  results.    Early  in  1989  the  Government  restored institutional
stability,  appointing  as  general manager  the  then  financial manager.   In
addition, EdH and the Government filled other middle-management positions with
qualified EdH staff.    In  the  financial  area  EdH  initiated, with government

support, a massive campaign against electricity theft and customers in arrears,
including disconnection  of  fraudulent  connections  with  police  assistance to
protect EdH'o crews.    As  of April  1989,  EdH's  new management is performing
satisfactorily and EdH shows discernible progress In reducing consumers' arrears
and electricity theft.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involv_ment.  Key elements of IDA's strategy for Haiti
include supporting $provements in Infrastructure necesssry for the reactivation
of the productive eectors and the strengthening of institutions important to the
development process. Since 1976, IDA has supported the development of the power
sector in Haiti through four credits amounting to US$ 80 million. However,
although these projects were generally successful, throe issues were only
partially solved: high energy losses, government arrears to EdH, and EdH's
managerial and institutional weaknesses. The preparation of the proposed project
took into account the lessons learneds the non-technical losses are being dealt
with separately from technical losses; the arrears settlement agreement began its
Implementation prior to negotiations; and the managerial and institutional issues
are dealt with through a detailed action plan.
6.       Prolect Obiectives.    The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  provide power
investments which are urgently needed to ensure a reliable supply of power
necessary for economic growth, and in particular, for industrial and commercial
activities. The additional capacity to be provided will avoid the rationing of
power that would otherwise become severe by 1992. Further, by interconnecting
the cities of Hinche and Thomonde to the main grid* it would substitute for
expensive local diesel generation and thus lower operating costs. The project
would also reduce non-technical losses, and Improve dEH's managerial financial
and technical capacity.
7.       Prolect Description. The proposed  project comprisess (a) installation
of two 20-MW gas turbine generating units in Port-au-Princel (b) construction of
a single-circuit, 42 km-long subtransmission line of 23 kV from the Peligre hydro
plant to Hinche; (c) procurement of equipment and tools for maintenance of
distribution  systems  and  the   loss-reduction   program;  (d)  preparation  of
feasibility studies for future medium-speed diesel units; (e) a preinvestment
study to assess the economic merits of a frequency conversion (from 50 Ha to 60
Hz) of the Ciment d'Haiti plant, to serve this plant from EdH's main grid; (f)
strengthening of an on-going program to reduce non-technical losses; (g) carrying
out a program for EdH's institutional development, including the implementation
of a training program. The total cost of the project, to be executed over six
years, is estimated at US$27.6 million, of which the foreign-exchange component
of US$ 24.0 million (872), would be financed by IDA. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan for the project are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method
of procurement and disbursements, as well  as  a disbursement schedule appear in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of IDA
operations in Haiti are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the
Staff Appraisal Report No. 6888-HA dated May 4, 1989, are also attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  Government has agreed to  (a) enable EdH to carry out a
program for institutional Improvement; (b) take all necessary measures to support
EdI's actions to eliminate electricity theft; (c) take all measures necessary to
ensure that all government agencies pay their electricity bills within 30 days of
billing and allow dEH to suspend service to agencies in arrears; and (d) allow
EdH to set tariffs at levels sufficient to earn a rate of return on average
revalued net fixed assets in operation as agreed with IDA and EdH (para. 9).



-3-
9.       EdH has agreed tot (a) implement  a Plan of Action for its institutional
development which will strengthen EdH's management (by transferring customer-
related activities from the technical to the commercial directorate, and by
splitting   the   administrative   directorate   into   separate   financial  and
administrative directorates), and to improve EdH's accounting and auditing
procedures and information systems; (b) hire new specialized staff only according
to a program to be submitted to IDA by December 1989, and improve its efficiency
so as to reach agreed annual targets of the number of customers per employee
ranging from 64 in FY89 to 100 in FY96; (c) implement a program to reduce non-
technical losses to gradually reduce its total losses in Port-au-Prince to 16S by
FY93, and in the provinces to 15% by FY91, and to employ consultants by December
1989 to strengthen and supervise the loss-reduction program; (d) maintain its
electricity tariffs at a level sufficient to earn rates of return on a'yrage
revalued net fixed assets in operation ranging from 3.52 in FY89 to 8X in FY95
and  thereafter;    and  (e)  seek  IDA's  consent  prior  to  undertaking major
investments.   The main  provisions  under  Credit  1527-HA will be maintained,
including that EdH will  continue  to  fill  its  key  managerial positions with
persons whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA.
10.      Special conditions of effectiveness  will  bes  (a) an action plan shall
have  been  preseated  to  IDA   specifying  all  administrative  and monitoring
arrangements required to ensure that Government entities' electricity bills are
paid within 30 days of billing; (b) a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between Government and EdH shall have been signed; and (c) EdH's plan of action
for recruitment of staff for FY90 shall have been submittec to IDA.
11.      Benefits.  The project will  contribute  to restoring economic growth in
Haiti, as it will provide the reliable electricity service needed for the
expansion of industrial production and commercial activities.  The rate of return
of the project is at least 162, which is satisfactory. This rate of return is
understated because electricity sales have been used as the only measure of
project benefits.
12.      Risks.  The project  is  not  complex  technically nor a major financial
burden  on  EdH.    The  main  project  risk  is  that  potential socio-political
instability may hamper dEI's efforts to reduce electricity theft and sustain
stable management, and thus prevent EdH from achieving the expected financial and
institutional performance. The above risks, however, are considered manageable
and acceptable given the important potential benefits of the project, the
interest shown by the Government in stabilizing EdH's management and EdH's record
of  satisfactory  management  even   during   political   crises.    No  negative
environmental impacts are expected from the project.
13.      Recommendation.  I am  satisfied  that  the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
