MEMORANDUM AND RECONIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR A
KARNATAKA RURAL WATER SUPPLY & ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed development
credit to India for SDR 66.3 million (US$92 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity and help finance a rural water supply and environmental sanitation
project in the State of Karnataka.
2.        Background.     Over the past ten years,  India has made a major
investment in developing rural water supplies. As a result, it is estimated that
about 95% of all villages in India now have accass to at least one safe drinking
water source. However, this supply of water is not adequate to meet the demand
within villages and the rural population is still using unsafe water to a large
extent. On the environmental/sanitation side, less ambitious programs have been
made available to promote latrine usage among the lower income groups in rural
areas. These programs have been largely unsuccessful due to insufficient public
health education.   As a result, less than 3% of the rural population use
latrines.
3.        Additionally, public facilities for drainage are poor.  As a result
of lack of clean water and environmental saritation, water related diseases are
a major health problem. This is especially true for infants and children of whom
over 80% are adversely affected annually. This results in infant mortality rates
in rural areas two-thirds higher than those in urban areas. Providing a reliable
domestic water supply, linked to improved environmental sanitation and health
education would be important factors in improving health standards and economic
productivity in rural areas.
4.        Under the Eightin Five-Year-Plan, the central government is emphasizing
the consolidation of rural water supply coverage to improve service levels,
greater community participation in operation and maintenance (O&M) and improved
water quality surveillance. The plan also proposes a new strategy linking health
education to sanitation and water supply. The proposed project would support the
new approaches being adopted by the central government under the five-year-plan.
5.        Previous Bank Experience and Lessons Learned.  The Bank has one on-
going project, the Maharashtra Rural Water Supply anid Environmental Sanitation
Project (Credit 2234-IN), which combines rural water supply, health education and
environmental sanitation in one investment package. It just became effective in
July 1991, so our experience to date has been limited. While the Bank has not
financed any other free-standing rural water supply projects in India, it has
financed six urban water supply and sewerage projects in the states of Gujarat,
Kerala, Maharashtra, Rahjasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The projects in
Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have been completed and Project
Performance Audit Reports have been prepared.
6.        The main lessons learned from audited projects are:   (a) adequate
project preparation before appraisal, including detailed engineering design is



essential; (b) financial and institutional strengthening targets need to be
realistic; (c) cost recovery has been insufficient and needs to be improved to
ensure sustainable operations; (d) the number of contracts should be reduced to
simplify the procurement process; (e) improvements in construction quality can
be achieved by prequalifying contractors and monitoring construction supervision;
and (f) more use should be made of the private sector (consultants) in project
preparation and implementation in order to avoid delays and excessive Bank
supervision input. In eddition, the initial lessons learned from the on-going
Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project are: (a) the
need for establishment of an empowered committee in order to avoid delays in
project awards and other essential decisions; (b) the development of innovative
community participation approaches, in particular the formation of village
committees, should begin on a pilot basis during preparation; and (c) the need
to increase the subsidy share for the construction of sullage drain&ge (from 50%
to 70%) in order to reduce the risk this component would fail due to lack of
counterpart funds from the community. The lessons learned from the audited and
on-going projects have been incorporated into this proposed project.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The proposed project would directly
support IDA's strategy to improve the health and living standards of low income
people, particularly, the rural poor.  In addition, it would encourage mcre
involvement of Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and women in the sector,
through their participation in project planning and implementation. Women, in
particular, would benefit from the project through improved access to domestic
water supply sources. This, in turn, would give them more time to participate
in economically productive activities. Also, IDA involvement is likely to
strengthen the State government's resolve to improve cost recovery for O&M.
Although other donors are active ir the sector, the scale of their financial
i.vestment is small and IDA would promote coordination among donors.
8.        Project Objectives. The main objective of the project is to raise the
standard of living in rural areas through improved health and productivity.
These result from improved access to potable rural water supply systems and
environmental sanitation facilities.   These improvements would be achieved
through promotion of the following specific objectives:   (a) more equitable
distribution of safe water via improved design standards and community
involvement  in the  siting of standposts  and handpumps;    (b)  increased
suatainability of water supply and drainage schemes through additional cost
recovery for O&M and greater involvement of the community in maintenance; (c)
expanded public and private investment in environmental sanitation through
programs focusing on latrine usage and the provision of sullage drains; and (d)
greater community awareness of the causes of water-related health problems and
the need for a cleaner environment through a health communications program
targeting women, adolescents, and children. This project would also develop
replicable models for coordinating water, environmental sanitation and health
communications programs for other areas of the state and country.
9.        Project DescriRtion.  The proposed project would be implemented in
about 12 districts in Karnataka and cover approximately 1,200 villages (250 in
phase 1, 750 in phase 2 and balance in phase 3) with an estimated population of
4.8 million.  The project would comprise the following four components:  (a)
Rural Water Supply, (base costs US$63 million) including construction of new and
rehabilitation of existing water supply schemes in 1,200 villages, assistance for
Public Health Engineering Department's (PHED) borewell program, leakage repair



works, a water quality control program and measures for groundwater recharge;
(b)   Environmental Sanitation,  (base costs US$26 million)  consisting of
construction of environmental sanitation facilities includin. sullage drainage
and, on a demand basis, pit latrines, washing platforms, cattle troughs, bathing
cubicles, street bins and bio-gas plants;  (c) Injtittin Building and Project
Supprt, (base costs US$15 million) including community development programs for
creation of village water supply and sanitation committees, comprehensive
training programs and strengthening of the project management, Public Health
Engineering Department (PHED) and Zilla Pariahads (ZPs); and (d) Health
Coommuicatlo , (base costs US$1 million) covering training programs to create
greater community awareness and demand for improved hygiene and environmental
sanitation. NGOs vould play a major role in the community development and health
communication programs.
*         10.       Village Selection Criteria.  The villages to be served under this
project are being selected in accordance with criteria developed by GOK and GOI.
Villages with less than 10 liters per capita per day (lpcd) supply would be given
first priority. Second priority would be given to villages with less than 20
lpcd, etc.. All selected villages )-tve less than 40 lpcd water supply and face
acute water scarcity in the dry season. High priority also would be given to
villages with serious water-related health problems such as guinea worm,
fluorosis, hepatitis, cholera and gastroenteritis, and villages without adequate
groundwater sources which require regional water supply schemes.
11.       Proiect Costs.    The total project cost is estimated at US$118
million; the proposed IDA credit of US$92 million equivalent woull cover about
87% of costs, net of taxes and duties. The GOK would finance US$17 million and
the communities' contributions for latrines and drainage would be US$9 million.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive
financing up to US$1.7 million would be provided for eligible expenditures made
after April 1992 in order to facilitate timely project start-up. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements as well as the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. The Timetable of Key Processing Events and the Status of
the Bank Group Operations in India are given in Schedules C and D.
12.       Main Protect Conditionalities.  During negotiations, assurances have
been received that:
(i) GOK would: (a) prepare guidelines, satisfactory to IDA, based
on experiences learned from the pilot schemes, to be used for
implementing the community participation activities of the project;
(b) appoint and maintain necessary qualified staff and provide funds
to meet all recurrent costs for effectively operating the water
quality monitoring system in the 12 project districts; (c) make
arrangements satisfactory to the Association with the Mandals to set
and collect water and drainage tariffs; (d) agree on draft regulations
for establishment and operation of Village Water Supply and Sanitation
Cofmittees (WSC);  (e) award no later than September 30, 1993,
contracts to consultants and non-governmental organizations, for
promoting community participation in planning of water supply and
environmental sanitation works to be carried in the second phase of
the Project; and (f) award consultants contracts for supervision of
construction fok the second phase of works to be undertaken under the



- 4 -
Project, prior to award of contracts for the commencement of said
works; and
(ii)  as a Condition of Effectiveness, GOK would:  (a) appoint key
staff of PPMU, PHED, and ZPs; (b) award consultants contracts for
health communication, training, final design (phase 2), and
construction supervision (phase 1); and (c) issue regulations setting
out procedures for establishment of VWSCs.
13.       Environmental Aspects.   The environmental classification for the
project is Category "B".  The provision of a safe and reliable water supply plus
improved environmental sanitation facilities,   related health education and
enhanced community awareness of the importance of a clean environment are
expected to have a positive environmental impact on the lives of people in the
rural areas. Also the project would strengthen the State's capacity to monitor
water quality for bacterial, mineral and chemical contamination. The projeet is
not expected to have any adverse impact on the environment. Although the share
of tribal population in the project is low (5% of the population), steps will be
taken to ensure that special efforts are made by the social survey and community
participation consultant to consult with the tribal communities to seek their
active participation in the design and implementation of the project. Special
attention will also be paid to scheduled caste population in the project villages
to ensure their unrestricted access to the water supply facilities.
14.       Project Benefits.   The project is expected to benefit about 1,z00
villages encompassing 4.8 million people. About 40% of the population to be
served are currently below the poverty line.  The main benefit would be the
reduction in the incidence of water-related diseases. This would lead to reduced
morbidity and mortality, higher productivity, and more available water for daily
domestic use.   The project would also result in time saved, by women, in
collecting water. It would also give communities more responsibility for their
own services which should lead to improved maintenance and operations.
15.       Risks.   The construction of the water supply facilities in the
villages is expected to be straightforward. However, there is the risk that the
environmental sanitation and health communications components may be given lower
priority in implementation and, thus the full impact of the integrated approach
may not be realized. This risk will be minimized by the monitoring role of the
Project Planning and Monitoring Unit, the use of NGOs and consultants for
community development and health communication, and the formation of village
water and sanitation committees. In addition, the sustainability of investments
in rural water supply would be at risk if there were inadequate institutional and
funding arrangements for O&M. This risk would be minimized through measures to:
(a) upgrade local skill levels through training; (b) strengthen administrative
arrangements by which communities assume responsibility for O&; (c) maximize
revenues through design improvements and provision of house connections; and (d)
clearly identify subsidies required in the poorest areas.



16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that th_ proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
