INMRAND     MD RECOMM'JATION OF THE PRESIDENT
- OF    INTERATIONAL IK FOR RECONSTRCTION AND DEVELOIENT
TO THE MECUTIVfl DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE RIMPULIC OF KOREA
_ FOR A IPOAD IMROVENT PROJECT
1.     l Th  following memorandum and recovnendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Korea for US$200 mlllion eltuivalent is submittod for approval.
The loan would help finance a road improvement project and would be for a term
of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bsnk's standard variable interest
rate.
22.         B dkgrond.    The successful economic performance in Korea has
created significant demand for transport of all types. The Government's strategy
has been to increase capacity and modernize the transport system ln line with
demand. In addition to the Vrowth of demand, there has been-a substantial change
in the modbl distribution with the-previously dominaut role of the railways being
replaced by a more balanced distribution of traffic among rail, coastal shipping
and road for freight, and between road and rail for passenger transport. The
Bank has supperted the Government's objectives in the transport sector and has
helped finance projects in rail, ports and highways. Previous operations in the
road sector have assisted in the Ldentification of many sector issues and have
supported actions to improve policies and to strengthen institutions. - The
Government has assigned high priority to continuing Bank assistance for road
development because of the still substantial investment needs and to provide
continuity in the implementation initiatives on road maintenance systems and
safety.
3.          lbe Road System.  The public road network totals about 54,700 km
comprising 1,540 km of expressways, 12,252 km of natlonal roads (in addition to
the expressways), 10,300 km of provincial r -1s, 12,900 km of county roads and
17,700 km of urban streets.  In addition there are about 52,400 km of village
access roads. The national expressways are toll roads. These figures represent
a doubling of the road network from about 27,000 'km in 1962. About 82% of
national roads are paved but much of the network of provincial and country roads
still needs improvement. Despite heavy investments in road improvements since
1967, only 41% of provincial roads and 21% of county roads were paved as of 1987
and a high level of imestment will continue to be required to ensure an adequate
level of service for growing traffic volUmes and maintenance of existing assets.
Unpaved roads, including some national roads, continue to have poor gravel or
earth surfaces, despite some recent improvements. The physical condition of most
unpaved roads in such that driving speeds are very low, driving conditions are
unsafe and transport costs are high. On some of the more heavily travelled
sections of the paved road network where traffic volumes have increased rapidly,
congestion is becoming saproblem and road capacity increases are much needed.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Bank lending to Korea has been
scaled down considerably but is being continued at a modest level consistent with
the country's still large external debt, and the vulnerability of its economy
to world market conditions, and in light of growing fiscal pressures arising from
won appreciation, expanding budgetary outlays for accelerated social sector
programs, higher wages and increasing production costs. The Government is not



2
taking the current external financial surpluses and Korea's standing in overseas
markets for granted.   In the context of a prudent borrowing program, the
Government has assigned high priority to continued Bank assistance for road
development. Improved transportation infrastructure is important to advance the
Government's Sixth Plan policies aimed at the integrated development of small
cities and rural areas and reduced regional disparities. The road network
remains a high priority, with significant benefits to be derived from investment
in many roads that are still unpaved or require capacity expansion. The proposed
project is also the logical continuation of the Bank's previous efforts in the
road subsector and builds on specific program initiatives begun earlier,
including the improvement of road maintenance and road safety. Both road safety
and maintenance systems are areas where Korea's knowledge and experience lag
behind the general level of development and where external expertise, organized
through Bank-supported projects, ,an be inexpensively and successfully applied
to Korean conditions.
5.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project is to increase transport
capacity during the Sixth Plan period (1987-91) by supporting three principal
road-related Government objectives: (a) enhancing transport efficiency by
upgrading the surface and alignment of existing roads and by improving road
maintenance and operations; (b) expanding traffic capacity by widening roads with
high transport demand; and (c) increasing traffic safety.
6.          Project Descrintion.  The project would have four components:
(a) paving, upgrading and widening of about 270 km of the national road system;
(b) establishment of a new road maintenance management system including periodic
maintenance of about 700 km of paved roads; (c) implementation of selected
aspects of the national road safety program including safety-conscious road
design of project facilities, physical improvement of known hazardous road
locations and preparation of road safety guidelines; and (d) the provision of
equipment, consultants' services, and training for road sector development. The
selection of specific investments under component (a) would be made according
to economic rate of return criteria. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Republic of
Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7556-KO dated April 12, 1989 is being distributed
separately.
7.          Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government confirmed: (a)
that the road maintenance management system would be carried out as agreed ; (b)
that the road safety program would be carried out as agreed; and (c) the details
of the training program.
8.          Benefits.   The main benefits obtained from the type of road
improvements to be made under the proposed project are the substantial savings
in vehicle operating costs accruing to road users. The selected components have
ERRs ranging from 12% to 54% with the weighted average being 27%. Both road
maintenance and safety related activities are expected to produce even greater
benefits than the road widening and upgrading components but they have not been
subjected to formal economic analysis.

9.          Rika.       The project poses no major risks. There is a possibility
that unforseen difficulties with land acquisition could result in delays in the
timely implementation of the project. However, MOC's experienc should minimize
delays. A number of people will need to be resettled  but previous experience
in Korea indicates that the assessment and payment of compensation to the
affected people is made in a fair and timely manner and delays are not expected.
10.         Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the Executive
*        Directors approve the proposed loan.
