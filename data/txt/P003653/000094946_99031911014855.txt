Chapter 1 Executive Summary
1.1 Introduction:
The development of Chinese economy and the growth of foreign trade have
gained great achievements since the economic reform started. During the past ten
years, the average growth rate of foreign trade was 14% per year. Rapid
development of foreign trade casts great pressure on foreign trade system as well
as provides ample cargoes for foreign trade. Sea transport was the predominant
way in which China connects with world market. Therefore the transport
networks from ports to inland areas is the vital important part of foreign trade
transport system. But container transports mainly center on coastal area,
especially on those provinces and regions where seaports exist. And the capacity
of most ports has saturated. The amount of current equipment will have huge
difficulties in facing the high increasing traffic of containers. If the capacity of
ports can not be enlarged as quickly as possible, it will be difficult to meet future
demands of container transport. With regarding to above considerations, SPC and
SETC are determined to improve international container multi-model
transportation system by using the World Bank loan in order to satisfy the
increasing demand of international trade transport. During the period of preparing
the feasibility study of the project, the World Bank defined the project as
category B, which does not required full scale environmental assessment.
According to the relevant environmental management regulations on building
project and requirements coming from the World Bank, SEA must be carried out.
So SETC entrusts the Environmental Impact Center Of Tianjin to prepare EIS.
The assessment center will prepare EIS and submit it to environmental
management department for approval. In doing so, corresponding reference
grounds will be provides in making-decision and implement of the project.
1.2 Project Description
The project consists of eleven sub-projects. It spans 11 cities of 4 provinces
in P.R.C. including Tianjin Port ICD of Tianjin, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao,
Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan ICDs of Hebei Province, Baotou ICD
of Inner Mongolia municipality, Xintang, Xiaoshan, Huzhou ICD of Zhejiang
Province.
Tianjin Port ICD is located at the Shisanmi of Xingang, Tanggu District of
Tianjin Municipality. This sub-project will enhance Tianjin Port Container
Company's ability to handling containers by purchasing and installing new
container handling equipment and facilities with loan of WB.
The other 10 sub-projects belong to new construction projects. According to
characteristics and demands of international container transport, the 10 ICDs will
have following functions: inland port; handling inter-modal procedures; cargo
distribution, transshipment and warehousing; international freight forwarding;
l



ISO container CY & CFS; retuming point of empty boxes; MIS application,- EDI
application; and auxiliary functions.
Geographic locations and sites of the II ICDs are shown in attached maps.

1.3 Baseline data of all ICDs
1.3.1 Natural environment of all ICDs
Tianjin Port ICD is located in the port. The climate in Tianjin Port district
belongs to oceanic climate. The average temperature of the hottest month is 26.2
degrees centigrade. The average temperature of the coldest month is -4.1 degrees
centigrade. The maximum rainfall is 80mm/hi. The earthquake intensity is 7
degrees.
Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan and Cangzhou of
Hebei Province are located in North China Plain. The climate of this region
belongs to warm temperate and sub-humid monsoon climate. The annual average
temperature is 10-14 degrees centigrade. The annual average rainfall is 600-
800mm. The earthquake intensity is 6-7 degrees.
Baotou lies in the west of Inner Mongolia municipality. The climate belongs
to continental climate. The highest temperature is 36 degrees centigrade and the
lowest is -33 degrees centigrade. The annual rainfall is 280-300mm.
Xintang, Xiaoshan and Huzhou are located in Zhejiang Province. This
region belongs to subtropical and warm temperate monsoon climate. The annual
average temperature is 15-20 degrees centigrade. The annual rainfall is 1400-
1600mm.
1.3.2 Investigation and assessment of the existing environmental quality of
all ICDs
Air quality of the most ICDs is good. Of the 4 routine monitoring items, SO2,
CO and NOx are all below or reached level IT of Ambient air quality
2



horns. Vehicle speeds are limited within 15 km/h.
*  Signs, wvhich show "Speed limited", "No usinig horns", are set up in
the construction site.
*  Construction rubbish must be collected and sent the trash collection
station.
Furthermore,
*  A soundproof wall, which costs 30,000 yuan RMiB, is set up in the
southwest of the Qinhuangdao depot, which separates the residential
from the construction site.
*  Any Civil engineering is prohibited at night. All machines producing
intense noise, such as agitators, should be arranged in the north of the
Qinhuangdao depot where is far from the residential area.
* A cistern (a no leak cement cistern) with the capacity of 4 cubic
meters, which cost 20,000-40,000 yuan RMB, should be built to store
wastewater in Qinhuangdao ICD, then wastewater produced in the
construction phase is transported to the sewage treatment plant
regularly.
Above mitigation measures, which will be implemented by ICD and
supervised by LPMO and LEPA, must be incorporated into the engineering
design process according to Regulations of environmental noise prevention of
PR.C
1.4.1.2 Environmental impact due to operational phase
(1) Air pollution of operational phase:
The main pollution source is tail gas from vehicles. Because the yard is
wide enough, transport density is not large and the retention time of vehicles
is short. Furthermore, from air baseline data of all ICDs, concentrations of
NOx and CO are below the national standards, so it can be concluded that
the local air pollution is not serious. So tail gas will cause little adverse
impact on ambient environment.
Mitigation measures
* ALL vehicles, which go in or out of ICDs, must run in the designated
route (have been designed by engineering design department) in order
to avoid the local air pollution. In order to reduce air pollution, these
plants, such as willow tree, elm, black locust etc., should be planted
on both sides of the route.
(2) Wastewater pollution of operational phase:
The wastewater discharged from each depot is composed of two parts:
industrial wastewater produced by container cleaning and domestic sewage.
4



Wastewater discharged fron these seven depots, Tangshan, Baoding,
Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan, Xintang, Xiaoshan ICD, should execute Level
of Integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB8978-1996). Level III
stipulates the highest concentrations of various pollutants, which COD is 500
mg/L and SS is 400 mg/L. The seven depots must build primary sewage
treatment facilities (separation tank-  oil-water separator and sedimentation tank
etc.). After being primarily treated by these sewage treatment facilities,
wastewater according with the standard can be dischlarged into sewage nets.
Domestic sewage can be discharged into sewage nets directly according to
relevant regulations after being treated through septic tank. The wastewater,
which is discharged into sewage net after being primarily treated, will be
centralized treated in the sewage treatment plant.
Wastewater discharged by Huzhou ICD will be directly discharged into
Tieshui Port Area sewage treatment station (120in3/d) which can meet the
increasing treatment demands (35t/d in 2005).
There are no sewage networks near Qinhuangdao ICD. Tang River prohibits
any wastewater to be discharged into. So cleaning water and domestic sewage of
this depot should not be discharged into Tang River. The wastewater, which will
be treated primary, then be stored in a cistern and transported to the nearest
sewage treatment plant by trucks regularly. In the future (2002) , when the
municipal sewage networks are laid to the depot, wastewater of this depot should
be discharged into the networks and be treated in sewage treatment plant. Thus,
wastewater of this depot will cause little impacts to ambient water environment
on condition that wastewater is strictly treated as the above requirements.
Tianjin Port ICD has been equipped with sewage treatment facility (power
absorbent charcoal treat system), whose treatment ability (one ton per hour) can
meet the demand even after this depot is rebuilt and expanded (three ton per day).
So after secondary treatment, cleaning water will accord with the discharged
standard and can be discharged into the sea. Domestic sewage will be discharged
into the local sewage treatment plant (Tianjin Port), which can treat 2000 tons
wastewater a day. So wastewater of this depot will cause little negative impact to
ambient water environment.
Baotou ICD will transport dangerous cargoes (mainly calcium carbide), so it
must be equipped with sewage treatment facility (power absorbent charcoal treat
system). Cleaning water and domestic sewage will be discharged into Erdaosha
River after being secondarily treated. Because of dry climate and high
evaporation in this region, wastewater will mostly evaporate after a distance of
one or two hundred meters. In rainy season wastewater will be diluted by flood.
But due to lacking in sewage networks, if the sewage were discharged for a long
time, the poisons in it would accumulate in soil and bring harimful consequence.
Forttnately, in Baotou the municipal sewage networks are being laid. After 2002,
year, the sewage in this district will be taken into the net system. Therefore, the
treated wastewater will be a little influential on the surroundings before 2002
year.
5



Mitigation measures:
In the liglht of above analysis, mitigation measures must be taken.
All ICDs must put into effect the measures:
*  All of cleaning wastewater must be massively treated. Only the
wastewater fitting the national standards may be discharged. If the
treated wastewater doesn't fit the standard, it needs treating once
more or twice so as to fit the standards.
*  Management should be enforced. Consumption of cleaning water and
domestic sewage should be abated as much as possible. Unnecessary
waste should be avoided. To attain these, on one hand, is to enforce
the management of cleaning work, on the other hand, is to enforce the
management of treatment work. .
*  With the increase of quantity of waste water, it's necessary to expand
scale of the treatment installation, and improve the treatment efficient
so as to insure to treat sewage efficiently and in time.
*  All rubbish (such as sludge), which be produced in the process of
wastewater treatment, must be sent, to the specific trash collection
spot in time.
Furthennore,
e  These ICDs, such as Tangshan   Qinhuangdao   Baoding
Shijiazhuang, Handan, Cangzhou. Xintang, Xiao shan ICDs, must
build primary sewage treatment facilities(oil-water separator and
sedimentation tank etc.). The cost of these treatment facilities is
estimated to be 100,000-200,000 yuan (RUB).
*   Wastewater discharged by Huzhou ICD must be discharged into
Tieshui Port Area sewage treatment station (120m3/d) which can meet
the increasing treatment demand (35tld in 2005).
*   Wastewater discharged by Tianjin Port ICD must be treated by
treatment facilities in Tianjin Port. Now there is a set of sewage
treatment facilities in Tianjin Port, and they can meet the increasing
treatment demand. Sewage treatment facility of Tianjin Port is a
powder active carbon system.
* Because dangerous articles will be transported in Tianjin Port ICD.
The procedure of cleaning containers must be normalized, and the
consumption of organic solvent must be reduced. According to
different cargoes, different cleaning methods will applied, such as
sweeping, vacuuming, high pressure ejecting and steam ejecting
cleaning, etc.
* The abandoned powder active carbon, which produced in the process
6



of wastewater treatment in Tianjin Port ICD, must be collected and
sent to dangerous articles treatment factory in Tianjin.
*   Baotou ICD must install a set of secondly sewage treatment facility
which will cost about 600,000 yuan (RMB).
*  On the basis of the fact that Baotou lies in dry, treated sewage may be
used in other several ways such as watering or planting etc.
*  The abandoned waste, whiclh produced in the process of wastewater
treatment in Baotou ICD, must be collected and sent to dangerous
articles treatment factory in Baotou.
*  A cistern (4m3), wlhicl will have been built in construction phase,
must be used in Qinhluangdao ICD before 2002. Cleaning wastewater
and domestic sewage will be stored in the cistern after being primarily
treated and then transported to the Qinhuangdao sewage treatment
plant.
Above measures will be implemented by local ICD and supervised by LEPA
and LPMO.
(3) Noise pollution:
Machine noises and vehicles noises are main noise sources during
operational phase. Of the 11 ICDs, Qinhuangdao and Tangshan ICDs are close to
their respective sensitive areas, so noises of these 2 ICDs will cause some impact
on the sensitive areas. The other 9 ICDs will cause little impact on the sensitive
areas.
Mitigation Measures:
?  Vegetation belts should be built in all ICDs. Percentage of
vegetation area should be at least 20%. These plants, such as
willow tree, elm, black locust etc., will be selected.
*  Layout of each ICD should be reasonably planned in design
phase. Office buildings should be put up in the side close to
sensitive areas, and workshops where containers are repaired in
the side far away from sensitive areas. Containers must be
repaired inside specific workshops.
*  Reasonable driving routes should be designed in all ICDs, and
obvious signs should be set up to prevent traffic jams. Vehicles
should slow down speed (<15kiliometer/h) when going into and
out of the ICDs.
Furthermore,
*   Soundproof wall, which costs 20,000 yuan (RMB), must be
built in the  north of Tangshan ICD. Percentage of vegetation
area of the Tangshan ICD should be at least 25%.
7



*   Soundproof wall, whiclh costs 30,000 yuan (RMB), must be -
built in the southwest of Qinhuangdao ICD. Percentage of
vegetation area of the Qinhuangdao ICD should be at least 25%.
Above mitigation measures, which will be implemented by ICD and
supervised by LPMO and LEPA, must be incorporated into the engineering
design process according to Regulations of environmental noise preventionl of
PR.C
(4) Risk accident:
Cargoes of Tianjin ICD include some dangerous cargoes. The variety and
quantity of these dangerous cargoes are large. Harms of dangerous cargoes will
be:
* When loaded and unloaded, dangerous cargoes may leak, which will
cause diffiision of poisons, explosion and fire hazards.
* During storage, severe management and wrong pile-up of dangerous
cargoes may cause accidents.
* During transportation, traffic accidents or other unpredicted reasons may
cause risks such as leakage of dangerous-cargoes.
Mitigation measures for dangerous cargoes of Tianjin ICD
A set of mitigation measurements for managing dangerous cargoes must
been established.
*  Strictly carrying on temporal regulations on port management of
dangerous cargoes.
*  Workers who have been trained strictly must operate loading and
unloading dangerous cargoes. Operational departments must carry out
operation according to protection measurements. Operations are
forbid until operational departments have specifications for dangerous
cargoes and carry out safe measurements.
*  Instruments for loading or unloading dangerous and poisonous
cargoes must be used specially. These instruments must be cleaned
after use.
*  More than 4m distance must be made between dangerous cargoes and
general articles. Clear marks must be indicated near dangerous
cargoes.
*  Cargoes must be piled intensively and managed by special persons.
Adequate fire-fighting facilities must be equipped according to
properties of dangerous cargoes.
*  Dangerous cargoes for export should not be stored in general
warehouse for over 72 hours. These cargoes must be transported
within 48 hours.
8



*  When containers of dangerous cargoes are stuffed and destuffing; Tliey
must be kept more than 20m distance to otlher cargoes. The stuffing
and destuffing yard must be equipped wNitlh certain fire-fighting
facilities. Persons participating in are relative fixed and must be
trained strictly.
*  Under the leader of each special managing director, the leading group
consisting of all departments is responsible for management and
supervision of dangerous cargoes.
*  Police station of the company, safety and teclnical departments must
supervise implementation of each safe measurement and emphasize
on loading dangerous cargoes.
In Baotou ICD, calcium carbide (CaC2) are the main dangerous cargoes. The
main dangerous properties of calcium carbide include: nonflammable in the
condition of drying regime, giving off much flammable and explosive
ethyne(C2H2) gas when contacting water. Ethyne(C2H2) gas may do much harm to
people by stimulating skins, eyes and respiratory tracts.
Mitigation measures for dangerous cargoes of Baotou ICD
On the basis of above analysis, the corresponding mitigation measures must
be adopted.
*  Calcium carbide must be intensively stacked, keeping at least 5m
away from other cargoes, and must not be stacked near the cargoes
with opposite properties. Enough dry sand and fireproof equipment
should be kept in the warehouse. Calcium carbide should be separate
from the ground by over 10cm thick cushions to guard against dump.
*  As a leakage accident takes place, workers who enter the accidental
spot should wear safeguard coat to collect leaked in a safe way. In
order to eliminate all fire risks, the spot must be kept good ventilation.
Leaked articles must be kept far from water and not be discharged to
sewage drains.
*  The stuffing and destuffing working zones of dangerous articles
should be kept at least 20m away from any other working zones. And
these zones should be equipped with necessary fire fighters according
to characteristics of dangerous articles. Workers loading and
unloading containers should have been trained.
*  Marks saying "Dangerous" should be attached to containers with
dangerous cargoes.
*  Strengthen management of dangerous articles, enforce phase training,
and strictly enforce "Transport Regulation of Dangerous Cargoes" in
order to minimize or avoid any accidents.
*  Work out and carry out safeguard measures and work out plans that
deal with emergency such as abrupt leakage.

* Assign a special route to transport dangerous articles in the Baotou
ICD
1.4.2 Positive Impact
All ICDs will prompt economic development of the local regions.
* This project will shorten container turning-round time and decrease
transport cost. It can be seen that the project will benefit National
Economy greatly.
* As an advanced transportation means, container transportation will
change present situation of local foreign transportation system. So this
project will improve comprehensive intemational market transportation,
and meet the demand of regional foreign economic development.
* The ICDs will promote the trade development of surrounding regions.
Furthermore, the ICDs will increase employment opportunities and
obtain a good social benefit.

1.5 Alternatives analysis
Alternatives of wastewater treatment of Qinhuangdao ICD
10



Scenario 1
At present, the ICD may establish a set of sewage treatment facilities so thiat
industrial wastewater and domestic sewage can be treated and then be disclharged
into the near river. In the future, when the quantity of wastewater increases and
sewage net is extended to the ICD, wastewater should be discharged into nets and
be treated intensively. However, the nearest river, Tang River is one of drinking
water sources of Qinhuangdao and no wastewater is allowed to discharge into it.
So this scenario is impractical.
Scenario 2
Link a sewage pipe of this ICD with municipal sewage nets so that
wastewater may be discharged into municipal sewage pipe networks and be
treated intensively. But the scenario is been planning. It does not put into effect
before 2002. So this scenario is also impractical at the present.
Scenario 3
Recently wastewater should be treated and attain the standard. The treated
wastewater should be stored in a cistern and then be transported to the sewage
treatment plant by vehicles regularly. This process is suitable for the peculiar
conditions of this district. But the process is complex and wastewater is liable to
leak in transportation, so in the long run this scenario is not a preferable one.
When the municipal sewage pipe networks are extended to this ICD, wastewater
should be discharged into the nets.
This sub-project will adopt scenario 3.
1.6 Environmental management and training plan
1.6.1 Environmental management
The local management organization of environmental protection is
necessary. Its main responsibilities are as follows:
*  Carry out environmental protection policies and statutes, Establish all
kinds of rules according to environmental protection statutes which
are established by the state or districts. Coordinate the relations
between the ICDs construction and environmental protection. Deal
with environmental problems produced in construction and operation
phase.
*  Supervise implementation of the sewage treatment facilities regularly
and deal with problems. Accumulate related technical data and
provide technical support.
*  Carry on environmental education and teclmical training and
disseminate environmental protection coordinating with management
sectors. Enhance environmental protection consciousness of all
workers through various ways and enhance professional quality of
environmental protection staff.
* Organize technological exchange of environmental protection. Utilize
11



and spread advanced experience and technology.
(1) Tianjin Port ICD:
The environmental management of Tianjin port ICD must be brought into
the overall plan of Tianjin Port. Environmental management sectors are necessary
and important sectors to manage Tianjin Port ICD. Table 1-3 shows the structture
of environmental management .sectors.

1.6.2 Staff training
Staff training can be divided into three levels, e.g. training of middle cadres,
environmental technicians, and common staff.
*D Training of middle cadres should improve their attention to
environmental protection by environrmental propaganda and
13



education.
Training form: giving instruction, forum, talking, etc.
Training frequency: once per month.
* Training of environmental technicians should improve their
specialized abilities and disposition.
Training form: sending them to national or local environmental
organizations to study the specialized knowledge regularly and qualifying
them every half a year.
*  Common staffs should possess their posts with permits. Specific
environmental training should be carried out before staffs change their
posts, especially in Tianjin Port ICD and Baotou ICD.
Training form: carrying out environmental education and forum.
Training frequency: once per month.
Trainer: environmental technicians of ICDs and experts of LEPA.
According to above training plan, fund of 10,000-30,000 yuan((RMB)) is
required in each ICD per year. (See table 1-2)

1.8 Public involvement
1.8.1 Content and form of public involvement
Object of inivestigationi: sensitive human beings arounid the depots, mainly
the local residents.
Fornm of investigationi: in terms of the characteristic and impact of the ICDs,
EIA team drew up the questionnaires. The team finally added up and analyzed
the questionnaires that were handed out and collected by the local relatively
sectors entnisted by the team.
1.8.2 Conclusion of public involvement investigation
(1) Investigation was supported greatly by the local department concerned, and
the investigated people showed high enthusiasm. 1200 pieces of questionnaires
were handed out, and 1115 were returned .The recovery rate was 92.9% with
67.8% of male and 32.2% of female.
(2) Among the investigated people, 90% supported the project, 91% thought
the project would be beneficial for the local economy. No person disagreed, and
few persons unconcerned.
(3) The investigated people had uncertain idea on the operational status of the
machinery, the noise pollution and the traffic jams during the container
transportation. It means that the publics pay close attention to pollution treatment
facilities, the noise pollution from container transportation.
In a word, the publics agree that the project will accelerate the local
economic development, improve the investment environment and raise income.
So they hope the project is organized and implemented as quickly as possible.

Chapter 5 Environmental impact and mitigation plan
5.1 Negative impact
5.1.1 Environmental impact due to construction phase
Environmental impact due to construction phase of ICDs(including
Tianjin,Tangshan, Handan, Cangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Huzhou)
Civil engineering of these ICDs has basically completed, so the project has
little impact on ambient environment due to construction phase.
Environmental impact due to construction phase of ICDs (including
Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xintang, and Baotou)
Fields where these ICDs locate are all space. There is large civil engineering
due to construction phase.
The ICD (like Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xintang) locates in development area.
The ICD of Baotou locates in the suburb. These four ICDs is far away from
sensitive area (more than 400m). The project has little impact due to construction
phase, if construction units operate strictly according to regulations---
Environnmental protection design requirements of construction project.
Environmental impact due to construction phase of Qinhuangdao ICD
The ICD locates in the suburb. The area is adjacent to express way and
upstream the Tanghe River, wlhich is drinking water source to residents. There are
some residents near the ICD (about 30m). Dust and noise due to construction
phase have certain impact on residents. It will do harm to Tanghe River that
waste matter is stacked improperly or wastewater is discharged improperly.
Acoustic environment impact due to constriction of Qinhuangdao ICD
During construction phase, all kinds of vehicles and machines produce
48



noises. Usually noises are unexpected, discontinuous and intense. Noise levels of
some kinds of construction machines during construction phase are listed in table
5-1.
Table 5-1 Main noise sources and their intensity during constniction phase
SoLind souirce    Noise level(max)    Distance(m)

Scraper               110        91-107  85-101   79-95   73-89
From table 5-1, noise levels of various machines are all high. Moreover,
when machines work together, the total noise level will be higher. For the nearest
sensitive spot, which is near Qinhuangdao ICD, is 30 meters away from the
according source, so noises during construction phase will cause potential
negative impact on sensitive spots.
Based on the above analyses, mitigation measures must be put into effect in
the construction phase of the ICDs.
These measures must be put into effects in all ICDs.
*  All vehicles going into and out of the ICD are prohibited to contact
horns. Vehicle speeds are limited within 15 km/h.
* Signs, which show "Speed limited", "No using horns", are set up in
the construction site.
*  Construction rubbish must be collectedf and sent the trash collection
station.
Furthermore,
*  A soundproof wall, which costs 30,000 yuan RMB, is set up in the
southwest of the Qinhuangdao depot, which separates the residential
from the construction site.
*  Any Civil engineering is prohibited at night. All machines producing
intense noise, such as agitators, should be arranged in the north of the
Qinhuangdao depot where is far from the residential area.
* A cistern (a no leak cement cistern) with the capacity of 4 cubic
meters, which cost 20,000-40,000 yuan RMB, should be built to store
wastewater in Qinhuangdao ICD, then wastewater produced in the
49



construction phase is transported to the sewage treatment _plant
regularly.
Above mitigation measures, whiclh will be implemented by ICD and
supervised by LPMO and LEPA, must be incorporated into the engineering
design process according to Regulations of environmental noise prevention of
PR.C
5.1.2 Environmental impact due to operational phase
(1) Air environmental impact due to operational phase
The main pollution source is tail gas from velicles. Because the yard is
wide enouglh, transport density is not large and the retention time of vehicles
is short. Fturthermore, from air baseline data of all ICDs, concentrations of
NOx and CO are basically below the national standard, so it can be
concluded that the local pollution is not serious. So, tail gas will cause little
adverse impact on ambient environment.
Mitigation measures
ALL vehicles, which go in or out of ICDs, must run in the designated route
(have been designed by engineering design department) in order to avoid the
local air pollution. In order to reduce air pollution, these plants, such as willow
tree, elm, black locust etc., should be planted on both sides of the route.
(2) Water environmental impact prediction due to operational phase
(a) Water environmental impact prediction of Tangshan, Baoding,
Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan, Xintang, Xiaoshan and Huzhou ICDs
Containers of Tangshan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan,
Xintang, and Huzhou ICD, which don't transport dangerous cargoes, are cleaned
by water only. So the main pollutants in wastewater after are COD and SS. The
wastewater discharged from each depot is composed of two parts: one is
industrial wastewater produced by container cleaning, the other is domestic
sewage. Handling capacity of each depot in 2000, 2005, 2010 can be predicted by
quantitative and qualitative analysis and by experts' experiences. By analogy,
20%  of containers of daily handling capacity are need cleaning and each
container to be cleaned will consume 0.5ton water. From above, industrial
wastewater quantity of each depot can be predicted. The predictions of these
eight depots are listed as following tables.

All districts where these.eight depots are located have built or will build
sewage nets, and have built sewage treatment plants already. (See table 5-10).

Wastewater discharged from these seven depots, Tangshan, Baaoding,
Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan, Xintang, Xiaoshan ICD, should execute Level
of Integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB8978-1996). Level Ill
stipulates the highest concentrations of various pollutants, which COD is 500
mg/L and SS is 400 mg/L. The seven depot must build primary sewage treatment
facilities (separation tank, oil-water separator and sedimentation tank etc.). After
being primarily treated by these sewage treatment facilites, wastewater according
with the standard can be discharged into sewage nets. Domestic sewage can be
discharged into sewage nets directly according to relevant regulations after being
treated through septic tank. The wastewater, which is discharged into sewage net
after being primarily treated, will be centralized treated in the sewage treatment
plant.
Wastewater discharged by Huzhou ICD will be directly discharged into
Tieshui Port Area sewage treatment station (120m3/d) which can meet the
increasing treatment demand (35t/d in 2005).
It can be concluded that each of these eight depots will do little harm to
ambient water environment on condition that wastewater was treated strictly.
52



(b) Water enviironmental impact prediction of Qinhuangdao ICD
Containers of Qinhuangdao ICD, which don't transport dangerous cargoes
are cleaned by water only. So the main pollutants in wastewater after are COD
and SS.
Handling capacity of each depot in 2000, 2005, 2010 can be predicted by
quantitative and qualitative analysis and by experts' experiences. By analogy,
20% of containers of daily handling capacity are need cleaning and each
container to be cleaned will consume 0.Ston water. From above, industrial
wastewater quantity of Qinhuangdao ICD can be predicted. The predictions of
results is listed as following table.
Table 5-11 prediction of waste ater quantity of Qinliuangdao ICD

There is no sewage net near this depot. And Tang River, the nearest rivers
one of drinking water sources of Qinhuangdao, which prohibits any wastewater
to discharged into. So industrial wastewater and domestic sewage of this depot
should not be discharged into Tang River. It can be seen from Table 5-10 that
quantity of industrial wastewater is small, e.i.5 t/d only recently. The
Qinhuangdao ICD must build primary sewage treatment facilities (separation
tank, oil-water separator and sedimentation tank etc.). The wastewater ,which can
attain the discharge standard (executing Level Im of Integrated wastewater
discharge standard (GB8978-1996).) after be treating, can be stored in a cistern
(4m3) and transported to the nearest sewage treatment plant (100,000 ton per
day) by trucks regularly. The cistern will have been built in construction phase. In
2002, when the municipal sewage nets are laid to the depot, wastewater of this
depot should be discharged into the nets.
Thus, wastewater of this depot will cause little impacts to ambient water
environment on condition that wastewater is strictly controlled.
(c) Water environmental impact prediction of Tianjin Port ICD and Baotou
ICD
Dangerous articles are transported through Tianjin Depot and Baotou Depot,
so process of container cleaning is comparatively complex. Therefore, pollutants
in industrial wastewater are varied and concentrations of COD and SS are big.
With regard to the above all, these two depots should be equipped sewage
treatment facilities with appropriate scale.
53



Water environmental impact prediction of Tianjin Port ICD
Through engineering  analysis, wastewater produced by this project is
industrial wastewater and domestic sewage. Industrial wastewater should be
treated in order to accord with relevant standard before being discharged.
Because this project is a rebuilt and expanded project, only quantity of
wastewater increases while kinds and concentrations of pollutants have no
changes. Concentrations of this project are cleaned in Jin-Ri Container Fixing Lt.
Co.. Sewage treatment facility of tlis depot is a powder active carbon system,
which can treat 1.0 ton wastewater per lhotur. Treatment teclhnological process and
treatment capacities of this system  are showed in table 5-12 and table 5-13

In the light of on-the-spot investigation, containers that need cleaning are
1% of total handling capacity, and one ton of water can clean 8-10 TEU on
average. From this and according to prediction quantity of TEU, table 5-14 is
obtained.
Table 5-14 prediction of wastew  er quantity of ianjin lort ICD

Note: the handling capacity of Jin-Ri Co. is 60% of the total of Tianjin Port.
It can be seen from table 5-14 that the existing sewage treatment facility
(one ton per hour) of Jin-Ri Co, which treating wastewater 5 ton per day
currently,. is capable of treating the wastewater even after this depot has been
rebuilt and expanded (increasing only 3 ton per day in 2010). Because Tianjin
Port ICD is only to purse facilities, so domestic sewage of the ICD doesn't
increase. At present, domestic sewage of Tianjin Port can be treated in Tianjin
Port sewage plant, which can treat wastewater 2000 tons a day. Domestic sewage
of the depot will be treated out of question.
From above, all wastewater of this depot will cause little negative impact on
ambient water environment.
Water environmental impact prediction of Baotou ICD
In different periods, kinds and quantities of cargoes are different, in turn,
concentrations of COD and SS in industrial wastewater vary greatly. By
investigation and analogy of some existing interior container depots, it can be
concluded that the highest concentration of COD is 1000-2000 mg/L, and the
lowest is 100-200 mg/L; the highest concentration of SS is over 500 mg/L, and
the lowest is 30-50 mg/L. On average, the mean concentrations of COD and SS
are 260 and 400 mg/L respectively. Concentrations of COD and SS should not
exceed the limit of 120 mg/L and 250 mg/L respectively according to sewage
integrated discharged standard (executing level I of Integrated wastewater
discharge standard (GB8978-1996).). So industrial wastewater produced by
container cleaning should be treated and should attain the standard before being
discharged. According to international regulation of dangerous article
transportation, all containers that have contained dangerous cargoes should be
cleaned and then removed danger signs.
Through investigation, the treatment capacity of a secondly sewage
treatment facility is showed in table 5-15.

Containers need cleaning are 3-5% of total handling capacity and one ton of
water can clean 8-10 TEU on average. The percentage of containers that need
cleaning is predicted to be 10% in Baotou Depot. Table 5-16 can be attained as
follows.
Table 5-16 rediction of wastewater uantit of Baotou ICD
Items                    2000    2005      2010

Cleaning sewage (T/d)     j    2        3         5
From above analysis, though components of pollutants are complex and
concentrations are high in industrial wastewater, quantity of industrial wastewater
is not large (in future it is only 5t/d). The industrial wastewater should be treated
and should attain the standard before being discharged. Sewage treatment
facilities may adopt a powder active carbon system.
Presently, there is no sewage discharge from factories around Erdaosha
River. The depot to be established will be the first to discharge sewage into the
River. Because of dry climate and high evaporation in this region, sewage fitting
the standard will mostly evaporates after a distance of one or two hundred meters.
Relatively large rainfall during rainy seasons will dilute the pollutants in the river.
But due to lacking in sewage net, if the sewage were discharged for a long time,
the poisons in it would accumulate in soil and bring harmful consequence.
Fortunately, in Baotou the municipal pipe net is being laid. After 2002, the
sewage in this district will be taken into the net system. Therefore, the treated
sewage will be little influential on ambient surroundings..
Mitigation measures:
In the light of above analysis, mitigation measures must be taken.
All ICDs must put into effect the measures:
* All of cleaning wastewater must be massively treated. Only the
56



wastewater fitting the national standards may be discharged. W the
treated wastewater doesn't fit the standard, it needs treating once
more or twice so as to fit the standards.
* Management should be enforced. Consumption of cleaning water and
domestic sewage should be abated as much as possible. Unnecessary
waste should be avoided. To attain these, on one lhand, is to enforce
the management of cleaning work, on the other hand, is to enforce the
management of treatment work. .
* With the increase of quantity of waste water, it's necessary to expand
scale of the treatment installation, and improve the treatment efficient
so as to insure to treat sewage efficiently and in time.
* All rubbish (such as sludge), which be produced in the process of
wastewater treatment, must be sent to the specific trash collection
spot in time.
Furthermore,
*  These ICDs, such as Tangshan   Qinhuangdao   Baoding
Shijiazhuang. Handan, Cangzhou, Xintang, Xiao shan ICDs, must
build primary sewage treatment facilities(oil-water separator and
sedimentation tank etc.). The cost of these treatment facilities is
estimated to be 100,000-200,000 yuan (RMB).
*   Wastewater discharged by Huzhou ICD must be discharged into
Tieshui Port Area sewage treatment station (120m3/d) which can meet
the increasing treatment demand (35t/d in 2005).
*   Wastewater discharged by Tianjin Port ICD must be treated by
treatment facilities in Tianjin Port. Now there is a set of sewage
treatment facilities in Tianjin Port, and they can meet the increasing
treatment demand. Sewage treatment facility of Tianjin Port is a
powder active carbon system.
* Because dangerous articles will be transported in Tianjin Port ICD.
The procedure of cleaning containers must be normalized, and the
consumption of organic solvent must be reduced. According to
different cargoes, different cleaning methods will applied, such as
sweeping, vacuuming, high pressure ejecting and steam ejecting
cleaning, etc.
* The abandoned powder active carbon, which produced in the process
of wastewater treatment in Tianjin Port ICD, must be collected and
sent to dangerous articles treatment factory in Tianjin.
*   Baotou ICD must install a set of secondly sewage treatment facility
which will cost about 600,000 yuan (RMB).
* On the basis of the fact that Baotou lies in dry, treated sewage may be
used in other several ways such as watering or planting etc.
* The abandoned waste, which produced in the process of wastewater
57



treatment in Baotou ICD, must be collected and sent to dangerous
articles treatment factory in Baotou.
0 A cistern (4m3), which will have been built in construction phase,
must be used in Qinhuangdao ICD before 2002. Cleaning wastewater
and domestic sewage will be stored in the cistern after being primarily
treated and then transported to the Qinhuangdao sewage treatment
plant.
Above measures will be implemented by local ICD and supervised by LEPA
and LPMO.
(3) Prediction of acoustic environmental impact due to operational phase
Machine noises and vehicles noises are main noise sources during
operational phase.
(a) Prediction of machine noise decrease
Because of transmission distance, absorption by air, reflection and barriers,
noise will attenuate during course of transmission. The attenuation formulation is
as follows.
LA(r)=LAef(rO)-(Adiv+ Abar+ Aatm+ A,,
LA(r)-noise value at the point r away from noise source
Lkef(rO)-noise value at the reference point ro away from noise source
Adiv-attenuation value due to geometric divergence
Abar-attenuation value due to noise barriers
A.,atm-attenuation value due to absorption by air
Aexc-attached attenuation value
r- the distance between noise source and acceptor
In the formulation,
AdiV =lOLg(l/4 n r2)                 ©
By using formulation (, attenuation values due to geometric divergence
from sources to sensitive spots can be calculated. The results are shown in table
5-17.
From table 5-17, it can be seen that attenuation values due to geometric
divergence are all high. In the process of operational phase noises will attenuate
even more due to barriers, air absorption etc., so when noises reach sensitive
spots they have attenuated so greatly that they will have no disadvantageous
effect c i those sensitive spots.

Huzhou                500                    -67
(b) Prediction of vehicle noise decrease
Vehicles with containers are mainly carrying capacities. When a carrying
capacity (usually over 7 tons) is running at uniform speed on a straight road, the
noise level at a spot that is perpendicular to running direction can be calculated as
the following formulation.
LA=A+BlgV
or   LA=a+bV
V ---vehicle speed
A,B,a,b---constants of vehicle type
When the speed of carry capacity is 20-80 km/h, the noise level at the spot
7.5 away from the vehicle is as follows.
LA=45+24lgV
or     LA=70+0.3V
The relationships between speeds of all kinds of vehicles and according A
level are showed in table 5-18. All data in the table are gauged at 7.5m away.
Scope of vehicle speed is 20-80 km/h.
Table 5-18 Regulaion equation of noise levels and speed of all kinds of vehicles
Vehicle      Reg equation Correlation   Reg equatior Correlation r
model          LA (V)         r         LA (lgV)
Medium         65+0.3v       0.84      38+251gv       0.83
Large          70+0.3v       0.90      45+241gv       0.90
When vehicle speed is 20km/h, for large vehicles, La=76 dB(A); and for
medium vehicles, La=7 1 dB(A). Through analyses in (a), noise attenuation values
59



in all ICDs are high, so it can be concluded that vehicle noises will not affect
sensitive spots greatly.
Through the analyses and prediction of (a) and (b), noises during operation
phase are limited within the depots, and can be reduced greatly by effective
measures so they will cause little negative impact.
Mitigation Measures:
*  Vegetation belts should be built in all ICDs. Percentage of
vegetation area should be at least 20%. These plants, such as
willow tree, elm, black locust etc., will be selected.
*  Layout of each ICD should be reasonably planned in design
phase. Office buildings should be put up in the side close to
sensitive areas, and workshops where containers are repaired in
the side far away from sensitive areas. Containers must be
repaired inside specific workshops.
*  Reasonable driving routes should be designed in all ICDs, and
obvious signs should be set up to prevent traffic jams. Vehicles
should slow down speed (<15kiliometer/h) when going into and
out of the ICDs.
Furthermnore,
* Soundproof wall, which costs 20,000 yuan (RMB), must be
built in the north of Tangshan ICD. Percentage of vegetation
area of the Tangshan ICD should be at least 25%.
*   Soundproof wall, which costs 30,000 yuan (RMB), must be
built in the southwest of Qinhuangdao ICD. Percentage of
vegetation area of the Qinhuangdao ICD should be at least 25%.
Above mitigation measures, which will be imnplemented by ICD and
supervised by LPMO and LEPA, must be incorporated into the engineering
design process according to Regulations of environmental noise prevention of
PR.C
(4) Induced impact due to ICDs development:
According to the specific location of the ICDs. Baoding ICD and
Shijiazhuang ICD lie in the economic technology development area. At present,
There exists empty land near the two ICDs. As the ICD development, the induced
impact, such as noise, transport jam, etc. may have some impacts on the
surroundings area in future. So, a reasonable planing of development area must
be considered. Fortunately, the overall planning has been implemented by the
local government in the two development area.

(6) Risk analysis
(a) Risk analysis of Tianjin Port ICD
Cargoes of Tianjin ICD include some dangerous cargoes. The variety and
quantity of these dangerous cargoes are large, tlhough dangerous cargoes make up
a small part of all the cargoes. Dangerous cargoes include explosive cargoes,
radioactive substances, and flammable liquid in retails, condensed liquefied gases
in retails, dangerous cargoes that should keep constant temperature by machinery
and other dangerous cargoes in retails. Hanrns of dangerous cargoes will be:
* Wh4en loaded and unloaded, dangerous cargoes may leak, which will
cause diffusion of poisons, explosion and fire hazards.
* During storage, severe management and wrong pile-up of dangerous
cargoes may cause accidents.
* During transportation, traffic accidents or other unpredicted reasons may
cause accidents such as leakage of dangerous cargoes.
Cargoes of Tianjin ICD include some dangerous cargoes. The variety and
quantity of these dangerous cargoes are large. Harms of dangerous cargoes will
be:
* Whlen loaded and unloaded, dangerous cargoes may leak, which will
cause diffusion of poisons, explosion and fire hazards.
* During storage, severe management and wrong pile-up of dangerous
cargoes may cause accidents.
* During transportation, traffic accidents or other unpredicted reasons may
cause risks such as leakage of dangerous cargoes.
Mitigation measures for dangerous cargoes of Tianjin ICD
A set of mitigation measurements for managing dangerous cargoes must
been established.
* Strictly carrying on temporal regulations on port management of
dangerous cargoes.
* Workers who have been trained strictly must operate loading and
unloading dangerous cargoes. Operational departments must carry out
operation according to protection measurements. Operations are
forbid until operational departments have specifications for dangerous
cargoes and carry out safe measurements.
* Instruments for loading or unloading dangerous and poisonous
cargoes must be used specially. These instruments must be cleaned
after use.
* More than 4m distance must be made between dangerous cargoes and
general articles. Clear marks must be indicated near dangerous
cargoes.
* Cargoes must be piled intensively and managed by special persons.
Adequate fire-fighting facilities must be equipped according to
properties of dangerous cargoes.
61



*  Dangerous cargoes for export should not be stored in general
warehouse for over 72 hours. These cargoes must be transported
within 48 lhours.
*  When containers of dangerous cargoes are stuffed and destuffing, they
must be kept more than 20m distance to other cargoes. The stuffing
and destuffing yard must be equipped with certain fire-fighting
facilities. Persons participating in are relative fixed and must be
trained strictly.
*  Under the leader of each special managing director, the leading group
consisting of all departments is responsible for management and
supervision of dangerous cargoes.
*  Police station of the company, safety and technical departments must
supervise implementation of each safe measurement and emphasize
on loading dangerous cargoes.
(b) Risk analysis of Baotou ICD
Calcium carbide (CaC2) are the main dangerous cargoes in Baotou ICD. The
main dangerous properties of Calcium carbide include: nonflammable in the
condition of drying regime, giving off much flammable and explosive
ethyne(C2H2) gas when contacting water. Releasing ethyne(C2H2) gas which do
much harm to people by stimulating skins, eyes and respiratory tracts.
On the basis of above analysis, the corresponding mitigation measures
should be adopted.
-Calcium carbide must be intensively stacked, keeping at least 5m away
from other cargoes, and must not be stacked near the cargoes with
opposite properties. Enough dry sand and fireproof equipment should be
kept in the warehouse. Calcium carbide should be separate from the
ground by over 1 Ocm thick cushions to guard against dump.
* As a leakage accident takes place, workers who enter the accidental spot
should wear safeguard coat to collect leaked in a safe way. In order to
eliminate all fire risks, the spot must be kept good ventilation. Leaked
articles must be kept far from water and not be discharged to drains.
* The stuffing and destuffing working zones of dangerous articles should be
kept at least 20m away from any other working zones. And these zones
should be equipped with necessary fire fighters according to
characteristics of dangerous articles. Workers loading and unloading
containers should have been trained.
* Marks saying "Dangerous" should be attached to containers with
dangerous cargoes.
* Strengthen management of dangerous articles, enforce phase training, and
strictly enforce "Transport Regulation of Dangerous Cargoes" in order to
minimize or avoid any accidents.
* Work out and carry out safeguard measures and work out plans that deal
with emergency such as abrupt leakage.
* Assign a special route to transport dangerous articles in the Baotou ICD
62



5.2 Positive Impact
All ICDs will prompt economic development of the local regions.
* This project will shorten container turning-round time and decrease
transport cost. It can be seen that the project wxill benefit National
Economy greatly.
* As an advanced transportation means, container transportation will
change present situation of local foreign transportation system. So this
project will improve comprehensive international market transportation,
and meet the demand of regional foreign economic development.
*  The ICDs will promote the trade development of surrounding regions.
Furthermore, the ICDs will increase employment opportunities and
obtain a good social benefit.
Chapter 6 Analysis of Alternatives
6.1 Alternatives of wastewater treatment of Qinhuangdao ICD
Scenario 1
At present, the ICD may establish a set of sewage treatment facilities so that
industrial wastewater and domestic sewage can be treated and then be discharged
into the near river. In the future, when the quanfity of wastewater increases and
sewage net is extended to the ICD, wastewater should be discharged into nets and
be treated intensively. However, the nearest river, Tang River is one of drinking
water sources of Qinhuangdao and no wastewater is allowed to discharge into it.
So this scenario is impractical.
Scenario 2
Link a sewage pipe of this ICD with municipal sewage nets so that
wastewater may be discharged into municipal sewage pipe networks and be
treated intensively. But the scenario is been planning. It does not put into effect
before 2002. So this scenario is also impractical at the present.
Scenario 3
Recently wastewater should be treated and attain the standard. The treated
wastewater should be stored in a cistern (4m3) and then be transported to the
sewage treatment plant by vehicles regularly. This process is suitable for the
peculiar conditions of this district. But the process is complex and wastewater is
liable to leak in transportation, so in the long run this scenario is not a preferable
one. When the municipal sewage pipe networks are extended to this ICD in 2002,
wastewater should be discharged into the nets.
This sub-project will adopt scenario 3.
6.2 Location alternatives of Baoding ICD
Scenario 1
This location lies in the south of Baoding and is near the South Goods Yard
of Baoding. The area of the location is small. And there, are factories and
63



residential areas around the ICD. WhAeni it is developed and expanded; the
buildings need pulling down and the residents have to migrate. So this location
has little chance of further development and can't meet the need of future
development.
Scenario 2
This location lies in the development area of Baoding. There are much
vacant lands around the location, which can meet witlh needs of future
development. This location is near Jing-shi express way and the transport is
convenient. So this location is suitable for the ICD.
This sub-project will adopt scenario 2.
6.3 Location alternatives of Shijiazhuang ICD
Scenario 1
The ICD is made up of two parts: one part is the present ICD, which lies
beside South Road; the other part is a 50-60(mu) vacant land, which lies in the
east of 106 National Road. These two parts are far away from each other, which
is unfavorable for management and transportation. Furthermore, the location is so
close to urban center that it will cause serious impact. So this scenario has now
been rejected.
Scenario 2
This location lies in the development area of Shijiazhuang. It is 2 km away
from 107 National Road, 5 km away from Jing-shi express way, 5 km away from
307 National Road and 8 km away from 308 National Road, which is convenient
for transport. Moreover, this location is far away from the urban center, and there
are few sensitive spots and little pollution impact. So this location is a reasonable
alternative.
6.4 Location alternative of Handan ICD
Scenario 1
Rebuild and expand the existing ICD, No. 1 Transportation Co. of Baoding.
This location has perfect water and electricity supplies, equipment and yard. But
this location has only a 30 (mu) area. So it can't meet with the needs of future
development.
Scenario 2
This location lies in the Northeast of the city. It has been taken over by the
state, so this scenario has to be rejected.
Scenario 3
This location lies in the north of South Circle Road, where the Driving
School of Baoding is now located. The school has built an office building with
complete facilities. There is a vacant field in the north of this location. So this
location has a broad development scope and transport convenience.
This sub-project will adopt scenario 3.
6.5 Location alternatives analysis of Baotou ICD
64



Through on-the-spot investigation, there are three location alternatives for
Baotou ICD to choose. Besides the above alternatives (Baotou Fuel - S ppy
Company) there are other two alternatives.
Scenario 1
Baotou ICD is proposed to be built at Erdaoshahe river to the north of the
outskirts of Baotou, wlhere railway and highway cross, and without problems of
settlement and tearing down houses. Inside the area, a special railway already
connects with the loop railway line of Baotou, and through it connects with
mainlines Beijing-Baotou and Baotou-Lanzhou, the Tianjin Port and the other
part of China can be reached. More over, national highway No. 110 and 210 and
Baogu highway lend to the depot. With roads in all directions, the place is
regarded as suitable for collecting and distributing goods, developing highway-
railway through transport, and building international container transfer station.
The owner of this project has developed services in domestic container transport,
multi-tlhrough transport, heaping, and storage, has obtained plentiful experience,
and has trained a number of skillful staffs.
Scenario 2
One is the location of Baotou International Container Transportation and
Exploitation Company. The location lies to be the south of Baotou Railway
Station. The company has a special 150 meters-railway, which leads to Baotou
Railway Station, a 36-ton-crane and a 7000 -concret-square. Now the company
has the transport capability of 3000 TEU per year and 1530 TEU each time. But
this location is such a narrow space that it has no development opportunities for it
lies between the downtown and Baotou No.2 Chemistry Factory. In addition, the
company mainly transports products of Baotou No.2 Chemistry Factory. So the
surroundings have high concentration of smog and heavy air pollution. In all, this
location is unfit for Baotou ICD.
Scenario 3
The other is the location of Baotou East Container ICD, which lies in the
south of Baotou East Railway Station. This ICD has such a simple function,
lagging equipment and bad working conditions that it can only transport small
civil containers. It is so close to residential areas and the air port that human
flows and vehicles flows will severely obstacle the ICDs development. Moreover
roads around the ICD are narrow, So it's difficult to build a special railway and it
will cause a large scale of migration. In all, this location is not fit for Baotou ICD,
either.
Through a comprehensive comparison and choice, it's reasonable for Baotou
ICD to be built on the location of Baotou Fuel Supply Company. This final
choice not only accords with fundamental principles of location choice, but also
meets with future development of international container transportation.

* The money has been invested.
Note: The investment (120,000-140,000 yuan RMB) of wastewater treatment
facilities includes the investment (20,000-40,000 yuan RMB) of cistern  in
Qinhuangdao ICD.
7.1 Analysis of environmental economy cost-benefit of Tianjin Port ICD and
Baotou ICD
Analysis of environmental economy cost-benefit includes environmental
investments and economic benefit of the plant.
Among the eleven ICDs, only in Tianjin and Baotou ICDs sewage treatment
facilities are required to build. Analysis will be focused on the environmental and
economic benefit, which mainly comes from the container's cleaning and
treatment of wastewater and domestic sewage in Baotou ICD and Tianjin Port
ICD.
Environmental investment
Environmental investment includes the depreciation of the fixed asset and
operating cost of the sewage treatment facilities, the formula is as follows:
I=D+O
I: environmental investment (I04 yuan/a)
D: depreciation of environmental facilities (104yuan/a)
66



0: operating cost of environmental facility (104 yuan/a)
Depreciation =total investment of environmental facility /n (n is the servic_
life of a facility, usually 20 years)
Operation cost includes the charges for electricity, the charges for water,
maintenance cost and the workers' wages.
The total investment of sewage treatment facilities in Tianjin ICD is 200,000
yuan, the service life is 20 years, the operation cost is 50,000 yuan, then the
environmental investment adds up to 60,000 yuan per year. About 1000 tons of
cleaning wastewater will be treated every year, the treatment cost is 60 yuan per
ton.
If the total investment of sewage treatnent facilities in Baotou ICD is
600,000 yuan, the service life is 30 years, the operation cost is 20,000 yuan, then
the enviromnental investment adds up to 40,000 yuan per year. About 5,000 tons
of wastewater (including domestic sewage) can be treated every year, the
treatment cost is 8 yuan per ton.
Environmental benefit
If the treatment facilities operate normally, the main pollution indexes could
attain the effluent standard after being treated. If 1000 and 5,000 tons of
wastewater is treated each year in Tianjin and Baotou ICDs separately, then about
200 kg COD and 400 kg SS could be eliminated in Tianjin ICD, and about 1 tons
COD and 2 tons SS, in Baotou ICD. So the implementation of the environmental
measures can reduce the emission greatly and emission has little influence on the
surrounding areas. From the above, we know that the environmental measures
have significant environmental benefit.
Economic benefit
The direct economic benefit from the environmental measure mainly comes
from the container's cleaning .The is:
B=QXP
B: Economic benefit from container cleaning (yuan/a)
Q: The number of cleaned container (ge/a)
P: Charge standard for container cleaning (yuan /container)
On the analogy of Tianjin Port, in which cleaning container fees is about 200
yuan RMB per container, cleaning container fees is about 150 yuan RMB/per
container in Baotou ICD. About 10000 containers (in Tianjin ICD) and 3000
containers (in Baotou ICD) need cleaning each year, so the economic benefit is
about 2000,000 yuan and 450,000 yuan RMB.
7.2 Analysis of environmental economy cost -benefit of other ICDs
The other ICDs don't transport any dangerous cargoes, so they will build
treatment facilities to treat cleaning wastewater. The investment of these
treatment facilities sees table 7-1:
67



In order to reduce effectively noise impact on ambient sensitive areas and
negative aesthetic impact, it is necessary to build soundproof walls or vegetation
belts around these depots. The environmental investments are shown in table 7-1.
These investments will bring benefits as follows:
* The environmental measures can reduce emission greatly, so that
economic fine and compensation can be prevented to some extend.
* Building green zone or sound -proof wall can reduce the physiological
and psychological loss from the noising to the residents in the
environmental sensitive area.
Althouglh these loss and compensation are uncertain (the amount may be
tens of thousand or hundreds of thousand even millions), they are all potential
indirect economic benefit.
Chapter 8 Environmental management and training plan
8.1 Environmental management of Tianjin Port ICD.
The environmental management of Tianjin port ICD must be brought into the
overall plan of Tianjin port ICD.
8.1.1 Establishment of environmental management index system

10.2 Conclusion of public involvement investigation
Environmental impact assessment center in Tianjin sampled according to
age, sex, occupation in local people wlho may be affected by the project and
inquired the opinions about the project impact, so as to satisfy and protect public
interests in a broader scope. The result of investigation is as follows.
* Investigation was supported greatly by the local department concerned,
and the investigated people showed high enthusiasm. 1200 pieces of
questionnaires were handed out, and 1115 were returned .The recovery
rate was 92.9% with 67.8% of male and 32.2% of female.
* Among the investigated people, 90% supported the project, 91% thought
the project would be beneficial for the local economy. No person
disagreed, and few persons unconcerned.
* The investigated people had uncertain idea on the operation of the
machinery, they also had different idea on the noise pollution and the
traffic jam during the container transportation. It means that the public
pay close attention to the operation of the pollution treatment facilities,
the noise pollution from container transportation would influence
people's normal working and living in some extend.
In a word, the public agree that the project will accelerate the local
economic development improve the investment environment and raised income.
So they hope the project is organized and implemented as quickly as possible.
