AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        This report appraises an agricultural credit project for which a
Bank loan of US$5.0 million equivalent and an IDA credit of US$3.0 million
equivalent, a total of US$8.0 million equivalent, is proposed. The Project
would support a three-year lending program for grain farm mechanization
and dairy farm and date-palm development. Government would be the borrower
of the IDA credit which it would on-lend to the Banque Nationale de Tunisie
(BNT) while the Bank loan would be extended to BNT directly. BNT would be
responsible for Project administration. This would be the second agricul-
tural project the Bank/IDA has helped finance in Tunisia.
ii.       BNT, a multi-purpose bank established in 1959 and mainly owned by
Government, is the major source of agricultural finance in Tunisia. It has
used funds from its own sources -- share capital, reserves and deposits --
and has also been the agent for Government financing in agriculture. To
implement the proposed Project, BNT would develop a small, appropriately
staffed unit, headed by a qualified and experienced farm management specialist.
Technical assistance in establishing this post and others under the Project
would be provided in the proposed loan/credit. Although BNT is a mature
institution, its financial situation was not entirely satisfactory and some
corrective measures were needed before the Project is presented to the Board.
iii.      From Tunisia's independence in 1956 until 1969, Government's
policy was to increase and diversify agricultural production through
cooperatives, wherever possible. The Bank/IDA's first agricultural project
(484/99-TUN), approved in 1967, was in line with this policy. In January
1969, however, attempts to extend cooperatives to cover all arable land
met with such opposition from private farmers and disillusioned cooperative
members that Government reversed its policies and is now determined to
encourage and support individual farmers. For the period 1965-1969, the
total value of agricultural output has declined in real terms by 22%, while
the overall economy has expanded. Its contribution to GDP has declined
from 23% in 1965 to 16% in 1969. To some extent, this deterioration has been
due to adverse weather but more significant has been the poor performance,
in general, of production cooperatives and the lack of confidence of private
farmers. Notwithstanding, agriculture is important to the Tunisian economy,
accounting for a quarter of total exports and employing half of the working
population.
iv.       The proposed Project is designed to finance individual farmers
for the production of grain and dairy products in Northern Tunisia. In
addition, it would support date-palm production development in southern
Tunisia by lending through BNT to the Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie
Laitiere (STIL). The Project would increase production of wheat for import
substitution, dates for export, and milk for local consumption. Investments
would be mainly in tractors and combines, livestock, tubewells, and land



- ii -
improvement. Annual net foreign exchange earnings at full development
are estimated at US$8 million.
v.        Total Project cost would amount to US$15 million equivalent.
Sub-borrowers would contribute about 30% and BNT about 17%. The proposed
loan and credit, equivalent to about 53% of total Project cost, would
finance the estimated foreign exchange component. Sub-borrowers would be
charged 8% per annum interest. Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk and on-lend IDA funds at 1% for 15 years, including five years of grace.
vi.       The range of items to be financed under the Project is varied and
most of it unsuitable for bulk procurement. With regard to agricultural
machinery and pumpsets, a number of foreign firms are represented through
local dealers, supplies are adequate, and prices competitive.  Procurement
would, therefore, be through normal commercial channels. However, contracts
for large deep well drilling amounting to about US$400.000 would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
vii.      The financial rates of return on individual sub-projects are esti-
mated to range between 14% and 26%. The overall economic rate of return is
estimated at about 22%. Appropriate assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions. The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5.0 million for a
term of 15 years, including a five-year grace period, and for an IDA credit
of US$3 million on IDA's standard terms.



AGRIC}lLTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
l.0l      In 1967 Tunisia received a Bank loan of US$12 million and an
IDA credit of US$6 million for the development of agricultural production
cooperatives.  Implementation of the L ro p ect was substantially affected
by changes in agricultural policies during 1969. Ir. January of that year
Government announced a greatly accelerated coOperativ;t development that went
far beyond agreement reached with Bank/IDA, but, afte-z opposition by private
farmers as well as cooperative menbers and in recognitii;n of the strain which
such a policy put on scarce human and finaincial resources, drastically re-
vised this policy in September 1969.  At that time, a law was enacted that
stipulated that, henceforth, state farms, cooperatives, and private farmers
would coexist. This had the effect of removing cooperatives from the central
role they had been expected to play in Tunisia's development. The change
in the basic situation instigated a review by a Bank/IDA mission in October
1969, which, in turn, led to a reduction of its loan/credit from US$18 mil-
lion to US$9.2 million. The change in the project was œiproved by the
Bank/IDA in November 1970.
1.02      In the course of renegotiating the cooperative farm project, the
Bank/IDA offered to study the problems and needs of small farmers, including
the former production cooperative members. The study was designed to review
what could be done to improve the productivity and efficiency of small farm
units and to cover such matters as marketing of their production, input
supply and extension services, and credit facilities. However, the Govern-
ment did not want the Bank/IDA to concern itself at this time with this
aspect of its revised agricultural policy and assured that it would under-
take such a study without Bank/IDA assistance. To revive the private farming
sector which, until September 1969, had insufficient access to credit
facilities, the Government requested the Bank/IDA to assist in the preparation
of a credit project for the private farming sector in Northern Tunisia and
to review a tree-crop development scheme in Southern Tunisia. In February
1970, a Bank and FAO/IBRD cooperative mission helped prepare such a credit
project. A formal Government request for financial assistance was received
by April 1970.
1,03      This report is based on the findings of a Bank/IDA appraisal
mission to Tunisia in June/July 1970, composed of Messrs. H. von Oppenfeld
and J. Gregor (Bank/IDA) and Messrs A. Bonnier and M. Delavalle (consultants
to the Bank/IDA).

II. BACKGROUND OF AGRICULTURE
Role of Agriculture
2.01      Tunisia has an area of about 160,000 km  and a population of
about 5.2 million which is growing at about 2.8% per year. About a quarter
of the total land is classified as cultivable, about 37% as grazing and
range land and the balance (about 37%) as arid or desert land. Agriculture
is the main sector of the economy, employing about half of the active popu-
lation and accounting for about 16% of GNP and a quarter of total exports
(Annex 1).
2.02      Only in Northern Tunisia, which contains about 60% of the
population, is agricultural production reasonably dependable. While the
modern sector of agriculture is still relatively small, there are more
than 2,000 farms of over 100 ha, and nearly all are located in the north.
In this region, rainfall is adequate and soils are good; available water
is generally acceptable for the irrigation of most crops. Presently, about
16,000 ha are irrigated from the Medjerda and there are plans to expand
to about 75,000 ha. A study of water resources in the north, undertaken
by consultants and financed by the Bank, was completed in July 1970.
It revlewed an outline master plan, prepared by the Government, and covered
alternative development approaches -- with a time horizon of 25 years --
involving hydropower, flood control, irrigation, and urban water supply.
2.03      The southern region, while semidesertic, supports oasis-type
agriculture, producing vegetables, dates, and livestock. Development oppor-
tunities under such conditions are restricted but not negligible. A
third region, "the Center," is steppe country, with rainfall not exceeding
200 mm annually, and essentially a stock breeding zone; irrigation possibil-        *
ities are limited.                                                                  _
2.04      While the growth of the overall economy has been positive in the
recent past, agricultural output in real terms was less in 1969 than it was
in 1965. The decline in agriculture has been due partly to adverse weather
conditions and partly to the poor performance of production cooperatives,
together with a lack of confidence on the part of private farmers.
2.05      The balance of trade in agricultural products has seriously
deteriorated in the past decade. Exports of Tunisian hard wheat have ceased,
whereas in 1959 they were some 180,000 tons. Grain imports (mainly soft
wheat) have grown substantially, reaching 480,000 tons in 1969, more than
half of Tunisian annual grain requirements. The value of Tunisia's leading
agriculture export commodity, olive oil, has also shown a decline, dropping
from D 13.5 million in 1966 to D 11 million in 1969, while imports of soya
bean oil have increased in recent years. In coming years, the imbalance will
be aggravated by increasing demands for fresh food products, such as
vegetables, fruits, fish, and meats.



-3-
2.06      From independence in 1956 to 1969, agricultural policies
emphasized increased and diversified agricultural production through
cooperatives wherever possible. Previously, most of the better lands
were farmed by French and Italian settlers (colons), covering about 300,000
ha in Northern Tunisia. In 1964 most of these lands were expropriated and
subsequently amalgamated with adjacent lands, owned and farmed by small
Tunisian farmers, into production cooperatives. Progress was slow, how-
ever, due to inadequate management and excessive Government interference.
In January, 1969, when Government declared that the cooperative system would
be extended to all arable lands, disinvestment by private farmers began to
reach serious proportions. Liquidation by sale or slaughter of livestock
is estimated to have reduced the national herd by about 25%. Standards of
land preparation had already declined over the last two years, productivity
deteriorated, and, on many farms, the cropped area was reduced due to lack
of adequate farm inputs.
2.07      In September 1969, agricultural policies were drastically changed.
A new law made participation in cooperatives voluntary. As a result, nearly
all former landed members of the cooperatives, dissatisfied with the system,
reclaimed their lands (covering about 150,000 ha) and the cooperatives were
left with about 200,000 ha to be farmed by landless members, the former
laborers on colon farms.
Agricultural Credit
2.08      The banking system consists of the Banque Centrale de Tunisie
(BCT), 11 deposit banks, and one investment bank. Two of the deposit banks
are mainly Government-owned -- the Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB) and
the Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT). These account for more than two-
thirds of the total credit to the economy and almost 40% of total deposits.
Provisions of the basic bank law are given in Annex 2.
2.09      Agriculture's share of loans outstanding increased from D 6.2
million (5%) in 1964 to D 21.7 million in 1969, but this still represented
only 10% of overall credit (D 227 million). BNT, is the principal source,
accounting for 92% (D 20 million) in 1969. In line with development policy,
there was a noticeable shift in lending away from the private farming sector:
its share of loans declined from about 30% in 1965 to 11% in 1969, and the
actual amount of such loans declined from D 2 million to D 1.2 million.
Cooperative lending increased from D 4.6 million in 1965 (70% of total
loans) to D 9.6 million in 1969 (89% of total loans). Loans to very small
farmers are provided by credit cooperatives (Caisses Locales de Credit
Mutuelles Agricole), introduced by the Government in 1963; there are pre-
sently 52 throughout the country, with a membership of over 70,000 small
farmers.  These credit cooperatives are administered by BNT for Government.
2.10      Practically all of BNT's lending is short-term because of the
nature of its resources (para 4.05 and Annex 3). Medium- and long-term
lending is dependent on Government funds, which are used to support various
agricultural subsectors at low interest rates. All types of credit are in
short supply, and the remainder of the banking system has provided very
little assistance to agriculture.



- 4 -
2.11      The Central Bank's basic discount rate is presently 5%.  Banking
interest rates, which are subject to Central Bank regulations, vary accord-
ing to the purpose for which loans are made and whether they are rediscount-
able (Annex 2). At present, they range between 4.75% per annum (the lowest
rate for financing of exports) and 9% per annum. The latter applies only
to non-rediscountable commercial lending. With regard to agricultural
credit, rates for seasonal crop finance are between 6% and 6.75%, while
advances on paper secured for essential products carry interest charges
ranging between 5.75% and 6.75%. Medium- and long-term loans for agriculture
are granted only by BNT from Government-provided funds at interest rates
ranging from 3-1/2% to 6%, with the exception of a loan from US Aid granted
in 1961 for which farmers pay 7%. In October 1970 the rates on Government
provided funds, were lowered to rates ranging from 3% to 4-1/2%. In
addition, Government provides subsidies on a selective basis to encourage
certain investments in agriculture.
2.12      Since Government changed its policy in September 1969, the de-
mand for development credit from the modern private farming sector in North-
ern Tunisia has shown a marked increase, particularly for investments in
mechanization and implements, dairy equipment, livestock, and date planta-
tions. However, because the amount of funds available from BNT's own re-
sources and from Government is not sufficient to meet these demands, the
rehabilitation of the modern private farming sector will be retarded unless
additional finance can be obtained.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Description
3.01      The Project, which is part of lNT's lending program, would fi-
nance, over three years, on-farm investments for grain farm mechanization
and dairy farm and date-palm development. It would include technical
assistance to strengthen BNT's loan appraisal division, plantation management
of the Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie Laitiere (STIL) (the sub-borrower
for the date-palm development (para 3.06)), and Government's dairy extension
services.
3.02      Kind of investment, typical farm size, average investment per
farm, and phasing under the proposed lending program would be approximately

Total:         360   316   332   1,008
Investments for grain farm mechanization would be in Northern Tunisia (Map 1)
on farms of about 100 ha. There are more than 2,000 farmers operating at
least 100 ha each in this region. Investment in dairy farms would also be
in Northern Tunisia. Date-palms would be planted in the oasis region of
Southern Tunisia (Maps 1 and 2) by STIL which has experience in date production
and operates Tunisia's only modern date-palm plantations. Sub-borrowers are
expected to contribute about 30% of the investment cost, which is within
their means.
B. Detailed Features
Grain Farm Mechanization
3.03      The dry farming system is used in Northern Tunisia.  In areas
where annual rainfall is below 500 mm, alternate-year cropping is practiced.
Where limited irrigation facilities are available, livestock production and
particularly, dairy farming can be combined with dry farming (para 3.05).
The cropping pattern is based principally on grains, such as barley and
soft and hard wheat.
3.04      About 850 grain farmers in Northern Tunisia would be expected to
invest in a mix of mechanized equipment, including about 135 crawler tractors
(70 to 75 hp) and 465 wheel tractors (50 to 70 hp) with suitable attachments,



- 6 -
and about 240 grain combines with about 3.60 m cutter bars. At the same
time, farmers would gradually replace local soft wheat with improved local
and Mexican varieties and increase the use of fertilizers and herbicides
(Annex 4).
Dairy Farm Development
3.05      Fearing expropriation in 1969, many farmers slaughtered their
livestock (para 2.06). The dairy development sub-project would help these
and others who wished to establish a dairy enterprise within their grain
farms. Normally, these farmers would own a wheel tractor with grain farm
attachments.  Their farms would be about 90 ha and possibly less, provided
their forage requirements were ensured from irrigated lands. To qualify for
a loan, each farmer would submit a satisfactory dairy farm development plan,
on the basis of which certain investments would be financed under the sub-
project: (a) pump irrigation for about 8 ha to ensure year-round supply
of feed (alfalfa, bersim, corn) planted to an extent matching the herd
build-up from 12 to about 20 dairy cows; (b) barn improvements, including
watering facilities; (c) attachments to existing wheel tractors for forage
cutting and haymaking; and (d) purchase of about 12 in-calf heifers. Aver-
age loans to about 150 dairy farmers would amount to about D 5,000 (US$9,500).
Further details on dairy farms are given in Annex 5.
Date-Palm Plantation Development
3.06      This sub-project (Annex 6) would be carried out by STIL (Annex 6,
Appendix 1) on the basis of a general development agreement with BNT under
which loans would be issued in tranches to finance about eighteen 50-ha
development units. Investments would be for: (a) groundwater development,
including irrigation and drainage network; (b) land preparation; (c) nursery
stock, transplanting and maintenance of windbreak trees and date-palms; (d)
tractors with trailers; (e) buildings for field office, storage, and pack-
aging; and (f) houses for permanent laborers.
3.07      The date-palm sub-project would be in two main locations on cur-
rently unused desert land: the Djerid region and the Nefzaoua region, as
shown on Maps 1 and 2. In both locations, groundwater would come from ar-
tesian aquifers (Annex 6, Appendix 2). In the Djerid, where the pressure
is sufficient to generate a sustained artesian flow, the main investment
would be for pipes and boreholes about 600 m deep. In the Nefzaoua, where
the aquifer is nearer the surface, the artesian flow from about 200 m would
need to be supported by pumping to make the most economic use of the re-
sources.  A flow of about 0.9 liter per sec is required for each hectare of
date plantation. The flow of wells ranges from 35 to 65/sec; plantation
units would thus average about 50 ha in size.  The location, design, soil
survey, electric sounding, pumping tests and trial of each borehole would be
certified by the Ministry of Agriculture's Bureau d'Inventaire des Ressources
Hydrauliques (BIRH). BNT would not disburse to STIL prior to obtaining such
certification and assurances to this effect were obtained from Government and
BNT during negotiations. In addition, Government has assured to grant ap-
propriate land use rights to STIL, by way of a long-term lease.

3.08      Available groundwater and soil investigations, carried out by
SCET, a French consulting firm, and a UNESCO team, indicate that ground-
water resources are adequate in quantity and quality and that soils are
suitable for developing 600 ha. Financing of an additional 300 ha would be
provided for, subject to certification by BTRH that water supplies are
adequate taking into account adjacent developments depending on water from
the same aquifer and that soil conditions are suitable in each specific lo-
cation (Annex 6).  Assurances&were obtained at negotiaticns that BIRH would
conduct necessary studies and that BNT would finance the additional 300-ha
date-palm development only after survey results, satisfactory to the Bank/IDA,
had become available.
Supporting Services
3.09      To ensure effective Project implementation, technical services
would be strengthened as follows: (a) a team of locally recruited dairy
extension agents would be trained and supervised under the existing bi-
laterally supported Government dairy training centers (para 3.16); (b) an
agricultural expert would be in charge of STIL's date-palm plantation
project; and (c) a farm management specialist would train and supervise
BNT technicians in loan evaluation (para 4.13).

Financing
3.11      Of the total Project cost (US$15 million), US$8 million would be
financed by a Bank loan of US$5 million and by an IDA credit of US$3 million.
BNT would contribute from its own resources US$2.5 million equivalent and the
Government would cover half of the cost of support services, or US$0.2 mil-
lion equivalent. The remaining US$4.3 million would come from the subborrow-
ers' contribution, equivalent to 30% of their investments. The financing
plan for individual components of the Project is summarized in the following
table:

BNT would be the borrower of the Bank loan and Government of the IDA credit.
The Bank loan would be extended for 15 years including a five-year grace
period at 7-1/4% interest. The IDA credit would be on usual terms to the
Government and on-lent to BNT at 1% for 15 years, including a five-year
grace period. Government would carry the foreign exchange risk. During
negotiations assurances were obtained on the foregoing.
3.12      Although BNT's contribution for long-term lending is estimated at
D 1.3 million, only about two-thirds of this amount would, in fact, be re-
quired because repayments from grain farmers, commencing in year 3, would
generate the other portion of the requirement (Annex 3, Table 6). Cash flow
projections (Annex 3, Table 5) indicate that farmers' repayments would
generate sufficient inflows to enable BNT to repay to Bank and Government
loan/credit funds within 15 years, including five years of grace. Accumulation
of surpluses would reach a peak during year 9 (D 1.4 million, US$2.7 million),
which would adequately cover any unforeseen slippage in commitments and re-
payments. If demands for credit under any of the categories shown in para-
graph 3.11 should decrease, the amount of the loan/credit no longer required
would be reallocated to another category to allow full utilization of the
loan/credit.



- 10 -
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.13      The range of items to be financed is varied and would not be suit-
able for bulk procurement. Farmers would purchase tractors, combines and
tractor attachments of their choice through existing commercial channels.
Ma*or producers of farm machinery from at least five Bank/IDA member countries
are represented in Tunisia and have adequate sales services. The dairy de-
velopment sub-project would require about 1,800 in-calf heifers, most of
which would come from Government dairy farms in the Medjerda Valley (Office
de Mise en Valeur de la Vallee de Medjerda, OMVVM). However, it is expected
that not all heifers required will be readily available, especially at the
start of the Project. Provision would, therefore, be made to import about
700 heifers. Existing channels for livestock procurement are satisfactorY.
Groundwater development for STIL's date-palm development (mainly for deep
wells) would involve about D 270,000 (US$514,000) phased over three years.
Prior to making subloans to STIL, BNT would require that contracts for drilling
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Assurances to
that effect were obtained during negotiations. However, because of time
constraints and limited operations envisaged for the 1971 planting season,
the Bank/IDA agreed that contracts to be executed before end-August 1971 and
not to exceed D 50,000 in the aggregate, could be awarded without interna-
tional competitive bidding. The amount for the purchase and installation of
pumps, about US$40,000, would be too small to attract foreign firms and
procurement would, therefore, be through normal commercial channels.
Disbursement
3.14      BNT's disbursements to sub-borrowers would take about four years.
The Bank/IDA would disburse against appropriate statements and documents for
75% (53% of investment cost) of all loans disbursed under the Project for
investments in grain farm mechanization, dairy farm development, and date-
palm plantations up to an amount provided for each of the three categories
(US$5 million, US$1.2 million, and US$1.7 million, respectively). This
represents the average estimated foreign exchange component (para 3.11).
On sub-loans for dairy farms it was agreed during negotiations that no dis-
bursements would be made for the purchase of dairy heifers without evidence
that Tunisia's total heifer imports, from the datc of signing, would be at
least 40% of the number of heifers financed under the Project. In addition,
reimbursement for support services, including the farm management specialist,
the agricultural expert, and vehicles, would be made on the basis of actual
foreign exchange cost. A schedule of estimated Bank/IDA disbursements is
given in Annex 7.



- 11 -
E. Project Administration
3.15      BNT would carry out the Project and would be assisted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, in respect of the dairy development sub-project.
Ministry of Agriculture
3.16      Dairy training centers, run with the assistance of FAQ and German,
Dutch, Belgian, and other bilateral assistance, are already established in
sub-project areas. The Ministry of Agriculture proposes that these centers
provide artificial insemination services and training for Project farmers.
The Ministry would also supply and finance dairy extension services, in-
volving about 15 extension agents (adjoint technique), their supervisors,
and support staff within the centers. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that the Government would ensure that the centers provide the ser-
vices and training mentioned above (Annex 5, Table 3).
IV. BANQUE NATIONALE DE TUNISIE (BNT)
General
4.01      BNT, a multi-purpose bank, was established at Government's initiative
in 1959. Its primary objective is to promote agricultural development by pro-
viding short-, medium- and long-term loans and, more generally, to carry on
all normal banking and financial operations, including commercial loans. It
can also participate in industrial and agricultural enterprises by taking
direct equity investments. BNT has played a dominant role in agricultural
credit; its share of total loans granted by banks grew from 68% in 1962 to
92% in 1969. BNT has expanded rapidly over its 11-year existence. While its
management has taken some risk during this period of growth (para 4.07), BNT
has reached a stage where its policy must become more in line with prudent
financial practices. For this purpose, a policy statement (Annex 3, Appendix 1)
governing BNT's future operation was agreed upon between BNT and the Bank/IDA
during negotiations and its implementation would be a condition of effectiveness.
Any changes to the statement would be made in consultation with the Bank/IDA.
Resources
4.02      BNT derives its resources from its own capital, deposits,
rediscount facilities, and borrowings. It has an authorized capital of
D 2 million. Its paid-in capital amounts to D 1.6 million, of which
the Government owns 25%; Government-controlled corporations and marketing
cooperatives, 35.7%; the Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel, 23.7%; and
private shareholders, 15.6%. Deposits, amounting to D 25 million as of
December 1970, are collected mainly from parastatal organizations and pri-
vate customers. BNT, like other banks, has access to rediscounting faci-
lities. Normal and seasonal quotas are set each year and BNT was entitled,



- 12 -
in 1969, to a normal quota of D 1.2 million. As of December 31, 1970
borrowing outstanding amounted to D 5.4 million and equity plus free reserves
to D 5.3 million (see 4.07 below), giving a debt-equity ratio of 1:1.
4.03      Besides the above resources, BNT administers several "Special Funds"
on behalf of Government for various agricultural subsectors in the framework
of a law on agricultural development. These funds are extended on
concessionary terms to stimulate various activities under specific Government
policies. The total of these Special Funds on December 31, 1970 was D 17.7
million.
Use of Resources
4.04      BNT's resources have been used for loans and for equity
investments, mainly in agriculture, housing, processing, and general
merchandising.
4.05      Lending Operations.  Since sight and term deposits form BNT's
largest single resource (D 25 million as of December 31, 1970), it has
followed a policy of short-term lending (D 32 million as of December 31, 1970
of which over D 6 million are invested in agricultural cooperatives). This
is well in line with BNT's financial structure and Government's past policy,
which called for tight control over medium- and long-term capital. One ex-
ception to this policy was, however, made in favor of STIL, a corporation
largely controlled, financed, and managed until the end of 1969 by BNT (whose
Chairman was simultaneously Chairman of STIL). Since the Chairman was
appointed Minister of Commerce, two new chairmen have been appointed, one for
BNT and one for STIL. BNT's financial engagement with STIL is discussed in
paragraph 4.07.
4.06      Equity Investments.  These participations amounted to D 485,000
as of December 1970 (Annex 3, Table 3). Out of this amount, D 54,000 of bad
investments have been fully covered by a reserve and D 38,000 have been cov-
ered up to 50%.  The market value of BNT's participations was estimated by
the end of 1970 at D 537,000, or 10% more than Lheir nominal value. Accord-
ing to BCT regulations, a bank equity participation in a single enterprise
should not exceed 20% of the share capital of any corporation. BNT slightly
exceeds this percentage for STIL (D 43,200 instead of D 30,000) and for
Societe Tuniso-Yuougoslave de Developpement (D 5,300 instead of D 4,200).
Assurances were obtained from BNT during negotiations that it would take
steps to reduce its equity participation to levels permissible under Central
Bank regulations by the end of 1972.
4.07      BNT's Financing of STIL.  Besides its equity participation, loans
outstanding to STIL amounted to D 2.7 million as of March 15, 1971, D 1
million for short-term and D 1.7 million for medium- and long-tern. Short-
term credits were given to finance stocks, estimated by BNT at more than
D 2.5 million. Medium-and long-term loans financed the building of a hotel
in Nefta, a housing scheme with a shopping center, and date plantations.



- 13 -
BNT's loans to STIL are secured by mortgages and liens of D 2 million. In
addition, short-term credits outstanding for financing exports amounted to
D 400,000 as of March 15, 1971. These were fully secured by export
documents.  BNT's financial stake in STIL amounts to AhoUt 50t of itti Owu
net worth (capital plus free reserves of D 5.3 million), whiclh is nol con-
sidered financially sound. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
this percentage would be gradually reduced to 25% by the end of 1975. It
was also agreed that as a condition of project sub-loans, STIL would have its
accounts audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank/IDA.
BNT's Financial Position
4.08      BNT has a good and consistent record of earnings (Annex 3,
Table 7). Five--percent dividends on capital have been paid every year
since its inception, the balance of net profit having been transferred to
various reserves. Present provisions for bad debts (D 0.6 million) and free
reserves, including D 2.5 million for various risks, are adequate.
4.09      BNT's liquidity position is strained.  Short-term liabilities
exceed current assets by D 1.9 million (ratio, 0.9:1) (Annex 3, Table
2). While BNT has been able to increase its sight and term deposits from
D 15 million in 1965 to D 25 million in 1970, part of these resources have
been used to finance long-term loans to STIL and short-term loans to cooper-
atives, which are now overdue.
4.10      When the Cooperative Farm Project was revised in 1970 the cooperatives'
debts to BNT amounted to D 6 million. Government agreed at that time to
reschedule the debts of the remaining cooperatives (D 3.4 million, meanwhile
reduced to D 3.0 million) which will be repaid over five years, partly by the
Government and partly by these Cooperatives. It has now agreed to repay under
its guarantee obligation in five equal annual installments the debts of
dissolved cooperatives in order to cover BNT's cash deficit. With these
repayments and those of STII.'s medium- and long-term debt (para 4.07), BNT's
current asset would exceed current liabilities by D 3.8 million in the fifth
year of the project, thus resulting in an improved liquidity ratio of 1.1 to
1 (see projected balance sheet in Annex 3, Table 8).
4.11      To further strengthen the financial position of BNT upon Government's
proposal it was agreed that the IDA credit portion of US$3 million would be
on-lent to BNT at 1% interest p.a. The cost of Bank/IDA funds (4.9%) and of
BNT's own resources (4%) would result in a blended cost of 4.7%, giving BNT
an overall margin on project operations of 3.3%. This would correspond to
a margin of 3.3 and 3.1 respectively on BNT's overall operations in 1969
and 1970 (Annex 3, Table 9, part 2). The 3.3% margin would be adequate to
cover BNT's operating expanses for the project (estimated at 1.5%) and
would result in an excess of revenue over expenses, which would enable BNT
to establish adequate reserves after payment of taxes (Annex 3, Table 7).



- 14 -
Organization and Management
4.12      BNT is administered by a Board of nine members who serve for six-
year periods. The Board is chaired by the General Manager and has three
representatives of Government, three representatives of Government-controlled
corporations and cooperatives, and two representatives of private share-
holders. The present Chairman was, appointed in September 1969. HIe had been
a senior executive of BNT before. The institution is well managed and its
staff competent. Full details of BNT's organization and management are given
in Annex 3.
4.13      BNT has substantial experience in short-term agricultural lend-
ing, but its capabilities in project evaluation are limited. This is
mainly because, for medium- and long-term lending operations, it has used
mostly Government funds at Government's risk, and project evaluation and
final authorization have been handled by Ministry of Agriculture technicians.
BNT's administrative procedures concerned with loan repayment, including
bookkeeping, have been satisfactory. Under the Project, strengthening would
be required in technical and financial Project evaluation and assessment of
investment effectiveness. This strengthening would be accomplished by
adding a qualified and experienced farm management specialist, to be in
charge of training and supervising technicians in loan evaluation (Annex 3,
Appendix 3). He would be supported by three locally recruited senior
technicians in BNT's Tunis head office and six locally recruited junior
technicians attached to BNT's branches in the Project area. In order to
strengthen STIL's technical services, BNT would ensure as a condition of its
subloan that a qualified and experienced agriculturist be recruited (para 3.09
and Annex 6, Appendix 3). The appointment of the farm management specialist,
in consultation with and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank/IDA,
and of the senior technicians would be a condition of loan/credit effectiveness.
Furthermore, BNT would ensure, as a condition of its project subloans that
STIL had employed a qualified and experienced agriculturist after consultation
with and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank/IDA.
Lending Policies and Procedures
4.14      BNT's agricultural staff would assist applicants in the
preparation of detailed plans, including preparation of farm plans, income
and expenditure estimates, and cash flows. In the case of lending to
STIL, BNT's technical work would not include preparation assistance but
would be restricted to the appraisal of STIL's proposal. BNT's staff
would appraise all sub-projects in terms of incremental returns and submit
recommendations to its management and Board. Subloans for dairy and cereal
development in excess of US$100,000 would require prior approval by the
Bank/IDA. Technical staff would periodically visit sub-borrowers' properties
to ensure that funds were being used for the intended purposes. The above
procedures would not be altered without the prior approval of the Bank/IDA.
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
4.15      With regard to dairy loans, assurances were obtained that BNT
would require: (a) from farmers a satisfactory farm plan prepared and car-
ried out under guidance of a qualified extension agent (para 3.05); and (b)



- 15 -
an assessment of BIRH that water supplies are sufficient to irrigate at least
8 ha for forage production, in accordance with the farm plan. With regard
to date-palm subloans, assurances were also obtained that after the four-year
loan/credit disbursement period and up to the early bearing age (end year 7),
BNT would either finance from its own resources or assure that adequate fi-
nance is available for STIL's follow-up investment.
Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
4.16      As stated in paragraph 2.11, banking interest rates in Tunisia
vary from as low as 4.75% for export financing up to 9% for commercial
lending.  BNT has traditionally charged 6% for lending (mainly short term)
from its own resources. To the extent it can be ascertained, present in-
terest rates bear little or no relationship to the real cost of capital.
In lieu of the allocative function of the cost of capital, Government has
instituted an administrative resource allocation mechanism under which
subsidized credit facilities are made available for a wide variety of pur-
poses. In spite of low interest rates, BNT has made reasonable profits,
mainly because of the low cost of its resources and non-assumption of risks
under special programs.
4.17      During negotiations Government and BNT agreed to raise interest
rates for medium- and long-term loans from 4% at present (para 2.11) to 8%,
for Project loans and for all similar loans that wou]d qualify under the
Project. However, in line with its recently stated policy to restore
confidence in the private sector and to encourage commercial farmers'
investments, Government wishes to mitigate the impact of increased interest
rates by payment of certain subsidies, for which details are yet to be
defined. These subsidies, which would not exceed in the aggregate the
equivalent of 2% of interest payable on sub-loans, would be a temporary
measure and phased out gradually, subject to Government review of its assistance
to the agricultural sector. This review would cover agricultural taxation
(including import duties on farm implements and inputs), price policies and
other subsidies.
4.18      Farm and date-palm development model calculations, summarized in
paragraph 5.08 and detailed in Annexes 4, 5, and 6, indicate that the fol-
lowing repayment periods for loans to sub-borrowers would be appropriate:

-  16 -
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that these periods would
not be exceeded without the Bank/IDA's prior approval.
Accounts and Auditing
4.19      BNT has a good accounting organization, as well as a management
information system. Under various supervisory functions, BNT is subject
to the customary supervision of banks by the Central Bank and Government
appoints a Financial Controller to protect its interest in BNT. Internal
audit is carried out by a section responsible directly to the Chairman/Cen-
eral Manager and the shareholders elect two auditors (Commissaires aux
Comptes). External audit is carried out by two accountants (Commissaires
aux Comptes) elected by the shareholders but has not been found adequate,
considering BNT's importance as a deposit and development bank.  Therefore,
BNT's accounts would have to be audited by independent auditors acceptable             0
to the Bank/IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations to this effect.
The first independent audit, relating to BNT's annual accounts for the year
ending December 31, 1970, was submitted to the Bank/IDA in May 1971.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRODUCER BENEFITS, AND REVENUE GENERATION
Production
5.01      Under the Project, about 750 farms, cultivating some 135,000 ha,
would benefit from mechanization and dairy development. Annual incremental
production at full development is estimated at 85,000 tons of wheat and
9,300 tons of milk. At full production, the date-palm plantations sub-
project would yield about 10,000 tons each year, or over twice the volume
of present exports. Assuming that two-thirds of the new production would
be exported, present export earnings from dates would more than double.
The intercropping of about 20% of the date-palm plantations with early
vegetables would yield approximately 2,000 tons of tomatoes, 400 tons of
garlic, and 250 tons of melon, about 75% of which could be exported.
Markets and Prices
5.02      Grains.  Wheat imports have averaged 200,000 tons annually during
1965, 1966, and 1967, rising to 402,000 tons in 1968 and 480,000 tons in
1969. The incremental output under the Project would reduce the import-
ation needs. The Project's financial and economic rates of return have
been based on present prices, net of production tax, of D 38 per ton
(US$72.39) for soft wheat and D 43 per ton (US$81.92) for hard wheat, both
being the present average landed cost in Tunis.
5.03      The world market price projections indicate that, in the mid-
1970's, the soft and hard wheat prices may be about US$65 and US$75 per
ton (CIF Tunis), respectively, equivalent to a decline of 10% for soft
wheat and 8.4% for hard wheat on the Project prices. To assess the



- 17 -
effects of such a decline of farmers' income, a sensitivity analysis was
applied (para 5.09). The results remain satisfactory.
5.04      Milk.  The incremental output of milk is needed to balance
STIL's fresh milk requirements for mixing with the imported dry milk
component. The sales of the reconstituted milk have been consistently
increasing, rising from 14.3 million liters in 1968 to 17.3 million liters
in 1969.
5.05      Farmers would receive between D 0.052 per kg for milk with 3%
fat content and up to D 0.054 per kg for higher fat content. This
provides an adequate price incentive for the farmers (at US$0.10 per
liter, which is acceptable when compared with other countries), while
keeping the cost of reconstituted milk reasonably low, due to the low
cost of dry milk powder.
5.06      Dates.  Prices paid to growers vary according to quality and
average D 0.09 per kg. Export-quality dates would be produced by STIL, which
is the sole exporter of Tunisian dates and has well established distribution
channels in Europe. During its financial year, ended on September 30,
1969, STIL handled a total of 6,265 tons, of which 4,547 tons were ex-
ported, for a total of D 967,000. The main importing countries were:
France, 1,756 tons; Italy, 1,589 tons; and Britain, 452 tons. In these
markets, Tunisian dates enjoy a privileged position because of their
quality and presentation.
5.07      To diversify its markets and to enable the adoption of more
efficient marketing techniques, STIL has undertaken studies of consumer
preferences in several European markets, mainly in Switzerland, Italy,
and the Scandinavian countries, building on the already excellent reputa-
tion of Tunisian dates. There should be no difficulty in disposing of
the additonal date production.
Producer Benefits and Revenue Generation
5.08      The Project would substantially increase farm  income by restoring
fertility to neglected land and provide a return ranging from 14% to 26%
(before debt service on borrowed funds) on all incremental Project invest-
ments. Financial returns and income to farmers, as well as to STIL for its
date-palm development, have been estimated on the basis of farm model calcu-
lations (Annex 4, Table 1; Annex 5, Table 2; and Annex 6, Table 1). Annual
incremental net incomes before and after debt service are shown below:

/2   Investment on idle land.
5.09      Taxes, duties, and other relevant levies have been deducted in
computing the net incremental income. In all cases, the net income provides
adequate incentive to invest under the Project on the terms and conditions
set out in paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18. As they are based on representative
models, some incomes, in practice, may range higher than indicated, while
other ones would undoubtedly be lower. The sensitivity of the grain and
dairy sub-projects was tested by assuming incremental net benefits 25% lower
than best estimates, due to lower yield or prices. The results still showed
adequate returns respectively of 15% and 12%.
5.10      Government revenue from duties and taxes generated by the
Project would be substantial. During the first three years, Government
would collect about D 1 million (US$1.9 million) from duties and levies on
imported machinery. In addition, the sales tax generated by incremental
grain, milk, and date output is estimated to reach about D 300,000 in year 9
and stabilize at D 340,000 (US$650,000) annually on present tax rates, once
date palms have reached full development.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project, while assisting the private agricultural sector,
which has been stagnating because of fears of compulsory absorption into
cooperatives, would reduce Tunisian dependence on imports of wheat and dairy
products. The Project would also assist STIL in additional work on date-
palm plantation development in the south, where its plantation would



- 19 -
eventually provide jobs and housing for about a thousand families of the
desert nomads, at present living in extreme poverty. Import substitution
of cereals and export of dates and off-season vegetables would be equivalent
to net foreign exchange savings of about US$8 million per annum at full
development.
6.02      Long-term credit support to private commercial farmers should
help to establish confidence in the Government's revised agricultural
policies and then contribute significantly to the much needed improvement
in the investment climate for agriculture. This, together with the introduc-
tion of realistic terms of lending, would mobilize commercial farmers' own
resources through the requirement of a substantial contribution to invest-
ments as well as help to strengthen further BNT lendable resources. In
addition, the development of BNT's technical services should make it an
increasingly effective provider of long-term finance for agricultural and
related developments. The setting up of the dairy extension service to act
as coordinator of the currently fragmented efforts under various bilateral
agreements should go a long way towards re-establishing and developing the
national herd, decimated during the period of farmers' fears (para 2.06).
While the Project as proposed would not directly help the majority of
Tunisia's rural population, it represents a first step towards the revival
of the agricultural sector. Commercial farmers expected to invest under the
Project would readily respond to opportunities of improved technology when
coupled with availability of credit. Their incremental output would con-
tribute towards improvements in the net balance of foreign exchange.
6.03      The economic rate of return for the overall Project at present
prices has been estimated at 22%. When computed separately, rates of return
to the economy are 24% for grain farm mechanization and dairy development
and 18% for date-palm development (Annex 8). Assuming price declines of
10% for grain to projected 1975 world market prices (para 5.03) and 10%
lower prices for dates and milk, the economic rate would still be satis-
factory at 18%.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan/credit negotiations, assurances were obtained to en-
sure satisfactory Project performance. Some of the principal assurances
involved:
From Government
(a) provision of extension services for dairy farms and technical
services for groundwater development on dairy farms and date-
palm plantations (paras 3.07, 3.08, 3.16);
From BNT
(b) recruitment of a farm management specialist for BNT's credit
division and an agriculturist for STIL's date-palm operations,



- 20 -
both after consultation with and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank/IDA (para 4.13);
(c) increase of interest rates on BNT's sub-loans and similar
loans from 4% to 8% per annum (para 4.17);
(d)  reduction of BNT's financial engagement with STIL (para
4.07).
7.02      The proposed Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5 million
for a term of 15 years to BNT, and an IDA credit of US$3 million on IDA's
standard terms.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR CREDIT
A. The Banking System
General
1.        Tunisia's monetary system consists of the Central Bank of Tunisia,
12 banking institutions, the Postal Checking system, and the National Savings
Fund. Of the 12 institutions, two are mainly Government-owned: the Societe
Tunisienne de Banque (STB) and the Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT). They
account for more than two-thirds of total credit to the economy and receive
about 40% of total deposits. A new bank, created in the autumn of 1968, is
expected to assist in the development of the southern region of Tunisia.
The Banking Law
2.        The operations of banking institutions in Tunisia were codified
in a regulatory law (67-51), which was promulgated on December 7, 1967. Each
bank has to apply for an authorization to carry out its functions and has to
specify whether it wishes to operate as a deposit money bank or as an invest-
ment bank. The deposit banks are entitled to receive deposits without any
limitation of duration. They may invest them either in short-term loans
or in medium-term loans (five years) within certain limits set by the Central
Bank. They are authorized also to issue long-term loans with the proceeds
of special resources. The investment banks are entitled to receive only fixed
term deposits for more than one year. They promote new ventures through
equity participations and medium- and long-term loans.
3.        The law sets various requirements, which are mainly as follows:
(a) a bank must have a minimum paid-in capital of D 200,000.00;
(b) a bank must allocate to its legal reserves 20% of its net
yearly profit until its own resources (capital and reserves)
have reached a certain percentage, to be fixed by the
Central Bank, of its demand and term deposits;
(c) fixed assets shall not exceed 75% of their own resources;
(d) a deposit bank shall neither invest more than 5% of its
own resources in an equity participation into a single
venture nor have shares that exceed 20% of the share
capital of any corporation. However, the Central Bank



ANNEX 2
Page 2
may authorize a banking institution to raise these ceilings,
provided that such authorization does not extend beyond 5
years;
(e)  the banks are obliged to comply with the Central Bank
regulations and, particularly, to observe the various ratios
set up by the Central Bank;
(f) the banks must close their annual accounts as of December
31; these accounts should be submitted to the General
Assembly of shareholders and be certified by a Commissioner
for Accounts selected from a list established in agreement
by both the Ministry of Planning and the Central Bank of
Tunisia. The banks should also submit to the Central Bank
their monthly financial statements, established according
to standard forms.
4.        Simultaneously with the law regulating the banking profession,
another law establishing the National Credit Council (law 67-50) was promul-
gated. The Council's main objective, when it is established, will be to set
guidelines for the volume, distribution and control of credit in relation to
plan objectives and the general economic situation, with particular refer-
ence to seasonal and special sectoral needs.
Central Bank Operations
5.        The Central Bank of Tunisia, in addition to its functions as bank
of issue and custodian of official foreign reserves, acts as banker to the
Government and to the deposit money banks. In the frame of annual stabili-
zation programs underlying consecutive stand-by arrangements with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1964, various ceilings were established.
The 1969 stabilization program provided for a single ceiling in the domestic
assets of the Central Bank and the foreign short-term indebtedness of the
deposit money banks.
The Control of Credit
6.        In order to control the operations of the deposit money banks,
the Central Bank relies primarily on the following instruments:
(a) Changes in the rediscount rate: The interest rates have
remained relatively stable since 1966, when the Central
Bank's basic rediscount rate was raised from 4 to 5% per
annum. For certain sectors, the Central Bank applies
preferential rates. Thus, a rate of 4% is charged for
paper related to export operations, seasonal crop financ-
ing, and medium-term credit for housing guaranteed by the
Government; financial paper is rediscounted at 5.5% and
medium-term securities at 5.75%; and guaranteed overdraft
advances carry a rate of 7%. A penalty rate of 2% is
added if the rediscount ceiling is exceeded by 10%. If



ANNEX 2
Page 3
the ceiling is exceeded by 15%, the penalty is 2.5% and
if over 15%, the penalty is 3%.
(b) Control of the deposit banks' rate structure: The Central
Bank controls the banks' rate structure.
(i) Deposits: At present, banks are allowed to pay interest
at the following rates:
Demand deposits:                           Up to 1.75% per
annum
Time deposits (minimum terms, 3 months): From 3% to 4% for 12
months or more
Deposits subject to advance notice:        Between 2.25% and 3%
Certificates of deposits:                  Between 3% and 4%
Savings deposits:                          3%
If left for more than six months:          3.5%
(ii) Lending operations: Interest rates charged by banks on
their lending operations are also subject to Central
Bank regulations, which indicate minimum and maximum
rates for certain kinds of transactions. The rates are
arrived at by adding to the official rediscount rate
percentages that vary according to the type of transaction.
Any change in the rediscount rate will, therefore,
trigger a change in the lending structure. At present,
the banking system's lending rates range between 4.75%
and 8% for transactions involving rediscountable paper
and over 8% for non-rediscountable paper. The lowest
rates are charged for the financing of exports (4.75%
to 5.75%). Seasonal crop financing ranges between
6% and 6.75%. Advances on paper secured by essential
products (cereals, olive oil, wine, canned foodstuffs)
carry interest charges ranging between 5.75% and 6.75%.
Agricultural and industrial medium-term loans carry 6.25%
and 7.25%, provided they are rediscountable. For non-
rediscountable medium-term loans, made with their own
resources, banks are free to charge rates in accor-
dance with normal banking practice. (For medium- and
long-term loans issued by BNT using Government's funds
in the frame of specific agreements, the rates are not
subject to such regulations; they are lower and aim to
support various agricultural sectors; for example, planta-
tion development loans are issued at 3.5% for the first
10 years, and rise to 5.5% thereafter.)



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(c) Rediscount ceilings: In order to regulate the overall level
of rediscounting, the Central Bank has established four types
of ceilings:
(i) Regular ceiling (cote normale): This ceiling, which was
fixed in 1961 in conjunction with the first stabilization
program with IMF, is subdivided for each deposit money
bank on an individual basis according to each bank's
share in total credit operations in the past and to
the level of its deposits. Banks that exceed their
ceilings have to pay penalty interest charges (see above).
However, bills regarding exports and guaranteed by Banks
are discounted outside such ceiling and without any limit-
ation.
(ii) Seasonal ceiling (cote saisonniere): This ceiling is set to
take into account the financing of the marketing of the
three major crops: a cereal ceiling for BNT only, fixed
in June/July for almost nine months, and, for all deposit
banks, a wine ceiling, fixed around December/January for
about six months, as well as an olive oil ceiling, fixed
around October/November for about nine months;
(iii)   Crop expenditures ceiling (cote frais de culture):
As the seasonal ceiling relates only to the financing
of the crop itself, the Central Bank was obliged, in
mid-1969, to set up an additional crop expenditure ceiling
to provide rediscount facilities for BNT for the financing
of current expenditures associated with the acceleration
of the agricultural cooperative movement. This ceiling
was fixed at D 2 million for 1969.
(iv)   A special ceiling on medium-term credit:  Rediscounts
under this ceiling are provided to the deposit banks
for the purpose of extending medium-term credit, pro-
vided that a bank can show that at least 10% of its
deposits relate to medium-term credits approved by the
Central Bank (ratio d'emploi).
(d) Ratios on the deposits
(i) Use of resources ratio for medium-term credit (as mentioned
above);
(ii) Liquidity ratio: Holdings by the bank of the following
types of assets must be equal to 60% of their short-term
liabilities: cash on hand (including deposits with the
Central Bank), funds lent on the interbank money market,
deposits with correspondents, portfolio of rediscount-
able loans, bills under collection, Treasury Bonds, 50%
of Government Equipment Bonds;



ANNEX 2
Page 5
(iii) Solvency ratio: This is clefined as the ratio between a
bank s capital and reserves and its deposit liabilities;
it stands at 10%.
(iv) Treasury bonds' ratio: At least 30% of the bank's deposits
should consist of treasury bonds (this ratio is about 10%
below the target, owing to the fairly tight liquidity
position of the banks as well as the limitations placed
in their subscriptions of Government bonds under the succes-
sive stabilization programs).
(e) Direct approval of bank loans
(i) Short-term loans: Short-term loans that exceed D 5,000
are rediscountable only with the approval of the Central
Bank, which may authorize rediscount to be limited to a
part of the loan. Furthermore, loans of large amounts
cannot be extended without prior approval of the Central
Bank; such an approval was originally required for loans
exceeding D 75,000 but with the first stabilization
program in 1964, this limit was lowered to D 50,000.
(ii) Medium-term credit: All rediscountable medium-term loans
are subject to prior Central Bank authorization.
(f) Yearly increase of loans: The yearly overall increase in
credit, exclusive of that covered by special lending funds
provided by the Government, shall not exceed percentages
fixed every year by the Central Bank (this rule, established
in 1964, has been discontinued).
(g) Reserve requirements: The deposit banks have to deposit to
the Central Bank a part of the increase in their deposits.
Since April 1968, compulsory reserves to be lodged with the
Central Bank were to amount to 10% of any increase in demand
deposits of up to 1% a month over the level of February 29,
1968 and to amount to 30% for any increase in demand deposits
above 1% a month over the level of the same base period. (The
main requirements of the Banking Law and the Central Bank Regu-
lations are summarized in Table 1.)
B. Agricultural Credit
Background
7.        Before independence, the organization of agricultural credit in
Tunisia reflected the dualistic aspect of the economy. The modern foreign
sector was financed by the Caisse Mutuelle de Credit Agricole de Tunisie
(CMCAT) and private banks. The Tunisian sector was financed partly by the



ANNEX 2
Page 6
Caisse Fonciere de Tunisie (CFT), with regard to medium and large land-
owners, and partly by the Societes Tunisienne de Prevoyance (STP), as far
as the subsistence farmers were concerned. In 1959 these institutions were
liquidated and the Banque Nationale Agricole (BNA) was established by the
Government. Its primary objective was to concentrate the financing of agri-
culture within a single institution geared to the requirements of a newly
independent country. In its desire to eventually separate the subsidy and
assistance type of intervention to agriculture from regular methods of fi-
nancing, the Government accepted that the new agricultural credit institution
should be operated by a businessman-type management. The BNA was therefore
given the legal status of a private corporation.
8.        BNA did not enjoy a monopoly.  However, the private commercial
banks have never been very active in the field of agricultural credit and
restrict their operations to financing agricultural products and short-term
production loans to well-established farmers. Therefore, BNA has played a
dominant role. In order to divide its risks, it expanded its activities to
all sectors of the economy. On its tenth anniversary, its name was changed
to Banque Nationale de Tunisie to stress its national importance and the
fact that, apart from agriculture, it finances industry and commerce as well.
Table 2 gives comparative figures for BNT and other banks from 1962 to 1969.
9.        In financing agriculture, BNT had to take into account two con-
straints. First, it had to grow as a sound banking institution. Therefore,
its policy was to restrict its operation to creditworthy medium and large
farmers. Second, it had to consider the nature of its resources. Since
most of them originated from demand deposits and rediscount facilities from
the Central Bank, BNT deals mainly in short-term credit. For medium- and
long-term financing, it depends on funds provided by Government and, there-
fore, distributes such loans with the technical advice of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
The Credit Cooperatives
10.       The Government tried to meet the credit needs of the small farmers
in various ways. Initially, BNT, acting as agent on behalf of Government,
had to extend loans to small farmers selected by administrative authorities
(prets speciaux de campagne.) Mearwhile, Government decided to integrate
the credit to its cooperative movement policy and promoted the establishment
of credit cooperatives (Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel.) The first mutual
credit cooperatives were established in 1963 in the province of CapBon.
Since then, they have spread throughout the country, especially in the north.
There are now 52 credit cooperatives, with a total membership of over 70,000
farmers.  At the end of 1969, capital subscribed by members was D 0.7 mil-
lion, the Government endowment was D 0.3 million, and deposits were D 4.3
million. A number of the cooperatives have been financially unsuccessful
because of high administrative costs in relation to the transactions handled
and losses suffered as a result of poor repayment performance by borrowers.
BNT is the official administrator of these cooperatives and gives them ad-
ministrative and financial support.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
The Farming Cooperatives
11.        Government policy involved also the establishment of farming coop-
eratives, which had to integrate smallholders' land. The Bank/IDA granted
a loan of US$12 million and a credit of US$6 million in 1967 (Loan 404/Credit
99-TUN) for the financing of irnvestments. It was agreed that BNT would act
as financial agent for the Government, and Government loans to the coopera-
tives, including the proceeds of the loan and credit, would be channelled
through it. For the financing of seasonal expenditures, BNT had to issue
short-term loans with its normal resources under a Government guarantee.
Many of the cooperatives have become insolvent, and most of the funds made
available to various cooperatives over the last four years have not been
repaid. Government has agreed to repay all these debts.
Needs for Agricultural Credit
12.        Under the cooperative Government policy, the amount of agricul-
tural credits issued by BNT rose from D 6.6 million in 1965 to D 10.8
million in 1969, after reaching D 13.6 million in 1968 (Table 3). However,
the share of the cooperative sector was of paramount importance (about 90%
in 1968 and 1969). The private sector, discouraged by the Government policy
and reluctant to invest, never received more than D 2.5 million per annum.
This amount was reached in 1966 and declined to D 1.2 million in 1969.
Furthermore, medium- and long-term loans to private farmers never exceeded
one-third of the total amount of loans approved. It is noteworthy that the
overall amount of loans from the banking institutions to all sectors have
almost doubled during the last five years, rising from D 134 million in 1964
to D 227 million in 1969. Even though agriculture's share within those
figures trebled from D 6.3 million in 1966' to D 21.7 million in 1969, its
overall share remains small: 5% in 1966, rising to 10% in 1969, although it
has been contributing around 16% to the GDP.
13.        Since the Government decided in September 1969 to restore the pri-
vate sector, there has been an urgent need to strengthen BNT finances. The
lending program included in the Agricultural Credit Project appraised in
this report aims mainly at restoring and improving the productivity of the
medium and large farms in the north. Small farmers would not benefit from
this Project but about 1,000 families would each gain a permanent income of
about D 60 per annum by way of wages from their work in the date-palm
development sub-project. The Government is aware of small farmers' needs
and is presently considering ways and means for assisting them.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
BANQUE NATIONALE DE TUNISIE (BNT)
General
1.        The primary objective of BNT is to promote agricultural develop-
ment by providing short-, medium- and long-term loans, and, more generally,
to carry on all normal banking and financial operations, including commercial
loans. It can also participate in industrial enterprises by taking direct
equity investments. BNT operates under a banking law and Central Bank regu-
lations (Annex 2). Future operations would also be governed by a policy
statement, drafted in accordance with guidelines set out in Appendix 1,
agreed upon between BNT and the Bank/IDA.
2.        BNT has an authorized capital of D 2 million.  Its paid-in
capital, which amounted initially to D 400,000, has been increased to
D 1,200,000 in 1968 and D 1,600,000 in 1969. It is distributed as follows:
Tunisian Government                                       25%
Government-controlled Corporations and Cooperatives    35.7%
Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel                          23.7%
Private Tunisian Shareholders                             15.6%
Its financial statements from 1966 to 1970 are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Administration and Management
3.        BNT is administered by a nine-member board (maximum number: 12),
whose members serve for six-year periods. The Board consists of a chairman
who is simultaneously the general manager, three representatives of the
Government, three representatives of the Government-controlled corporations
and cooperatives, and two private members.
4.        The lines of authority are well defined and the personnel
conditions are stable. BNT is a mature institution with a good coverage of
the country through its network of 23 agencies. Its head office is in
Tunis and there are also two agency offices in the city, making a total
of 25 in all. During 1969, a computer was installed and the administrative
benefits are obvious from a series of new controls BNT introduced during
1970, particularly as they relate to loan repayments. BNT, a highly cen-
tralized institution, employs 522 people, of whom 289 are at headquarters;
130 are assigned to agency offices, which average about five employees each;
and 103 are seconded to Caisses Locales. Its organizational structure ap-
pears in Appendix 2.

5.        It has a reasonably good accounting organization, as well as a
management information system. There are four supervisory functions:
(a)  As a bank, BNT is subject to the usual Central Bank
supervision;
(b) Shareholders elect two auditors (commissaires aux comptes)
at their annual general meeting;
(c) Government appoints a financial controller (controleur
financier), charged with the protection of Government's
interest in BNT; and
(d) Internal audit is carried out by a separate BNT section,
responsible directly to the chairman-general manager.
Lending Policies and Procedures
6.        Current lending procedures of BNT are to secure short-term
seasonal loans over the relevant crop, reinforced by insurance against
fire and hail risks, the cost of which is about 1% per annum. For medium-
and long-term loans, up to 70% of the cost of on-farm improvements, livestock
and machinery and equipment and its installation is advanced. On-farm im-
provements are generally financed for between five and 10 years and other
items for five years. Lien over stock and equipment is required as is mort-
gage on land in most cases. Not all land is properly titled, but the type
of participant envisaged is not likely to have difficulties in this respect.
BNT is fully aware that its real security, besides Project soundness, stems
from the borrower's integrity and technical ability. However, to collect
the information and be better prepared for loan evaluation analysis, BNT
would need to strengthen its organization by adding a qualified and experi-
enced farm management specialist, to be in charge of training and supervising
technicians in loan evaluation (Appendix 3), and by recruiting three senior
technicians in its head office and six junior technicians in its branches
located in the Project area.
7.        BNT generally carries the full non-repayment risk for loans
made with its normal resource. However, it was requested to undertake loans
to cooperatives under a Government guarantee. The Government carries the full
risk on loans made with Special Government funds, whose issue is subject to
approval by various governmental departments.
Interest Rates and Terms
8.        On the average, BNT lends its own resources at 6% per annum.
Overdrawn current accounts pay 7% per annum and BNT charges an additional
2% on delinquent balances. The special fund loans vary from fund to fund.



ANNEX 3

Resources
9.        BNT classifies its resources into two categories:  normal
resources and special resources.
Normal Resources
10.  (a)  Own resources.  These include capital of D 1,600,000 and
free reserves, which have steadily grown, thanks to BNT
regular annual profit, and had reached about D 3.7 million
as of December 31, 1970.
(b) Deposits. These started at D 2.6 million in 1960 and have
increased year by year. The deposits held on December 31,
1970 amounted to D 18 million sight and 7 million term.
They are collected in the rural and urban sector and include
deposits from parastatal bodies, cooperatives, private cus-
tomers, and USAID.
(c) Rediscount Facilities. They are provided by the Central Bank.
BNT's regular ceiling amounts to D 1.2 million. Further-
more the Central Bank allocates to BNT a crop expenditure
ceiling and seasonal ceilings for the financing of cereals,
wine and oils the amount of which is fixed according to annual
requirements. Bills regarding exports and guaranteed by banks
are rediscounted outside any ceiling.
Special Resources
11.  (a)  In 1961, BNT borrowed direqtly from USAID (Development Loan
Fund (DLF) ), with the Government's guarantee, US$5.0
million for a term of 15 years, including one year of grace.
The object was to enable BNT to make medium- and long-term
loans to the agricultural sector for production and process-
ing. Full disbursement was achieved by 1967. One of the
conditions of this 4% loan was that BNT's clients would pay
7% per annum interest, the highest rate charged by BNT for
any type of agricultural loan.
(b) BNT administers several "Special Funds" made available to
it by Government or by external agencies under a Government
guarantee for various agricultural subsectors or in the
framework of a law on agricultural development (May 1963).
These funds are given on concessionary terms in order to
stimulate various priority activities under specific Govern-
imient policy. The total of these Special Funds on December
31, 1970 was D 17.7 million, which included the USAID (DLF)
funds (D 1.5 million). The amount received as an agent from
Bank/IDA for the financing of cooperatives was D 3.2 million.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Use of Resources
12.  (a)  Investments:  BNT's own resources are partly used for equity
investments. As of December 31, 1970, its participations
amounted to D 485,500 (Table 3). Out of this amount,
D 54,300 of bad investments has been fully covered by a
reserve and D 38,000 is covered up to 50%. The market
value of these participations was estimated in January 1971
at D 537,100 or 11%o more than their nominal value. BNT has
agreed to take appropriate steps that would reduce its parti-
cipations to 20% of the capital of any single corporation,
according to BCT regulations (Annex 2). BNT exceeds this
percentage for STIL (participation of 29%, D 43,200 instead
of D 30,000) and for Societe Tuniso Yougoslave de Developpe-
ment (participation of 25%, D 5,300 instead of D 4,200).
(b) Loans:
(i) Loans on Normal Resources
Sight deposits form BNT's largest single resource,
and it, therefore, follows a basic policy of investing
its "own" resources almost entirely in short-term loans.
An exception to this policy was, however, made in favor
of STIL (Annex 6, Appendix 1), a corporation largely
controlled and managed until the end of 1969 by BNT (same
chairman) and, to a large extent, financed only by BNT.
Since that time, however, two new chairmen have been
appointed, one for BNT and one for STIL. Besides its
equity participation, total loans outstanding to STIL
amounted to D 2.7 million, as of March 15, 1971, of
which STIL has agreed to repay D 1.7 million in 7 equal
annual installments. Additionally, BNT has agreed to
reduce its financial engagement with STIL (other than
short-term financing of export commodities) from 50% of
its capital and free reserves at present to 25% by end-
1975. This disengagement plan, recommended by Bank/IDA,
would not impose undue restrictions on STIL's financial
resources and would not impede its development program.
STIL has competent management and its overall operations
have been consistently profitable (Annex 6, Appendix 1).
(ii)  Loans on Special Funds
Special Funds are generally invested in medium- and
long-term loans. The relevant investments are shown
under "Assets" in Table 1 (Summarized Balance Sheets,
1966-1970). The difference between the total borrowed,
as shown under Special Funds,and invested remains
available for investments.

"'age 5
13.       It is worthwhile to mention that fanming cnoperetives were financed
with BNT normal resources as well as DLF and Government funds. Table 4
gives the amount of loans due from farming coopezatives.  Following the
reduction in number of cooperatives from 350 to 21S in Septeiber 1969, the
Bank/IDA and Government agreed in November 1970, to reschedule the debt
to be repaid, partly by the remaining cooperatives and partL; by the
Government. Details are as follows:
(a) Remaining Cooperatives: D 3.4 million (P 3.3 million on
BiNT funds and D 0.1 million on DLP funds) will be repaid:
(i) up to about D 1.5 million by Gevernment in annual install-
ments of D 0.3 million, commencing Juns 30, 1971;
(ii) up to about D 1.9 million by the cooperatives, according
to schedules over five years.
(b)  Dissolved Cooperatives:  The amount of debts on BNT funds (D 2.5
million) and DLF funds (D 0.1 million) wil'l be repaid by the
Government according to BNT's needs.
As of March 15, 1971 the remaining cooperatives' debts had been reduced to
D 3.0 million. To cover the projected cash deficit, Government has agreed
to honor its guarantee obligation and repay the dissolved cooperatives' debts
in five annual installments, starting in Year 1.
BNT Financial Structure
14.       Table 2 gives a classification of BNT assets and liabilities
as of December 31, 1970, which is summarized below (in D million).
Current Assets                  34.1    Current Liabilities              36.0
Medium- and Long-
Term Assets      13.5                  Medium- and Long-
Less Provision      0.6         12.9       Term Liabilities                3.9
Investments and Fixed
Assets                         1.0    Capital Reserves and Surplus    5.3
48.0                                     45.2
Special Funds Loans                     Special Funds
Government   14.5                    Government Funds    16.2
Funds                              DLF                   1.5
DLF           0.4
14.9                                     17.7
62.9                                     62.9
15.       BNT's liquidity position i8 not satisfactory.  Short-term liabili-
ties exceed current assets by D 1.9 million (ratio 0.9/1). While BNT has
been able to increase its sight and term deposits from D 17 million in 1966
to D 25 million in 1970, part of these resources have been used to finance



ANNEX 3
Page 6
long-term loans to STIL and short-term loans to cooperatives, which are over-
due.
Project Requirements
16.       The cash flow projections (Table 5) assume that BNT borrows at an
average cost of 4.7% per annum the funds required for its lending program
and that BNT lends to sub-borrowers at 8%, leaving it with a 3.3% margin.
This is sufficient to pay for BNT's incremental costs under the Project,
create a sufficient reserve for bad debts and leave it with a reasonable
profit. During the disbursement period, BNT would have to provide funds re-
quired to cover the cumulative deficit, which would reach a peak of D 918
in year 3 but would thereafter be reduced through repayments under the Proj-
ect.
17.       Furthermore, BNT would be expected to provide short-term
(seasonal) credit to the farm mechanization and dairy development sub-
project farmers. At 50% of operating costs, the requirements are estimated
at D 4,000 for Model 1 (crawler tractor), D 2,000 for Model 2 (wheel tractor),
and D 2,000 for Model 3 (dairy). Converted to total requirements, based on
the projected entries of farmers, the position would be:
Model 1         Model 2            Model 3            Total
No. of             No. of            No. of              No. of
Farmers    D'000  Farmers D'000    Farmers  D'000    Farmers D'O00
Year 1   125        500      155    310        75       150      355    960
Year 2   125        500      155    310        30        60      310    870
Year 3   125        500      155    310        45        90      325    900
375     1,500      465    930       150       300      990  2,730
These short-term requirements have not been computed in the Project cash                0
flow but in the overall BNT cash flow.
BNT Projected Financial Statements
18.       Tables 6, 7, and 8 give projected cash flow, balance sheets, and
operating results from year 1 through year 5. Deposits, which increased by
D 8 million during the last five years, are expected to increase by D 1.1
million only during the next five years.  It is anticipated that BNT would
recover D 1.4 million every year from Government, cooperatives, and STIL.
Projected balance sheets show that at the end of year 5 current assets would
exceed current liabilities by D 3.7 million (ratio 1.1:1).
Medium- and Long-Term Debt Equity Ratio
19.       The following table shows that the medium- and long-term debt/
equity ratio, which was 1:1 as of December 31,1970   would be 1.3:1 at the
end of year 5.

Financial Results
20.       BNT has a good and consistent record of earnings.  Tables 7 and 9
give the summarized Profit and Loss Accounts for the last five years. The
small decline of revenues was due partly to a change in the accounting pro-
cedures during the 1969 introduction of the computer, under which interest
on loans is not charged out until collected. This method reflects income
received rather than income earned, and represents, therefore, a more con-
servative approach. Furthermore, expenses have been consistently rising and
BNT became liable to pay income tax in 1969 (after a nine-year exemption).
The resulting narrowing margin will require strong management control.
21.       A 5% dividend on capital has been paid consistently throughout,
the balance of net profit being transferred to various reserves. The pro-
vision for bad debts and investments had a balance of D 0.6 million at the
end of 1970. Provision for various risks, which might be considered as a
general reserve, and reserves amount to D 3.7 million.  These provisions are
adequate to meet any contingencies arising out of non-repayment of loans.
Future Earnings
22.       Income and expenditure projections for five years (Table 7) indi-
cate that BNT would continue to make profits, be able to maintain a dividend
of 5%, and establish adequate reserves after payment of taxes.

Appendix 1

TUNISIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
BANQUE NATIONALE DE TUNISIE
GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION OF A POLICY STATEMENT
General
1.        The National Bank of Tunisia (BNT), as a deposit money bank estab-
lished as a joint stock company governed by the Code of Commerce and the
Banking Laws, will conduct its affairs and operations under the management
of experienced and competent officers observing the principles of liquidity,
profitability, and security, guided by the aim to contribute to the economic
development of Tunisia.
Organization and Personnel
2.        The organization of the BNT and the internal methods of work will
have to be adjusted to the growing tasks.
3.        Staff will be employed, trained and promoted only according to
their abilities and professional knowledge in banking, accounting, adminis-
tration, and agriculture (including fisheries).
Scope of Operations
4.        BNT may extend its financing activities primarily to agricultural
enterprises.
5.        To qualify for BNT's assistance, an enterprise should be finan-
cially viable and its projected operations should be consistent with the
national economic development priorities.
Form of Assistance
6.        BNT will make assistance available for enterprises within the
limits of sound financial practice, by means of loans and various forms of
investment including guarantees, equity participations, and the underwriting
of securities issues.
7.        In order to assist the development of the Tunisian capital and
money market, BNT should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to
other investors or to require other banks' participation in lending to an
enterprise, with due respect to its own interests and to those of the other
participants.



ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page 2
Limits of Commitment
8.   (i)  The minimum size of loans made by BNT should not be
less than D 100.
(ii) The aggregate of lending to and equity participation in
any single enterprise should not exceed any of the fol-
lowing, unless such excess is fully guaranteed by Govern-
ment or responsible financial institution:
(a)  25% of BNT's net worth, i.e., paid-up equity plus free
reserves;
(b)  15% of BNT's net worth plus outstanding long-term
Government loans;
fc)  50% of the total assets of an enterprise.
However, the above limitations do not apply to short-term
financing by BNT of products for export or purchase of
grains, vines and olive oil secured by chattel mortgage.
(iii) BNT should normally limit its participation in the equity
of a single enterprise to a maximum of 20% of the capital
of the enterprise.
Security
9.        BNT should seek to obtain adequate security on loans made, subject
to satisfaction on the viability of the project and the earnings potential
of the enterprise. Aside from security considerations, BNT should evaluate
medium- and long-term loan applications in terms of incremental returns
from the additional investment to be financed and in terms of loan repayment
capacity.
General Lending Principles
10.  (i)  BNT will aim at financing only sound projects which
are financially viable with satisfactory technical and
administrative management;
(ii) BNT will seek to avoid taking a management control of
any enterprise which it finances. Where, in exceptional
circumstances, such action may be required to protect BNT's
interest, BNT will seek to divest itself of its management
control whenever appropriate arrangements can be made;
(iii)  The period of repayment on loans made by BNT shiould
be related to the life of the asset financed and realistic
projections of cash flow for the enterprise;



ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page 3
(iv)  BNT will ordinarily avoid re-financing since the purpose
of its assistance should be to increase the productive
capacity of the enterprise;
(v) When financing investment expenditures through medium- and
long-term loans, BNT will either finance the working cap-
ital or assure that adequate finance is available for
current expenditures.
Financial Policy
11.  (i)  BNT's interest rate and other fees should be fixed from
time to time in light of current market rate but the rate
of interest and other fees charged on any particular loan
should be fixed for the life of that loan. BNT will set
a reasonable interest rate and other fees in order to cover
the cost of its funds and its operating expenses, including
adequate provision for bad debts, depreciation and taxes and
to build up such reserves as necessary to maintain at all
times an aggregate of capital and reserves, equivalent to
at least 10% of sight and fixed term deposits;
(ii)  BNT shall ensure that medium- and long-term loans are fi-
nanced by resources with appropriate terms such as equity
capital and reserves, long- and medium-term borrowings,
including medium-term rediscount facilities from the Central
Bank;
(iii) BNT shall strictly comply with financial ratios prescribed
for banks by the Central Bank of Tunisia;
(iv)  Fixed assets of BNT, including participations, shall not ex-
ceed 75% of its net worth, as defined in paragraph 8;
(v) BNT shall ensure that the total of its outstanding debts of
more than one year does not exceed four times the total of
its paid-up equity capital plus free reserves; and
(vi)  BNT will obtain suitable protection against the foreign ex-
change risk in respect of foreign loans.
Government Funds
12.       The present rules do not apply to operations made on behalf of
the Government with special funds provided by the Government and adminis-
tered by BNT as an agent in the frame of specific agreements.

1.        The grain farm mechanization sub-project area comprises the
Governorats Bizerte, Jendouba, Beja, Le Kef and parts of Tunis, in north-
western Tunisia, north of the 400-mm rainfall line (Mtap 1). This area
accounts for nearly four-fifths (78%) of the country's barley and hard
and soft wheat production.  Alluvial, inherently fertile soils predominate
in the low-lying cropland areas. However, differences in annual rainfall
govern land use and cropping patternts: extensive, alternate year cropping
in the southwestern portion and semit-intensive cropping in the remaining
portion.
2.        Aside from rainfall, competition from weeds is the main factor
liniting productivity. In recent years, weed infestations have seriously
increased. Changes in Government policy and lack of investment and produc-
tion credit have discouraged private sector farmers from maintaining and
replacing their grain farm equipment. Standards of land preparatiorn and
weed control have thus declined and productivity has deteriorated and on
many farms, the cropped area was reduced, due to lack of adequate farm
inputs.
3.        Key factors towards restoration and improvement of productivity
are: (a) investment in tractors, attachments and combines (an estimated
75% of the cereal farms rely on mechanized land preparation and harvesting);
(b) improved weed control, partly through timely and thorough land prepara-
tion and partly through herbicides; (c) gradual replacement of local soft
wheat witlh improved local and Mexican varieties; (d) increased use of
fertilizer, especially on the improved varieties; and (e) timely harvesting
through purchase of grain combines.
Alternate Year Cropping -- Model 1
4.        In the western and southern portions of the sub-project area
(Pont du Fahs, Ebba Ksour, LeKef, Sakiet, Sidi Youssef), annual rainfall
rarely exceeds 450 mm. Typical grain farms in this region average about
200 ha in cereals: hard wheat, soft wheat and barley. These crops provide
about 1,500 hours of productive work annually for a crawler tractor, 1,100
hours for a wheel tractor, and 300 to 400 hours for a grain combine.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Soil and climatic conditions require that a crawler tractor be
used for two crucial operations: deep plowing of dry, hard soils (following
harvest in summer and prior to the fallow period) and land preparation
prior to seeding in November/December, when clay soils are often wet and
slippery. Wheel tractors, have insufficient power and traction. In recent
years, most farmers have either not been able to purchase such heavy equip-
ment as crawler tractors and combines, for want of credit, or have post-
poned such investments because they feared expropriation.
6.        The investment cost on such farms would average D 8,000
(US$15,200) for a crawler tractor and about D 1,000 (US$1,900) for
attachments. Not all of the existing attachments would need to be
replaced. The investment, coupled with increased short-term production
credit, would enable farmers to improve land preparation, weed control
and fertilizer use. With these practices, hard wheat and soft wheat
yields are expected to increase from present levels of about 0.8 tons/ha
to about 1.3 tons/ha. A further increase in productivity is expected
through gradual replacements of local varieties by Mexican wheat seed.
In 1969/70, Tunisian farmers planted some 5,000 ha of Mexican-type wheat
for seed multiplication and about 60,000 ha for commercial use or for
exchange of seed with neighbors. Availability of improved seed is thus
assured.
7.        Other essential inputs, such as fertilizer and herbicides, are
readily available through normal commercial channels, or from service
cooperatives. Phosphate is one of Tunisia's major exports. Mechanization
facilitates relatively efficient use of labor. Unskilled farm laborers
earn about D 0.6 per day (US$1.15); tractors and mechanics receive up to
twice that amount.
8.        Basic assumptions in cropping pattern and cost/revenue aspects
are sunmarized in Table 1. The financial rate of return is about 25%. The
sensitivity was tested, assuming a yield or price decrease of 25% below the
best estimate and the result still showed an adequate return of 15%.
9.        Model 1 uses a crawler tractor purchased in year 1 (D 8,000)
throughout the life of the Project.
10.       Although 200 ha of cereal crops do not suffice to justify exclusive
use of a new combine, the area is too large to rely on outside custom
services. Demand for custom services has been increasing, but, due to lack
of combines, available units could not cope with it. Farmers have lost up
to 20% of their grain harvest, particularly in hot, dry years. With the use
of combine-harvesting, available at appropriate times, grain losses should
not exceed 5%. The savings represent about D 2,000 annually. Those invest-
ing in new combines will therefore find it easy and financially attractive
to render custom combine services for other farmers at rates of D 4 to 5
per hour. In these circumstances, the annual demand for the next three
years is estimated at 80 units.

Semi-intensive Cropping -- Model 2
11.       In the northern portion of the sub-project area (Beja, Sedjenana,
Mateur, Jendouba), average annual rainfall (450 to 650 mm) permits annual
cropping. Typical farms produce hard and soft wheat, pulses (mainly chick
peas) and green or dry forage (mainly oats and vetch). These crops provide
about 1,100 hours of productive work per year for a medium size tractor
(60 hp). Land preparation for pulses and forage is performed in spring when
soil conditions are more suitable for wheel tractors. Occasionally, crawler
tractors are rented for deep summer plowing and most farmers rely on custom
harvesters because the area in cereal and pulse crops does not justify
ownership of a combine.
12.       Investment cost on these farms would average 1) 2,900 (US$5,500)
for a 60 hp tractor and D 1,000 (US$1,900) for appropriate attachments.
Basic assumptions and cash flow are shown in Table 1. As illustrated in
model 1, the investment, coupled with increased short-term credit for pur-
chased inputs, would increase productivity, mainly through better and more
timely land preparation and weed control. Returns would also be improved
through expansion of areas in Mexican wheat for which ecological conditions
are suitable. The financial rate of return, based on the assumptions indi-
cated in Model 2, is 21%. The sensitivity was also tested. Assuming a
yield or price decline of 25% below the best estimate, the result still
slhowed a rate of return of 12%, which is satisfactory.
Demand for Tractors and Combines
13.       According to a farm equipment census in 1968/69, private farmers
in northern Tunisia owned about 4,000 (3,000 wheel and 1,000 crawler)
tractors. Annual demand under this sub-project is estimated at 200 units
(155 wheel and 45 crawler tractors), or 5% of the tractor population.
This estimate is low. It takes into account (a) arrangements for financing
farmers' tractor purchases through supplier credits, (b) a tendency of
farmers to over-mechanize, and (c) BNT's limited capacity to appraise loan
applications.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
DAIRY FARM SUB-SUBPROJECT
Model 3
1.        Dairy farming is at present concentrated in large Government and
cooperative farms in the lower Medjerda Valley. The Office Mise en Valeur
Valley Medjerda (OMVVM) plans to expand its herd of 2,000 to about 5,000
cows. Import of Friesian cattle, establishment and management of Government
and cooperative dairy farms has been supported through bilateral and multi-
lateral technical and financial assistance (Belgian, Canadian, Danish, Dutch,
German and FAO).
2.        OMVVM operates a calf rearing scheme.  It buys female Friesian
one-month old calves from private farmers at D 25, and rears and breeds
them, either for expansion of its own herd or to sell later to farmers at
D 280 for one in-calf heifer. Farmers receive a D 30 Government subsidy
per heifer bought under the program; D 80 credit is repayable from milk
deliveries from the Medjerda loan fund and additional credit can be obtained
from BNT for the balance. The program has been confined to irrigated Med-
jerda Valley farms near Tunis, but it has aroused interest among other
farmers, notably in areas where irrigated forage production is feasible.
Demand and Marketing
3.        While Tunisia's fresh milk production increased from about 3,000
tons per annum in 1960 to 9,300 tons in 1969, fluid milk consumption has
increased much more rapidly. It rose from 3,000 tons in 1960 to 18,000
tons in 1969, mainly because of urbanization and tourism, but also as a
result of progressive marketing by the Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie
Laitiere (STIL) (see Table 1). By means of reconstituting imported dry
milk and blending it with locally produced fresh milk, STIL has been able
to pay adequate prices to farmers. STIL needs additional fresh milk,
however, to maintain the quality of fluid milk demanded by its customers.
It has a line of 16 dairy products on the shelves of its retail outlets.
Milk collection in major production areas is adequately organized and
can be expanded into new areas. Processing facilities are also adequate
and can absorb additional output.
Project Area
4.        Dairy farms (about 150) would be established on existing grain
farms in the vicinity of Mateur, Sedjenana, Beja and Jendouba (See Map 1).
Ecologically, this region is somewhat better suited to dairy farming than
existing Medjerda Valley farms, because of higher elevation and rainfall.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Prior to 1969, many grain farmers in this region kept beef cattle, and a
few have had experience with dairy cattle. Fearing expropriation, they
sold much of their stock but are now keen to re-establish beef enterprises
or to convert them to dairy.
Investment
5.        Average investment cost is estimated as follows:
D/farm
Irrigation for 8 ha                              3,060
Shallow well and pumpset at D 1,950
Irrigation network        at D 1,110
Barn Improvements                                  800
Including watering facilities and milk
room at D 40 for 20 cows
Forage and Hay-making Attachments                  240
for existing wheel tractor
Purchase of Dairy Heifers                        3,200
at D 267 for 12                            __-
Total ...      .      7,300
6.        BNT's technical staff would appraise all aspects of these invest-
ments as a package on the basis of incremental returns, subject to the
following conditions:
(a) approval of technical aspects of irrigation (well site or
alternate source of water, pump specifications, quality
and availability of water) by an authorized engineer of the
Bureau de l'Inventaire des Ressources Hydrauliques (BIRH)
of the Ministry of Agriculture:
(b) establishment of irrigation facilities for at least 8 ha
and acceptance by the farmer of a crop plan that would
meet year-round feed requirements;
(c) low-cost, but adequate barn and watering facilities for 12
cows and young stock, with provision for expanding the herd
to 20 cows;
(d) availability of artificial insemination services and training
for the Project area farmers (see para 7 below). Farmers
would be required to agree to follow technical advice given
by the extension agents working under the supervision of the
dairy training centers;



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(e) STIL's agreement that the location is suitable for regular
collection or delivery of milk to a collection center; and
(f) deferment of loan release for purchase of dairy heifers by
BNT until the authorized extension supervisor certifies that
the applicant has a secured feed base and has complied with
the above conditions.
7.        The provision of artificial insemination services and training
would be based on the use of Government-approved bilateral (German, Dutch,
Belgian) and FAQ joint training centers.
8.        Basic assumptions for dairy farm development are indicated in
Model 3, (Table 2) showing a financial rate of return of 26%, the cropping
schedules and crop pattern are illustrated in Appendix 1. The dairy feed
supply would be secured mainly from irrigated alfalfa and bersim, and from
unirrigated forage crops, mainly vetch and oats (green forage, hay or silage).
The portion of the 8-ha irrigated land not used for alfalfa and bersim pro-
duction would be planted to high-yielding Mexican soft wheat and maize, and
where appropriate, to commercial vegetables. By-products from sugar beet
production (tops and pulp) would be available as supplementary feed in the
Jendouba and Beja regions.
9.        The dairy heifers would mainly come from OMVVM, which plans to
have an annual surplus of about 400 heifers for sale from 1971 onwards,
from their own herd and from their heifer raising scheme. The Project
provides financing for import of about 700 heifers because it is expected
that at the start of the Project the required number of good quality stock
might not be readily available.
10.       The demand for dairy farm loans is estimated at 75 in the first,
30 in the second and 45 in the third year of the lending program. Since the
establishment of irrigation and alfalfa is a precondition, the heifers would
be purchased 9 to 12 months following each loan approval. Staff require-
ments and cost estimates of the dairy extension service for 150 farms are
shown in Table 3.

DATE-PALM DEVELOPMENT SUB-PROJECT
Model 4
Production
1.        Between 1965 and 1969, the production of dates from Tunisia's
8,000 ha of mature palms has averaged about 5,000 tons annually. Most of
the 8,000 ha is in traditional oasis plantations. Oasis land ownership is
traditionally shared by many people with minute holdings, and the fruit of
a single palm tree may belong to more than one family. The pattern of
fractional ownership has led to excessively close spacing of 300 to 400
palms per ha; however, less than half the trees bear fruit. In modern
plantations, it is considered unwise to exceed 130 palm trees per ha.
Efforts to modernize such old plantations have not yet been successful
despite substantial Government investments. Results of newly developed
smallholder units on 1 to 2 ha of irrigated land have also been disappoint-
ing, mainly because of poor management.
Marketing
2.        Date production has primarily satisfied domestic demand.  From
1965 to 1969, exports have averaged only 3,300 tons, or 7% of total
production. Of three main types or varieties (Deglat, Alligh and Communes),
Deglat accounts for practically all the exports. The Societe Tunisienne
de l'Industrie Laitiere (STIL) is the sole exporter of dates (Appendix 1)
and has modern processing, packaging, refrigeration, and storage facilities.
Date merchants and processors in Marseille, France, are its main customers
for bulk or wholesale shipment of dates to Europe. To diversify its markets
and to pursue more aggressive marketing techniques, STIL has developed 250 g
retail packs. Through study of preferences in several European markets
(mainly in Switzerland, Italy, and Scandinavian countries), STIL has learned
to differentiate between the degree of dryness and the design of labels of
its retail pack in accordance with consumer preferences in specific markets.
Nearly one-third of its exports are now marketed in retail packs and this
position is increasing. STIL sells these packs at an average price of
D 0.400 per kg, of which D 0.090 to D 0.100 is the wholesale buying price,
D 0.200 the cost of packaging and marketing, and about D 0.100 STIL's
net profit.



AANNEX 6

Commercial Date-Palm Development
3.        STIL has not been able to satisfy export market demands.  There-
fore, because the domestic supply of Deglat dates is limited, STIL has
become involved in modern date-palm development.  Since 1964, it has
managed a mature commercial plantation established by a Frenclh company.
In additioni, it has established about 400 ha of modern Deglat plantations,
the first of which are now beginning to bear fruit. They are in two prin-
cipal locations: Nefzaoua and Djerid, soutlhwest and south of Gafsa in the
Tunisian Sahara, the date-palm sub-project area (Mfaps 1 and 2).
Investments and Financial Rate of Return of 50-ha Plantation
4.        Principal investment items of a 50-ha date-palm unit, designed
for deep (600 m) and medium deep (200 m) boreholes are shown in Table 1.
These costs are typical for the Djerid location (deep boreholes and artesian
flow) and for the Nefzaoua region (medium deep with pump unit). The basic
assumptions on yields and prices are given in Table 2. The financial rate
of return based on these assumptions is 14%, as shown in Table 3.
5.        Investment cost estimates include provision for "dead" and
"planted" windbreaks (especially important as protection against Sahara
sand storms); 15 houses for permanent labor and staff and one shed with
space for field office, packaging, and supplies; and 10% for overhead and
contingencies.
Water Resources
6.        Location and groundwater availability for new plantations are
described in Appendix 2. STIL employs competent contractors for well drill-
ing, uses reasonably sound agronomic techniques, and has developed competent
plantation management.  Availability of water supplies and land suitability
for about 600 ha (12 units averaging 50 ha) are adequate.  Provision for                 0
financing an additional 300 ha (second tranche) is also included under this
sub-project, subject to certification by Bureau d'Inventaire des Resources
Hydrauliques (BIRH) of the Ministry of Agriculture as to adequacy of water
supplies and suitability of soils for each specific location. It would
also be subject to approval by the Bank/IDA. Likely locations for the 300
ha are:
Nefzaoua:       Jabria area                     40 ha
Djerid:         Louah area                     100 ha
Hazoua area                     80 ha
Between Neftah and Tozeur       40 ha
North of "L'Oasis"              40 ha
Total ..       .   300 ha
7.        Water requirements range from about 0.5 liter/sec for 1 ha during
the establishment period to about 0.9 liter/sec at full development, years



ANNEX 6
Page 3
12 to 15. A safety factor of 10% has been included and all water requirc-
ments were computed at 1 liter/sec per ha. Initial water supplies can
be more fully utilized through intercropping of vegetables - tomatoes,
melons, garlic, onions and hot peppers - or fruit - apricots and pomegra-
nate. On average, 20% of each 50-ha unit could be intercropped.
Necessary Improvements
8.        Although STIL has demonstrated competence in planning, establish-
ing, and operating modern date-palm plantations, improvements could be made
in three principal areas:
(a) Economizing water use. Estimates of water requirements
should take into account the likely decline of artesian
flows in future years. Better long-run water use should
be secured through appropriate combination of artesian
f low and pumping (Appendix 2).
(b) Agronomic practices. The weakest aspects of STIL's date-
palm management are fertilizer use and watering practices.
As regards intercropping, STIL is just beginning to exploit
the advantages of soil, climate, and water conditions, which
permit harvesting of tomatoes in the second half of January;
apricots in the second half of April; melon, onion, garlic,
and pomegranate, with a view to marketing such produce in
European markets, during off-season. STIL should, therefore,
secure the services of a qualified agricultural expert with
broad experience in producing and marketing tree fruit and
vegetables. Because it is unlikely that STIL can secure the
services of a Tunisian expert with such qualifications, pro-
vision for financing expert services is included in the
estimated Project costs. Terms of reference for the expert
are included in Appendix 3.
(c)  Accounting.  Present record and accounting practices are inade-
quate, even for the existing date-palm plantations. Substantial
improvements are necessary to satisfy the requirements of
improved plantation management and financial management of
STIL's head office.

TUNISIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'INDUSTRIE LAITIERE (STIL)
Origin and Objectives
1.        STIL was formed in 1961 as a public company with the object of
acquiring a milk processing enterprise operating as a branch of a metro-
politan French enterprise. Additionally, STIL was to operate road trans-
port, develop fruit and vegetable conditioning and processing, operate
as importer and exporter of agricultural and food products and undertake
such other industrial and commercial activities consistent with the achieve-
ment of the preceding objectives. STIL's authorized and paid-up capital
is D 150,000, held as follows: Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT), 28.7%;
parastatal bodies, 24.3%; individual shareholders 37% and corporate
entities, 10%.
Principal Activities
2.        STIL's activities, initially concentrated on milk processing and
distribution, now include: fruit and vegetable processing, transport, ex-
port and import, general merchandising, tourist hotel operations, and date-
palm plantations (para 4). Involvement in date-palm development began in
1964 when it took over the management of a mature plantation established by
a French company. As the sole authorized exporter of dates, facing a con-
tinuous short supply of export-quality dates, STIL subsequently established
400 ha of modern plantations, the first ones of which are now approaching the
first bearing stage.
Administration and Management
3.        STIL's governing body is a Board of Directors (Conseil d'Admin-
istration), consisting of three to 12 members holding shares and elected
for six years by the Annual General Meeting; members may succeed them-
selves. The Board elects one of its members as chairman-general manager.
A new full time chairman-general manager was elected in September 1969;
his predecessor was simultaneously the chairman-general manager of BNT and
relinquished both posts on being nominated the Minister of Commerce.
4.        There are five departments, each headed by a departmental manager,
reporting directly to the chairman-general manager. They are:
(a) Industrial Department
(i) Canning operation;
(ii) Fruit and vegetable conditioning and packing; and
(iii) Milk processing.



ANNEX 6
Appendix 1
Page 2
(b) Commercial Department
(i) Transport fleet administration and shipping office;
(ii) Import and export; and
(iii) Retail and general merchandising.
(c) Agricultural Department
(i) Date-palm plantations; and
(ii) Cattle operations in Djerid and Mateur.
(d) Real Estate Department
(i)  Hotel; and
(ii) Other buildings.
(e) Administrative Department
(i) Accounting;
(ii) Personnel; and
(iii) Staff - social services.
5.        STIL employs about 130 people on a monthly payroll and, de-
pending on the season, between 600 and 1,300 weekly paid laborers. The
simple pattern of five departments has been successful under the strong
management of the previous general manager and there are indications that
the present general manager will continue along the same lines of control.
The present weight of his responsibilities contributed to his ready accep-
tance that an agricultural expert, capable of implementing the date-palm
plantation sub-project, will need to be employed to run this sub-project.
Resources, Their Use and Financial Position
6.        According to the last balance sheet (September 30, 1970), the
value of STIL's net assets was D 3.7 million. The corresponding resources
were: Capital, D 150,000; Reserves, D 598,000; and Provisions, D 2,993,000.
Normally, Provisions would not be included in the shareholders' funds, as
its main purpose is to act as an adjustment factor to the value of
various assets such as debtors and perishable stock. In this case,
however, the large amount accumulated over the last four years has not
been assigned to any class of asset and, therefore, the Provisions, as they
now stand, are really reserves on which taxation has not yet been levied.
7.        Summarized details of STIL's balance sheet from 1967 through 1970
are given in Table 1. The substantial increase in bank overdrafts from D 1.2
million in 1968 to D 3.0 million in 1970 is related mainly to investments
made in a hotel and date-palm plantations. Part of these overdrafts (D 1.7
million) have been converted into long-term liabilities in March 1971.
8.        STIL's shares are traded on the Tunis Stock Exchange, and their
recent price, which was between D 16.0 to D 16.5 per D 10 share in June



ANNEX 6
Appendix 1
Page 3
1970, has further increased to D 20 in January 1971. This reflects the
favorable assessment made by investors of STIL undertakings, based on the
high dividends paid so far (12% on the 1969 earnings, 10% on the previous
two years' earnings).
9.        Table 2 gives a summary of STIL's earnings and their derivation.
In order to obtain a clear picture of real profits, an adjustment needs to
be made for the excess Provisions charged, thus:

Accounts and Audit
10.       STIL's accounting system is based on a generally accepted
(in Tunisia) model codification and classification, which enables clear
records to be kept of past transactions but does little for the management
in the way of budgeting, cost control, profit planning, and other means
of measuring money or physical factors in terms of predetermined expectations.
11.       Audit is carried out by a "commissaire aux comptes" appointed by
the shareholders in general meeting. This report on STIL accounts as of
September 30, 1969 is limited to comments on technical aspects of accounting
and comparison of variations from year to year without adequate verification
that the accounts are in accordance with the true situation. This audit,

GROUNDWATER SUPPLY IN THE NEFZAOUA AND DJERID REGIONS
A. Chott el Djerid Basin Area General
Natural Conditions and Potential
1.        The chott el Djerid, a large natural depression that was formerly
a great lake in the early quaternary era, lies 400 km south of Tunis on the
northern edge of the Sahara desert. The "chott," from an Arab word meaning
"ishore," is primarily a large dry basin filled with important deposits of
salt and gypsum that were washed out by leakage of underlying artesian
aquifers and by concentrations of runoff washing the salted slopes of the
basin under heavy evaporation conditions. Temperature in this region ranges
from 0 to 50C and, though not far distant from the sea (120 km), the
evaporation is increased by a low grade of air moisture (less than 25%).
2.        Despite these hard climatic conditions, Chott el Djerid basin
is well fitted with groundwater resources, occurring mainly under arte-
sian conditions at depths ranging from less than 80 m in the southern area
-- the Nefzaoua -- to more than 500 m in the northern edge -- the Draa el
Djerid (see Map 2).
3.        Though many surveys have been carried out, the total availa-
bility of water is not yet fully determined. Full estimates are expected
to be available in 1971 from the UNESCO ERRES Project, which is actually
under operation.
4.        As a consequence of high evaporation and the numerous layers of
saline deposits in geological formations, the standard of water quality is
generally low, ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 ppm of total salt. Consequent-
ly, soils used for agriculture must be carefully selected. Drainage in the
lower areas is quite often a prerequisite to any cropping activity.  Palm
trees and other selected crops, however, provide reasonable yields,
especially of the well known "Deglat Nour" dates that are so popular in
European markets.
5.        Provided that modernization and rationalization is carried out
to take more advantage of existing resources and to further develop potential
resources, the natural conditions described above can be considered propitious
for economic development.



ANNEX 6

B. Aquifer Analysis
6.        Since CH. Domergue and J. M. Daniel conducted their surveys 1/,
it has been generally accepted that the Nefzaoua and the Djerid aquifers
are closely connected and are two parts of the same groundwater system,
the "Continental Terminal." The western part of this important system
extends into Algeria (Oued Rhir), while the eastern part runs close to the
Libyan border. The DJerid and Nefzaoua springs, the Chott el Rharsa and
the Chott el Djerid, represent the main downstream limits of the system.
However, since there is no hydrogeological information on the Chott el
Djerid and Great Eastern Erg regions, the Djerid and the Nefzaoua aquifers
must be considered as two different units.  The Nefzaoua aquifer is in the
southern part of Chott Djerid while Draa el Djerid aquifer lies in the
northern part.
Nefzaoua Aquifer
7.        The groundwater flow of the Nefzaoua aquifer is provided by
rain infiltrations, either on the sand dunes of the Great Eastern Erg
or in temporary marshes at the bottom of the Dahar Plateau. The recharge
basin extends over 10,000 km2 and the average annual flow is about 1.6 to
2.2 m3/sec, assuming an infiltration rate of 5% to 7% and an average annual
rainfall of 100 mm. Equal piezometric lines go from 70 m above sea level to
40 m, from SE to NW. The aquifer lies in fractured limestones of upper
Senonian, whose thickness ranges from 40 m to 120 m because of an old
erosion surface. These limestones settle down from SE to NW under Miocene
and Pliocene sediments and near Kebili the head of this previous layer is
at a depth of 40 m to 50 m. Under these general conditions, the Nefzaoua
aquifer is, in southern and eastern areas, a free water table (replenish-
ment area); it then becomes a confined aquifer, and, finally, an artesian
one.  However, the downstream limits are complicated because the Senonian
limestones are connected with the Turonian limestones (Tebaga mountains),                 0
which contain a free-water table. At the upstream and downstream boundaries,
therefore, steady state conditions prevail, which permit a limited over-
exploitation.
8.        Groundwater outlets fall into one of two main categories:
(a) Natural
(i) Springs. The most important springs are located
near Kebili. While the total flow is now roughly
0.35 m3/sec, it was more than 1.0 m3/sec before bore-
hole drilling commenced;
1/   XIX International Geological Symposium, Algiers, 1952; "Les Bassins
Artesiens de Sud Tunisien", Ch. Domerque Monographies, Regionales 2nd
Serie -- Tunisia No. 3; Tunis, 1952.



ANNEX 6
Appendix 2

(ii)  Evapotranspiration losses.  These occur along the
boundaries of the aquifer and near the existing
springs (wild vegetation); and
(iii)  Evaporation losses in the Chott el Djerid area.
These occur because of numerous springs and
direct evaporation from the surface of the Chott
el DJerid. Although evapotranspiration and eva-
poration losses cannot be quantified, one must
assume that, before the boreholes existed, the
flow of the Nefzaoua aquifer was about 2 m3/sec.
(b) Man-made. Roughly 110 boreholes have been drilled from
1907 to 1970. The following table gives the number and
the artesian flow (1970 data) for each area:
Area                  No. of Boreholes             Flow (m3/sec)
Mansourah                  26 (5 out of order)             0.500
Kebili                     30 (18 out of order)            0.200
Rahmat-Douz                28 (6 out of order)             0.700
Along the Chott Limit      22 (8 out of order)             0.450
Total: . . . . . .  106 (37 out of order)             1.850
The growing water exploitation from boreholes is directly
related to the decreasing spring flows. At present, the
total water used amounts to about 2.2 m3/sec (1.850 from
boreholes and 0.350 from springs).
9.        It seems, therefore, that the aquifer is now over-utilized.  How-
ever, the average decrease of the water levels (2 or 3 m during the last 20
years) is not alarming.  Such a drawdown is permissible, and, oonsidering
the free-boundary conditions and the size of the aquifer (para 7), an equiva-
lent amount could be withdrawn without serious risk during the life of the
Project.
10.       The growing water utilization and the average water table
drawdown have also caused a decrease of the size of the artesian region.
In several locations, pumping is now necessary to obtain, from one borehole,
the same quantity of water as was formerly available through artesian flow.
11.       A UNESCO team 1/ is presently engaged in a major study of
groundwater resources. Within a few months, this team will establish
a mathematical model to determine more accurately the groundwater budget
for the Nefzaoua region. While it would not be safe to accept a large
increase of water exploitation before results of the study are available,

a modest increase, estimated at roughly 0.200 m3/sec, is feasible and in
agreement with preliminary conclusions of the UNESCO survey.
Priority Areas
12.       Based on Tunisian Government soil surveys, two locations are
suitable for new date palm perimeters.
(a)  Tarfaiet el Kraroub area.  A 35-ha date-palm plantation in
this area receives water from a borehole. However, a later
pedological survey 1/ indicates that the most suitable soils
are located 2 km from this perimeter.  A new borehole could
be dug close to this new location for an expected artesian
flow of 80 liter/sec5 sufficient to water 80 ha of date-palm
plantation. It is likely, however, that after five years of
utilization, it would be necessary to pump to obtain the
same flow.
(b) Diemna area (Atilet Zabli). One kilometer from Djemna, a
survey 1/ has shown the existence of about 135 ha of good
soils and about 160 ha of medium quality soils. Since the
aquifer in this area is presently not over-utilized, a 120-
ha date-palm perimeter could be irrigated from two boreholes,
each yielding about 60 liter/sec. There should be two pump
units, since the upstream boundary of the artesian region is
not far from the proposed location. The average total salt
content is about 1,400 ppm in the Tarfaiet el Kraroub area
and 1,600 ppm in the Djemna area.
Cost Estimate
13.       In the Tarfaiet el Kraroub and in the Djeama areas, geological
conditions are very similar:  the head of the limestone layer is at an
average depth of about 60 m, while the bottom is at a depth of 150 m to
160 m. These considerations lead to the following proposed design for
Project boreholes:
Total depth                         160 m
Drilling diameter              :   17-1/2 in
13-3/8 in blind tubing         :    Ju m
Open hole in limestone layers       100 m
Acidification of the limestones will be required.
The estimated cost of such a borehole would be D 10,000 (Table 1), with a
foreign exchange requirement of 35%.

14.       Pump diameter (deep well turbines) would be 8 in or 10 in, with
a 30 to 50 HP diesel engine. A complete pump unit, including transportation,
pump installation and pump house, would cost D 5,500, 50% of which would
be the foreign exchange cost. Annual average operating cost for a 50-HP
pump unit reaches D 1,150 (Table 1), 55% of which would be foreign exchange
cost.
15.       Boreholes would have to be replaced after 20 years and pumps
after 10 years. However, pump replacement would cost only D 4,000
because pipes and pump houses would have longer useful life. Investment
and operating costs for 200 ha of date-palms over 40 years are shown
in Table 2.
Djerid Aquifer
16.       The DJerid area, located north of Chott el Djerid, extends from
the Algerian border to the western limit of the Tebaga mountains. To the
north, from a hydrogeologic viewpoint, the Djerid region reaches Chott el
Rharsa, which can be considered as the downstream boundary of the water
table, although the Draa el Djerid anticline separate Chott et Djerid from
Chott el Rharsa.
17.       The Djerid aquifer is replenished by rainfall on the sand dunes
of Great Eastern Erg, located south and west of the area mentioned above.
After percolation through these sands, the water reaches the Senonian
limestones. In Nefzaoua, the boreholes went into the limestones, but in
Djerid, the hydrogeologic outline is a little different. In this area, the
mio-pliocene layers are not clayey but sandy sediments and it is into these
that the boreholes are drilled. In such conditions, the Senonian limestones
can be compared to a pipe that carries water from the upstream and dunes
to the downstream mio-pliocene sands. The size of the replenishment area
and the average porosity of the sand determines how much water can be stored.
It can reach tens of billions of m3.
18.       The Draa el DJerid anticline is the major characteristic of the
Djerid aquifer. It caused the mio-pliocene pervious layers to outcrop, and
the aquifer, which is artesian along the Chott el Djerid limits, becomes a
free-water table in the greatest part of the Draa el Djerid hills. To the
north, the opposite happens: the free-water table becomes an artesian aqui-
fer. Taking into account the difference between the porosity of sediments
in the free-water table and their storage coefficients in both artesian
areas, the Djerid aquifer is, in fact, cut into two parts. Because of this
division, an over-utilization in the southern part could not seriously
affect the northern part for 10 years at least.
19.       The thickness of the pervious sands ranges from 200 m to 300 m.
However, the head of this layer is often very deep, running 200 m to 450 m
along the Chott el Djerid coast and more than 600 m near Louah, north of
Draa el Djerid. The equal piezometric contours, from south to north, range
from 65 m to 45 m above sea level.



ANNEX 6
Appendix 2

20.       The main springs of the DJerid area are a result of the Draa el
Djerid anticline. At present, the flow issuing from these springs can be
estimated at 1.180 m3/s, while in 1952 it was 1.500 m3/s. The following
table gives the location of the most important spring areas and the total
flow for each area in 1952 and in 1970.
Flow (m3/s)
Location                   1952           1970
Nefta                      0.500         0.350
Tozeur                     0.500         0.450
Degache                    0.320         0.260
El Hamma                   0.170         0.120
Total                 1.490         1.180
It can be assumed that before boreholes drilling commenced (1905), the
total flow was about 1.8 m3/s. Taking into account the other outlets
(springs and evaporation losses in Chott el Rharsa and in one part of Chott
el Djerid, small springs not measured), the total yield of the DJerid aqui-
fer is nearly 2.5 or 3 m3/s.
21.       The underground water is exploited by at least 35 boreholes 1/.
The following table gives the number of boreholes and the amount of utilized
artesian water (1970 date) for each region:

The existing boreholes can actually give more than the plans shown above
because sluice gates are often installed on the discharge pipes and they are

not always wide open. In the Tozeur-Seddada area, for example, the artesian
flow can reach 0.500 m3/s; however, an exploitation at such a flow would de-
crease the Tozeur and Degache spring yield (opening the gates might provide
a net increased flow of 0.130 m /s).
22.       The analysis above indicates that water utilization in the Djerid
area from springs and boreholes amounts to 1.9 to 2.0 m3/s, which leads to
the assumption that the Djerid aquifer is not now over-utilized. This
assumption, however, must be modified to take into account the borehole
density in some areas. For instance, in the Tozeur-Seddada and in the
Oasis-el Hamma areas, there is more than one borehole per km and it can be
assumed that in the traditional oases (Nefta-Tozeur-Degache-el Hamma), the
aquifer is overutilized. The way in which the natural oases were developed
brought on this situation. New date-palm plantations were always located
close to the traditional ones and borehole density increased year by year
in restricted areas.
Priority Areas
23.       Because soil surveys have not been made in many parts of the
regions, the location of new perimenters must be presently based on hydro-
geologic conditions. This would permit only a determination of general
areas as sites of new date-palm plantations. Later on, soil surveys should
be made so that precise locations of the perimeters can be established.
24.       Priority areas are as follows:
(a) Hazoua area. Between the Algerian border (Hazoua) and
Nefta (35 km), only one borehole has been drilled.
According to the flow of the aquifer in that region,
it is possible to withdraw at least 0.200 m3/s. The
head of the pervious layers is located at a 450-m
depth and the thickness of the aquifer can run as
much as 150 m. The artesian flow is expected to be
nearly 50 to 60 1/s for each borehole. Therefore,
to irrigate 200 ha of new date-palm plantations, four
boreholes would be required.
(b) Between Nefta and Tozeur (Draa el Dierid area). The
aquifer of the Nefta and Tozeur areas is over-used except
along the Draa el Djerid hills, between Rherdgaya and
Tozeur, where there are no boreholes. Surveys indicate
the presence of suitable soils in all of this area. Two
boreholes could, therefore, be drilled, one at each of
the following suggested locations: (i) 4 km east of the
existing Rherdgaya borehole, and (ii) 4 km east of the
above location. Each borehole should be 500 m deep and
give an average expected yield of 40 to 50 1/s. This
would provide irrigation for 80 ha of date-palm plantations.

(c) Dghoumess area. One borehole could be drilled in this
area. It should be 600 m deep and give an expected flow
of 40 to 50 l/s, sufficient for watering 40 ha of date-
palm plantations.
(d) Louah area. In this area, located north of the Draa
el DJerid anticline, only one borehole taps the ground-
water table. It is therefore possible to drill at least
two new boreholes in a first stage project. Each bore-
hole would be 700 m deep (screens from 600 m to 700 m
depth) and the expected artesian flow would be 45 1/s.
This would irrigate 80 ha of date-palm plantations.
25.       The average salt content is about 2,750 PPM in the Hazoua area,
2,200 PPM in the Nefta-Tozeur area, 3,000 PPM in the Dghoumess area and
3,500 PPM in the Louah area.
Cost Estimate
26.       Table 3 gives the cost of an average borehole and the foreign
exchange requirement. While hydrogeologic conditions change from one
location to another, each borehole would have the following common
characteristics:
(a) 16-1/2 in drilling diameter;
(b) 9-5/8 in blind tubing; and
(c) 6-5/8 in screens with gravel packing.
27.       Artesian flow could locally be lower than expected or it could
decrease during the useful life. It would therefore be necessary to make
provision for pumping after the first 10 years, in possibly three locations
out of nine.  Investment, with replacement and operating costs for 400 ha
of date-palm plantations over 40 years are shown in Table 4.
C. Technical Guidelines
28.       The size of a date-palm plantation should not be determined on
the basis of the water yield of a borehole just after its completion. This
flow will decrease at a rate, depending on its exploitation. It can be
calculated that, if the initial water yield of a new borehole is 100%, it
will go down as follows:
(a) 92.5Z after six months;
(b) 89% after one year;
(c) 85% after three years;

(d) 83% after five years;
(e) 81% after 10 years; and
(f) 79% after 20 years.
(for a confined aquifer of hydrogeologic characteristics; transmissibility,
l1-Um2/s and storage coefficient, 4.10-4). These figures could be lower
for an older borehole. The choice would, therefore, be made in each case
between:
(a)  An artesian exploitation based on a safe yield value
(for instance, 75% of the original flow);
(b)  An artesian pumping exploitation based on the original
flow; and
(c)  A pumping exploitation based on a desirable flow (higher
than the initial one), consistent with the borehole
characteristics.
29.       Provided soil surveys indicate that the areas are suitable for de-
velopment, the precise location of perimeters would have to be determined by
BIRH 1/ hydrogeologists, taking into account the results of completed or
pending pumping tests, geophysical surveys, trial boreholes, and well design
considerations.
30.       Proposed date-palm plantation increases (400 ha in Djerid and
200 ha in Nefzaoua) should be considered maximum until the results of the
UNESCO survey are available. Under these circumstances, the Tunisian
Government should give an assurance that any date-palm development envisaged
with Italian Government financing will not compete for water from the Djerid
and Nefzaoua aquifers.
31.       If the results of the UNESCO survey show that it is possible to
increase the date-palm plantations, a second phase project would be estab-
lished. It can expected that the location of new perimeters would be in
the following areas:
(a) Nefzaoua: 40 ha near Jabria; and
(b) Djerid:
(i) Louah area: 100 ha;
(ii) Hazoua area: 80 ha;
(iii) Between Nefta and Tozeur: 40 ha; and
(iv) North to "L'Oasis": 40 ha.

ANNEX 8
TUNISIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.        The two rates of return from the Project to the economy have been
calculated as shown in the attached table. Investment, operating cost and
farm gate prices have been calculated at current levels. Based on these
assumptions, the economic rate of return over a Project life of 40 years
would be 22% 1/.
2.        The sensitivity of the Project has been tested.  Assuming yields
would be 10% less than estimated, or that there would be a 10% price decline
of farm prices in line with 1975 projected world market prices while costs
would remain at the same level, the rate of return to the economy would drop
to 18%, still a satisfactory return.
3.        Additional benefits not taken into account are:
(a) the demonstration effect the Project would have on other
farmers;
(b) the strengthening of BNT's technical department and the
provision of additional loanable funds for agriculture; and
(c) the setting up of a dairy extension service.
Though not readily quantifiable, these factors would further enhance the
Project's already adequate rate of return.
I/   In addition, separate *rates have been calculated for date-palm planta-
tions on one hand for which the economic life is 40 years (15 years to
full bearing and 25 years of full yield) and for the remaining sub-
projects (grain farm mechanization and dairy) for which the economic
life has been assumed at 20 years, on the other. The rates are: 15%
for date-palm plantations, without intercropping; 18% for date-palm
plantations, intercropped with vegetables; 24% for the other sub-projects
(grain fam mechani2:ation and dairy development).
