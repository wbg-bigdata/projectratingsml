AND                OF THE PRESIDECT
OF THE INTERNTIMOAL DEVEilPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THR EKECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OM A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TEE KIRGDGK OF NEPlL
FOR A ROAD FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJT
1.      The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 11.2 million (US$15.5
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.   It would help
finance the priority requirements of rehabilitation and reconstruction of
damages to road infrastructure during the flood disaster of July-August
1987.
2.      Bac4round.   Nepal is bordered by China to the north, and India,
her main trading partner, to the east, south and west. The country's land
area of 141,000 square kilometers is divided into three distinct physical
regions which run in almost parallel bands from east to west across the
couuitry: (i) the relatively fertile Terai (23%) in the south, which
produces the country's agricultural output; (ii) the Hills (61%) including
the important Kathman4j Valley in the center; and (iii) the Himalayas
(16%), the world's highest mountains,  in the north.   The central and
northern regions are dissected by deep valleys running generally from
north to south.
3.      The population of Nepal is now estimated at about 17.0 million.
With an average of more than 120 persons per square kilometer, Nepal is
one of the most densely populated mountainous countries in the world.
About 34% of the population lives in the Terai, while 58% live in the
Hills and 8% in the Himalayan region.  About 90% of Nepal's population
live in rural areas and for nearly all of them agriculture is the main
source of livelihood.   Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed
countries in the world.  Per capita income is estimated at US$160 (1986)
and health and education standards are below the average for South Asia:
life expectancy at birth is only about 47 years; infant mortality about
135 per thousand; and adult literacy only 19%. Between 1965 and 1985, GDP
grew at an annual rate of 2.6%, barely exceeding population growth at
2.4%.
4.      Nepal's daunting topography and climate are the major impediments
to inexpensive and reliable road transport. They create a set of adverse
conditions that are unequalled in the world.   In addition,  the many
streams and rivers are seasonally swollen by the monsoon rains and make
conditions for road transport even more difficult, and road construction
and maintenance exceptionally trying.



-2-
5.      Periods of intensive rainfall result in flash flooding of the
sraller rivers and general flooding due to the inability of natural
drainage systems to cope with the excess water. Particularly destructive
floods are most likely in July and August when rainfall coincides with
snowmelt in the Himalayas. The 1987 flood was the worst in 20 years, as
flood peaks from snowmelt and rainfall coincided with glacial effects in
China  and  the  Himalayas.    Flooding  affected  the  road  network  and
irrigation structures extensively. The greatest damage was in the Central
and Eastern Development Regions and in the Kathmandu Valley.    Road
transport cane to a halt along the East-West Highway in the Terai and
along the Arniko Highway from Kathmandu to China.
6.      Damage to Roads and Ancillary Structures.  The main damages to the
road infrastructure occurred due to the failure of river channelization,
protection and river bank stabilization works at approaches to bridges and
road embankments, and other cross-drainage structures, due to heavy scour
and changes in the river courses in the Terai. In the Hills, heavy floods
and landslides resulted in successive damming up and breaking through of
rivers, which caused damage to br'dges, washout of road sections, and
failure of protection works at approaches.  About 350 km of roads at 37
different locations, mainly in the Eastern and Central Development
Regions, and 106 bridges and cross-drainage structures were damaged to
varying degrees of severity.
7.      Response by Government and Donors.  His Majesty's Government of
Nepal (HMG), supported by international donors, responded quickly and
effectively by providing immediate relief to the affected population. H11K
also carried out a detailed flood damage assessment. The U.K. Government
(ODA) has assisted HMG to assess damages along the East-West Highway, and
the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) has provided technical assistance
for geological  investigations along the Arniko Highway.   HMG's major
flood-related efforts now focus on rehabilitation and reconstruction of
the road and irrigation infrastructure for which it requested IDA's
assistance in January 1988. IDA's strategy has been to: (i) help H1MG to
prepare an emergency road rehabilitation program; (ii) coordinate with
major multilateral and bilateral agencies (UNDP, ADB, ODA, SDC); and
(iii) ensure that priority is given to repairs which are needed to re-
establish economic activities and those that facilitate resumption of the
flow of goods and services.
8.      Rationale  for  IDA's  Involvement.    Given  IDA's  long-standing
development role in Nepal, it is well placed to assist HMG in rebuilding
the roads and irrigation infrastructure, as it has already financed three
highway and eight irrigation projects. The proposed project focusses on
road rehabilitation; the irrigation rehabilitation needs are being handled
under a separate project (proposed Mahakali Irrigation II). As the lead
donor, IDA would help coordinate the road sub-sector reconstruction, and
assist in financing about one half of HMG's program.   Other donors are
discussing with HMG additional support to help with the remainder of the
program.



-3-
9.      Project  Objectives.    The  proposed  project  aims  to  dieliver
immediate assistance to HMG to carry out its program to rehabilitate,
rebuild or replace priority elements of flood-damaged roads and ancillary
structures in the Eastern and Central Development Regions and the
Kathmandu Valley.   It would also accelerate the start of selected top
priority works, to protect investments in road infrastructure that
survived the 1987 flood.
10.     The Proposed Proiect.   The proposed project (US$18.5 million in
June 1988 prices), would comprise priority components of HMG's emergency
program to rehabilitate flood-damaged road infrastructure.   It would be
executed by the Department of Roads (DOR), which would also be executing
agency for the UNDP component.  The credit would finance the first three
years of the program,  and would include:   (a) flood protection works
(US$2.4 million), bridges, culverts and causeways (US$3.8 million) and
roads (US$11.0 million); and (b) technical assistance for consulting
services, by local and foreign consultants, and equipment (US$1.3
million).    Works  comprise  repair,  reconstruction,  strengthening  and
upgrading and limited new construction of flood protection schemes,
bridges, culverts, causeways and roads damaged during the 1987 floods.
The limited new flood protection works would entail no changes to the new
courses taken by rivers.  They would protect structures that survived the
flood and the ones to be built under the project.  These works will not
cause any appreciable harm to riparians since they will be confined to che
existing river channels and would not adversely affect the quality and
quantity of water downstream. In view of this, no notification to
downstream riparians is required.
11.     Designs for works to be implemented in the remainder of   the
current dry season (March-June 1988) have been prepared by DOR.  These
have been reviewed by and are being implemented under the supervision of
consultants, who have been employed on a sole source basis. Sub-projects
to be implemented in subsequent construction seasons will be designed and
supervised by consultants to be retained under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. These sub-projects will be selected on the basis of
criteria discussed and agreed with HMG at negotiations and will include,
inter alia, (a) repair of only 1987 flood-damaged works; (b) no deferred
maintenance; and (c) new construction works limited to protection of
structures that survived the flood and those requiring rebuilding as a
result of the flood.
12.     A  breakdown  of  costs  and  the  financing  plan  are  shown  in
Schedule A. The proposed IDA credit of SDR 11.2 million (US$15.5 million
equivalent) would finance about 84% of the total project cost, net of
taxes and duties.   HMG will provide US$2.5 million as counterpart funds
and UNDP US$0.5 million for technical assistance for one expatriate
advisor (Program Engineering Manager). HMG would pass on the proceeds of
the credit to DOR as budgetary allocations for sub-projects meeting
eligibility criteria.   Retroactive financing in an amount not exceeding
US$1.5 million equivalent, is proposed for expenditures incurred on
capital works and consultant services after March 1, 1988.



-4-
13.     The Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
would be followed for procurement of works and goods. The Guidelines for
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers anid by World Bank as Executing
Agency would be followed for retaining consultants. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Nepal are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map and a Technical Annex in lieu of the Staff Appraisal
Report are also attached.
14.     Agreements Reached.   The  following principal agreements were
reached at negotiations:    (a)  IDA's total road flood rehabilitation
project is expected to last three years; (b) DOR would employ consultants
to design and supervise the works to be implemented in subsequent years;
(c) the rehabilitation works to be undertaken under the project will be
selected and carried out according to criteria agreed between HMG and IDA;
(d) HMG will ensure that adequate funds will be allocated for
implementation and maintenance of all project works; and (e) HMG will
advise IDA annually on specific funding arrangements for flood
rehabilitation works by other donors prior to presentation to IDA of each
year's priority work program.
15.     Credit  effectiveness  conditions  would  be  that:         (i) all
effectiveness conditions for cofinancing arrangements for the provision of
the Program Engineering Manager (PEN), other than the effectiveness of the
DCA have been met; (ii) the PEM has been employed; and (iii) an adequate
number of qualified staff have been assigned by DOR to work with the PEN.
16.     Benefits.    Although  the  Nepalese  are  resilient  to  natural
disasters, they have been unable to maintain normal levels of economic
activity after the 1987 floods.   The proposed project would hasten the
return to normalcy and improve the flow of goods and services including
imports/exports to dhina and India, movement of perishables to markets and
resumption of passenger traffic.   The economic benefits, although not
calculated, are likely to be substantial. The project would also help HNG
plan for and improve its response to natural disasters.
17.     Risks.  The main risk relates to further damages that might occur
due to unpredictable geologicel events or floods, and the difficulty of
finding cost-effective permanent solutions. This issue will be addressed
at the final design stage and reasonable and pragmatic trade-offs will be
developed by the consultants.   Another risk would be DOR's capacity to
implement the project within the agreed implementation period. This has
been addressed through the provision of adequate inputs of technical
assistance by expatriate and local consultants and the PEM.

18.     Recommendatio.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

ROAD FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
A.  MACKGRUD
1.      The  geography  and  climate  of  Nepal  make  annual  flooding
practically inevitable.   Nepal has a rugged topography with altitude
varying from about 300m in the Terai (the southern plains) to more than
8,000m in the Himalayas. The central and northern regions are dissected
by deep valleys with rivers and streams running generally from north to
south and draining into the Terai.   The hills and mountains in this
geologically young area are geomorphically active and their slopes
unstable.   The Terai is flat, slow to drain and exposed to uncontrolled
man-made structures, with farmers deliberately blocking water courses and
cross-drainage structures to divert water for irrigation. There are few
countries in the world where road construction and maintenance are as
difficult as in Nepal. The hilly terrain, with steep slopes, flat river
beds, deep gorges and flash floods are obvious constraints and complicate
further the structural permanence of the country's road network.
2.      Nepal receives 80% of its annual rainfall  (1,500 - 5,000 mm)
during the monsoon season (June-September). During July and August, when
heavy rainfall coincides with peaks from snowmelt and glacial effects in
China and the Himalayas, catchment areas of streams and rivers experience
exceptionally heavy flows that carry large sediment loads which encourage
erosion and flooding    Also,  monsoon rains generate interlinked and
successive geodynamic phenomena along rivers, and cause landslides,
torrents, and blocking up of river beds. Heavily loaded streams wash out
point bars at the banks, cause soil erosion landslides and generate
scouring and deposit new point-bars. As a result, continued sedimentation
encourages meandering and braiding of rivers, and creates changes in their
courses bringing them closer to bridge abutments and road embankments and
creating the need for new works because of changes in river courses.
3.       The 1987 Honsoon Floods.   The floods resulting from the 1987
monsoon were the worst in the last 20 years. Flooding affected the road
infrastructure in the Central and Eastern Development Regions extensively
and brought road transport to a halt along the East-West Highway and from
the border with China to the north to the border with India, in the south.
Damages occurred due to heavy and continuous rainfall from July 30 to
August  12,  1987.    It was reported that while in the Terai,  normal
precipitation during July varies between 300 and 350mm, and 250 to 450mm
in the Hills, during July 1987 actual precipitation in these areas reached
500mm and 1,200mm, respectively.



- 12 -
4.      The  main  damage  in  the  Terai  was  the  failure  of  river
channelization,  protection  and  rivet  bank  stabilization  works  at
approaches to bridges, culverts and road embankments and other drainage
structures, because of heavy scour, as well as changes in the stream and
river courses.   In the Hills and in the northern part of the Central
Development Region, damage was due to geological and other interlinked
geodynamic phenomena such as successive damming up and breaking through
caused by landslides in the upstream catchment areas of rivers, resulting
in the failure of protection works and washout of road sections.
5.      The nlood Damage.  Floods and landslides affected 651,000 people
in 51 out of 75 districts. It is estimated that some 16,000 families lost
their houses and crops and that about 37,000 acres of cultivated land were
damaged. The resulting floods and landslides also caused loss of human
lives (328), injuries (202), and loss of head of cattle (110) country-
wide. The combination of these exceptional rains with impaired drainage in
river channels, due to landslides and flash flooding from major streams
and rivers, caused widespread damage of varying degrees of severity to
dams, check dams, embankments, irrigation canal systems, and protection
schemes and hydro-electric projects.
6.      Road  Infrastructure Damage.    Following  the  recession of the
floods, DOR, with assistance from its district and zonal offices, prepared
an overall assessment of damages and reconstruction needs in the road sub-
sector. It is estimated that about 350 km of roads of various categories
and 106 bridges, culverts and other cross-drainage structures have been
affected at 40 different locations country-wide.   According to DOR's
preliminary assessments, the cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction
=iorks is estimated at US$30.0 million, of which US$15.0 million would be
needed for roads, US$12.0 million for bridges, culverts and other cross-
drainage structures, and US$3.0 million for flood protection works. These
estimates exclude the cost of damage to projects under construction or
maintenance contracts at the time of the flood.
7.      Government's ResMonse to the Flood Damage.  HKG, assisted by the
donor community, provided immediate relief to the affected population,
notably food, shelter, medicine and construction materials. Utilizing the
Armed  Forces,  HMG  has  initiated  temporary  works  of  clearance,
reconstruction, and realignment of sections of the Arniko Highway which
suffered severe destruction and washouts.  DOR has spent a large portion
of its annual emergency reconstruction budget for protection works in the
Sunkosi River and for clearing of landslides.



- 13 -
8.      HMG  also  sought  and  received  assistance  for  flood  damage
assessment.   As a result, by November 1987, DOR had at its disposal a
flood disaster Appraisal Report for the Arniko Highway (section from km 62
to km 87). The report was prepared by Swiss consultants under contract to
Swiss Association for Technical Assistance (SATA). The Swiss Development
Cooperation (SDC) has already committed funds for studies and selected
works on the Arniko Highway (Lamosangu to Barabise) and on the Lamosangu
to Jiri Road. IDA and ADB were also approached in January 1988 for flood
rehabilitation assistance.   In addition,  the U.K. Government  (through
ODA), which has been involved in the construction and maintenance of roads
in Nepal, has assisted in verifying and assessing damages in the Terai and
along the East-West Highway.   HMG will advise IDA annually on specific
arrangements for funding of flood rehabilitation works by other donors
prior to the presentation to IDA of each year's priority work program.
B. IDA'S RESPONSE AND STRAIfG
9.      In response to HMG's request, IDA fielded a mission to prepare and
appraise a project for IDA financing. The proposed project is the first
flood disaster relief project for road infrastructure to be financed in
Nepal. Given IDA's long-standing development role in the transport sector
in Nepal, its involvement would support HMG's objective of carrying out
its post-flood rebabilitation program effectively and would be a catalyst
for participation by other donors quickly and positively.
10.     For the road sub-sector, IDA's response and strategy has been to:
(i) help HMG to identify and prepare an emergency reconstruction and
rehabilitation program; (ii) coordinate the mobilization of resources
required for the program through contacts with major multilateral agencies
(UNDP, ADB) as well as bilateral ones (ODA, SDC) to finance part of the
program; and (iii) ensure that priority is given to repairs which are
needed to re-establish to economic activities and those that facilitate
resumption of the flow of goods and services.
C.  DEAILED PROJECT DESCRS PT10
11.     Objectives.  By the end of 1987, DOR had compiled a detailed list
of damages and reconstruction needs for the country's road infrastructure.
Project components were therefore selected from DOR's damage assessment
list with the aim to:  (i) deliver immediate assistance to DOR to repair,
rebuild  or  replace  priority  components  of  flood-damaged  road
infrastructure;  (ii) help finance the first three years' works of the
program ensuring that priority is given to elements which would facilitate
resumption of road transport activities; (iii) help DOR accelerate
implementation of urgently needed schemes to protect investments that
survived the 1987 flood; and (iv) develop and implement a post-monsoon
damage monitoring system which would enable DOR, in the future, to assess
and respond quickly and effectively to urgent damage repair and
rehabilitation needs.



- 14 -
12.     Components.  The proposed project, estimated at US$18.5 million,
would comprise priority components of HMG's program to rehabilitate
flood-affected roads and ancillary structures, and would include:
(a) ReDair. Reconstruction and Limited New Construction of Flood
Protection Works (USS2.4 million).   These works would encompass
guide bunds, gabion walls, embankments, channelization, gabion
spurs, as well as protection of bridges (abutments, piers,
wingwalls) and approaches to road embankments.   The majority of
these schemes would be  located along   the East-West Highway
between km 0 and km 240. Protection works would also be required
downstream from Lamosangu, on the Arniko Highway, to protect
sections of the road which survived the 1987 flood impact. About
2,000 running meters of guide bunds, 160,000 m3 of channelization
and 35,000 m3 of gabion walls and spurs, toe walls and other
protection structures would be built and/or rebuilt under the
project.
(b)  Repair. Reconstruction and Llmited Ny C_onstruction of Cross-
Drainage  Structures  (USS3.8  million).    Cross -drainage  works
financed  under   the  project  would   include  repairs  and
reconstruction of bridges and culverts as well as new construction
of culverts and causeways. Repair works would be limited to eight
bridges and four culverts, and reconstruction to four bridges.
Three of these bridges would be located in the Kathmandu Valley.
New construction would be limited to two causeways (240 meters)
and one new slab culvert of 18m.  New construction works would
replace structures washed out as a result of changes in stream and
river courses. The Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT) and DOR
have placed high priority on the immediate reconstruction of the
Kathmandu  Valley  bridges.    These  bridges  span  river/stream
channels varying between 45 and 80m and are closed to vehicular
traffic causing substantial inconvenience to urban transport. The
project would thus provide for the reconstruction of three
priority bridges in the Kathmandu Valley as two-lane reinforced
concrete bridges, and a fourth bridge on the Tribhuvan Highway
between Kathmandu and Thankot.
(c) Repair. Reconstruction and UomradinM of Roads (USSl1.0 million).
The project would upgrade and strengthen selected sections of two
roads, namely Tribhuvan Highway (sections totalling 13 km between
Kathmandu and Naubise) and parts of the Arniko Highway from km 62
to km 87,  respectively.    Road works would include compacted
filling of embankment breaches and washouts, the resectioning of
eroded embankments as well as the restoration of road shoulders
and the repair and strengthening of damaged pavements. Upgrading
work on sections of the Kathmandu-Naubise Road would also include
widening co 'le existing roadway while retaining the existing
alignment .,hin lts present right-of-way. The severe landslides
that affected  the Arniko  Highway have completely interrupted
vehicular traffic to the town of Barabise and north to China. At



- 15 -
present, the road is only passable up to km 81. Between km 82 and
87 there are a number of stretches where the road has been washed
out completely for several hundred met.ers.   The project would
therefore provide for the reconstruction of sections of the road
to reopen it for thru-traffic up to km 114 (Kodari on the border).
(d) Provision of Technical Assis_ance Services WUSS1.3 million). The
project would provide technical a&sistance for consultant services
by expatriate and local consultants and some equipment.   These
services would include:   (i) provision of an expatriate Program
Engineering Manager (PEM) attached to the office of the Chief
Engineer of DOR (CE/DOR); and (ii) consulting services for design
and supervision by expatriate and/or local consultants.   Draft
terms of reference were reviewed and discussed w'-th DOR in the
field and were finalized at negotiations.
13.     It is estimated that DOR would require about 40 manmonths input by
the PEM and about 315 manmonths input by design and supervision
consultants (11 manmonths by expatriate and 304 manmonths by local
consultants).
D. PROJECT INFLEMENTATION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
14.     Orxanization.   DOR would have overall responsibility for project
planning and implementation. DOR comes under the MWT and is headed by the
CE/DOR.    The  department  was  reorganized  in  1984  and  has  remained
substantially unchanged since then except for the creation of a planning
and monitoring unit. its organization in the field presently consists of
5 regional, 11 zonal, and 29 district engineers and it is responsible for
the planning, design, construction, maintenance and administration of the
road network.
15.     Given the emergency nature of the project and the recognized
limitations of DOR, it is necessary to reinforce the department to cope
with the workload during the three-year implementation of the project.
This project provides for a full-time PEN to assist the CE/DOR in the
implementation, and monitoring of the project. DOR will assign assistant
engineers as counterparts to the PEM.   The project would also provide
consultants for design, supervision and contract administration.   They
would also advise CE/DOR on bid evaluation and awards of contracts.
16.     In spite of the heterogeneous nature of the works, the variety of
operations to be undertaken, and the geographical distribution of sub-
project sites over large areas during the design phase, DOR. would package
all works on an area basis in such a way as to realize certain 'economies
of scale' during design and construction supervision.   This would imply
that several small-scale repair/restoration and reconstruction/replacement
works could be covered by one contract instead of letting numerous small
contracts.



- 16 -
17.     Sub-Project Selection Criteria.   In the final selection of sub-
projects, project works would be selected consistent with criteria
satisfactory to IDA, such that:
(a) sub-projects should be the direct consequence of the 1987 flood,
which if not attended to, would seriously endanger or diminish the
effectiveness of road and ancillary structures;
(b) no deferred maintenance would be included;
(c) new construction works should be either to protect existing
structures or required as a consequence of the flood (e.g., works
at locations where new river courses or landslides render their
construction mandatory);
(d) rehabilitated and/or reconstructed works should be simple to
construct and maintain by district offices;
(e) reconstruction works would restore pavements and structures to
their original specifications or such other specifications,
including necessary additions or alterations, as may be warranted
to ensure their optimal performance and integrity over a
reasonable life;
(f) no other external source of finance is available; and
(g) the works have been reviewed by the PEH and approved by the
CE/DOR.
18.     Project Costs and Financing.   The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$18.5 million with a foreign exchange component of US$7.0
million or 38% of total cost.  Identifiable taxes and duties are US$0.9
million and the total project cost, net of taxes and duties is US$17.6
million equivalent.   The proposed IDA credit of US$15.5 million would
finance about 84% of the total project cost, net of taxes and duties. HMG
will provide US$2.5 million as counterpart funds and UNDP would provide
technical assistance funds of US$0.5. HKG would pass on the proceeds of
the Credit to MWT and DOR as budgetary allocations;   HKG would also
provide adequate funding to enable DOR to implement and maintain all works
under the project.
19.     The following table outlines in detail the project cost estimates.
Base costs estimated for the project are in June 1988 prices, and physical
contingencies, where applicable, range between 5-10%. Price contingencies
on the foreign expenditures have been estimated on the basis of IDA
forecasts for international inflation at 3.0% for 1988 through 1990 and at
3.5% for 1991 and thereafter; for domestic expenditures, they are
estimated at 11.0% for 1988, at 7.0% for 1989 and at 6.0% for 1990 and
thereafter.

20.     Retroactive Financing.  Consultant services and selected priority
sub-projects on the East-West Highway would be executed during the first
construction season (March-June, 1988) and are proposed to be financed
retroactively in an amount not to exceed US$1.5 million.   HMG and IDA
Egreed to sole source hiring of an expatriate firm to review the designs
and supervise construction of these projects until the end of June 1988.
Timely completion of the selected sub-projects is urgent, as these would
protect investments that survived the 1987 flood.   these sub-projects
would be limited to:
(a) reconstruction of guide bunds and channelization works at Biring
Bridge Km 23+190 (US$0.36 million);
(b) protection and repair of guide bunds with gabions including
channelization works at Kankai Bridge Km 30+000 (US$0.12 million);
(c) river bank protection works and construction of spur with gabions
at Bakraha Bridge Km 57+000 (US$0.06 million);
(d) construction of a culvert/causeway including protection works
upstream and downstream at Bhaune Bridge Km 72+800(US$0.46
million);
(e) protection of bridge abutments and river bank protection works by
gabions plus backfilling at Chisang River (Bhanwari Bridge) Km
75+000 (US$0.02 million);
(f) reconstruction of guide bunds including boulder pitching and
gabion works and reconstruction of a slab culvert at Mahaul
km 145+000 (US$0.24 million); and
(g) construction of guide bunds including gabion matting at Balan
Bridge Km 194+000 (US$0.19 million).
21.     Procurement.        Contracts   for   civil   works   requiring
equipment-intensive operations (e.g. road rehabilitation/reconstruction)
and worth more than US$2.0 million each would be suitable for
international competitive bidding (ICB). Two contracts worth a total of
about US$9.5 million would be let on this basis, since they would be large
enough to attract international bidders. A preferential margin of 7 1/2%
would be allowed for local contractors in evaluating such bids.
Procurement arrangements for these contracts will be in accordance with
the guidelines set out in "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits'
and will include prequalification of contractors. Miscellaneous items of
equipment such as two four-wheel drive vehicles and office equipment (two
personal computers, typewriters and a copying machine) aggregating
US$72,000  will  be  purchased  by  prudent  shopping.    Procurement  of
consulting services would be done according to "Guidelines for Use of
Consultants World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency.'



- 19 -
22.     ICB would not be appropriate for all civil works contracts of
value  less than US$2.0 million each because:   (i) the program would
involve work at a large number of sites scattered throughout Nepal;
(ii) all contracts would be of a relatively low value; (iii) the dispersal
of sites and small contract values would make impossible the packaging of
works into single contracts of sufficient value to attract foreign
bidders; (iv) most of the work would be labor-intensive, involving a
minimum of equipment, and could easily and economically be organized by
local contractors; and (v) the time involved in letting contracts through
ICB would delay the start of works.   These contracts totalling US$6.6
million, have been tailored to respond to the emergency nature of the
project and would ba let through the existing arrangements for local
competitive bidding (LCB) among prequalified Categories A & B contractors.
These procedures have been found satisfactory to IDA. Review and approval
by IDA prior to award would be required for all contracts estimated to
cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more.
23.     Disbursements.  The project would be implemented over three years
with disbursements extending over four years, ending June 30, 1992. The
proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against eligible expenditures
(net of taxes and duties) as follows: 90% of expenditures on civil works,
including construction materials; 100% of the foreign expenditures on
directly   imported  equipment   (vehicles,   personal  computers  and
miscellaneous  office  equipment);  and  100%  of  foreign  and  local
expenditures incurred for consultant services. No disburseme.its would be
made for expenditures incurred by Nepal's military for the realignment and
reopening of the Arniko Highway. Full documentation would be sent to IDA
in support of withdrawal applications except for small works contracts
costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of  US$100,000  each.    For  such
expenditures,  withdrawal applications would be supported by certified
statements of expenditures (SOEs). The documentation in support of SOEs
would be retained by DOR and made available for review to IDA
representatives on request. This documentation will be subject to audit.
24.     A  Special  Account  of  SDR  1.45  million  (US$  2.0  million
equivalent), equal to approximately six months disbursements, would be
established at the Nepal Rastra Bank. HMG would authorize DOR through MWT
to draw and utilize the funds in the Special Account to facilitate payment
of eligible expenditures.
25.     Accounts and Audit.   DOR would maintain separate accounts and
records for the project.  For all expenditures for which withdrawals would
be made on the basis of SOEs, DOR would arrange to maintain separate
records and accounts. Auditors acceptable to IDA would audit the project
accounts each year. The auditors' report, together with their comments,
would be sent to IDA within 12 months and certified copies of the
unaudited accounts as soon as available, but not later than six months
after the close ov each fiscal year.   Audit reports would include a
separate opinion as to whether the funds disbursed against: SOEs have been

used for the purposes for which they were provided.   Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the accounting and auditing requirements
outlined above would be met.
B.  ACTI 0   RNED
26.     The following principal agreements were reached at negotiations:
(a)  the project will be implemented over three years and all works to
be financed under the project will be the consequence of the 1987
flood (para 23);
(b)  HMG will implement sub-projects on the basis of selection criteria
discussed and agreed with IDA (para 17);
(c)  retroactive financing of up to SDR 1.1 million for priority sub-
projects would be for expenditures incurred after March 1, 1988
(para 20);
(d)  HMG will provide adequate annual budget allocations to enable DOR
to implement and maintain all works completed under the first-,
second- and third-year implementation programs (para 18);
(e)  DOR will  employ  the services of consultants  for design and
supervision of sub-projects to be implemented in subsequent
construction seasons (para 21);
(f)  HMG will advise IDA annually on specific arrangements for funding
of flood rehabilitation works by other donors prior to the
presentation to IDA of each year's priority work program (para 8).
27.     Credit effectiveness conditions are that:
(a)  all effectiveness conditieas of cofinancing arrangements with UNDP
for provision of the PEN, other than the effectiveness of the DCA,
have been met (para 18);
(b)  the PEM has been employed (para 15); and
(c)  adequate numbers of qualified and experienced technical staff have
been assigned by DOR to work with the PEN (expected to be at least
three Assistant Engineers) (para 15).
