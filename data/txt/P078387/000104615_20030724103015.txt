I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project supports Government's 10-year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) by focusing on
rehabilitation of the most priority link within the Central Transport Corridor area and improving
institutional capacity to manage road program, assets and services on a more commercial basis. The
primary objective of the proposed project is to: (a) improve access to economically productive Central
Transport Corridor area; (b) support actions aimed at further strengthening management and financing
systems for sustainable maintenance of the road network; and (c) reduce poverty and promote awareness
of HIV/AIDS program.

The Central Transport Corridor is one of the nine transport corridors identified in the strategic plan,
which interconnects most parts of the country and is critical to promoting trade and investment by
opening up areas of main economic activities, such as mining, tourism, agriculture and manufacturing.
The Corridor serves Western and North-Western parts of the country as well as the neighboring land
locked countries of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. The Government
accords high priority to the rehabilitation and upgrading of the sections along the Central Corridor.

In addition to upgrading section of the Central Transport Corridor, the project focuses on: (a) preparing
feasibility studies and detailed designs of trunk roads located within the Central Transport Corridor area;
(b) improving maintenance management by setting up performance based contracts; (c) providing
technical assistance for road sector management capacity building; and (e) conducting poverty impact
baseline studies and HIV/AIDS awareness program.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Tentative components have been identified and are specified below. (A map showing road
components of CTCRP is attached.)

(a)      Civil works and Supervision of upgrading to bitumen standard of Singida-Shelui Road.
Singida-Shelui road (110 km) leads from the region's headquarters to the border of Tabora region,
serving a number of intermediate administrative and trade centers as Iguguno, Misigiri and Shelui. It
belongs to the central corridor of the national trunk road system. The existing roadway is gravel surfaced
(7 to 10 m wide, including shoulders). Design features are poor and road safety is below standard. The
components include:
(b)      Feasibility study and detailed design for upgrading of Singida-Babati-Minjingu road (220km).
(c)      Institutional capacity building to TANROADS/MCT/MOCT Zanzibar

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Civil works will only be financed for the Singida-Shelui road. Feasbility studies and other design studies
will be financed for various roads both on the mainland and Zanzibar.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: Civil works and services for upgrading to bitumen standard will be financed for only the
Singida-Shelui road. An EA, EMP and RAP have been prepared for this road. Environmental clauses will
be included in civil works contracts as recommended in the Guidelines for Environmental Management,
Design and Implementation of Transport Projects (September 2001).

The project is financing the feasibility and detailed design studies for the following two roads segments:
Singida-Babati-Minjingu (220 km) and Dodoma-Babati (263 km) whose safeguards documents (EA and
RAP) will be modeled after the Singida-Shelui road.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and

                                                       3
                                                                                                        ISDS



describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The following direct and indirect negative environmental impacts can arise from road rehabilitation and
   maintenance works: land take, dust and noise, generation of sediment, river pollution and scour damage
   (river damage extraction), safety hazards (quarry faces, blasting, etc.), health hazards, visual impacts.
   The following socioeconomic impacts can arise from road rehabilitation and maintenance works:
   permanent and temporary land take resulting in involuntary resettlement and/or compensation, land
   tenure impacts, public health impacts, cultural impacts, and changes in local population's way of life
   and/or exploitation of natural resources, etc. These were determined and assessed during preparation of
   road specific EAs and RAP, which is currently underway for the Singida-Shelui road.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
n/a

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
n/a

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
n/a

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The environmental assessment and resettlement action plan for the Singida-Shelui road has been
prepared. The EA has been reviewed and cleared by ASPEN. A RAP was prepared and submitted for
review by ASPEN and is currently under revision by the Government. They will both be submitted for
approval and disclosed prior to Project appraisal.

Safeguards isssues will be included in the tender documents and TOR for consultants for all feasibility
and deisgn studies. An environmental specialist from TANROADS will monitor the implementation of
the EMP and RAP. Safeguards compliance will be a condition for interim and final approval of
payments.

The Ministry of Transport and Communications has already prepared Guidelines for Environmental
Management, Design and Implementation of Transport Projects (September 2001), which will provide
the overall framework for preparing road specific EAs.

For the Singida-Babati-Minjingu (220km) and Dodoma-Babati (263 km) segments, which are to be
studied at the feasibility level and then designed in detail under the credit, environmental and
resettlement work (and any other safeguards work) will be done as the road designs evolve. The
description of the studies for these roads will incorporate the environmental and social impact planning
as tasks to be undertaken, as well as the capacities to be included in the study teams. The impact
planning will be done following the safeguards policies of the Bank, and to the same standards that are
used and approved for the Singuida-Shelui Road, whose RAP will, serve as a template. Should it be
found that any safeguard policies are triggered as the road designs evolve, the appropriate safeguard
instrument will be prepared and sent for review, comment and approval to the Africa Region's Safeguards
team (ASPEN). Once approved, said document(s) will be disclosed in country and at the InfoShop,
World Bank headquarters. The DCA will also make this reference.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
During preparation of the Project, initial drafts of the proposed Project have been discussed in meetings

                                                       4
                                                                                                        ISDS



with representatives of various sector ministries, including the MOW, MCT and PORALG. MOW has
organized and will organize the required consultations with the key stakeholders. MOW and MCT will
also play a pro-active role in interacting directly with law makers and users associations, as well as any
dissemination and public opinion to be referred through the media. A comprehensive process of
information sharing, consultation and collaboration will be taking place during preparation and
implementation.

A series of workshops and seminars have been proposed by MOW during the course of preparing
associated studies. The participatory process will play an important role in the formulation and
implementation of proposed institutional reform measures, and definition of program priorities. MOW is
already applying this participatory process in presenting consultants' report on the Urgent Road
Rehabilitation Program and 10-Year Road Sector Development Program in Dar es Salaam in March,
2000 and May 2002. For disclosure see Section II.D.3.

For the environmental and social safeguards issues within the Program, participation and consultation
will be a core element in the formulation and implementation of any assessment prepared. For the
Guidelines document, participation and consultation of various stakeholders within the sector and
environmental community culminated in a validation workshop in December 2000 to discuss and provide
feedback on the Guidelines. The Guidelines also make strong recommendations on the participatory
process within the EAs and SAs to be prepared for each individual road segment

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
         in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
         similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
         safeguard issues.
