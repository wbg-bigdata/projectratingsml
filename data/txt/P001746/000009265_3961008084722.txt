MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IDA TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI FOR A
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali, for the equivalent of SDR 9 million (US$ 13.4 million)
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Vocational Education and
Training Consolidation Project.
2.     Country Background:  Mali's GNP per capita of US$ 250 (1994) is among the lowest in
the world, with average annual GNP per capita growth limited to 1 % between 1988-1993.
Prospects for future growth of GNP per capita have been constrained by high fertility levels and
population growth, a narrow human and physical resource base, variable climate, and inappropriate
macroeconomic policies. However, the devaluation of the West African Franc (CFAF), combined
with comprehensive macro- and sectoral reform programs (aimed at economic liberalization, private
sector and human resources development, and agricultural productivity gains and diversification),
set the conditions for renewed economic growth, which is currently forecast at 5 % per year between
1995 and 1997. As a result, private sector job opportunities are improving, in both rural and urban
areas. More specifically, significant growth in production and employment are expected over the
medium term in the following areas: textiles, agro-industry, simple import substitution,
construction, public works, transport, hotels and tourism, crafts, and small enterprise development.
3.    Labor Market:  With a total population of around 9 million people, the active labor force
is estimated at 3.6 million. The agriculture sector absorbs about 75% of the labor force, although
underemployment leading to urban migration is common. Manufacturing, construction and artisanal
occupations represent about 10% of the labor force, with the services sector accounting for another
*15 %. The entire modern sector is estimated at just 14,000 private sector workers, 12,000 parastatal
employees, and 37,000 civil servants, while the informal sector accounts for an estimated 700,000
workers (90% of the non-agricultural labor force). Approximately 1 million Malians work abroad,
although job opportunities in destination countries have declined.  Under the most optimistic
assumptions, growth over the short-term of formal private and public sector employment (currently
around 1,300 jobs per year) will not absorb the stock of existing unemployed and the annual inflow
of 80,000 newcomers into the labor market. Due to the momentum of population growth, this
annual inflow into the labor market will rise to 110,000 by 2005 and 140,000 by 2015. The
agricultural and informal sectors are the most dynamic and promising areas for employment growth
- education and training programs must reflect this reality.
4.    Education and Training:   Mali's primary education enrollment rate of 35% (1995) is
among the lowest in the world, as is the adult literacy rate of about 20%. The secondary education
enrollment rate is just 6% (1995), with general and technical/vocational (VET) education enrolling
27,500 and 16,950 students, respectively. Nine public VET institutions enroll approximately 7,400
(44%) of these VET students, with another 9,550 students (56%) enrolled in 27 publicly-financed
private training centers. Higher education enrolls 9,600 students. In addition, 24 public and 13
private skills upgrading centers exist. Public centers are associated with specific ministries and
train civil servants and parastatal employees, while private centers offer training in the services
sector (e.g. computers and accounting), but rarely in technical/industrial skills. Informal sector



2
training is the most widespread form of vocational training - an estimated 45,000 apprentices work
in Bamako, learning to become craftsmen in over 70 professional trades. Training costs are paid by
master artisans in exchange for labor. In sum, the picture is of a severely underdeveloped primary
education sub-sector, with low quality secondary and higher education, and unstructured, low-
technology skills training mainly in the informal sector.
5.    Public spending on VET averaged 10% of total education expenditures in 1995, up from
7% between 1987-1992 (compared to 14% for general secondary). In 1995 47% of public VET
financing went to private VET providers, based on per student subsidies. Unit costs were an
estimated US$ 325 in 1994, varying from US$ 170 for administration/finance to US$ 600 for civil
works. Cost recovery is not practiced. About 50% of VET expenditures goes to personnel, 35%
for equipment, materials, and maintenance, and 15% for student scholarships. In theory, employers
also contribute to in-service training through an "employment services tax", equal to 1% of
payroll, but this is primarily for job placement and operating costs of the National Manpower and
Employment Office (ONMOE), with only limited financing of skills upgrading.
6.     Project Rationale:   The project aims to provide basic professional and technical skills
needed for Mali's economic development and demanded in the labor market. Indeed, Mali has one
of the least-skilled labor forces in the world. The vast majority of the active labor force has had no
schooling whatsoever, adult literacy is estimated at just 20%, and the mean years of schooling for
adults aged 25 years or more is just 0.3 years. Development of primary education is, therefore, the
first priority for improving the quality of Mali's labor force (and will be supported with IDA
financing for an Education Sector Investment Program now under preparation). Beyond primary
education, the labor force needs basic professional and technical skills - literacy and numeracy
alone are not enough.  The project would respond to labor market demand for skills in
construction, agro-processing, maintenance, mechanics, electricity, metal work and mining.
7.     There are three alternatives to the proposed investment in basic professional skills: the
importation of required skills from abroad, the financing of skills training abroad, and/or letting the
local private sector determine which skills are to be developed. The first alternative is expensive,
politically and socially volatile, and ineffective in developing local capacities and providing
employment for Malians, an important Government objective. The second option was rejected
because it has higher estimated costs (tuition, travel, living expenses, etc.) and lower benefits (risk
of emigration and training unrelated to the Malian labor market). The third option is neither
realistic nor viable without Government involvement - the private sector in Mali is underdeveloped,
the size of enterprises is small, trade associations are poorly developed, managerial competencies
and foresight to finance and organize training are lacking, and private training costs are high due to
the inability to benefit from economies of scale. Government involvement in VET is therefore
necessary.
8.     More specifically, the proposed project would address the following issues in the vocational
education and training subsector:
* Formal pre-service VET is poorly adapted to labor market demand. In 1995, two-
thirds of VET students were enrolled in tertiary sector training (office and secretarial
skills), for which the labor market is saturated. Meanwhile, there is unmet labor market
demand for skills in construction, agro-processing, maintenance, mechanics, electricity,
metal work, mining and tourism, as confirmed by seven labor market and training studies
conducted during project preparation. Between 1988-1993 75% of all new modern sector



jobs were industrial/technical, and labor market demand for industrial skills is growing as a
result of a resurgence of the economy following the CFAF devaluation, as evidenced by
rising wages for skilled labor in these areas;
* The quality of VET is very low. Particularly at the Certificate of Professional Training
(CAP) level, training facilities are obsolete, in disrepair (equipment of 1962 Soviet origin),
and exacerbated by overcrowding. The quality of instruction is poor (40% of instructors
are uncertified), while VET curricula are rigid, excessively theoretical, and poorly adapted
to the Malian economy. Low quality training means low productivity and employability,
thus defeating VET's economic purpose;
* Geographic over-concentration prevails, with 90% of VET capacity in Bamako,
although 40% of the formal labor market and most of the informal labor market are outside
the capital;
* Management of VET is inflexible and lacking in market orientation, with insufficient
leeway accorded to mobilize and allocate resources (financial, human and material)
efficiently. Employers do not participate in curriculum design, school management,
financing or practical training;
* Skills upgrading services are insufficient and inadequate. Contrary to pre-service
VET, informal sector apprenticeship training is strong in practical skills but weak in theory
and locked in a low-technology loop. Besides a few NGO-supported programs, informal
sector training is entirely unstructured and purely production-based, and most master
artisans are illiterate. In the modern private sector, its small overall size, the low quality of
goods produced, and the predominance of small firms result in weak enterprise training
capacity;
* Limited resources and institutional capacity at the National Manpower and Employment
Office (ONMOE) result in inadequate and unused labor market information. Data from
employer surveys, VET trainee tracer studies, and informal sector surveys are rarely
collected and analyzed. Labor market information which exist are not disseminated nor fed
back into programming of either pre-service or in-service VET training; producers and
users of labor market information are not linked.
* Finally, VET is underfunded and its financing is mismanaged. Insufficient resources
are allocated to materials and maintenance expenditures, and too much is spent on
scholarships. Informal sector apprenticeship training, which trains more youth than the
formal training system, receives no public financing whatsoever. Employers finance little,
if any, skills upgrading.  There has been no significant investment financing since the
Bank's first education project in 1973.
9.     Project Objectives:  The project's development objectives are to promote market-oriented,
labor-force skills through improved quality and supply of vocational education and training
services. Over the implementation of the project, approximately 40,000 workers and apprentices
would benefit from in-service skills upgrading, while another 6,000 youth would benefit from pre-
service vocational training. It is expected that at least 75% of project trainees would be employed
within three years of training, with incomes sufficient to generate at least a 16% social rate of
return to project investments. Increased coherence and complementarity between training,



4
employment and physical capital investments are key factors for achieving Mali's overall
development objectives of growth, human resources development and poverty reduction.
10.    Project Description:   The project would improve the supply, quality and relevance of
vocational training for skills demanded in the labor market, in addition to developing the
institutional capacity to identify those skills and adapt training as needed. The project's cost of
US$ 22.9 million (including taxes and contingencies) would include three components:
(1) Improve Qualitvyand Relevance of Pre-service VET (US$ 9.2 million), through (i) civil works
and equipment investments to rehabilitate selected training streams (auto and electrical mechanics,
metalwork, maintenance, construction, woodworking and accounting), (ii) introduction of modular,
competency-based curricula emphasizing general skills and practical training, (iii) teacher upgrading
of pedagogical and practical skills, (iv) phasing out of obsolete training streams, and (v) improved
working conditions, equipment, training and TA for strengthened VET institutional capacity;
(2) Develop Sustainable In-Service VET Capacitv (US$ 12.0 million) through (i) the establishment
of a demand-driven, employer-supported and -managed Vocational Training Support Fund (VTSF),
to provide skills upgrading, apprenticeship and enterprise-based training,  as well as limited
equipment and material needs for private skills upgrading centers contracted to provide this
training, and (ii) the development of national skills upgrading and apprenticeship certification
standards for VET trainees; and
(3) Improve Labor Market Information (US$ 1.7 million) through the establishment of an
Employment and Training Observatory (ETO), which would gather, analyze and disseminate labor
market information for use by policymakers, VET administrators, employers and students. Project
support would include office equipment, training, labor market and employer surveys, and technical
assistance.
11.    Project components were explicitly designed as least-cost alternatives and include significant
government and beneficiary financial participation.
12.    Project Implementation:    The project would be managed through two structures: a
Component Coordination Unit (CCU) and the Vocational Training Support Fund. The CCU would
be responsible for project activities concerning pre-service VET (component 1) and the ETO
(component 3), including management of project resources and the preparation of financial
statements for audit for these two components.  It would be staffed by a Coordinator, two
specialists in accounting and procurement, and a secretary, and would be integrated at the Cabinet
level of the Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education (MESSRS). The National Department of
Technical Education and Vocational Training (DNETP) would be responsible for execution of pre-
service VET activities (component 1), while the ETO Director would be responsible for execution
of component 3. All civil works under the project would be delegated to AGETIPE, an effective,
IDA-financed public works NGO.
13.    The VTSF would be managed by a 16-member Management Committee (4 from the public
sector, 12 from the private sector--including employers, unions, artisans and NGOs), with daily
execution responsibilities delegated to an Executive Secretariat, headed by a General Director who
would be responsible for management of project resources pertaining to the VTSF and the
preparation of VTSF financial statements for audit. Its staff of eight professionals (including a
Women's Training Specialist) should be fully adequate for reviewing training requests, procuring
training providers and handling project finances. An important feature of the VTSF would be the
Government's introduction of a Vocational Training Tax which would ensure a sustainable source
of employer financing long after the project ends. This would be equivalent to 0.5% of the private



5
and parastatal sector payroll, and would be accompanied by a reduction of other payroll taxes so the
net fiscal burden on employers and labor costs would be unchanged. (Note: The National
Federation of Malian Employers has officially stated its support for this measure in a letter to the
Government.) The VTSF would be a non-profit agency whose financing would be exempt from
taxes. A comprehensive and detailed Project Implementation Plan and an Operations Manual for the
VTSF have been completed.
14.    Lessons Learned:  PCRs for the first three Mali education projects, and the Bank's VET
Policy Paper which reviewed experience in this sub-sector, suggest numerous lessons to be applied
to this project. (a) Public pre-employment training in secondary vocational schools may be justified
when employer and private training capacity is weak, but these programs require sufficient
recurrent cost funding and strong market orientation in planning and institutional responsiveness.
To ensure this market orientation, employer surveys and graduate tracer studies conducted during
project preparation would be continued during project execution, while firm Governmnent
commitments to provide increased recurrent cost financing and involve employers in school
management and curriculum design would enhance efficiency and quality. (b) Public and private
training institutions must function in the marketplace, and be adept at changing enrollments and
curricula to adjust to employment opportunities for graduates. This would be ensured through
application of flexible, labor market-based criteria for VTSF financing of skills upgrading activities,
which would be managed primarily by employers and artisans. (c) Financial diversification is
important for both sustainability and equity in sharing the costs and benefits of training.  The
introduction of the 0.5% of payroll Vocational Training Tax, which would provide up to 1/3 of
VTSF financing, plus the 25% beneficiary contribution for all VTSF-financed training (paid by
trainees, their employers or their sponsors), would ensure sustainability and introduce VET cost
recovery for the first time in Mali. (d) Reliable labor market information is necessary to ensure
VET market orientation. and would be provided by the Employment and Training Observatory, and
through additional studies to be financed under the VTSF and DNETP.
15.    Rationale for Bank Involvement:  Human resources development is one of the pillars of
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in Mali--presented to the Board on January 5, 1995--
and will remain so over the medium-term, complementing efforts to generate sustained broad-based
economic growth, while focusing on the needs of the most vulnerable.  Without a dramatic
improvement in education attainment and skills development, Mali cannot hope to generate or
sustain rates of growth needed to overcome poverty. The proposed project addresses this need
directly and is included as an essential investment operation in the CAS. Moreover, the Bank's
long experience in Malian training (dating from 1973), its sector work on the Malian Labor Code
(1992) and youth unemployment (1993), and its clear institutional VET policy, give the Bank a
comparative advantage in this sub-sector. Finally, the Bank's lead role in VET reform, now
supported actively by the French, the Canadians, and the ILO, argue for continued Bank
involvement.
16.   Agreed Actions:   The Government's formal agreement was obtained during negotiations
regarding a sub-sector VET policy framework, which includes a complete revision of all legal texts
pertaining to VET, the respect of enrollment capacity, and recurrent cost implications of both VET
and labor market investments. Conditions of effectiveness include: (a) enactment of revised VET
texts satisfactory to IDA; (b) establishment of the VTSF; (c) allocation of CFAF 95 million to the
ETO by the ONMOE to meet estimated operating costs for 1996; (d) transfer of staff to the ETO;
(e) recruitment of qualified project staff for the CCU and VTSF; (f) IDA approval of first-year
work programs and budgets for the VTSF and CCU, (g) Proof that appropriate offices acceptable to



6
IDA have been allocated to the VTSF; (h) Government and IDA approval of the Project
Implementation Plan; and (i) appointment of an external auditor. Conditions for disbursement are:
(a) for Component I (pre-service vocational training), proof that the Govermnent has obtained all
necessary authorizations for the civil works to be carried out under the project; and (b) for
component 2 (the vocational training support fund), adoption of all necessary legislative and
regulatory texts, acceptable to the Association, relating to the financing by employers of VTSF
activities.
17.    As part of the 1995-1997 Policy Framework Paper signed with the World Bank,
Government also agreed to review the implementation of the Labor Code with the aim of identifying
further areas of reform to allow more flexibility in the functioning of the labor market, following
substantial liberalization of the code in 1992 pertaining to employee hiring and dismissal, the role of
the National Manpower and Employment Office, and leave policies.
18.   Poverty Category:  Approximately one-half of project beneficiaries are expected to come
from the informal sector, which studies have shown to be primarily composed of poor,
marginalized workers. The project would make special efforts to see that women represent at least
40% of all in-service trainees, although specific quotas would not be applied.
19.   Environmental Aspects:    Category C. The project would finance rehabilitation and
limited new constructions.
20.    Program Objectives Category:   This would be a human resources development project,
with a particular focus on developing skills among relatively poor individuals working in the
informal sector, especially women, thereby improving their productivity and earnings.
21.    Participatory Approach:   This project was prepared in-country, with the task manager
located in the Resident Mission. This enabled extensive beneficiary participation, near exclusive
use of national consultants for preparatory studies, and close collaboration with Government
officials and other donors.  In addition to a three-person Government preparation team, a
"consultative group" for the project was established, including employers, artisans, NGOs,
women's associations, private training centers, unions and recent school graduates.  Weekly
meetings with the task manager during preparation resulted in firm ownership and commitment to
the project among the Borrower and intended project beneficiaries. In particular, the Operations
Manual for the proposed VTSF was drafted, revised and then finalized in concert with the
consultative group. With regard to project implementation, private sector beneficiary groups would
control the majority of votes on the VTSF Management Committee, with employers, unions,
artisans and NGOs all present. Furthermore, employers and unions share control of the Board of
Directors of the ONMOE, which would oversee the work of the ETO. Thus, both employers and
employees would be active participants in project execution, an essential condition for successful
VET and labor market investments.
22.    Benefits:    The first category of benefits would be econoniic.  VET trainees should
demonstrate improved vocational and entrepreneurial skills, thereby improving productivity,
employment prospects and earnings. On average, 8,000 workers and apprentices per year would
benefit from one month of in-service training, while another 1,200 VET students per year would
benefit from pre-service training over five years. For the proposed in-service training, the Bank has
estimated a social rate of return of 34%, with a minimum 10% rate of return conditional upon a
US$ 7 per month increase in earnings after training. For 2-year and 4-year VET streams proposed



7
for investment, the social rates of return are estimated at 13% and 17%, respectively. Sensitivity
analyses suggest that to achieve at least a 10% social rate of return among 2-year VET trainees, at
least 60% need to find a job within three years of graduation which pays at least CFAF 60,000 per
month (about US$ 120), while for 4-year VET trainees, at least 75% need to be employed within
three years of graduation, and earning at least CFAF 90,000 per month (about US$ 180). This is
highly probable given current employment and salary trends in economic sectors targeted by the
project.  Additional key assumptions underlying this analysis are continued positive macro-
economic performance (including a competitive exchange rate), and at least average levels of
rainfall (which directly affects overall economic growth and consumer purchasing power). The
second type of benefit would be institutional in nature. The project would strengthen the key
strategic functions of the DNETP, and put in place efficient procedures for the allocation and use of
public funds for both pre-service VET and skills upgrading. Cost recovery, private sector financing
and provision of training would increase, and involvement of employers in management of both pre-
service and in-service VET training would improve the system's responsiveness to labor market
demand. In addition, financial transparency would be ensured for the first time at the ONMOE.
Thirdly, the project offers social benefits. By targeting the training and development needs of
youth and workers outside of the formal education and training system, with a special effort aimed
at women, the project would improve equity, reduce social tensions, and contribute to urban and
rural poverty alleviation.
23.    Project Sustainability:  For the first time in Mali, employer contributions and beneficiary
cost recovery for in-service VET services would be institutionalized, providing significant VET
financing long after the project ends. Employers would contribute approximately CFAF 300 million
per year to the Vocational Training Support Fund through the 0.5% payroll tax for vocational
training. Training beneficiaries (or their employers or sponsors) would also pay 25% of the cost of
VTSF-financed training (10% for young apprentices). As for pre-service VET, while the economic
rationale for increased cost-recovery is apparent, this issue needs to be addressed for the sector as a
whole, particularly at the higher education level, before it can be introduced in the context of this
project (the Mali Education SIP will address this issue). In addition, employers and workers would
contribute CFAF 95 million each year for 100% financing of the operating costs of the ETO,
mobilized through the existing 1 % employment services tax. Additional recurrent costs linked to
investments in pre-service VET are estimated in nominal terms at CFAF 150 million, beginning in
1998, primarily for equipment maintenance, repairs and raw  materials.   Relative to  1995
expenditures this would be equivalent to an increase in real terms of 9% for pre-service VET
materials, of 4% in total VET expenditures, or 0.5% in total education spending. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that as of 1998 the Government would increase educational materials
financing to CFAF 60,000 per VET student, and to maintain this as a minimum for the duration of
project implementation; this increase should be covered primarily by reducing scholarship
expenditures, although some additional resources may be required.  Total VET unit costs (both
investment and recurrent) would increase to about USS 750 per year, equivalent to approximately
two times general secondary unit costs. This 2:1 ratio of VET to general secondary unit costs
conforms to international norms and reflects the added costs for equipment, materials, practical
training and smaller classes.
24.    Risks:  This is a medium-risk project. The greatest risk is exogenous: the possibility that
growth of the economy and of labor market demand for the skills to be developed under the project
will be insufficient. While current economic indicators provide grounds for optimism, Mali's
economy is vulnerable to changes in climate and international commodity prices. To minimize this
risk, the project would diversify training activities to cover a range of promising economic sectors -

slow growth in one sector may be offset by rapid growth in another. The second risk is political
and social pressure arising from increased numbers of basic education graduates, which hinders the
control of VET enrollment growth and the Government's ability to reduce and/or phase out training
streams no longer demanded in the labor market. This is being addressed through: revised,
transparent admissions policies being applied for the school year 1995-1996; a clear definition of
what constitutes VET's enrollment capacity; and the Government's ongoing public communications
program linked to the execution of the Education SECAL. Thirdly, there may be resistance within
the MESSRS to execute curricula reforms, and to involve employers in VET management. This is
being addressed by an ongoing, participatory training program for VET administrators and teachers
which covers labor market demand, curriculum requirements, teacher training, and school
management. A fourth risk is weak implementation capacity and delays in project start-up, which
are being addressed through a Project Preparation Facility to finance the recruitment and training of
project staff. the installation and training for both financial and project implementation monitoring
systems, the pilot testing of a range of training sub-projects under the VTSF, the development of
in-service training curricula, promotional activities to inform targeted groups about the project,
advance preparation of procurement documents and a project launch seminar. Finally, employers
may not be willing to play an active role in managing either pre-service or in-service VET. This
risk has been minimized through private sector involvement in the preparation and design of this
project, in particular with respect to the Vocational Training Support Fund (the private sector
would assume the presidency of the VTSF Management Committee).
Recommendation:   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

\1: The net present value is the sum that results when the discounted value of the expected costs of the investment are
deducted from the discounted value of the expected returns. In this table, for each year of the project, the streams of
costs and estimated benefits are discounted to their present value for that year using a 10 % discount rate, and then
this stream is discounted at 10% to present value terms for 1996. The NPV of total VET costs was calculated each
year by multiplying the NPV of social costs for individual VET trainees by the number of trainees for each training
stream, and then adding the NPVs for each stream together. Estimated social benefits are the differences in trainee
earnings before and after the training, used as a proxy for increased worker productivity. As with total VET costs,
the total NPV of VET benefits was calculated each year by multiplying the NPV of social benefits for individual
VET trainees by the number of trainees for each training stream, and then adding the NPBs for each stream together.
Subtracting the NPV of total VET costs from that of total VET benefits yields the NPV of net benefits, which is
solidly positive.
\2: Includes all project investment costs, incremental recurrent costs and opportunity costs.
\3: These calculations refer to the NPV of project benefits for each year's cohort of trainees.

Note on Portfolio Implementation Issues
1.    Overall portfolio performance is satisfactory and is expected to improve further in the aftermath of
the highly successful Country Portfolio Implementation review held in Bamako in November 1995. Action
plans were agreed between the Bank and the Government for addressing genenc as well as project specific
implementation issues. Two follow-up committees (with membership from all key ministries and
Departments as well as the Resident Mission) have been set up to monitor execution of these plans. One of
these committees is under the Prime Minster's Chairmanship.
2.     As of November 30, 1995, IDA's portfolio in Mali represented a total commitment of about US$
988.97 million (including cancellations of about US$ 10 million) with an undisbursed balance of US$
232.77 million. Three projects closed dunrng the year, leaving the portfolio with 14 projects. No new
funds have as yet been committed in FY96.
3.     Two projects that were rated as problem projects in FY94, were upgraded to satisfactory in FY95.
In the case of the education sector consolidation project, the upgrading represented progress in the
implementation of kev reform measures to restructure sector expenditures and increase their efficiency.
The Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project was upgraded and its suspension lifted. after
misused funds were reimbursed bv the Government. Only one project (Mining Capacity Building) was
rated highly unsatisfactory in FY95. This was due mainly to lack of progress in execution of the project
and the Government's refusal despite repeated warnings to sign contracts concluded with consultants for
the execution of two studies critical for defining project activities. The project was suspended in July 1995
but since then the Government has renegotiated the contract with consultants and work on these studies
should start soon. This would allow the suspension to be lifted.
4.     Apart from the Countrv Implementation Review, recent actions to improve implementation of the
portfolio included four mid-term reviews, and the fielding of an accounting and auditing mission in June
1995. The Private Sector Assistance Project is being restructured to improve is effectiveness in supporting
private sector growth.
5.     The Bank has continued to support the Public Contracts Agency (DGMP)'s efforts to strengthen
procurement capacity. In Julv 1995, a seminar was held by the DGMP, with Bank participation to explain
the Bank's new guidelines on the evaluation of competitive bids for goods, works and consultant services.
The Bank also provided support to the DGMP for the revision of the procurement code which was
submitted to the National Assemblv in October 1995. Outstanding audit reports for the Economic
Recovery Credit and SAL I are under preparation and should be completed soon. A telex has been sent to
the Govedrnment on the urgencv of having these audits completed.
