INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SEOND CHANDPUR IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $13
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh on standard IDA terms, to
help finance the completion of the second Chandpur irrigation and flood
protection project.
2.        This would be the first operation of the Bank Grop in Bangladesh
and would be the first of some eleven-,similar operations which I propose
to submit during the next few weeks. The proposed new credits would replace
credits made earlier to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for on-going pro-
jects located in Pakistan's former east wing. Disbursements under these and
other loans and credits to Pakistan were suspended on December 29, 1971.(see
paragraph 23). Each of the proposed credits would be used in the first
instance to repay the obligation of Pakistan to the Association in respect
of amounts disbursed under the original credit agreement, and to reimburse
Sweden for any project expenditures financed under the Swedish interim
credit arrangement (see paragraph 24). The balance would be disbursed to
Bangladesh against project expenditures, including expenditures incurred
prior to the suspension of disbursements. In view of the exceptional eco-
nonic problemsa ofBale a asa-nd--f the serious delas alreai     encountered"in
the execution of these projects, I would propose that the standard 50-year
life of each of the proposed new credits would commence in 1972 rather than
the year in which the origin!al credit was made.
3.        The assumption by Bangladesh of liability for loans and credits
made for projects in the former east wing of Pakistan which are fully dis-
bursed, or which are not among the eleven credits referred to in paragraph 2
above, has also been raised with the Government. The-Government does not
wish to take any formal action at this time which might prejudice the arrange-
ments to be made between Bangladesh and Pakistan with regard to a general
apportionment of liabilities, but the Bank is urging both governments to reach
within a reasonable time an agreement satisfactory to' all concerned. Mean-
while, Pakistan continues to service all Bank loans and IDA credits, including
those for projects in the former east wing of Pakistan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
4.        An economic mission visited Bangladesh in July and August of this
year. Its report will be distributed within the next -few weeks. A Country
Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.-
5.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of the territory comprising the former east wing of Pakistan. Even in the -
best of circumstances Bangladesh constitutes a critical and complex develop-
ment problem. The population is poor (per capita income of US $50 to US $70 --
a figure which has not risen over the past 20 years), overcrowded (population



-2-
density is nearly l,4O0 per square mile) and becoming more so (population is
growing at 3 percent per annum), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is well
under 50 years), and largely illiterate (under 20 percent literacy rate).
6.        The physical problems of Bangladesh -- its precarious environment,
lack of natural resources, and alluvial terrain with resultant high cost of
infrastructure -- have been compounded by poorly chosen and implemented in-
vestments in the past. The investment on the whole has yielded depressingly
low returns. This is not to say that investment could not yield adequate
returns and result in high income growth rates. There are positive factors
as well -- the fertility of the soil, the intelligence and resilience of the
people, and the availability of abundant water which, if properly used, could
become a substantial asset. The dimension of the problem is an argument for
a vastly increased and better directed effort at solving it.
7.        But a solution has clearly been made much more difficult by the
destruction in the past two years, first as a result of the cycloxe of late
1970, then during the period in 1971 which ended with the war of December
1971. According to the Government of India, some 7 to 10 million refugees
had returned to Bangladesh by March 7, 1972. During the initial period the
Govemnment had depended on Indian assistance in many areas. This Indian
assistance was given quickly, generously and at a critical time before other
aid efforts had got underway. The Indian army had carried out a number of
emergency reconstruction works. Substantial amounts of food as well as- other
essential supplies had been provided, largely on grant terms, and a foreign
exchange loan of US $5 million had been provided on very easy terms. The new
Bangladesh currency, the Taka, was fixed at par with the Indian rupee (7.28 to
US $1), thus devaluing it in terms of the previous official rate of the
Pakistani rupee (4.76 to US $1). During the first two months India was the
major source of bulk commodities and, in addition to the official transfers
of food and fertilizers, there was considerable smuggling of raw jute out of
Bangladesh in return for consumer goods.
8.        The United Nations, through the United Nations Relief Organization
in Dacca (UNROD), played a central role in relief and rehabilitation.  UNROD
was originally created by reorganizing and strengthening the UN Office for
coordinating cyclone relief.  In March 1972, the United Nations organized a
mission of high-level consultants, led by Ambassador Emna Sailer, to make the
first detailed assessment of relief and rehabilitation requirements. UNROD
received contributions itself (which reached US $178 million out of total
pledges of about US $900 million by June 30, 1972) and coordinated other relief
activities. The most important task accomplished by UNROD was to analyze
foodgrain import requirements and help assure their timely arrival.
9.        Work started immediately on restoring the ports of Chittagong and
Chalna to allow import of foodgrains, fertilizer and construction materials
and exports of jute. The ports were quickly made operational, initially with
Indian and subsequently with USSR assistance. Chittagong could operate at 90 per-
cent of its pre-war capacity by the end of June. Many roads also were quickly
repaired and ferries were brought in to substitute for damaged bridges. Here,
there was a problem of a great shortage of vehicles. It has been estimated
that the number of trucks (about 10,000 in 1969) and buses (about 5,000 in
1969) was reduced by 50 percent.  During the six months, about 1,000 new trucks.
have been brought in, mainly through UNROD.



-3-
10.       Although railway rolling stock did not suffer badly, the railways
are perhaps the most seriously disrupted part of the transport system as a
result of the cutting of the two major regional links in the network -- the
Hardinge bridge linking the Western half of the country to Chalna port, and
the Bhairab or King George VI bridge linking Dacca and the central portion
of the country to Chittagong and the East. The Hardinge bridge should be re-
paired by the end of 1972, but the Bhairab bridge will not be useable until
mid-1973. Only two other bridges remain to be repaired, the Old Brahmaputra
at Mymensingh which will also be ready by mid-1973, and-the Barhatta, also
in the ?wmensingh area (North Central), which should be ready by the end of
this year. Only in the second half of 1973, therefore, will it be possible
to make the whole rail system useable.
11.       All this has placed a great deal of pressure on inland water trans-
port, previously neglected. Of the average of 300,000 tons of foodgrains
per month imported in May and June, 120,000 tons came to Chalna and was all
trans-shipped by water. Of the remaining 180,000 tons offloaded at Chitta-
gong, only 10,000 were transported by road, 30,000 by rail, and the balance
of 1140,000 by mini-bulkers (flat-bottomed self-propelled bulk ships). From
secondary distribution points, most of the transportation is also by boats.
Through this means, therefore, the transport system has been restored to a
point at which the distribution of food on a priority basis, except for
certain isolated areas in the Northwest, is no longer impeded. It is still
very far, however, from permitting a normal flow of goods and passengers.
12.      Thanks to a swift international response, most notably from India
in the initial period, the threat of famine has not materialized in the first
six months. Nearly one million tons of foodgrains were received during the
period. During the first three months this came mainly from India via rail
and road. Subsequently, with the ports being opened, arrivals increased from
98,000 tons in March to 144,000 tons in April, 281,000 tons in May and
372,000 tons in June. This enabled the Food Ministry to. step up its distri-I
bution through the rationing system and for relief purposes. The offtake
was increased from 82,000 tons in January to 245,000 tons in June, for a
total distribution of one million tons during the period, compared to about
600,000 tons for the comparable period in 1969/70 and 1970/71.
13.       It is unlikely, however, that these imports will be sufficient to
compensate for the shortfalls in the 1971/72 harvest'. Overall production in
the crop year 1971/72 may be sane 9.7 million tons or about 20 percent below.
the 1969/70 level of 11.8 million tons. In the circumstances it is not sur-
prising that even with the additional imports of one million tons, prices
have risen from T 40 per maund of coarse rice in June 1971 to T 63 per maund
in June 1972.
114.      Despite the difficulties enumerated above, foreign trade made a
remarkable recovery. As the ports were cleared, exports, mostly of jute and
jute goods, picked up rapidly, increasing to US $12.3 million in February,
US $26.1 million in March, and about US $30 million in each of the following
months. Foreign exchange reaerves also increased rapidly, going from US $25
million in February (most of which were borrowed), to well over US $150
million at the end of June.



15.       Imports during these six months were tightly controlled as the
Government sought to build up foreign exchange reserves sufficient to allow
future imports at reasonable levels. The Government's strategy was to in-
sure  sufficient foodgrain imports -- largely aid-supported -- and, wherever
possible, facilitate the import of other aided goods, while severely curtail-
ing non-aid imports. Although aid pledges to Bangladesh increased rapidly
and reached approximately US $900 million by June 30, 19,72, non-food disburse-
ments were low. Import entitlements of only about US $100 million were
authorized, compared to a normal level of about US $200 million for a half-
year. The policy of curtailing imports led, of course, to severe shortages
of almost all consumer goods, including basics such as cloth, soap, etc.
16.       The low levels of imported consumer goods, combined with the dis-
ruption of the domestic production and distribution system, is the major
reason for the sharp rise in prices. There is no reliable general price
index for Bangladesh. However, the trend can easily be observed in individual
price movements of some basic household goods such as rice, which alone
absorbs over 50 percent of the average family budget. The simple arithmetic
average of the price increases of such basic items is 43.4 percent over the
six-month period. Shortages are not the only cause of this upward surge in
prices. The December devaluation of the official rate of the domestic cur-
rency by 53 percent is an important contributory factor. Another major
cause of price rises is the appreciable amount of smuggling of goods to
India which takes advantage of price-differentials between the I-ndian and
Bangladesh markets, which is not matched by equivalent imports.
17.       In the industrial sector, the Government found itself compelled to
act following the departure of Pakistani owners of factories and businesses.
Most of the large factories came into the category of "ibandoned propertyt"
and. were expropriated in March, 1972. The nationalization went beyond this
category, however, and covered,also other Jute, cotton textile and sugar mills,
as well as most establishments in other sectors with assets of more than T 1.5
million. Together with the former East Pakistan Industrial Development Corpora-
tion (EPIDC) companies, there are probably over 400 manufacturing enterprises
in the public sector today. They are under the control of the Ministry of
Industries through its Nationalized Industries Division and ten new sector
corporations. Due to the disturbances, most of the manufacturing firms came
to a virtual standstill by the end of 1971. Considering the circumstances,
the recovery in the first months of independence has been quite remarkable.
18.       Despite these impressive initial results, there is evidence to sug-
gest that the pace of industrial recovery is now slowing down. The diffi-
culties impeding return to full production arise in several fields.  Firstlyr,
the lack of raw materials, spare parts and components, transportation, power
supply and other material inputs is still a major problem for many industries.
While the lack of imported-inputs is on the way to being eliminated as a
bottleneck, production based on local raw materials (sugar, paper, tanneries,
rubber, timber) is likely to remain affected by shortages for a longer time
to come. Secondly, the consequences of the sudden interruption of inter-
industrial and market linkages with West Pakistan are beginning to show up
in the form of shortages of consumer goods, shortages of raw materials and
intermediate goods, reduced market size, unsuitable product mix, and cost
increases.  Thirdly, the labor problem has already emerged as a serious



-5-
production constraint. This is so not only in terms of working days lost,
but also in terms of general deterioration of labor discipline. The present
fluid political and legislative environment, problems with general security,
and the multiplicity of workers' organizations, have made difficult the main-
tenance of orderly conditions in industry. And fourthly, the productivity
and profitability of industrial enterprises is generally low, and their
financial position precarious, making their full recovery even more difficult.
19.       The Annual Plan for 1972/73 proposes an expenditure of T 5,010
million on reconstruction and development. Three-quarters will be met
through foreign aid. Even the financing of the remaining quarter is, however,
very dependent on the extemal sector and about 70 percent of Government tax
revenues come from imports either directly through customs duties, or in-
directly through sales and excise taxes. This dependence on extermal trade
is no disadvantage in a year when imports will be at record levels as a
result of sizable aid and the revival of exports. In the longer term, how-
ever, there is a serious question as to whether growing current and capital
expenditures can be financed from what is likely to prove an inelastic revenue
source.
20.      Harvests in 1972/73 will probably at best return to 1969/70 levels,
partly as a result of late arrivals of fertilizer and other agricultural
inputs. The growth of population since 1969/70 means that more imports will
be required, a record level of 2.1 million tons of foodgrains. This partly
explains the very high level of imports (US $850-900 million) expected in
1972/73. In addition, there are the needs of reconstruction and the comple-
tion of development projects which are unfinished. Even this high level will
scarcely replenish the depleted stock of consumer goods, spares, etc. It will
be financed in large part through aid pledges of about US $900 million, of
which US $450-500 million is expected to be disbursed in the year, and in part
from-the proceeds of exports which are estimated at US $400 million for 1972/73.
This rapid revival of export eamings is one of the most heartening features
of the present situation. It is almost entirely a consequence of the strong
position of jute. The long-run outlook for jute is as problematic as always,
however, and steps will need to be taken to diversify and provide incentives
for other exports. There have been special problems for exports such as tea
and paper products which were formerly exported to the west wing of Pakistan
and for which new markets must now be found. In addition, the potentials of
the trading relationship with India need to be explored, and cooperative
approaches developed in the production of jute and in the management of water
resources..
21.      Preparation of a medium-tenm plan will soon commence. When it be-
comes available, it will be necessary to consider whether the policies to
meet these problems are appropriate. With the experience of the first few
months to go by, there is reason to believe that the problems which Bangla-
desh faces will be tackled with courage and Imagination.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIQIS IN BANGLADESH
22.      The Bank and the Association have made one loan and nineteen develop-
ment credits, total ing US $4.7 million and US $168.1 million respectively
(net of cancellations), for projects located whollywdthin vhat was formerly



-6-
East Pakistan. Of these, the loan and seven of the credits hlave been fully
disbursed3 and US $95.5 million remains undisbumed under twelve developmet
credits. In addition, under ten loaus and ei-ght development credits total-
ling about US $495 million for prosects in both East and West Pakistan,
amounts ptresently outstanding total about US $257 inilicn, paAt of which will
presumably be assumed by Bangladesh. Axmex I couLtains a sumlnary statemernt
of the Barik loan and. IDA c2elitB for projects wholly located in Bangladesh.
There am no IFC investments ill Bangiadesh.
23.       As a result of the events wbich s.art.ed in M4arch 19-11, very little
development work was done on any of the unfixiahed projects, inm;luding Bank-
and IDA-financed projects. While conultants, cantractors &nd suppliers
emnployed on the IDA-financed projects continued their activities for som
time, thereby incurring some expenditures, th6 processing of withdrawal
applications was delayed. On December 29, 1971, the Banik and the Association,
in consultation with the Govenmment of Pakis-6an, saspendel the right of Pak-
istan to make further withdrawals in respect of expendit-ires for projects
located in the East (SecM 71-60). Under most prtojects some project expendi-
tures incurred in 1971 still remain unpaid.
24.       Earlier this year the Goverzoent, of Bangladeoii deci de that the
interrupted IDA-supported projects were of very high priLority anlI work on
them should therefore be resumed as early as possible, subject t- the avail-
ability of the necessary foreign exchange. At the same time, Bangladesh.
applied for membership in the Bank Group and expected to receive renewed IDA
support for these projects in due course. While the memnbership application
was being processed,- Sweden offered an interim ciedit of. US $11 million
equivalent to Bangladesh to finance urgent expenditures incurred under these
projects after January 1, 1972, and a credit agreement; between Bangladesh
and Sweden was signed on June 2, 1972. With financing assured through thase
interim measures, activities under a number of the projects were in fact re-
sumed. A meowrandum describing these arragements was considered by the
Executive Directors on April 18, 1972 (Ri2-74).
25.       Of past Bank and IDA lending in the East, about one-third went to
agriculture, about one-fourth each to transportation and industry, and the
remainder to education, urban water suppl- and telecommunications. By 1971,
we had prepared a program for substantially increased support by the Bank
Group as well as by the other members af the ConsortiUm for the development
of the land and water sector in the east wing, with particular emphasis on
the need to raise agricultural production. Much of this work remains val_d
and modifications where necessary are being made. While priorities may
change, it is certain that a substantial portion of lending in the next few
years will have to go to agriculture, with some lending for transport, in-
dustry and telecommunications, and perhaps for educatibn and family planning.
For the projects that are being identified for IDA support in the fiscal
years 1974 and 1975, it is clear that the Governnent' own resources, together
with the IDA funds likely to become available, will be inadequate;  it is
hoped that bilateral donors will provide joint or parallel financing in sub-
stantial amounts.. In fiscal year 1973, the urgent needs of reconstruction
must take priority and I intend to submitiin the near Miiture for the con-
sideration of the Executive Directors, a reconatruction program credit to
finance imports of items which ars urgently needed for the rehabilitation
of the economr.

PART III - THE PROJECT
26.       Bangladesh's difficult problem of limited cultivable land, sub-
ject annually to a dry season as well as to severe floods and to periodic
cyclone damage, has been exacerhated in modern times by a population pressure
of mounting intensity. More than 80 percent of the population of 75 million
lives directly off the land. The overriding priority in the Government's
economic policy is therefore to raise food production fast enough to fore-
stall unmanageable food imports and to provide useful employment in the rural
areas. The Bank Group has been involved since 1965 in assisting the Govern-
ment authorities in this vital sector, with. the collection and analysis of
data, as well as the formulation of strategies and the preparation of invest-
ment programs. The Government of Bangladesh has requested the Bank to con-
tinue this assistance, and discussions about the form and extent of future
Bank activities are underway. The proposed project is an important part of
the overall development program. The need to provide flood protection as
well as irrigation, which characterizes the Chandpur project, is common to
large areas of Bangladesh. Completion of the Chandpur project wJJJ not only
yield immediate benefits in the project area, but will also provide much-
needed experience valuable for future irrigation and flood protection projects,
and it therefore has an important place in the preparation of a well-balanced
development program.
27.       A US $13 million Credit (No. 184-PAK) was made in May 1970 for the
Chandpur II Irrigation Project, designed to provide flood protection for an
area of about 140,000 acres, about 75,000 acres of which would be irrigated.
A technical note describing the findings of a mission which visited Bangladesh
in June 1972 to re-appraise the project is attached as Annex III. The prin-
cipal works of the project include embankments to empolder the area, regulators
with navigation locks, a pumping plant, low-lift pumps and provision for agri-
cultural support and a project consultant. The proposed project would remain
fundamentally the same as that financed under Credit No. 184-PAK except for
the following changes: (i) relocation of a portion of the project embankment
along the Meghna River further inland; (ii) provision of detailed engineering
studies for stabilization of the Meghna River bank adjacent to the project;
(iii) provision for a comprehensive embankment maintenance program; (iv) pre-
paration and implementation of a plan to mitigate the effect of the project
works on fisheries; and (v) unified project management.
28.       The Chandpur project, initiated in 1963 with the help of an IDA
Credit (No. 40-PAK) of US $9 million, was originally designed to include
gravity irrigation and flood protection. However, land acquisition problems
made it necessary to stop the irrigation works and the credit amount was con-
sequently reduced to about US $5 million in 1965. Work on flood protection
continued until 1967 when, due to high cost increases, the Association agreed
to halt construction, and to the utilization of the undisbursed balance of
the Credit (about US $660,000) for the retention of consultants to redesign
the project. Chandpur II, utilizing natural channels and low-lift pumps
instead of conventional gravity irrigation, evolved from this redesign work.
Already in June 1970, one month after the Credit No. 184-PAK was made, virtually
all the civil works contracts had been awarded and, by March 1971 when the
works were halted due to the political unrest, the maJor project works were
about half completed.



-8-
29.       The civil works contracts for the regulators (about US $1.1
nillion) will be completed through a combination of force account and piece-
rate contracts because any other procedure will delay execution of the project
by at least a year. Foreign contractors did not express an interest when the
original contracts were tendered and it is highly unlikely that they would be
interested now that the work is over half completed. Under the contract for
fabrication and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment for the
regulators, awarded in 1970 after international competitive bidding and sus-
pended in 1971 because of the civil war, the contractor had made substantial
progress; a renegotiation of the contract is underway to take account of
domestic and foreign inflation, currency revaluatians and storage costs.
Contracts for the procurement of low-lift .pums will be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding. The remaining works would be relatively small
and of insufficient interest to foreign firms to justify international bidding.
Contracts for them would therefore be awarded after local bidding. It is
estimated that major construction will be completed in June 1974. This would
be followed by installation of low-lift pumps and intensive agricultural
development. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of
1976 (two years later than originally scheduled).
30.       River erosion and lateral migration of river channels are normal
for alluvial rivers such as the. Meghna. Until recently, the 6tly remedy feasible
has been a periodic relocation of the embankment. Accordingly, economic jus-
tification for the first Chandpur project and the proposed project was based
on a conservative estimate of the rate of river erosion and the resultant need
to relocate the embankment. However, a more permanent remedy for the erosion
problem involves stabilization of the river bank with large quantities of rock
Which is not available locally. The recent normalization of relations with
India now allows access to suitable rock quarries. Consequently, the proposed
project provides for a study of a stabilization plan.   The study is to be
completed by April 1973. If, as expected, stabilization is feasible, the'
Association would assist the Government to secure the required financing either
from a new IDA credit or from bilateral sources. River bank stabilization
could result in savings of about 20,000 acres of valuable agricultural land
and avoid the relocation of an estimated 60,000 people over the next'20years.
In addition, it would serve as a pioneer project applicable to large areas of
the country abutting the major rivers.
31.       Under Credit No. 184-PAK there was provision for the adequate main-
tenance and repair of the project works. However, maintenance and repair were
neglected, and the embankment slopes have been eroded in a number of places,
severely weakening its over-all effectiveness. To remedy this situation, the
proposed project includes a provision for the establishment of a maintenance
program and about US $0.5 million of the proposed credit is earmarked for the
procurement of equipment and materials required for this purpose.
32.       The proposed project would enclose important carp and prawn fishing
grounds. Both provide food and the prawn is an important foreign exchange
earner. Some of the works under the proposed project would prevent restocking
of the fishing grounds and thereby elizinate, In time, an important source of
eanlings and employment. To avoid this,the proposed project includes ponds
for propagation of fingerling carp and juvenile prawsn to restock project



-9-
fishing grounde regularly. Some aspects of this program are new to Bangla-
desh, and therefore the proposed credit also includes funds for fisheries
consultants and for the training of Fisheries Department staff.
33.       The original project organization with separate project directors
for construction and for agricultural services resulted in poor coordination.
It has therefore been agreed with the Government that there would be a single
organization responsible for the implementation of the project. During the
period of construction and testing, the Bangladesh Water Development Board
(BWDB) would be in charge of the project, with supporting staff from other
agencies seconded to BWDB. The Ministry of Agriculture would establish a Land
and Water Use Directorate which would take over responsibility for the project
after the project works had undergone several years of successful testing.
34.       The total cost of the project (excluding taxes and duties) is now
estimated to be US $22 million as compared to the US $21.9 million estimated
when it was originally designed under Credit No. 184-PAK. The costs of em-
bankment relocation (US $1 million), the engineering study of bank stabiliza-
tion (US $0.2 million), the fisheries facilities (US $0.2 million), and equip-
ment and materials for the construction and maintenance program (US $0.7
million), together with general cost escalation, are approximately balanced
by the effect of the devaluation of the Taka. When disbursements under
Credit No. 184-PAE were suspended, expenditures for the project totalled
about US $3.4 millian of which about US $700,000 was in foreign emahange.
35.       The proposed credit of US $13 mdllion would finance:   (i) repayment
of amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. 184-PAK (US $0.6 million);
(ii) project expenditures incurred in 197) by consultants, contractors and
suppliers and toward which IDA has not made any disbursements (about US $1.1
million); and (iii) about 61 percent of the cost of, completing the project,
including about 38 percent of the local currency expenditures. The latter
item includes the reimbursement to Sweden for the portion of SIDA's interim
credit that will actually have been disbursed under the project by the time
the Association's credit becomes effective. Thus overall, about 60 percent
of the project costs will be financed with the credit, including about 40
percent of local currency expenditures. The Association's contribution to
the total costs of the project thus is the same as was expected under Credit
No. 184-PAK, but since foreign exchange requirements have increased somewhat,
its contribution to local currency expenditures will be reduced from 50 per-
cent to about 40 percent.
36.       The project is sound and economically Justified, promising a rate
of return, including past costs, of about 15 percent, using a shadow price
for labor of 50 percent of money wages and the official exchange rate. This
reflects increased production and takes into account the cost of stabilizing
the embankment later on, or alternatively production losses from reduced area
of cultivation due to erosion. The project will increase farm production by
over 150 percent, save about US $12 million on foreign exchange annually, and
increase farmers$ income by 125 percent; the project will also provide agri-
cultural employment equivalent to 20,000 year-round jobs and improve living
conditions for the inhabitants of the area by providing better flood protec-
tion and drainage.

PA1RT IV - LEGAL INSTRMJENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's 
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft Credit
Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the prior Development
Credit Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and incorporates the
provisions of the Project Agreement with the then Province of East Pakistan.
There will not be a separate project agreement. Special provisimci is made
in Schedule 1, paragraph 6 for repayment of amounts disbursed under the
Swedish credit and development credit No. 184-PAK.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATI(N
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

TECHNICAL NOTE ON
CHANDPUR II IRRIGATION AND FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        This is a technical note prepareq by the Special Projects
Department based on findings of a missioni/ which visited Bangladesh.from
May 13 to June 3, 1972, to reappraise the Chandpur Project. Daring 1971,
execution of the Project, under way with the assistance of an IDA Credit
to Pakistan (Credit No. 184-PAK), was disrupted by the conflict. In
December 1971, the Association, in consultation with the Government of
Pakistan, suspended disbursements for the Project. By June 1972, with
conditions in the country returning to normal the Government of Bangladesh
included the project among those on-going development projects for which
Sweden provided interim financial assistance. The Government has now
requested a new credit from the Association for the Project.  Some changes
in the Project have been made in light of experience gained since the start
of construction (see Section C, below). However, these changes do not
alter the basic concept of the Project.  An IDA credit of US$13.0
to Bangladesh is proposed to replace the US$13.0 million development credit
(Credit 184-PAK) to Pakistan.
B. BACKGROUND
2.        Bangladesh, with a population of about 75 million growing at an
annual rate of some 3%, already has one of the highest population densities
in the world. At least 80% of the population is dependent on agriculture,
mainly the cultivation of rice and jute. The unsettled conditions during
the past year have imposed an almost total hiatus on the economy of the
country, including disruption of Chandpur Project activities. Rapid
progress in agricultural production is crucial to the new nation of Bangla-
desh to help compensate for the losses during the disturbances and to keep
ahead of population growth. The Chandpur Project, with major works
already half completed, could be implemented more rapidly than other similar
projects, would provide much needed experience for future irrigation and
flood control projects and fits in well with a balanced development program.
3.        The first Chandpur Credit (No. 40-PAK) for US$9 million was
approved in 1-963. In 1965, because of increased costs., inadequate
execution of the Project and serious doubts about the design of the proposed
gravity irrigation system, the Association cancelled the amount of the'
credit (US$3.7q million equivalent) earmarked for irrigation works. Wqork
on the flood control aspects was discontinued in 1967. The remaining
/ Mission headed by R. Picciotto and including G. Stern and V.Ja Hansen
of IDA and J. Pegg, Consultant to IDA.



funds were utilized to redesigni the Project to use natural dvains ,e
channels and low-lift punrps inst.pad ofr conventional gravity irrigation.
4.       The revised Project. was appraised in 1969/70 a'-'d a new credit
of US$13 million (total project cost IJS$22.7 rLillion) was made in May 1970
(Credit 18h-PAK).  The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)Ywas
the executing agency for ounstruction, operation ard maintenanca of major
works and the Department of Agriculture was responsible for the agriculture
support program, including the installation, operation and maintenance of
low-lift pumps. Under the Project, flood protection would be provided
to 10,000 a,, of which 75,000 ac would be irrigated.  Main Proje-t components
include:  602 mi of embankment to enclose the area; two -regu.atc.rs, including
navigation locks; a 1,200-cfs pumping plant; eight sluices; river dredging;
2.5 mi of a 33 kv power line; 1500 diesel puwered 2-cfs pumrips with
maintenance services and facilities; agsicultural support program.; and
project consultants. The Project was to be completed during 197h/75.
5.        Three major contracts wel let--Nos. 101 and 102, awarded
January 1970 to a local firm (Dynami.c Northern Consortium) for construc-
tion of the civil work portion of the 2. regulators, and No. 1(03, awarded
Jmue 1970 to a Japanese firm (Swnitomo Shoji Kaisha Ltd.) for fal.rication
and installation of the electrical and mechanical equipment for the regu-
.lators, including the rnavigation locks cand pumping plAnt. A number of
smaller local contracts were let for embankment construction.
6.        In March 1971.,.due to the disttianbances, civil works (Contracts
101 and 102) halted on the regulators with work a little over half completed.
WJAPDA cancelled the contracts effective July 31, 1971 because the contractor
had not been performing satisfactorily, and completely abandoned the construc-
tion sites after March 1971. Manufacture of electrical and mechanical
equipment (Contract 103) was suspended in July 1971 pending rescheduling
of the civil works. When construction halted, the dewatering system was
shut down and the regulator sites flooded along with part of the
construction equipment. Of the 60 mi of embankment forming the polder
about 40 mi have been completed and a 1O-mi section on the east side
of the project is under construction and nearing completion. The remaining
10-mi section is partly coipleted, but construction has been halted
because of the threat of erosion by the Meghna River (para 12).
The above work, together with the dredgirg of the South Dakatia River,
represents more than 90%n of the major construction under Credit 184-PAK.
The dredging was to have heen started in January 1972, but was postponed
because of the delay in construction of other works.
7.        The agricultural support program has made little progress due
to a c:.mbin.ation of:  (a) unsettled security; (b) delays by the Covernment
in deciding on project staffing; and (c) inadequate liaison between Agri-
culture and WAPDA. The Governmant of Bangladesh now has proposed unified
management to improve progress of the agricultural program(para 19).
y   Under the Government of Bangladesh, the Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA) has been split into a Water Development Booerd
(BWDB) and a Power Development Board.
2/ Thirty-one mi of the sixty mi had previously been constructed.



-3-
8.        W%hen disbursements from Credit 184-PAK were suspended on
December 29, 1971, only US$0.6 million had been disbursed to cover foreign
exchange costs of project consultants* Total expenditures up to that time
are estimated at .US$3.4 million, including US$0.7 million of foreign exchange.
9.        The Government of Bangladesh ascribes high priority to the Chandpur
Project and has included it among the projects for which Sweden is providing
interim financing. Out of this interim financing plan, it was envisaged
that US$2.0 million would permit resumption of work on Chandpur Project,
pending finalization of arrangements for IDA credit. SIDA expects that the
portion actually expended will be repaid by M4ay 1, 1973, from proceeds
of an IDA credit to Bangladesh.
C. THE PROJECT
10.       The Project would remain fundamentally the same as provided
for under Credit 184-PAK (Appraisal Report No. PA-32a dated March 31, 1970).
and described in para h above. The principle works include embankments to
empolder the area, regulators with navigation locks, a pumping plant and
low-lift pumps. Provision also is included for an agricultural support
program and project consultants.
11.       The following modifications have been discussed and agreed with
the Government: (a) relocation of a portion of the Project embankment
along the Meghna River further inland; (b) provision of detailed engineering
studies for stabilization of the Meghna River bank adjacent to the Project;
(c) provision for a comprehensive embankment maintenance program; (d) pre-
paration and implementation of a plan to mitigate the'leffect of Project works
on fisheries; and (e) unified project management.
12.       The Erosion Problem.  Erosion by the Meghna.'River into the
Chandpur Project area has been more rapid than previously anticipated.
This erosion has resulted in the loss of home sites and valuable farm
land and has destroyed about 1 mi of previously constructed Project
embankment. At the present rate of bank recession, about 5 mi additional
of Project embankment would be lost to the river within the next 3 years.
Lateral migration of river channels is normal for alluvial rivers such as
the Meghna in Bangladesh. Because it is not possible to forecast accurately
the extent and speed of this migration, embankments normally are set
back from the river bank to allow time for remedial action. Earth em-
bankmentr wiA] not stop the migration however, and if the river continues
to erode toward them, relocation becomes necessary. A more permanent remedy
Lnvolves stabilization of the river bank to prevent further migration. This
is sometimes accomplished by revetting the river bank with articulated
concrete mattresses or by constructing works such as rock dikes and groins
to divert the river currents and induce silt deposition along the bank.



The proposed Credit provides for relocation of the embankment further
inland now and for study of a stabilization plan for the future.
13.       Relocation of Enbankment. Because the Meghna River already
has destroyed a portion of the embankment and threatens additional
destruction, it is necessary to relocate a portion of the embankment-further
inland. After consideration of several alternatives, it appears desirable
to make the relocation inland a sufficient distance to insure a safe life
of about 5 years for the embankment. In the absence of stabilization, if
the river were to continue to move inland future relocations would have
to be made periodically. Relocation would involve local labor and local
costs only. The Government has agreed (a) to undertake such relocations
as needed to prevent breaching of the embankment; atnd (b) to include an
engineering study of river bank stabilization within the scope of consulting
services for the project. The cost estimate (Table 1) includes provision
for the initial relocation and for a bank stabilization study.
14.       Engineering Investigation of Bank Stabilization.  In the past,
bank stabilization has been difficult because rock of suitable quality is
not available in Bangladesh. However, now rock is available from India,
readily accessible to river transport. The stabilization works might
consist of a rock closure dike'at the head of the secondary'channel,
beginning approximately 12.5 mi downstream from Chalndpur town (to reduce
low and medium flows through the secondary channel and thus encourage
filling with sediment) supplemented by a system of 4 or 5 rock spur dikes,
located along the exposed bank starting 5 mi downstream of Chandpur (to
reduce the wave and current action along the exposed bank and to induce
filling in the dike system). The following specific points need to be
investigated:
(a) while it is knIawn that rock of suitable quality is available in
India along the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and is readily
accessible to river transport, specific arrangements for obtaining
and transporting the rock are needed and agreement with India
will be essential;
(b) availability of flueh deck barges and towboats, the time of
year they can operate on 'the Ganges and Brahnaputra Rivers, ad
the cost of operating them need to be looked into;
(c) final design and siting studies must be made. and tender documents
prepared for construction of dikes;
(dl) :;ttd(1L:; are needed to asseso the potential interaction between
thiese 3tvabil.zatton works and those now undertaken (and to be
continued) by BWDD to protect Chandpur town and to determine
whether it would be desirable to carry out both protection
works jointly.



- 5-
15.       These investigations would be accomplished by April 1973.  If,'as expected,
stabilization is found to be feasible, supplementary financing of the
stabilization work would have to be arranged and preparation of tender
documents, and award of contracts completed by October 1973, so that
construction work on the dikes could proceed during the 1973/74 season.
With the embankment set back to insure a 5-year life, dike construction
would be completed before the relocated embankment is threatened by erosion.
16.       Maintenance of Embgnkments. Even though Credit 184-PAK provides
that the works and facilities of the Project would be at all tines adequately
maintained and repaired in accordance with sound engineering practices,
maintenance has been inadequate. As a result, embankment slopes are eroded
in a number of places, and some embankments have been partly degraded. The
authorities have allowed many buildings to be erected on either the em-
bankment crown or on the degraded areas of the slopes, which prevents
effective maintenance. Inadequate maintenance prior to the time of final
embankment closure could lead to embankment failures during the first few
monsoon seasons before the embankments and appurtenances are rehabilitated.
The poor showing in the Chandpur Ptoject area and for other embankment projects
in Bangladesh points to the need for specific assurances regarding the
organization and funding of embankment maintenance.. The outline for such
a program has been discussed with the Government and the proposed credit
includes US$0.5 million for equipment and materials needed for maintenance.
Under the program, the Government would budget funds annually to meeit
recurrent maintenance costs. BWDB would be responsible for preparing a
maintenance manual, establishing an organization, stockpiling equipment
and supplies, and providing for inspection, flood fighting and timely
repair of detected deterioration. BWDB would also assure that embankments
would be relocated as needed to prevent breaching due to river erosion.
To confirm the above understanding, BWDB would prepare a maintenance
program satisfactory to the Association by January 1, 1973.
17.       Fisheries.  In the course of reappraisal, the environmental
impact of the Project on fisheries was assessed. The Project area
includes most of the South Dakatia River and numerous tributary khals
which are important for carp and prawn fishing. In particular, the area
is one of the sources of giant freshwater prawns, a source of export
revenue for Bangladesh. Carp and prawn output is valued at Tks 1.9
million (US$0.3 million) annually.  The carp spawn in the nearby flowing
streams while the prawns spawn in brackish waters, south of the Project
area. River and khal closures by the embankments are expected to prevent
entry of young fish, and fish stocks no longer would be replenished.
Unless corrective action is taken, polder construction could affect the
livelihood of about 3,t*non fishermen. The Bangladesh Fisheries Directorate,.
rasisted by consultants, has been drawing up a plan to maintain fish
production in the area.  The scope and timing of such a plan has been discussed
with the Government. It is proposed that facilities, be provided for propagation



-6-
of fingerling carp and juvenile prawn to stock project channels annually.
Bangladesh already has experience in propagation of carp and no problems
are foreseen for such a program. Prawn propagation would be new to Bangladesh,
and training of personnel would be necessary. The estimated construction
cost of ponds and facilities for the program would be about Tk 1.5 million.
Operation costs would be about Tk 0.2 million annually. BWDB, in cooperation
with the Di.rectorate of Fisheries will prepare a detailed plan for the
fishery program by January 1, 1973, with the goal that the facilit-:es
should be operational by the time of embankment closures, i.e. before
July 1, 197h.
18.       Organization.  There have been some changes in Government agencies
responsible for various aspects of the Project. Some large organir:ations
have been split into smaller units--for instance, the Directorates of
Forestry,. Fisheries and Livestock Development, formerly part of the
Department of Agriculture, are nw grouped in a separate Ministry.
Similarly, the Cooperatives Directorate has been transferred from Agriculture
to the new Ministry of Local Government, Rural Dtvelopment and Cooperatives.
Finally, the former Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has
been split into a Water Development Board (BWDB) and a Power Development-
Board. BWDB would operate under the new Winistry of Flood Control and
WUater Development. Low-lift pump and extensive tubewell development
remain with the Agricultural Development Corporation, under the Ministry
of Agriculture.
19.       The lack of progress in the agricultural support program (see
para 7) has been due largely to inadequate liaison between Government
agencies such as BWDB and the Ministry of Agriculture. in the course
of reappraisal, discussions with the Planning CommiasionA BWDB and the
ministry of Agriculture ended in a proposal to replace the present separate
management of major works and agricultural services by unified management.
BWDB would be in charge during the construction and testing period. The
Ministry of Agriculture would establish a Land and Water Use Directorate
and would take over management after the project works have undergone
several years of successful testing. This change in management would fix
Project responsibility and accountability, eliminate liaison problems,
permit better use of BWDB experience in agriculture project management and
bolster the agriculture support programi.
D. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
20.       Because of inflation and war-related economic disruptions since
Credit 184-PAK was negotiated, the estimated total project cost, in-
cluding foreign exchange (net of duties and taxes) has increased by
about 50.Z from Tk 108.3 million to Tk 160.9 million (see Table 1,
attached). The estimated local currency requirement increased from



-7-
Tk 80.2 million to Tk 1O0.9 million. The largest increase occurred in the
cost of dredging - from Tk 7.0 million to Tk 24.5 million due to increased
unit costs based on recent experience in Bangladesh.
21.       In dollar terms, the estimated total cost of the project is
US$22.0 million equivalent, including US$7.5 million foreign exchange
(see Table 1, attached). This compares to US$21.9 million equivalent
total cost of project under Credit 18h-PAK (both without duties and taxes).
The increase in foreign exchange from US$5.1 million to US$7.5 million
reflects mainly the addition of equipment for construction and maintenance,
cost escalations and increased cost of project consultants.
Project Financing
22.       The proposed credit of US$13.0 million equivalent would contribute
about 59% of the estimated cost of the Project, the same as under Credit
184-PAK.  It would finance all of the foreign exchange (US$7.5 million)
and about 38'1 of the estimated local expenditures.  Thus the IDA Credit
would finance TV 4O.0 million of local currency requirements, leaving
Tk 65.9 million for Government financing. This compares -with Tk 42.8
million required Government financing under the old credit. Proceeds
from the credit would be used by Bangladesh to reimburse IDA for disburse-
ments under Credit 18h-PAK, and to reimburse Sweden for the portion of
the interim loan actually disbursed (para 9). Financing and projected
disbursements would be as follows:

23.       Interim financing by Sweden has allowed reappointment of project
consultants, resumption of construction and renegotiation of contract 103
(para 5) for the fabrication and installation of electrical and mechanical
equipment. (See attached bar chart.) Resumption of contract 103 by
/ Includes di5bursement to repay interim funding by Sweden and costs
prior to December 29, 1971. US$1.00 = Tks 7.28.



November 1972 and of regulator construction in January 1973 would allow
completion of major works by June 197a. This would be followed by installation
of low-lift pumps and intensive promotion of agricultural development.
Renegotiation of contracts, appointment of consultants, recruitment of extra
staff and purchase of'adequate materials and equipment would need to take
place soon. Dewatering and clean-up of regulator sites would need to take
place during Novembar/December 1972. Construction of the relocated embank-
ment would comence as soon as rights of way could be obtained.
E. PROCUREMENT
24.       The civil works on the regulators (contract rescinded, see para 6)
would be completed by BWDB on a combination of force account and piece-rate
contracts awarded after local competitive bidding. Calling for fresh
tenders covering all of the work (US$1.1 million) would not be practical.
Dewatering cannot start until November 1972 making it highly unlikely
that the process of tendering and award could be completed in time to
permit substantial progress during the 1972/73 dry season. Foreign contractors
did not express an interest when the original dontracts were tendered
and it is highly unlikely that they would be interested now that the work
is over half completed. The contract for fabrication and installation
of electrical/mechanical equipment for the regulators,' awarded in 1970,
after international competitive bidding, was suspended in 1971 until work
could proceed on the civil works. The contractor had-made substantial
progress and a renegotiation of the contract (estimated US$1.9 million)
is underway to take account of domestic and foreign inflation, currency
revaluations and storage costs. Procurement of low-lift pumps and other
works including embankment construction would be handled as under Credit
184-PAK. Contracts for embankments, offices and residences would be
relatively small and of insufficient interest to foreign firms to'attract
international bidding. They would be awarded after local bidding.
F. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
25.       The Chandpur Project is designed'to exploit the high development
potential of part of the old Meghna floodplain in the: Eastern Region of
Banglidesh. The Project would provide flood protectibn for a gross area
of 133,000 ac, and irrigation for 71,000 ac, using natural channels and
lowlift pumps. Present cropping in the Project area consists mainly of low-
yielding traditional deep-water aman, mixed with aus or jute, and usually
followed by fallow or low-yielding catch crops in the winter season. Winter
irrigation would allow cultivation of high-yielding IRRI boro or early
transplanted aus. With flood protection and drainage', cultivation of IRRI
transplanted aman would be possible - instead of deepwater aman.
26.       The quantifiable benefits from the project would be an annual
increase in the value of farm production ten years after completion of
major polder works, to about Tks 15 million (US$21 million), or 2-1/2
times present levels, and more than double the level that could be achieved
with expected improvements in farm inputs but without irrigation and
flood control. Most of the additional production would be food for local



-9-
consumption which would otherwise have to be imported.  Therefore, compared
to "inputs only" conditions, the Project would yield a saving of foreign
exchange of about-US$12 million annually after the tenth year, rising to
about US$15 million annually with the Project at full development after
the thirtieth year.
27.       The economic rate of return on the project is expected to be over
15%, with foreign exchange valued at the official exchange rate of Tk 7.28-
US$1.00.  With foreign exchange valued at a shadow rate 50¶" higher than
the official rate (i.e. Tk 11 = US$1.00), the rate of return would be over
20%. Because of serious unemployment and underemployment, the economic
value of unskilled construction and farm labor is considerably less than its
financial cost. Therefore, the base analysis was made using 50% of financial
cost for wages of construction workers and additional farm labor. At full.'
financial cost, the rates of return would fall to about 12%'at the official
exchange rate, and to about 18% at the rate of Tk llj= US$1.00.
G. RECOMThNDATIONS
28.       It is recommended that the proposed development credit of US$13.0.
million be made to the Government of Bangladesh to permit completion of
the Chandpur Project.
29.       Conditions under credit 184-PAK which are still applicable with
necessary modifications as follows:
(a) Government would open a revolving fund to be operated by the
Project Director, and make deposits into it of amounts as
required to permit payments to be made promptly;
(b) the revolving account would be audited annually by auditors
acceptable to the Association and copies of the reports sub-
mitted to the Association'within 6 months of the end of the
fiscal year;
(c) further land required for project works would be acquired promptly
as needed, under terms which ensure that the owners receive
full and prompt compensation;
(d) tile Covernment would maintain all works and facilities in accordance
with sound engineering and agriculture practices and shall consult
witti the Association prior to transferring responsibility for
the maintenance and operation to any agency or organization
othor than rWDB;
(o) engineering Btudies of low-lift pumps would be completed by May 1,
1973, and the specification approved by the Association;
(f) rental charges would be collected on a graduated scale rising
to a level to ensure recovery by the tenth year of full annual
operation, maintenance and replacement costs of low-lift pumps;



(g) within two years of credit signature, the Government weuld prepare
and subnit to the Association a plan to recover the other
operation and maintenance costs;
(h) within five years from the date of completion, of the Project, the
Government would prepare and submit to the Association a plan for
recovery of as much as practicable of the capital costs; and
(i) competent and experienced consultants would be employed, and
suitable staff recruited, on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association.
30.       In addition, the following points have bpen agreed to sub-
sequently by the Government:
(a) Government would provide funds annually to carry out an adequate
maintenance program, including funds for embankment relocation,
as needed (para 16);
(b) an engineering study with terms of reference satisfactcry to
the Association would be made of a plan for stabilizing the bank
of the Meghna River adjacent to the project, to be completed
by April 1, 1973 (para 10);
(c) standard budget control documents (PC-I forms) for an agricultural
program, embodying1the new unified management concept and including
provision for fisheries development, would be prepared and approved
by the Government by January 1, 1973 (paras 17 and 19).
