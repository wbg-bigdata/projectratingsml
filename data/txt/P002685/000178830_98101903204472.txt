SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AT'TACHMNNT TO APPRAISAL REPORT PA-97a
Amendment to Project Costs and Financing
1.        The Appraisal Report PA-97a was printed prior to exchange rate
changes introduced on December 18, 1971. As a result of these changes,
the foreign exchange costs of the project are likely to-increase by the
equivalent of US$ 40.0,000, raising the total to US$ 16.5 million. The
cost table in para 5.01 of the Appraisal Report requires the following
amendments:
(1) the foreign element of the price contingency should be
increased from US$ 369,000 to US$ 769,000, and
(2) the total project costs should be increased from US$ 16,080,000
to US$ 16,480,000.
2.        A corresponding adjustment to the financing plan is shown below.
It replaces the financing table in para 5.05 of the Appraisal Report.
Foreign Exchange Costs      Local Costs        Total Costs

3.        In the above table the amount of the IDA Credit was increased by
US$ 300,000, raising the total from US$ 10.5 million to US$ 10.8 million.
This increase maintains IDA's share of the foreign exchange financing as
previously estimated in the Appraisal ieport. The eBtimated disbursements
of the Credit shown in Annex 10 require to be increased by approximately
2.8$ per quarter.
4.        The cost increase amounts to approximately 2.5% of the overall
project costs. Its effect on the project's economic rate of return will
not be significant. The possibility of future cost increases was con-
templated by a sensitivity analysis (para 8.09 of the Appraisal Report).
It was shown that a cost increase as high as 20% would reduce the rate of
return from 17% to 13.4%.

SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for expanding smallholder tea
production in Tanzania. It would be the fourth Bank Group operation in the
agricultural sector of the country. The other credits date back to 1965 and
total US$15.3 million.
ii.       The expansion in smallholder tea planting would take place in four
widely scattered districts - Rungwe and Lupembe in the southern highlands,
Bukoba on Lake Victoria in the northwest and West Usambara in the northeast.
The project would involve production of planting material, provision of fertil-
izer to growers, the construction of about 300 km of green leaf collection
roads, construction of tea factories, the purchase of leaf collection
vehicles, and the provision of extension services to growers. At full
maturity it would produce about 9.5 million kg on 8,300 ha. By comparison
Tanzania produced about 8.5 million kg of made tea on about 9,300 ha in 1970,
most of it by private estates and private outgrowers.
iii.      The project would be mainly carried out by the Tanzania Tea
Authority (TTA), a parastatal organization, which would be responsible for
developing nurseries, green leaf collecting, building and operating factories,
marketing tea, and providing extension services. Green leaf collection roads
would be built by construction units of the Ministry of Communications,
Transport and Labour (Comworks); construction of the roads in the Rungwe and
West Usambara districts would be financed with assistance from Norway.
Fertilizer would be procured by the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB)
and distributed to growers through cooperative societies and unions. Growers
would obtain loans for the purchase of stumps during each year of planting
and for the two succeeding years for infills and for the purchase of fertil-
izer during the first two years. These loans would be repaid by deducting
a cess from the proceeds of green leaf sales.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$16.1 million and cover a five-
year period from 1972 to 1976. An IDA credit of US$10.5 million is proposed
which would finance about 65% of total project costs. Norway would provide
about US$1.9 million or 12% of project costs and Government would provide
about US$3.7 million representing about 23% of project costs. Of this, about
a third might be provided in local currency by a soft loan from the Inter-
national Coffee Organization's Diversification Fund. The IDA credit would
provide about US$4.3 million of foreign exchange costs and Norway would
provide the remaining US$1.5 million. The credit would also provide about
US$6.2 million or 61% of local costs.
v.        Procurement of vehicles, tea factories, and road construction equip-
ment for the Bukoba and Lupembe areas would be by international competitive
bidding. Contracts for construction of houses would be put out to local com-
petitive bidding as their number and scattered distribution would not justify
international bidding. Purchases of fertilizer would be through international
competitive bidding, with up to 15% preference to local manufacturers.



- ii -
vi.       The increases in project farmers' annual net cash incomes at full
development are expected to be between T Sh 1,782 and T Sh 2,272 (US$249 to
US$318) per farmer, depending on the area in which the farmers live. This
increase is more income than a farmer would receive by having the head of
the family working full time in agriculture at the legal minimum wage of
T Sh 3.85/day.
vii.      The economic rate of return for the entire project is about 17%
over a 50-year period. The rates in the various areas are estimated to be
above 18% (24% in Rungwe) except West Usambara, where it is estimated at 7% to
8%. There are no alternative opportunities for farmers in West Usambara;
Government has already embarked upon tea development in the areas and there
would be significant but unquantifiable indirect benefits in this area. There-
fore, West Usambara is included in the project as requested by Government.
viii.     With the appropriate assurances, the project would be suitable for
an IDA credit of US$10.5 million.

SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A smallholder tea project was identified in Tanzania by an IBRD/
PMEA mission in November 1968. The Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA), a para-
statal organization, was established in 1969 and the United Research Company
of Alexandria, Virginia was employed by Government and financed by USAID to
prepare the project. The preparation report, together with a request for
financing the project, was submitted to the Bank by Government in July 1970.
1.02      The proposed project included the planting of tea during the
second five-year plan, from 1971 through 1974. As appraised, it has been
modified to include plantings from 1972 through 1974 and the necessary
factories, leaf collection facilities, nursery development, provision of
growers' fertilizer, and extension services. The project would be mainly
carried out by TTA.
1.03      The project would be the fourth Bank Group operation in the agri-
cultural sector in Tanzania. The three previous projects were an IDA credit
of US$5 million in 1965 for agricultural credit; a credit of US$1.3 million
in October 1968 for beef ranching development; and a credit of US$9 million
in September 1970 for flue-cured tobacco development.
1.04      Three other credits for smallholder tea development have been made
in East Africa, to Kenya and Uganda. All of these projects are in some
ways similar to the project proposed for Tanzania and are being successfully
carried out. The main difference in the Tanzanian project is the use of a
credit channel which makes the project more costly and complicated. However,
the extra cost can be regarded as a contribution towards strengthening finan-
cial institutions.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
to Tanzania in February 1971, composed of Messrs. Parsons, Gregor and
Lowenstein of IDA, Mr. Reid of PMEA, and Messrs. Taylor and Thompson,
Consultants. The annex on World Market prospects for tea was contributed by
Mr. Elz of the Bank's Economics Department.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Tanzania is situated to the south of Kenya and Uganda in Eastern
Africa. It extends from the Indian Ocean to its western boundaries with
Zaire (formerly Congo (K)), Rwanda and Burundi (see Map 1). Its total area
is 361,800 square miles (937,000 kn2), including 20,650 square miles
(53,500 km2) of inland water. With the exception of a narrow strip along
its 550 mile (900 km) coastline, the country lies entirely at an altitude of



over 300 m. A large part of the country is a plateau at about 1,300 m, with
mountainous areas rising to almost 3,000 m on its southern and northeastern
borders. The continent's highest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro, rises to a
height of over 19,240 feet (6,000 m), close to the border with Kenya.
2.02      The population was estimated in 1970 at 12.9 million and its
growth rate is about 2.7% per annum. There are on the average, about 15
people per km2, a very low rate. About 90% of the population is engaged in
farming and agriculture accounts for about 40% of the Gross National Product
(GNP).
2.03      In 1970, GNP was US$1,281 million (in 1968 dollars) and per capita
GNP was US$99. From 1970 to 1976, total GNP is expected to grow at about
6.5% per annum and if this is achieved per capita GNP would increase at an
annual rate of approximately 3.7%.
2.04      Imports of food, beverages and tobacco have accounted for a de-
clining proportion of external imports (imports from countries of origin
outside the East African Community) and in 1969 were only 4.4% of the total.
2.05      Exports of tea increased during the 1960's but in 1969 were still
only 2.5% of total exports. Principal agriculture exports of the country
in the past have been cotton, coffee, sisal, cloves (mainly from the Island
of Zanzibar), and cashew-nuts.
B. The Tea Industry
2.06      At the end of 1969 there were 9,260 ha of tea planted to estates
and private outgrowers. These growers produced 8,492,000 kg of green leaf
tea during 1970, compared with 3,721,000 kg in 1960. Between 1960 and 1970,
output increased sharply, largely because of rising yields as shown below.

2.07      During 1970, all tea was manufactured at factories located on es-
tates. Private estates bought green leaf tea from outgrowers and smallholders
for manufacture and marketing. A factory owned by TTA was recently built
at Mponde, and will be in operation during 1971. An existing factory at
Lupembe has been rebuilt by TTA. There is also a factory in Bukoba. This
was owned by the Bukoba Cooperative Union and the National Agricultural
and Food Corporation (NAFCO), but TTA has recently acquired NAFCO's interest.
2.08      Government's Second Five-Year Plan calls for a drastic revision
in tea production, manufacture and marketing. TTA will administer this
program. The Plan calls for the planting by smallholders of 9,482 ha from
1971 through1 1974. Of this total, 8,345 ha are included in the project
being considered for financing by IDA.
III. THE TEA GROWING AREAS
A. General
3.01      Tea is grown in four widely separated areas of Tanzania.  The
oldest tea plantings date from World War I and are in the Rungwe and
Lupembe-Mufindi areas of the southern highlands and in the Usambara moun-
tains, which are located along the Kenya boundary in the western part of
Tanga region. More recently, tea has also been planted in Bukoba district
which is on the western shores of Lake Victoria (Map 1).
3.02      Climate.  Rainfall in all areas is generally adequate for tea
production, annual averages ranging from 1,400 mm in Usambara to 2,500 mm
in Rungwe (Annex 1, Table 1). In some years, yields are reduced by
drought in Usambara and Lupembe, and rainfall falls off steeply on the borders
of the tea areas in both Usambara and Bukoba. Tea is grown at altitudes of
between 1,000 and 1,700 m in Tanzania, which by world standards is medium/high
altit:ude tea. Frost very occasionally causes damage in the Rungwe area.
3.03      Soils.  Soils in all areas are suitable for tea production, but in
two areas soil conditions give rise to some difficulty in the establishment
of the young tea bushes. In Bukoba, the soils are loose and friable and lose
moisture rapidly. In order to retain adequate soil moisture during the es-
tablishment period, it is necessary to mulch between bushes with grass until
a cover is formed by the tea itself. In Rungwe, the problem arises from the
layer of volcanic pumice to be found at varying depths below the surface.
Until the tea roots have penetrated this area into the fertile soils below,
growth is often retarded. Hence, in these two areas, yields are reduced
slightly in the early years of production.
3.04      Topography.  Topography differs markedly among the main tea
growing areas. In the Usambara mountains and in the Lupembe area of the
southern highlands slopes are steep to precipitous and tea is grown on slopes
of up to 500 or more. In Rungwe the country is mountainous, but the culti-
vated hillsides are, as a rule, more gently sloping. In Bukoba, the landscape
is gently undulating to flat. Soil conservation measures are necessary in



- 4 -
all areas but, in general, the soils appear to accept the heaviest rainstorms
on the steepest slopes without serious erosion (Annex 2).
B. Population and Tenure
3.05      Population.  Population densities in the tea growing areas are
among the highest in the country, reflecting the fertile soils, adequate
rainfall, and the generally healthy climate of the hilly areas where the crop
is grown. Although the land available per family averages as much as 32 ha
over Tanzania as a whole, the area available in tea growing areas varies
from about 2 ha per family in Bukoba to over 4 ha in Usambara. By contrast,
according to the 1967 census, in Lupembe where the land is at presen. sparst
settled there were 27 ha per family available for cultivation. Lupembe was
at one time more heavily settled, but a general exodus of population took
place some years ago due to the lack of viable cash crops in the area and
to the very poor maize yields realized from the only varieties available at
the time. Presently a rapid, spontaneous resettlement of the area is taking
place, activated mainly by the recent very successful introduction of a
hybrid maize campaign in the area and by the attraction of tea now being
developed as a cash crop.
3.06      Tenure.  In the past, the usufruct of land was allocated to
individuals by the traditional land authorities, who were the leaders, or
elders, of the clan. Cultivators and their recognized descendants could
retain these rights to land that was being rested and had remained unculti-
vated for some years. In 1969, Government terminated these traditional rights
and at present district councils and local Tanzanian African National Union
(TANU - the national political organization) leaders have broad discretionary
powers to permit occupancy of unused land. Any allocation of land to
accommodate future tea planting can be finalized by the local council in
cooperation with TTA.
C. Production, Yields, Extension and Research
3.07      Production.  At present, 94% of tea production in Tanzania arises
from privately owned tea estates and privately developed outgrowers whose
green leaf is processed by estate factories (paras 2.06 and 2.07). Small-
holder tea occupies 18% of the total area planted to tea, but produces only
about 6Z of the national crop, since much of this area is newly planted and
is not yet in bearing. By the end of fiscal 1969 (June 30, 1969), 1,955 ha
of smallholder tea had been planted since the first trial plantings in 1961.
3.08      Yields.  Yields of mature tea in Tanzania average about 900 kg/ha
of made tea. Due to the recent introduction of fertilizers and new plantings,
yields have increased 8.6% annually over the last 10 years, and are still
rising, although at a reduced rate over the last three years. In a good year
some estates with fully mature tea have averaged 1,500 kg/ha of made tea.
Clonal material is becoming more widely available and with its increasing
utilization, yields will certainly continue to improve.



3.09      Extension.  TTA has responsibility for all aspects of smallholder
tea development. It is described more fully in paragraphs 6.01 to 6.05 and
Annexes 3 and 4 of this report. It is responsible for carrying out extension
in all tea areas. Field staff are seconded to it and financed by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives at the ratio of one assistant field
officer for every 100 smallholders and one field officer to about 300-500
smallholders. Recruitment of new growers is carried out by this staff with
help from local TANU officials. Extension staff also approve smallholder
plots as being suitable for tea growing, and advise growers on land pre-
paration, planting, fertilizing, cultivating, weeding, mulching, pegging,
pruning and plucking. TTA has provided one Area Tea Development Officer
with supporting staff in each of the four main tea producing areas to
coordinate and administer the work of the field extension staff. The morale
and effectiveness of this service is good. Extension staff are also
responsible for making arrangements for the collection of green leaf, and
for the delivery of planting material from the nurseries to growers. The
actual production of seedlings and clonal material in the nurseries is
carried out by TTA, using staff specially allocated to this work.
3.10      Research.  Apart from some field trials conducted by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives in Bukoba, all tea research is carried out
by the East African Tea Research Institute (TRI) at Kericho in Kenya. TRI
operates a substation in Tanzania at Marikatanda in Usambara and carries out
irrigation trials on tea at Mufindi in the south. It serves Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania, each of which contributes to its budget in proportion to the
amount of tea produced. TRI is a well established organization of interna-
tional repute. It is the main source of technical guidance to the tea
industry and has made major contributions to the productivity of tea in East
Africa. At present, on the advice of IDA, TRI is applying to UNDP for funds
to strengthen its research capacity and to provide for an advisory service
to operate in the three East African countries.
D. Cooperatives, Communications and Labor
3.11      Cooperatives.  The cooperatives are regulated by the "Cooperative
Societies Act, 1968" and by the "Cooperative Societies Rules, 1968". There
are some 1,750 cooperative societies in Tanzania, incorporating about 20%
of all farmers; these primary societies may combine into unions and at present
there are 26 of these.  Government is pressing for amalgamation of the unions
into 17 regional bodies with which it hopes all the primary societies will
become affiliated in the course of the next few years.
3.12      The cooperatives are supervised by the Registrar of Cooperatives
in Dar es Salaam, whose establishment is a sub division of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives with a complement of about 500 employees through-
out the country. The affairs and accounts of the cooperatives are audited
by the Audit and Supervision Fund (ASF), a self-financing Government organi-
zation. ASF recovers its costs by charging audit fees, and employs about
100 people including 10 qualified accountants. Government runs a Cooperative
College in Moshi in close cooperation with the Registrar's office. Basic
and advanced courses for cooperative employees are given each year.

3.13      Communications.  The four areas in which smallbolder tea develop-
ment is proposed are widely scattered (Map 1). Only one, West Usambara, is
relatively close to a sea port -- about 130 km from the port of Tanga. For
this area, tea and supplies must be transported through the mountains by
truck for roughly 40 km to reach rail head.   Bukoba, which lies on Lake
Victoria at the northwest corner of the country, uses water transport across
the lake to Mwanza where a rail connection with Dar es Salaam is available.
A new port is being constructed a few miles from Bukoba which will permit
the transport of loaded freight cars across the lake to the rail head at
Mwanza. Rungwe and Lupembe are in the southwest corner of the country and
have neither rail nor water connections with the nearest port of Dar es Salaam-
about 1,000 km distant. Truck transport is now used for supplies between
these locations and the port -- a two-day trip. The Tan-Zam Railroad, now
being constructed by the Chinese, will serve Rungwe and Lupembe and i^s
scheduled to be in operation in 1975/76.
3.14      Labor.  Most of the population live in rural areas and are engaged
in subsistence farming (para 2.02). These farmers have little cash income at
present. There is a plentiful supply of labor in the tea growing areas for
staffing tea factories, leaf collection vehicles and other project activities.
The minimum wage in agriculture, including tea factories, is T Sh 3.85/day.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project includes continuation of the present planting program
and subsequent maintenance and production of tea by 14,000 smallholders on
about 8,300 ha in the four areas of Bukoba, West Usambara, Rungwe and Lupembe.
The tea would be grown either on growers' existing holdings, on individually
owned composite blocks on unutilized land, or on communally owned and oper-
ated Ujamaa village blocks. The project, through TTA, would also finance
the collection of green leaf from growers, and the processing, marketing and
export of made tea. Development would be completed by 1982, but the whole
area would be planted to tea by 1974. The development period for the purpose
of disbursement of IDA funds would be through 1976. Thereafter, the project
would be self-financing. The project would consist of:
(a) strengthening of TTA by provision of technical services
and construction and equipping of staff houses, offices,
workshops, stores for TTA field operations, and training
facilities at Kiwira in the Rungwe district;
(b) construction of two and expansion of three tea factories
and provision of processing equipment for them, phased
approximately as shown in Annex 5;
(c) provision of extension and leaf collection services for
project growers and related transportation;



- 7 -
(d) construction of about 300 km of all-weather roads in the
project areas, and provision of consultants' services for
construction and maintenance of these roads and for the
training of Tanzanian personnel in this connection;
(e) establishment and operation of tea nurseries and mother
bushes to provide planting material for the project
growers; and
(f) provision of credit to project growers for the
purchase of planting material and fertilizers.
4.02      TTA would manage the project and purchase, own and operate the
equipment and facilities required for leaf collection, processing and
marketing. It would provide all the extension staff, on secondment from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, required to recruit and instruct
farmers in modern tea production techniques and be responsible for the pro-
vision of adequate good quality planting material. Credit would be provided
by the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) and would be channelled to
growers through existing cooperative societies. Road improvement would be
carried out by units established under Comworks. Further details of the
organization and management of the project are given in Chapter VI.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      Planting Program.  TTA would recruit tea smallholders in accordance
with the schedule given in Annex 1, Table 3. Each grower would plant 0.2 ha
in the first year and if his performance is satisfactory, he would plant a
further 0.2 ha in each succeeding year until he had planted 0.6 ha in total.
Spacing would be 3 feet by 4 feet. Planting would be carried out under the
supervision of, and with material supplied exclusively by, TTA.
4.04      Rate of Development.  The rate of development proposed for the
project is very rapid. In the first year of the project, about 3,000 ha
are scheduled for planting, with slightly smaller areas scheduled for 1973
and 1974 (Annex 1, Table 3). However, TTA is well ahead of schedule
in the recruitment of growers, and planting material in sufficient quantity
to meet the proposed planting schedule for 1972 and 1973 is already growing
in TTA nurseries or will be planted shortly. Further consideration is given
to this subject in paras 6.08 and 6.09.
4.05      Administration.  TTA, which would manage the project, would be
strengthened by increasing the number of management personnel at its head-
quarters in Dar es Salaam and in the field extension service and by providing
technical assistance in processing (Annex 3). In addition, the project would
provide houses, offices, workshops and stores for TTA's field operations.
4.06      Factories and Equipment.  Ten factories owned by TTA fully equipped
for CTC 1/ processing and with the requisite storage and workshop facilities
1/   This process is described in Annex 5.

would be erected by 1982. Each factory would be completed in three phases
to capacities of 0.57 M kg, 1.1 M kg and 1.7 M kg of made tea per annum, in
accordance with the schedule given in Annex 5.
4.07      Transport.  Vehicles and spare parts would be provided to enable
the extension services to perform their functions efficiently on the scale
of one field officer to every 500 growers and one assistant field officer
to every 100 growers. This would require 20 four-wheel-drive pickups and
57 motorcycles.
4.08      Roads.  It will be necessary to improve about 300 km of road to
collect green leaf and to transport the tea from the factories. These roads
would be distributed as shown below:
Km
Rungwe                    105
Bukoba                     85
Lupembe                    75
West Usambara               35
Total           300
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that all the roads would be
completed within 2 years of the signing of the Credit Agreement, that they
would be constructed to a minimum standard as described in Annex 6 para 14
and that Government would satisfactorily maintain these roads after the
construction period.
4.09      Assurances were also obtained that using IDA funds, Government
would establish and operate two road construction units, one each in Bukoba
and Lupembe, with plant and establishment outlined in Annex 6 and employ
consultants, acceptable to the Association, for at least 2 years, to supervise
and coordinate the construction and subsequent maintenance of the roads and
to train local staff; and that Government would assign to these two units
sufficient supporting staff and all other resources necessary for the com-
pletion of the project roads in these two areas. The units so established
would subsequently be available to construct and maintain other feeder roads
in the areas.
4.10      The construction of roads in the Rungwe and West Usambara areas
is expected to be financed by Norway, which has expressed willingness to
finance feeder road programs, including tea roads in these two areas. The
proposed arrangements between Tanzania and Norway for tea road construction
and maintenance in Rungwe and West Usambara would be along the same lines
as outlined for the Bukoba and Lupembe areas. The completion of arrangements
satisfactory to IDA for financing, supervising and constructing the project
roads in the Rungwe and West Usambara areas will be a condition of effect-
iveness of the IDA credit.
4.11      Nurseries.  TTA would continue to operate existing nurseries
and establish new nurseries for production of seedlings and vegetatively



- 9 -
propagated (V.P.) material in adequate amounts and at suitable sites to
enable them to supply all project growers with high-grade planting material
(Annex 1, Table 4). They would also establish mother bushes of suitable
clonal selections to provide V.P. material for farmers to establish their
own nurseries. TTA would provide growers with all V.P. material by 1974 and
would no longer need to continue nursery work once this program had become
established by 1975.
4.12      Credit and Inputs.  Credit to growers for planting material and
fertilizers during the first two years until bushes came into bearing, and
seasonal credit for annual fertilizer requirements thereafter would be
provided through their cooperatives. All growers would be cooperative
members.
4.13      The Tanzania Rural Development Bank. The principal agri-
cultural credit institution in Tanzania, the National Development Credit
Agency (NDCA), has recently been changed with the concurrence of IDA
into a new institution, the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB). The two
institutions and the circumstances leading up to this change are described
in Annex 7.
4.14      NDCA was the credit channel for two IDA credits -- one for
general agriculture (80-TA) in January 1966 for US$5 million, and one
for flue-cured tobacco (217-TA) in September 1970 for US$9 million. About
US$1.6 million of 80-TA was used by June 30, 1971 for smallholder tea
development.
4.15      TRDB will be the credit channel for loans to TTA and the
cooperatives. To TTA it will make available funds covering processing
equipment for tea factories, tea factory buildings, vehicles and spare
parts for TTA leaf collection services, office equipment for TTA head-
quarters and establishment of nurseries. To the cooperatives it will make
available loan funds for on-lending to project growers required for financing
tea stumps and fertilizer.
4.16      TRDB's staff, mostly former NDCA employees, have had adequate ex-
perience in appraising the creditworthiness of cooperatives and subsequent
credit supervision.
4.17      IDA funds would be passed on to TRDB by the Treasury at 4% p.a. who
in turn would on-lend to the cooperatives and to the Tea Authority at 8-1/2%
p.a.
4.18      T Sh 0.20/kg of green leaf would be deducted by TTA factories over
13 to 15 years for payment of interest and principal on TRDB loans to
cooperatives for the purchase of planting material and fertilizer. The
proceeds of this cess would be remitted directly by TTA to TRDB and the
cooperatives would receive records of the remittance. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that this direct payment procedure would be followed.
The term of 13 to 15 years would include three to five years of grace during
which period interest would be capitalized because of insufficient income.

V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Cost and Financing
5.01      Cost.  Total project costs commencing from July 1971 are estimated
at about T Sh 115 million (US$16.1 million). Approximately T Sh 13.3
million (US$1.9 million) would be financed by Norway, and about T Sh 26.5
million (US$3.7 million) would be financed by Government and T sh 75.0 million
(US$10.5 million) by IDA. The foreign exchange component is about T sh 41.6
million (US$5.8 million). Detailed cost estimates are shown in Annex 8 and
the table below:

5.02      Salaries and allowances for TTA's extension personnel and staff
are based on salary levels presently paid for expatriate personnel and for
Tanzanian staff.  Physical contingencies include 10% for road construction
and extension housing. A cumulative 5% p.a. for price contingencies is
allowed for leaf collection vehicles, extension vehicles, factories and
growers' fertilizer. Price contingencies for other costs are allowed at a
cumulative rate of 3% p.a.
5.03      Additional capital investments in factories after 1976 would be
as scheduled in Annex 5, Table 1. The additional investment would amount to
US$5.9 million through 1983 (see also para 6.11).
5.04      Costs for fertilizer include the expense of purchasing fertilizer
during the planting year and the immediately succeeding year. There would
be no leaf plucked during these two years and fertilizer use during this
period would be a capital cost. After the second year, green leaf would
be harvested and growers would purchase fertilizer from the proceeds of
their green leaf sales with use of seasonal credit financed by TRDB.
5.05      Proposed Financing.  It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$10.5
million (T Sh 75.0 million) be made on standard terms to Government. The
credit would cover 65% of project costs from 1972 to 1976 and Norway financ-
ing is estimated to cover 12%. The Government would contribute US$3.7 mil-
lion for local costs. It has approached the International Coffee Organiza-
tion (ICO) for a loan on soft terms from ICO's Diversification Fund; ICO
have expressed interest in providing about US$1.2 million in local currency
for the project. This would become part of Government contribution. Foreign
exchange and local costs covered by each source of financing are shown below:

5.07      The projections in Annex 9 show that during the first three years
of the project TTA will build up a large surplus of cash, due to the sales
of tea stumps, some of which were planted before the start of the project.
This surplus will provide a cushion for the following four years, of which
the last two will have a deficiency of cash inflows, likely to substantially
deplete the accumulated surplus. Thereafter, the flows will be in balance
with year 12 showing a stabilization of annual cash surplus. TTA will,
therefore, require an eight year period of grace on its loan from TRDB,
during which only interest would be paid, with a subsequent twenty year
repayment period, so as to allow for any contingency caused by unfavorable
cost or revenue deviations from the original assumptions.
5.08      TRDB will be the principal credit channel (paragraph 4.15).  Other
financing would be as follows: TTA would receive direct grants from. Govern-
ment towards the costs of services of experts employed by it, towards vehicles
and spare parts for TTA extension services and staff houses and training
facilities for extension services; the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
would receive grants by way of annual budgetary allocations for the services
of experts employed by it and for the services of Tanzanian extension service
staff; Comworks would receive similar grants for the road construction
machinery for Bukoba and Lupembe areas and for the construction of roads in
those areas.
5.09      Repayments by TRDB of both IDA and government funds would also be
over 28 years including 8 years of grace, during which only interest would
be paid.
B. Procurement and Disbursement
5.10      Procurement.  Contracts for goods and services estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$25,000 or more will be subject to international com-
petitive bidding. This will include the procurement of vehicles, tea
factories and road construction equipment for Bukoba and Lupembe. Because
of their scattered distribution and the relatively small amount involved,
contracts for construction of staff houses and for procurement of office
equipment would not attract international competition and will be awarded
following local competitive bidding. Tea cuttings, mulch, wire for shade
construction and poles, all for nursery development, may be purchased under
negotiated contracts, according to procedures acceptable to the Association.
Any contract for goods and services estimated to cost less than the equiva-
lent of US$5,000 may be awarded on the basis of quotations from local suppliers.
5.11      Procurement of fertilizer will be through international competitive
bidding with a local preference of 15% or the appropriate customs duty, which-
ever is lower.
5.12      Disbursement.  The credit of US$10.5 million would be disbursed
as follows:



- 15 -
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures on processing equipment for
tea factories, road constr-uction machinery for Bukoba and
Lupembe area roads and the services of experts employed by
both Government and TTA - US$2.4 million;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures or 70% of local expenditures
on tea factory buildings, vehicles and spare parts for TTA
leaf collection services and office equipment for TTA head-
quarters, vehicles and spare parts for TTA extension
services, fertilizer and tea planting material - US$3.9
million;
(c)  70% of total expenditures on establishment of nurseries,
construction of roads in Bukoba and Lupembe areas, staff
houses and training facilities for extension services and
services of extension service staff employed by Government
and seconded to the project - US$3.6 million; and
(d)  an unallocated amount of US$.6 million representing
contingencies on the above categories and transferable
to them as required.
5.13      As the project is a continuation of an on-going program, it would
be desirable to finance certain expenditures retroactively to July 1, 1971.
The amount involved is about US$580,000 and consists of: (a) US$85,000 for
TTA's payments to personnel; (b) US$420,000 for cuttings and related
materials for TTA nurseries as these cuttings must be in the ground by
January 1972 so as to mature in time for distribution for the 1972/73
planting season: (c) US$29,000 for leaf collection vehicles required for the
increased output of the first half of calendar 1972; and (d) US$46,000 for
vehicles for extension staff advising new growers.
5.14      Since a phase II project is envisaged following 1976, it is pro-
posed that any excess funds remaining in the credit account at the end of
the disbursement period be cancelled. Applications for disbursement would
be supported by contracts, shipping documents, and certified records of
expenditures. A schedule of estimated disbursements by quarters is shown
in Annex 10.
C. Accounts and Audit
5.15      The system of accounts of TTA, which has been in business for about
two years, requires reorganization to cope adequately with the greatly ex-
panded activities envisaged under the project. During negotiations it was
confirmed by Government that a Financial Controller had recently been
recruited under the US technical assistance program and evidence was
presented at negotiations that the design of a satisfactory accounting
system to record the progress of the project, with a breakdown of all expenses
according to their purpose (extension services, nursery development costs,
leaf collection, factories, central office of TTA) and function (technical



- 16 -
assistance, personnel costs, travel, operation of factories and leaf collect-
ion) had reached an advanced stage. Assurances were obtained during nego--
tiations that the accounts would enable IDA to readily identifv expenditures
in terms of the headings agreed in the credit documents. Assurances were
also obtained that the tea cooperatives receiving loans from TRDB under the
project would maintain individual project grower accounts and that Government
would fornard to the Association, TTA and TRDB, not later than four montlhs
after the end of each fiscal year, a report on the operations and financial
condition of the cooperatives. The tea development cooperative officer and
his staff would be responsible for seeing that these accounts are properly
naintained.
.5.16     The accounts and the general administrative systems and procedures
of the TRDB would be those maintained by its predecessor, NDCA. These
have been found satisfactory in connection with IDA's two previous projects.
.5.17     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that TTA and TRDB
would have their accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to
ithe Association and that their audited accounts and auditors' report would
be furnished to the Association not later than four months after the end of
their financial year.
VI.  ORGANIZATION A4D MANAGEMENT
A. The Tanzania Tea Authority
6.01      TTA was established by the Tea Ordinance, Cap. 291 as amended by
t:he Tea Ordinance (Amendment) Act, 1968 (Annex 4), as a parastatal body
corporate to be responsible for all aspects of smallholder tea development
aIs well as for the functions previously exercised by the Tea Board of
Tanzania. Under the guidance of the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives,
who appoints its members, TTA is empowered to: promote, supervise and
:Lmplement programs for the development of the tea industry, including the
supervision of planting. cultivation and harvesting of tea; inspect plant-
ations and green leaf' negotiate agreements for leaf processing~ organize
the purchase and transportation of green leaf- participate in the establishment,
control and management of tea factories' control tea marketing, and act as a
national marketing agent.  TTA has not to date assumed responsibility for the
t:wo latter activities, which would require the Minister to publish an
enabling order.  TTA is also operating its own nurseries and is producinp
seedlings and clonal planting material for the smallholder program.
6.02      TTA's level of staffing is not adequate to meet future project
requirements and certain changes to the TTA Board's composition and sonme of
iLts procedures (Annex 3, para 7) should be considered by Government.  During
negotiations assurances were obtained that Government would review the level
of TTA staffing and ungrade the more senior positions and those of their
supporting staff.  In doing so the salary levels relating to these posi.tions
would be increased in view of the increased responsibilities, so as to
attract Tanzanians of the highest ability to fill those posts. As a



- 17 -
condition of effectiveness, TTA will be required to employ a Chief Marketing
Officer and a Planning Economist, whose experience and qualifications are
satisfactory to the Association. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that an Accountant with experience and qualifications acceptable to
the Association would be employed before July 1, 1972. His main task will
be to assist the Financial Controller (para 5.15) in the implementation of
the new accounting system and cost control over the four project areas'
activities. Assurances were also obtained that until completion of the
project, TTA will consult with the Association prior to making any changes
in the positions of its Chief Executive, Financial Controller, Accountant,
Planning Economist, Chief Mtarketing Officer and Chief Factory Officer.
B. Extension Services and Staff Training
6.03      TTA is entirely responsible for all advice on tea growing in the
smallholder tea development areas. It has established an organization in
each area headed by an Area Tea Development Officer, who is an agricultural
officer with university training in agriculture and a professional officer
in the Ministry of Agriculture seconded to TTA. Under this officer is a
staff of field officers and assistant field officers of diploma and certif-
icate level, respectively 1/. In addition to their basic training in agri-
culture, these officers receive specialized training in smallholder tea
development at the TRI Center at Amani in Usambara. Future requirements
necessitate construction of new training facilities expected to be located
at 1Kiwira in the Rungwe district.
6.04      At present TTA's extension staff of field officers and assistant
field officers is adequate. M4any of these people are newly qualified and are
still gaining experience and knowledge of the practical problems of tea
development, but their total numbers exceed the ratio of one field officer to
500 farmers and one assistant field officer to 100 farmers that is considered
adequate for project operation. They will therefore be receiving "on-the-
job' training until such time as the number of farmers in each area reaches
the totals planned under the project.
6.05      TTA's extension staff is seconded to it from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives and is under the direct control of TTA for
operational purposes. TTA finances travel costs and is responsible for
providing houses and offices for this staff. However, the Ministry continues
to be responsible for providing and paying the salaries of this staff, and
would therefore cover most of the extension costs of the project without
charge to TTA or the growers, as it does for other crops. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that these arrangements would continue and that
the Mlinistry would supply the appropriate number of extension staff as and
wh1en required by TTA.
1/   Certificate level is reached after two years' training following school
certificate. A diploma requires success in a three-year training course
following school certificate with at least four credits.

C. Smallholder Recruitment
6.06      By the end of fiscal 1969 (July 1, 1968 to June 30, 1909), neariy
4,600 smallholders were growing tea in Tanzania, each averaging about 0.4
'ha. TTA plans to recruit a further 16,000 smallholders during the second
plan period, 1971-74. During fiscal 1970, TTA attracted nearly 2,300 nzv
growers, exceeding its recruitment target of 2,079.  Hlowever, the number of
new growers needed to achieve the planting targets increases rapidly to
almost 9,000 new growers in 1972 (Annex 1, Table 3). Plans for 1971/72 are
well forward, and TTA already has lists of potential smalllholders for t1he
next planting season well in excess of the numbers planned in all arcas.
5.07      TTA relies heavily on help from local leaders and administritive
officers of TANU in mounting intensive grower recruitment campaigns. Tlhese
campaigns have been very successful and there is every indication that they
will continue to be so. The extension services would continue to approve
all individual smallholder plots as being suitable for tea cultivation. Theil
suitability is judged by individual plot inspection and testing of soil depth.
General suitability of soils in the areas has been established by large
scale soil surveys.
15.08     Planting of tea in blocks in contiguous holdings and the formation
of Ujamaa villages, would form part of the campaign, but local strategy would
depend upon plans adopted by the Development Committees in each region.  IWhere--
ver feasible, planting in blocks would be encouraged as this simDlifies grower
recruitment, supervision, and green leaf collection.  For example, in Bukoba,
the blocks planted to tea by individual farmers average about 60 lha planted
over three years by 100 individual farmers. In Lupembe, where the Ujamaa
tievelopment is going ahead rapidly, the 1971 campaign included plantini on
77 Ujamaa farms with an average membership of 27 families. This development
has made achievement of the very ambitious planting targets possible and will
enable further development to take place as planned.
6.09      If fulfillment of the recruiting and planting targets are delayed
by as much as a year, factory construction could also be delayed without
increasing costs. Disbursements by IDA would be delayed as well. Ilowever,
proceeding with the project as appraised is considered justifiable.  Assur-
ances were obtained at negotiations that Government would ensure that the
tea planting program would be phased approximately as set out in Annex 1
Table 3.
D. Leaf Collection
6.10      Leaf collection centers would continue to be established on roads
serving the smallholder areas at selected sites so that growers would not have
to transport their green leaf more than about 3 km to collection centers.
lJntil full development in an area has been achieved and final sites to suit
the actual distribution of smallholders can be selected, these collection cen-
ters would continue to be built of temporary materials supplied and erected
by the growers themselves at no cost to TTA. At full development, sites



- 19 -
would be chosen and collection centers would be constructed of permanent
materials.  Materials available locally and all labor required would be
provided free by growers, but building materials that have to be purchased
would be financed by a loan from TRDB to the cooperative concerned.  The
cooperatives would remain in charge of collection center operations, weighing
and recording, and preparation of leaf for transport to factories. TTA would
be responsible for providing transport and leaf inspection, and for sche-
duling leaf collection from collecting centers to factories. Further
details of green leaf collection arrangements and the types of transport
required are given in Annex 11. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that TTA would coordinate leaf collection schedules and acquire, maintain,
and operate appropriate leaf collection vehicles required for leaf collection
services to the project growers.
E. Processing of Green Leaf
6.11      The projected production of made tea from existing and proposed
smallholder plantings is shown in Annex 12. At present smallholder leaf is
processed in factories at Bukoba and Lupembe and since April 1971, at its
factory at Mfponde in W4est Usambara. The Lupembe factory is owned by TTA.
TTA nowi holds 90% of the Bukoba factory and the Bukoba Corporation Union
holds 10% (para 2.07). Some smallholder leaf in the south of Usambara
would continue to be processed by the privately owned factory at Ambangulu
until such time as a second TTA factory is justified by increased production.
Similarly, the two private factories in Rungwe would continue to process
smallholder tea until TTA's factory, at present under construction at
Katumba, comes into production in early 1972. Thereafter, factory construct-
ion would be phased to process all smallholder leaf in accordance with
Annex 5. The program would ultimately require a total of 10 factories by
1982, most of them with a capacity of 1.7 M kg of made tea per annum. Factories
would be built in three phases to process first 0.57 M, then 1.1 M and
finally 1.7 It kg/p.a. of made tea. Details of factory design and machinery,
and the considerations that led to the choice of factory size, are described
in detail in Annex 5. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that TTA
would construct and operate additional tea factories to provide adequate
processing capacity as required by the tea planting program (para 6.09); and
that TTA would employ contractors acceptable to IDA, upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA.
6.12      TTA intends to manage all of its own factories in the future.  It
is essential that these be supervised by experienced managers, to ensure
that quality tea continues to be produced and to train local management
staff to take over in five or six years' time (Annex 5).  Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that until completion of the project, TTA
would (a) employ a factory manager for each of its tea factories in Mponde,
Lupembe and Katumba, whose experience and qualifications were satisfactory
to IDA, (b) employ an experienced tea processing group or groups as visiting
consultants, acceptable to IDA, for at least two years and on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA and (c) make arrangements satisfactory to IDA
for the sound management of any other factories under its control. Parts



- 20 -
(a) and (b) of this assurance will be conditions of effectiveness of the
credit.
F. Land Clearing
6.13      Most of the Project tea would be planted on land that had already
been cultivated, or, in Bukoba when block planting is carried out, on
grassland. However, a small part of the Usambara area (possibly about -5C
ha) would be cleared from heavy forest. Clearing would be done by hand by
the farmers concerned at no cost to the project over the next three years
Ln preparation for 1974 planting. This clearing of forest areas is corsid-
ered necessary by Government to provide additional income for farmers living
on the forest edge in conditions of considerable population pressure.
G. Credit Channel
6.14      As in Credit 80-TA and 217-TA, and as a part of its institution
building policy, Government wishes to use the TRDB as a credit channel for
:Loans to TTA and cooperatives; TRDB's investment policy is satisfactory to
IDA and assurances were obtained at negotiations that this policy would not
be changed without prior consultation with IDA. As Annex 9, Table 5 shows,
TRDB can expect a considerable income from its participation. The first
seven years alone will yield TRDB an aggregate of about TSh 12.8 million
(US$1.8 million) in net interest revenues.
6.15      Since TTA, with some strengthening, could operate the project
directly (as is the case with the Kenya Tea Development Authority and
Uganda Tea Growers' Corporation), TRDB's inclusion would have two main
effects: it would cause some administrative duplication, and it would bring
about a transfer of funds generated by the tea industry to an institution
which assists development in other sub-sectors of agriculture. As the TTA
would be able to operate effectively without these funds, these costs are
acceptable and, on balance, considered to be in the interests of overall
development.
VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARMERS' BENEFITS
A. Production and Yields
7.01      The utilization of fertilizers has only recently been adopted on
most estates, and average yields have been rising accordingly to the present
level of 900 kg/ha. In addition to ensuring full fertilizer use on small-
holders' tea, TTA is taking steps to introduce improved selected clonal
imaterial for smallholder plantings and by 1974 all planting material will
be vegetatively propagated. The projected yield of smallholder tea has
therefore been increased above the present average as shown in Annex 1,
Table 2. Estimated yields at maturity vary according to the area from
1,010 to 1,300 kg/ha.  They are similar to yields now being obtained in
Kenya and Uganda and are considered to be realistic.



- 21 -
7.02      Production from project plantings would start in 1974, when it is
estimated that 379 metric tons of made tea would be produced. Production
is expected to increase steadily until 1984 (full maturity of project plant-
ings) when project output is estimated at 9,600 tons of made tea. Facilities
for manufacturing and marketing tea would be enlarged as production increases.
Production at maturity would be derived from the four areas as shown below:
Production at Maturity by Area
Production
Area             Tons          Percentage
Rungwe               4,443           46.5
Bukoba               2,106           22.1
Lupembe              2,286           23.9
West Usambara          714             7.5
Total          9,549           100.0
Source: Annex 15.
7.03      Although production from plantings under the project will be about
9.5 M kg., production from all smallholder tea in Tanzania will be about
13.9 M kg from 1984 onward. The 4.3 M kg difference arises because some
smallholder tea was planted as early as 1961 and the additional production
would develop from the early plantings.
B. Marketing and Prices
7.04      Marketing.  Made tea would be transported by lake steamer, road,
and rail to Dar es Salaam or Tanga. From these ports the tea would be shipped
to markets in importing countries, in particular, Mombasa (Kenya), London
and the United States. TTA would be responsible for marketing made tea
and would arrange transport of the tea from factory to port and export. All
tea would be shipped through the State Trading Corporation and TTA would
have a marketing specialist, designated Chief Marketing Officer (para 6.02),
who would work closely with the State Trading Corporation to assure prompt
shipment of tea from Tanzanian ports. It is important that tea be shipped
promptly as it deteriorates with time. He would supervise the marketing and
shipment of tea from Tanzanian ports by TTA. The member countries of the FAO
Study Group on Tea, coordinating tea marketing action internationally, have
received a statement of Bank Group interest in tea generally and have been
informed of the project. No objections have been raised.
7.05      Prices.  Prices for Tanzanian tea are projected at T Sh 7.35/kg
CIF London from 1972 through 1980. After 1980, prices are expected to rise
slightly to about T Sh 7.72/kg. The projected prices are lower than prices
in recent months because a surplus situation is expected to develop in
future world markets (Annexes 12 and 13).



- 22 -
7.06      Marketing Costs.  Costs of transporting made tea from factories to
pcrt vary according to factory location. The lowest costs are for the area
closest to the sea, West Usambara; the highest charges are for the factories
whiich are the greatest distance from the coast, at Bukoba. Transport charges
for Rungwe and Lupembe are expected to decline after 1975 because the Tan-Zamv
Railroad is expected to start running to Dar es Salaam in that year (Annex 12,
Table 1). The cost of shipping tea from Tanzanian ports to London is
estimated at about T Sh 1.16/kg.
C. Farmers' Benefits
7.07      Each farmer participating in the project would receive materiai
to plant about 0.6 ha tea over three years.  Tea farmers are smallholdlers
who now are engaged in subsistence farming and have very little, if any,
cash income. In general, they have two to three acres of subsistence crops
consisting of maize, bananas, pulses, beans, and cassava. Some of them grow
Arabica coffee, but tea would in no case replace coffee. A smallholder
faumily has an average of three to six persons working on the farm and would
have adequate labor resources to provide the 160 man-days of work p.a.
required for 0.6 ha of tea, in addition to operating his existing small-
holding.
7.08      Wages are costed at zero because of the subsistence nature of
fairming in the tea areas, and net cash income per smallholder from tea is
estimated at T Sh 1,782 to T Sh 2,272 p.a. at full maturity, depending
oni the region in which tea is produced (Annex 14). These returns are
attractive to farmers in all tea areas, and there is considerable demand
from farmers to be included in the tea project.
7.09      The net income earned by individual smallholders from growing
tea would be larger than earned from full-time employment of the family head
at the minimum wage for agriculture, T Sh 3.85/day.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Benefits
8.01      The project's principal economic benefit would be larger net
foreign exchange earnings from the export of tea. At project maturity gross
earnings would amount to T Sh 63.6 million (US$8.9 million) and net earnings
would be about T Sh 55.8 million (US$7.8 million). The increase in cash in-
come to farmers (para 7.09) would pave the way for secondary benefits in the
project areas. These benefits have not been quantified, but they would en-
hance the project's economic justification.
8.02      On the basis of yields, production and prices given in Chapter
VII, and of costs given in Chapter V and Annex 8, and assuming a project
life of 50 years, the rate of return to the economy from investments in the
project is estimated at 17% (Annex 15). This rate of return assumes a



- 23 -
zero labor cost. Wages are assumed at 0 because of the very limited
opportunity for employment for cash wages and, in any event, actual wages
even for limited opportunities would not be more than half the legal
minimum wage of T Sh 3.85/day. If labor is priced at T Sh 1.92/day, the
rate of return would be 14.0x.
8.03      Economic rates of return were also developed for each of the areas
but no costs for the central office of TTA were included for these comparison
analyses. The rate of return ran from a high of 24% in Rungwe to a low of
8% in West Usambara for a 50-year period and with wages at zero. If labor
is costed at T Sh 1.92/day being the current average daily rate, the range
is from 19.6% in Rungwe to 5.9% in West Usambara (Annex 15). If central of-
fice costs are allocated to the tea producing areas, the rate of return for
West Usambara would be reduced to 7%, the cost of the factory already com-
pleted in this area being treated as a sunk cost.
8.04      The reasons for the low rate of return for West Usambara are
associated with higher costs for road construction, longer hauls for green
leaf collection, economies of scale in manufacturing and lower yields than
in Rungwe and Bukoba. The yields at full maturity in West Usambara and
Lupembe are estimated at 1,010 Kg/ha, compared with 1,300 and 1,200 Kg/ha
in Bukoba and Rungwe, respectively. The factories to be built in West
Usambara are somewhat smaller than the factories in the other areas and,
therefore, require larger investments and higher operating costs per kilogram
of made tea than in the other areas. Also, the distance for hauling green
leaf from leaf collection centers to the factories are somewhat longer in
West Usambara than in the other areas and leaf collection costs are some-
what higher, due to difficult terrain and longer carries, as shown below:
Costs per Kg
(Tsh)
Factory            Factory          Leaf Collection
Area          Investment       Operating Cost             Cost
Rungwe            1.90               1.41                 0.51
Bukoba            1.46               2.33                 0.57
Lupembe           1.64               2.50                 0.55
West Usambara    3.47                6.28                 1.36
Average         1.86               2.24                 0.60
8.05      The low rate of return for West Usambara poses the question of its
inclusion in the project. The area has at present a small amount of Arabica
coffee grown as a cash crop, plantings of which cannot be increased by in-
ternational agreement. There is a current program for the planting of carda-
moms (a spice) under forest but the market and area suited to cardamoms is
limited. The development of cash crops in the area is desirable to improve
the standard of living and provide employment opportunities, but there is no
alternative development possible other than tea. With these considerations in
view, Government had already embarked upon tea development in the area and
has established nurseries to cover plantings up to 1974; seedlings and V.P.



- 24 -
material for the 1972 and 1973 plantings are already growing in the nursery
beds. In addition a factory to process smallholders' green leaf has al-
ready been completed at Mponde, and will be operating during 1971. TTA
has already recruited growers for the 1971 season, and at present there are
over 200 ha of outgrower tea planted under the scheme in Usambara. Under
these circumstances it would be unrealistic to expect the Government to
cease tea development in this area, and it is in fact fully committed to
continue the program.
8.06      Indirect benefits arise from increasing employment opportunities
which will restrict migration to the towns, thus avoiding an increase
in the social costs involved in supporting the unemployed in the towns. It iG
difficult to assess the value of this benefit. Other indirect benefits from
project investments for West Usambara would arise from the markedly greater
influx of cash to the local economy, at present based largely on subs stence.
This would arise both from income from tea and from employment. Mult-<L1ier
effects would be facilitated by road improvements, allowing the population
greater mobility and easier access for trade. The improved roads would in
fact allow development to expand in all sectors in areas that are presently
isolated by the very steep and mountainous nature of the topography. Con-
sidering these factors and in view of the fact that the IDA commitment in
the area would amount only to US$0.6 million out of a total project commit-
ment of about US$10.5 million, the Usambara area has been included in the
project as requested by Government.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
8.07      Sensitivity analyses were run for each area and for the total
project assuming that the costs were decreased in 10% steps to 80% and that
they were increased in 10% steps to 120% of those shown in Annex 15, Table 1.
Sensitivity analyses were also run for tea prices. Tea prices, CIF London,
were first lowered by 5% and then raised in two steps of 5% each from the
level shown in paragraph 7.05. The results of these sensitivity analyses
are summarized in Annex 15, Table 2.
8.08      A separate sensitivity analysis was run to determine the effect of
variations in fertilizer prices. Fertilizer prices were dropped to 90% and
then 80% of those used in the cost tables and then raised from this level by
10% and 20% (Annex 15, Table 2).
8.09      When all costs were raised to 120%, the rate of return for the
total project declined to 13.4%. Variations in fertilizer costs appeared to
have little effect on the rate of return. Variations in prices received for
tea also had a relatively minor effect. For the total project, the low price
caused the rate of return to decline to 15.9% and the highest price caused
the rate of return to increase to 19.6%, compared with a base rate of 17.3%.
Rates of return for the individual areas showed variations of the same
order of magnitude.

IX. AGREEMNTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) Completion of tea roads in all 4 project areas within
2 years of the signing of the credit agreement and their
subsequent maintenance (paras 4.08 through 4.10), subject
to a condition of effectiveness under 9.03 (a) below;
(b) Strengthening of TTA's accounting system, upgrading and
expanding its staff, adding training facilities and
securing secondment of Government extension staff (paras
5.15, 6.02, 6.03 and 6.05);
(c) Phasing of tea planting program, organization of leaf
collection services and provision of additional tea
factories (paras 6.09 through 6.11);
(d) Terms of loan repayments from cooperatives to TRDB and
submission of tea cooperatives' annual accounts to IDA
(paras 4.18 and 5.15); and
(e) TRDB's investment policy will not be changed without prior
consultation with IDA (para 6.14); TRDB's and TTA's audit
(para 5.17).
9.02      The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the credit:
(a) Government to complete arrangements satisfactory to IDA for
the construction of the project roads in the Rungwe and West
Usumbara areas (paras 4.08 and 4.10); and
(b) TTA to complete arrangments satisfactory to IDA for the
employment of: Chief Marketing Officer, Planning Economist
(para 6.02), Factory Managers and the visiting consultants
(para 6.12).
9.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$10.5 million on standard IDA terms.

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Smallholder Tea Cultivation and Research in East Africa
General
1.        Smallholder tea schemes are already operating in Uganda and Kenya
under Bank Group financing. The proposed project in Tanzania would have
many similarities with these projects and experience in them can in many
cases be directly related. In addition the East African Tea Research
Institute at Kericho in Kenya carries out programs of research on problems
affecting tea production in all the three countries and is financed by them
in proportion to the amount of tea produced.
Nurseries
2.        Most of the nurseries in Tanzania produce seedlings for sale as
stumps at between 18 months and two years of age, as was the case in the ear-
lier days of smallholder tea projects in Kenya and Uganda. This program
(see Annex 1, table 3) is changing as material becomes available to produce
one-leaf cuttings from selected clones by vegetative propagation (V.P.).
Cuttings are grown in polythene sleeves and are ready for planting out from
8-12 months. The ultimate aim is to adopt the system at present practised in
Kenya, where growers produce their own planting material in V.P. nurseries
established on their smallholdings from cuttings supplied from mother bushes
selected and maintained by the Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA).
3.        In general an acre of nursery in Tanzania produces 100,000 plants
gross (about 250,000 per ha). In most of the nurseries inspected by the
appraisal mission a very high percentage of takes both from seed and cut-
tings were observed. TTA estimates that usually 80,000 saleable plants can
be produced per acre of nursery. As can be seen from Table 4 of Annex 1,
TTA would produce sufficient planting material for the project assuming only
60% successes. Full details of nursery practice and all aspects of tea pro-
duction are published in the Tea Growers Handbook 1969 1/, based on the ex-
perience of the Tea Research Institute at Kericho and others. The successes
obtained by the Kericho method of vegetative propagation of cuttings in the
three East African countries is quite remarkable, and the mission saw evidence
of spectacularly successful use of these methods both by Kenya outgrowers
and by TTA in their V.P. nurseries.
1/   Published by the Tea Boards of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and TRI; this
handbook is used as a standard reference book for all tea growers.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Site Selection and Clearing
4.        Soils.  Tea soils should be deep and free draining, without rock
or impermeable pans, to a depth of at least 2 m. They should nevertheless
be moisture retentive and ideally have an acid reaction between pH 4.5 and
5.5, although pH values between 4.0 and 6.0 produce acceptable yields. The
soils of the development areas under the project have been surveyed for depth
and pH values and are satisfactory. Plant nutrient levels are not critical
since fertilizers would be applied as part of the project. A deficiency in
soil copper levels has been found on volcanic ash soils at Rungwe and this
introduces problems in the fermentation of young tea. Semiannual spraying
with copper sulphate cures this condition, but is expensive, and further work
is being carried out on this problem. Fermentation problems decline as the
bushes mature. In Bukoba, sites are selected especially carefully as subsoil
depth varies.
5.        Climate.  All areas selected for tea growing under the project
are at suitable altitudes above sea level, varying from 1,000 to 1,700 m.
Annual rainfall varies from just under 1,400 mm at Usambara to over 2,500
mm in Rungwe, and is generally concentrated between the months of September
and May in Bukoba, and November and May or June elsewhere. In general suf-
ficient rain falls during the dry weather to maintain the bushes at a very
low level of productivity, but very dry conditions are sometimes experienced
in Lupembe and Usambara, and this causes a reduction in average yields (see
Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2).
6.        Clearing.  Most of the tea grown under the project would be
cultivated on existing holdings on soils that have been recently cultivated
so that on these areas there would be no clearing required. In the Bukoba
area, many of the blocks selected for planting are on natural grasslands
where clearing would be minimal. In Usambara, some 150 ha to be planted in
1974 are at present under high forest. Government considers this necessary
to provide additional income for farmers living on the forest edges in condi-
tions of considerable population density. This forest would be cleared grad-
ually over the next three years by hand by the farmers themselves. Trees
would be ring barked, and when dead would be felled and the roots removed as
completely as possible to avoid Armillarea damage to tea planted on newly
cleared land. Timber would be windrowed before burning to avoid raising the
pH of the soils where tea is to be planted.
Soil Conservation
7.        Extension personnel are now being trained to mark out levels on farm-
ers' fields and supervise the carrying out of soil conservation measures
before planting begins. In Tanzania, these measures take the form of
ditches constructed at vertical intervals adjusted to the slope and graded
at 1/2%, discharging to controlled outlets every 1,000 ft.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Planting
8.        Planting is carried out during the rainy months from December
through March. Holes about 60 cm deep and 20 to 30 cm wide are dug at the
recommended spacing of 4 ft by 3 ft along the contour, which gives a plant
population of 8,872 per ha. Fields are inspected by TTA staff for satisfac-
tory soil conservation measures and spacing before stumps or sleeved cuttings
are issued. Stumps are kept wrapped in sacking until planting, after which
they are watered in. Light temporary shade may be provided in the lower al-
titudes during sunny weather. Fertilizers are mixed with the soil from the
planting holes. In Bukoba, grass cut from surrounding fields is laid on the
ground as a mulch after planting.
9.        TTA estimates that about 83% of the stumps planted survives the
first two years and adequate material is provided from its nurseries to in-
fill the stumps that have died during the first two growing seasons.
Weeding and Mulching
10.       This is usually carried out by hand, using hoes or forks for
couch grass. Where the problem is severe, the use of herbicides such as
"dalapon" is growing in popularity. In Bukoba, plots are mulched annually
by using grass cut from nearby fields, until the crop forms its own
ground cover, usually in about the third year after planting at the recom-
mended spacing. All areas also use pruned material as a mulch.
Bringing into Bearing
11.       The lower parts of the branch system of tea bushes will form
the permanent frame which will remain largely unaltered throughout the
lifetime of the bush concerned. This frame should be low, strong, and
have a good spread. Two systems of bringing bushes into bearing, pruning
and pegging, have been developed by TRI and both are being used in the
Tanzania smallholder tea development.
12.     (a)    Pruning
(i)  After about one year's growth, stump plants should
be pruned at 8" (20 cm) from the ground when most
shoots are 1 cm thick at that height. A second
pruning at 16" (40 cm) should follow after about
two years of growth when most shoots are 1 cm thick
at that height. Thereafter tipping should be carried
out for about three rounds at a height of 24" (60 cm).
This consists of removing all shoots as soon as they
have developed three leaves and a bud above that
height. No tipping or plucking should be done between
formative prunes.
(ii) Sleeved clonal plants tend to develop a strong main
stem which should be checked at an early stage to



ANNEX 2
Page 4
encourage strong lateral branching. However, they
do not possess root reserves to support the development
of new leaves and shoots unaided, so pruning should be
delayed if the bush does not possess adequate leaves
below the pruning level. When the plant is about
30 cm tall, the main stem is pruned back to 15 cm
above the ground. Lateral shoots are not cut back
at this stage. Next all shoots are pruned at 28 cm
when most shoots are 1 cm thick at that height. A
second pruning is subsequently carried out at 40 cm
before tipping at 60 cm as for stump plants.
(b)    Pegging. When shoots have reached a height of between
45 cm and 60 cm, they should be pegged down to the
ground using wood or wire pegs. Shoots should be
distributed evenly around the main stem; usually
between three and five such stems should be pegged.
The terminal leaf and bud are removed from each stem
so pegged. The bush should now be tipped at a height
of about 45 cm for at least five rounds. It can be
seen that pegged bushes will come into bearing con-
siderably in advance of pruned fields.
Pruning
13.       After a few years the increase in height of the plucking table,
and the increase in the number of shoots per bush which leads to a decrease
in the size of each shoot, bring about a decrease in plucking efficiency
and yields. Under Tanzania conditions it is desirable to prune back the
table to about 2 inches above the last prune every three years or so.
This process should continue until the table becomes too high for com-
fortable plucking, when a prune to about 45 cm should be carried out and
a new pruning cycle commenced. All prunings are placed on the field as
a mulch. Pruning is carried out with a specially designed pruning knife
which must be kept very sharp. A specially marked stick is used to
measure the heights of the different prunes.
Plucking
14.       The object of plucking is to provide the factory with leaf suitable
for processing into good quality made tea. The aim is to pluck a shoot con-
taining two leaves and a bud. Plucking can be carried out at intervals
ranging from five days to two weeks depending on growing conditions. Good
plucking produces a level surface or 'table' which is held parallel to the
ground surface. Smallholder plucking will be controlled to some extent by
leaf collection schedules, which must be adjusted as much as possible to
suit growing conditions.
15,.      During periods of adverse growing conditions due to cold or
drought, the tea bush produces a larger proportion than usual of shoots
onI which the apical bud is dormant. This is known as a "bhanji" shoot.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
These should normally be plucked as soon as they rise above the plucking
surface, otherwise they will harden and cannot be manufactured. During
periods of adverse conditions, however, they should be left on the plant.
Fertilizers
16.       Compound fertilizers have been used by smallholders since 1968
and TrA intends to continue their use in future. The annual applications
proposed are below those recommended in Uganda, where growing conditions are
somewhat better, and increased rates of applications may be encouraged in
future years, depending upon the results of field trials at present underway,
and the increased use of clonal material. At present a 25.5.5 compound is
used in gradually increasing annual or semiannual applications, following
the initial use of triple super phosphate and sulphate of potash at planting
time. Applications of 25.5.5 fertilizer commence at 180 kg/ha and rise to
460 kg/ha during the 4th year after planting, and thereafter.
Tea Diseases and Pests
17.       There are no diseases or pests of tea in Tanzania that would
be of major concern to the smallholder tea development program. The most
serious disease is Armillarea mellea, a fungus of worldwide distribution
that lives on the dead roots of forest trees. This is only locally serious
on tea that has been newly planted on poorly cleared forest areas. It can
be prevented by the complete clearing of roots from the soil before planting
commences.
Shade and Windbreaks
18.       Recent work at Kericho has shown that at higher altitudes shade
reduces yields of tea in East Africa. Hence there are no plans for shade
tree planting under the development program in Tanzania. However, where
tea is grown in blocks or on ujamaa farms of any great extent, windbreaks
would be beneficial, and farmers would be encouraged to plant them.
Irrigation
19.       There are no plans for irrigating tea under the project.  However,
irrigation trials are progressing at Mufindi, where rainfall is badly dis-
tributed, with very promising results. Any extension of the present project
in future should have reliable results from these trials on which to base a
judgment as to whether the extension of tea growing in Tanzania into areas
that required supplementary irrigation would be justified.

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Staff and Technical Assistance Requirements
General
1.        The Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA) and its functions are described
in Chapter VI of this report and Annex 4 shows the ordinance establishing
TTA as a parastatal body. At its present level TTA's staff would not be
able to carry out its functions effectively under the expanded activities
envisaged under the project. Considerable expansion of staff and facilities
would be necessary, and some technical assistance from external sources would
be provided until appropriately qualified Tanzanian nationals had acquired
the experience to enable them to take over the posts concerned. Certain
changes in TTA's Board and its present procedures are also considered desir-
able.
TTA's Staff
2.        The level of the Executive Officer's appointment is at present
tihat of Assistant Director of Agriculture in the Ministry, and subordinate
staff posts are adjusted accordingly. As it will be necessary to increase
TTA's headquarters staff considerably to accommodate its increased responsi-
bilities under the project, the level of appointment of the Executive Offi-
cer should be raised to that of Director of a Department of the Ministry,
and his title changed to that of General Manager. The level of his subordi-
nate staff posts should also be raised appropriately to accommodate their
enhanced responsibilities.
Technical Assistance
3.        Fully qualified and experienced financial analysts, cost account-
ants and planning economists are not easily available to TTA, and these posts
may require temporary appointments from overseas until local staff have be-
come experienced. In addition a Tea Marketing Specialist with experience in
the trade overseas will be essential to help TTA in its marketing functions.
4.        TTA has already made overseas appointments to the posts of Finan-
cial Controller and Chief Factory Officer at headquarters and Chief Tea
Maker at the Lupembe factory. Four Tea Development Officers have been recruited
from India and Ceylon to help the Area Tea Development Officers operating in
Bukoba, Uisambara, Rungwe and Lupembe. However, experienced tea factory
managers are not available locally and Government does not wish to engage
Managing Agents for the newly acquired smallholders factory at Lupembe, nor
for the newly erected factory at Mponde, or that being erected at Rungwe.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
I't is vital therefore that experienced expatriate factory managers be employed
t:o be responsible for the operation of these factories under the Chief Factory
Officer, until such time as local managers are adequately trained and
experienced. It will be equally vital for TTA to employ a suitable tea
group or groups as visiting Consultants for at least the initial 2 years,
to make available to the management both at headquarters and the tea
factories their knowledge and experience and assist with the training of
f'uture tea factory managers. These proposals on staff and expatriate
technical assistance posts are described graphically in the Chart attached
to this Annex.
The Tea Authority Board
5.        Present Position.  Under the Tea Ordinance, Cap 291, as amended by
t:he Tea Ordinance (Amendment) Act, 1968, the Minister of Agriculture appoints
miembers of the Board at his discretion.  At present the Board consists of:
- One member representing the Minister, as Chairman;
it " "    nominated by the Minister of Finance;
_ to   t    "         Development Planning;
_~ I          "  "       "            " "  Commerce;
representing the tea trade;
- Four members representing growers' cooperatives.
6.        A Standing Committee composed of the Chairman, the three other
M'inisterial representatives, one cooperative member, and the Executive
Officer of TTA as Secretary, carries out all regular business between Board
meetings, which are convened by the Chairman as and when he deems appropriate.
In effect, TTA's business is carried out by this Standing Committee.
7.        Proposed Development.  The Executive Officer as Secretary of
the Standing Committee should also be a full member of the Board, and
act as its Secretary. In addition the present arrangement under which
the Standing Committee in effect excludes the Board from any effective
function, narrows the base on which decisions affecting the tea industry
as a whole are taken. The Board should be brought more into the picture
of development and should be responsible for confirming all decisions
taken by the Standing Committee before they can become effective. As the
smallholder development proceeds it will be essential for the government
members of the Board to keep in very close contact with the growers' repre-
sentatives; Board meetings should be more frequent than is the case at pres-
ent; and the quorum should be increased to include at least three unofficial
members.

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Factory Design, Phasing and Management
Factory Design
1.        Tea factory buildings throughout the world are not built to a
specific design because of the various types of manufacture used. However,
in Tanzania, it is generally accepted that the Rotorvane/CTC type manufac-
ture produces a good quality tea readily saleable on the export market,
and it is therefore recommended that this process be used for all factories
in the project.
2.        The design of the new Mponde Factory in West Usambara is based
on CTC manufacture but could be improved by allowing more space in the
processing department. Future designs should incorporate this suggestion
and two bays should be allocated to each production line. When computing
factory construction costs and machinery required, allowances have been
made for this.
3.        The withering building at Mponde factory was designed for single
troughs as opposed to the double deck troughs used on other estates. This
is considered wasteful in terms of building and roof space, and in future
designs consideration should be given to using the double deck troughs.
Mono-rail conveyors suitably placed in the department will reduce labor
costs of handling leaf.
Factory Capacity
4.        Quality control is essential to the success of the project.
Such control can only be achieved by first class manufacture of tea
in factories which are of a manageable size. These factories must be
readily controllable during the peak cropping months. The criteria
would appear to be governed more by the machinery which has to be main-
tained and run correctly than by the flow of green leaf being processed.
Thus a three-drier factory producing 1.7 M kg of tea is considered the maxi-
mum that one manager and his assistants can readily supervise and that can
be expected to produce good quality tea the whole year around.
5.        The table below shows the throughput and basic machinery
requirements of a 1.7 M kg factory in three stages, and from this it can be
seen that during maximum output, 13,600 kg will be processed in one day.
The clests in which tea is dispatched from factories contain an average 50 kg
net of black tea, and therefore 270 chests must be packed each day if a large
accumulation of dry tea which would result in marked deterioration of quality
is to be avoided. The dispatch of tea from the factory will in all



ANNEX 5
Page 2
cases be by lorry transport, and the quantity will in itself present a
problem if anything larger than 1.7 M kg is built.

Factory Phasing
6.        Rungwe Area.  At present all smallholder leaf is manufactured
by private factories, but the first TTA factory at Katumba is now being
built and will be operational by the end of 1971. In view of the decision
to standardize in 1.7 M kg factories, the smallholders' leaf would ultimately
be processed in four factories. The location of each factory is shown in
Mcp 2.  Each factory would expand to capacity as production increases.  The
phasing of the factories is shown in Table 1.
7.        Bukoba Area.  The existing factory would expand to 1.7 M kg made
tea. as production increases and if the estimated production is maintained it
would reach capacity by fiscal 1978. In the same year, the second factory
at Katoke would be started and completed to phase I. This factory would
gradually expand as production increases and would complete phase III by
fiscal 1982. The combined output of both factories would be 3.4 M kg which
is adequate for the anticipated yield of 3,113,000 kg made tea from the
Bukoba area.
8.        Lupembe Area.  The existing factory would be expanded to a
capacity of 1.7 M kg made tea by fiscal 1976. There is adequate space to
enlarge this factory which would result in only two factories being required
in the area. In fiscal 1977, the second factory at Ukalawa (Map 4) would be
built to phase I and this would also increase in capacity to 1.7 made tea by



ANNEX 5
Page 3
fiscal 1981. The expected yield from smallholder tea in the area is 3,404,000
kg by 1984.
9.        West Usambara Area.  Due to the very mountainous terrain in the
area it is doubtful if a site could be found for a 1.7 M kg factory. The
existing TTA factory at Mponde, due to start manufacture in March 1971, can
be expanded to manufacture 1,130,000 kg only, and this would be achieved by
fiscal 1978. However, after that year, the crop increases quickly to the
estimated maximum of 1,589,000 kg made tea. Therefore the second factory to
be built in the Sakare area would be started in 1978 and completed in 1979.
This factory would only have a capacity of 570,000 kg.
10.       The existing factory would be increased in capacity to 1,130,000
kg because most smallholders are to the north of the area and the site is
satisfactory for a larger factory. A large site in the Sakare area would be
difficult to obtain, but should present less problems for a small factory
limited to phase I production.
Factory Management
11.       There are at present two smallholder factories operating, one at
Bukoba and one at Lupembe. These factories also manufacture leaf from
parastatal estates adjacent to the factories.
(a) The Bukoba tea factory is jointly owned by the National
Development Corporation and the Bukoba Cooperative Union.
Additional machinery to expand capacity has been financed
by the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA) and the
factory is managed by a firm of managing agents who supply
the management staff (George Williamson Ltd., U.K.).
(b) The Lupembe tea factory is owned by the Lupembe Cooperative
Society but TTA assumed managerial control early in 1971
and has invested capital borrowed from NDCA for expanding
the capacity and replacing worn-out machinery.
12.       TTA intends to manage all its own factories in future, but it is
essential that they be supervised by experienced managers who should be re-
cruited internationally to ensure that quality teas continue to be produced
and to train management staff to take over in the future.
13.       Power Supply.  It has been assumed that the Tanzania Electricity
Supply Company (TANESCO) will supply power to all factories in the proj-
ect and assurances were obtained from the supply company to this effect.
The cost of access lines to each factory is included in the first stage
of each factory. Wiring and switch gear will expand at each stage. All
factories are situated some distance from the source of power and in
countries where rainfall is high, there are bound to be power cuts during
peak periods. It is therefore essential that a certain percentage of
standby power be guaranteed. The cost of diesel electric generating
sets to cover one-third of the required power has been included in the



ANNEX 5
Page 4
first stage. In the event of a power cut, when leaf is in the factory
or being processed, the standby equipment will be sufficient to keep the
withering fans operating, thus preventing the green leaf from deteriorating
beyond use when power is resumed. Tea in the driers will burn if left
in the machines for longer than half an hour. With limited standby power,
the factories could also operate at low capacity instead of completely
closing down.
14.       Evacuation of Tea to Port.  In all cases, packed teas will be
evacuated from factories by lorries and/or rail. The distance from factory
to railhead or port varies with each area and in some cases, notably Bukoba,
it is well over 1,000 km. The West Usambara factories are situated only
70--100 km from the port of Tanga.
15.       The Bukoba factory now dispatches packed tea by road to Dar-e-
Sa:laam because of heavy losses incurred when transshipment is made at
Mwanza (a port at the south end of Lake Victoria) to railway wagons. A
new port is to be constructed south of Bukoba township and this will
be operational in 1973. This port will handle rail ferry cargo so that
in future all teas from this area will be loaded from lorries directly
into wagons for transportation to Dar-es-Salaam port.
16.       Teas from the Rungwe area are now transported direct to Dar-
es--Salaam by lorry but when the new Tanzania/Zambia Railway is complete
they will be loaded into wagons at Mbeya and taken to Dar-es Salaam by
rail. The same will apply for Lupembe, but for this area the loading
station will be approximately 100 km north of the factories. The railway
is scheduled to operate in 1975/76.
17.       West Usambara factories present the least problems for evacua-
ticin. The new Mponde factory tea will be taken by road to a railhead at
Momibo (a small town south of Lushoto) and the second factory tea will
be transported to Korogwe at the foot of the Usambara mountains. In
each case, the distance from the port is relatively short and in the
region of 100 km.
MaxLufacturing Process and Techniques
18.       Green Leaf Reception and Withering.  Grower's green leaf arrives
at the factory in open weave bags, transported on trailers. The leaf is
then check-weighed and placed in withering troughs, spread evenly to a
depth of approximately 20 cm. With this spreading, one trough will accom-
modate 1,150 kg of leaf. The trough bed should be 2.4 m wide and 20 m long.
Provided all troughs are fitted with reversible fans and conditioned air
supplied to each trough by means of steam radiators, a good even wither will
be possible throughout the year. Since it is essential that the leaf be
levelled off during the withering process, a 0.7 m passageway should be de-
signed between each trough. This will also facilitate unloading of the trough
for processing the leaf. The withering process for CTC manufacture usually
takes between 16-20 hours, but will vary with climatic changes.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
19.       Leaf Processing - Sifting.  When the leaf has withered to the
correct degree for CTC manufacture (this is considered to be between
68% and 72%) it is passed over a green leaf sifter to extract sand and
other extraneous matter before the leaf passes through the Rotorvane
and CTC machines.
20.       Rotorvane/CTC Machines.  A modern CTC machine cuts the leaf
twice and operates in conjunction with the Rotorvane. The output of
this unit is sufficient to keep one 6-foot-wide modern drier working
to capacity. Costs also include spare rollers for the CTC machine
which must be kept sharp the whole time. No allowance has been made
for roller sharpening equipment but as this is a specialized job carried
out by a lathe turner, it would be more satisfactory if the work were
carried out by private factories, who have the equipment. Bukoba is
the only area where private factory facilities are not available, but
the Bukoba Cooperative Union Workshop has good facilities and can carry
out this work as at present.
21.       Fermenting.  A new type of fermenting machine has been installed
in the new West Usambara Tea Factory at Mponde. Experiments using this
machine for CTC manufacture have not proved satisfactory in Kenya but the
suppliers have modified the machine and further tests are awaited. If
the fermenting machine can be made to work efficiently and produce good
quality teas, then a saving could be made in factory buildings, but at
present there are doubts about this. One fermenting unit of machine is
required for each production line. Further orders for these machines
should not be placed until more information concerning its effectiveness
under Tanzania conditions is available.
22.       Driers and Fuel.  The use of six-foot hot feed driers is
recommended for all factories. These machines have a guaranteed output
of 270 kg of made tea per hour when operating on steam. It is essential
that steam be used because the drier chamber temperature differs greatly
from the feeder unit temperature and this is impossible to control from
one stove. The boilers will also provide steam for heating the radiators
for withering. The type of fuel to be used will vary with the areas
in which the factories are located. In the West Usambara and Bukoba
the only fuel available is heavy fuel oil, but in Rungwe and Lupembe
coal is available and Government has taken over the coal mine at Ilima,
situated south of the tea areas. Fuel oil is expensive in these districts
and will remain so until the Tanzania/Zambia Railway is complete. There is
a possibility that TTA will obtain oil from the Tanzania/Zambia oil pipeline,
but no information could be obtained on this.
23.       Sorting and Packing.  Modern sorting machinery is compact and
takes up little room. It is as efficient as the old type and has there-
fore been recommended. The vibroscreen sorters produce good clean grades
quickly, but this is not the only consideration of this department. As
the factory stages progress, more tea has to be handled daily and extra
space is required for bulking and packing. An extra bay has therefore
been allowed for in each stage.

24.       The tea trade in London has not yet accepted a change from
plywood chests to cardboard containers but the latter are being manufac-
tured and are accepted by other importing countries. This should be
kept under constant review, as it will reduce both purchase price and assem-
bly costs. The cardboard containers used must conform to the standard metric
tea chest sizes of 40 cm x 50 cm x 60 cm and 40 cm x 40 cm x 60 cm. These
sizes; are used worldwide in the trade and are suitable for palletizing.
25.       Insurance and freight costsaAan be reduced if all teas are pal-
letized either at the factory or on the coast, and some importing countries
will not accept teas that are not palletized. This also must be kept under
constant review by TTA.
26.       Grades.  The normal principal grades and expected percentages
of Cl'C tea are:
- BPI (Broken Pekoe one)
-  PF  (Pekoe Fannings)              77% to 82%
- PD (Pekoe Dust)
- BP (Broken Pekoe)
-  Fngs  (Fannings)                  17% to 14%
- D I (Dust one)
- BP II (Broken Pekoe two)
-  Fngs II  (Fannings two)           6% to 4%
- D II (Dust two)

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Road Works
Introduction
1.        Reliable transport is essential to ensure prompt delivery of
good quality green leaf to the factories. The largest production of
green leaf occurs during and following the heaviest rains, when produc-
tion may approach 1% of the annual totals on several days and when roads
are prone to structural failure. With inadequate roads, collection
vehicles may not be able to reach the buying centers, resulting in
complete loss of plucked leaf; or delivery may be delayed, resulting in
low quality tea.
2.        Road location and design standards, the leaf collection system
and factory size and location are all interrelated. In Tanzania, roads
will be the sole means of transport within the producing areas for ex-
tension personnel, stumps, fertilizers, green leaf and made tea.  Only
leaf collection and access roads within the four major producing areas are
recommended for early improvement under the project, since major transport
routes from producing areas to the ports are satisfactory or are being
improved to satisfactory standards.
3.        All-weather roads can be constructed at relatively low cost
in all four major producing areas. With flexible geometric standards,
roads can be designed to follow the existing topography, thus keeping
excavation to a minimum. The present condition of the riding surfaces
is the most serious obstacle to all-weather travel. In three of the
areas, local gravels are suitable for surfacing, but crushed stone is
recommended in West Usambara. The use of local gravel or crushed stone
for maintenance would gradually increase the bearing strength of the sub-
grades.
Road Routing
4.        A total of 300 km of road would be improved as shown below:
Rungwe          105 km
Bukoba           85
Lupembe          75
Usambara         35
Total     300 km



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        In the Rungwe area the road from Kyimo to Lugombo is included
in a separate feeder road project and therefore is not included under
the tea roads. The maximum distance a farmer should carry his leaf to
a road is considered to be 1.5 km and about the same distance along the road
to the nearest collection center. In general, alignments were chosen to
follow ridge lines and existing terrain, thus keeping earthworks and drainage
to a minimum (Map 2).
6.        In the Bukoba area route selection is based on the same
criteria as described in paragraph 5 above (Map 3).
7.        In Lupembe (Map 4), all proposed routings follow existing
alignments or paths.
8.        In West Usambara (Map 5), a main spine road from Bumbuli to
Dindira is included in a separate feeder road development project and
is omitted from the proposed tea roads. Equipment used for tea road
construction will also be used for the feeder road project. It is recommended,
however, that the Mponde factory-Vuga road should be improved to the
junction with the Mombo-Soni road. This road extension would provide a
short route for the transport of made tea from the factory to the trunk
road and railhead at Mombo.
Financing and Timing
9.        It is expected that Norway will finance the improvement of tea
and feeder roads in the Rungwe and West Usambara areas. As a result, the
project will only be required to finance tea roads in the Bukoba and Lupembe
regions, at a cost of T Sh 9,796,000.
10.       It is anticipated that Norwegian finance will be available in
late 1971/early 1972. The proposed road improvements in the Rungwe and
West Usambara regions would be completed by about January 1973 and September
1972, respectively.
11.       Construction on the Bukoba and Lupembe areas would probably
start in the ninth month and be finished in the 13th or 14th month
after the start of the project.
Execution of Work
12,       The most practical and economical method of improving the
roads would be by the use of independent construction units. It is
also trhe intention of Norway that separate construction units be used in the
Rungwe and Usambara areas.
13.       The units would operate under the control of Comworks.  Comworks
would assign an experienced senior road engineer to coordinate this work
and to ensure that the necessary priorities with regard to the road improve-
ments are realized. He would be supported by another senior engineer acting



ANNEX 6
Page 3
as Project Road Manager for Bukoba and Lupembe. It is understood that
the Rungwe and West Usumbara areas would also be supervised by a Road
Manager with a staff complement similar to that used in Bukoba and Lupembe.
14.       The tea roads would be constructed to the following road design
standards:
Width           :Minimum 7.50 m between centers of side drains.
Cross-Section  :Barreled cross-section; center line level minimum
40 cm above invert of side drains.
Surfacing       :Gravel or crushed stone, 3 m wide, to a minimum
thickness of 10 cm.
15.       As the construction requirements vary within each area, the
composition of each unit would not be the same with regard to plant
and staff. Proposals on the plant and staff composition of the units
are given in Tables 1 and 2.
16.       The economic operation of construction units depends on
experienced supervision to ensure maximum output from the plant in con-
junction with a minimum of detailed design. Proposals on the necessary
supervisory staff for each of the units are given in Table 2.
17.       Each unit should also be provided with adequate mechanical
maintenance facilities and spares to ensure a minimum of "down time" on
plant. Comworks' Project Coordinator should be given financial control
over the funds available for the works. This control avoids the consider-
able delays which can occur when approval is required for nominal expendi-
ture necessary to keep the unit operating efficiently.
18.       On completion of road improvement works, the construction units
would be passed over to the regional engineers of Comworks to supplement their
resources and ensure adequate maintenance on the additional roads. The amount
and type of plant from the "units" would be an excess of requirements for
maintenance, but this excess would be utilized by the regional engineers for
improvement of further feeder roads within the districts. Comworks would also
have the responsibility of maintaining all tea roads after initial improvement
and construction, and the unit equipment would be sufficient to carry out the
maintenance of district roads in addition to the roads constructed under the
project.
19.       Additional staff would be required for maintenance commitments.
This staff would participate in a training scheme attached to the construc-
tion units during the construction period. To fulfill these requirements,
each expatriate needed to supervise the construction units would be
training a Tanzanian assistant.
20.       Field staff and plant operators would also be assigned to the
"units" for specific periods for training purposes.

21.       All structures required to dispose of rainfall runoff, other
than structures with abutments, are included under minor drainage which
primarily consists of round and arched corrugated pipe culverts. Major
drainage includes bridges and larger culverts with abutments. Bridge
decks would be constructed from precast units to simplify erection and
to minimize the down time for existing bridges, which would require
redecking and would be out of use during construction.
Costs
22.       The cost of road improvement is estimated at T Sh 22,226,000
for all areas. However, Norway is expected to improve the roads in
Rungwe and West Usambara. Therefore, the project costs include only
the costs for Bukoba and Lupembe estimated at T Sh 9,796,000 (Table 3).

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TANZANIA RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (TRDB)
Background
1.        TRDB was created by the "Tanzania Rural Development Bank Act,
1971" with the following objectives: to make available long- and medium-term
finance for rural development; to provide technical assistance and advice for
the purpose of promoting rural development; to administer such special funds
as may from time to time be placed at its disposal; to finance the purchase
of agricultural input; to undertake such other activities as may be necessary
or advantageous for the purpose of furthering the foregoing objectives.
2.        The creation of the new institution required the approval of IDA
(formalized by an amending agreement signed on April 28, 1971) because TRDB
was to take over certain agreed assets and corresponding liabilities as well
as operations from the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA), an insti-
tution handling a major part of Tanzania's agricultural credit including
IDA Credits 80-TA (US$5 million agricultural credit) and 217-TA (US$9 million
Flue-Cured Tobacco). TRDB took over almost all of the NDCA staff and all its
offices and equipment including its field offices. Basically, TRDB will
carry on with all NDCA's activities, broadening these as explained below
(para 10). Certain assets of NDCA were not transferred to TRDB. These
consisted of loans unlikely to be repaid which were either inherited by NDCA
from its predecessor institutions or made as a part of unsuccessful Government
loan programs. The classes and amounts of these loans were agreed with IDA
prior to the creation of TRDB and an understanding reached that these uncol-
lectable loans (worth about T Sh 31 million or US$434,000 equivalent, being
about 30% of all loans) would remain with NDCA which would eventually be
liquidated.
Organization and Management
3.        TRDB has a board of directors consisting of a chairman appointed
by the President of the Republic, and eight other directors appointed by the
Minister of Finance and chosen from among persons with knowledge and experience
of economic and financial matters, rural development, agriculture, small-scale
industries, ujamaa villages or cooperatives. The chairman acts simultaneously
as the managing director. Next is the general manager appointed by the
Minister of Finance for a term of five years, responsible for day-to-day
operations. The head office is in Dar-es-Salaam and there are 19 field
offices. The total staff is about 70, of which about half are at the head
office.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        The present senior head office staff includes the posts of chief
accountant and financial analyst, both of which have been filled with expat-
riate officers with IDA's approval under Credit 80-TA, disbursed by
June 30, 1971 and carried forward as one of the conditions of Credit 217-TA.
Further senior posts include an economist and a legal officer, both of whom
have worked for NDCA for over two years. It is intended to broaden the
former NDCA rural coverage in order to tackle TRDB's enhanced objectives and
in this connection the newly appointed chairman-managing director and
general manager are preparing projections of additional staff requirements
with emphasis on a development section with competent technical staff able
to assist applicants with advice and preparation of projects relating to
crops, livestock, fisheries, cottage industries and farm management.
Resources
5.        Under the TRDB Act, 1971, the authorized capital is T Sh 100 mil-
lion in 100 shares of T Sh 1 million each, which may only be taken up by
Government. Should the authorized capital be increased above T Sh 100 mil-
lion, the President of the Republic may direct that such additional capital
may be allotted in whole or part to a parastatal body. The opening balance
sheet of TRDB, emanates from the agreed assets and liabilities transferred
to iLt from NDCA.
6.        Based on the tangible assets to be transferred, the initial sub-
scriLbed capital will be 25 shares or T Sh 25 million and a reserve of 0.2
million. Other resources of TRDB will comprise short-term obligations
including short-term deposits of about T Sh 10.5 million, IDA funds T Sh 29.8
mil]Lion, various deposits T Sh 1.2 million and a bank overdraft of T Sh 7.0
million. The overdraft originally contracted by NDCA at 7% per annum from the
NatiLonal Bank of Commerce for the financing of a Government-directed tractor
loani program, is due to be converted into a long-term loan on soft terms
witlhin six months of TRDB's commencement in business; Government's undertaking
to l:hat effect has been received by IDA as a part of the transfer agreement.
The total resources will therefore amount to approximately T Sh 73.7 million.
7.        Under the TRDB Act, 1971, TRDB may by a board resolution, sub-
jeci: to the approval of the Minister of Finance, call up further capital
from Government (Section 5.2) and in particular it may do so when funds are
required for contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization
on TRDB's ordinary borrowing (Section 15.2). TRDB will also administer
fundls designated "special" which will be furnished by Government for the
purpose of making loans on concessionary terms (see para 10 below).
Use of Resources
8.        The assets to be transferred to TRDB will consist of about
T Sh 60.0 million (net of T Sh 6.7 million provision for doubtful debts) of
loans and mortgages, the bulk of which consists of short-term loans (35%),
medium- and long-term loans (26%), IDA loans (31%) and sundry advances
(8%),. The current assets of T Sh 12.9 million are mainly liquid funds and



ANNEX 7
Page 3
the balance of T Sh 0.8 million is in fixed assets, giving total assets of
T Sh 73.7 million.
Lending Operations
9.        During the last few years, the bulk of NDCA's lending was to the
cooperative unions and a limited number of primary societies. The various
procedures and administrative systems have been satisfactory. Generally,
the accumulation of bad debts (para 2) was caused by badly conceived lending
programs carried out under Government directives rather than inadequate
administration. The bulk of current lending has been dominated by loans
under the two IDA projects of which the Flue-Cured Tobacco project will sub-
stantially enhance TRDB's operations over the next few years. Under this
project the difficulty of collecting the participating farmers' repayments has
been overcome by the deduction of repayments by the processing plants. A
similar system would be adopted by the proposed Tea Development project: the
tea growers would receive payments for green leaf net of a repayment deduc-
tion, which would then be remitted monthly in bulk to TRDB.
10.       It is Government's intention that TRDB will have a "soft
window" for the financing of development projects as determined by Government
policy. Government will provide special funds for these lending programs
under Section 10 of the TRDB Act, 1971 (para 7). The special funds will be
administered separately from TRDB's ordinary funds and expenses relating to
these special operations will be charged against the special funds. TRDB
will therefore need to develop adequate procedures for the allocation of all
its special fund administrative expenses including a share of the general
overhead in order to ensure that its ordinary resources do not subsidize the
special operations undertaken on concessionary terms.
Financial Position and Profitability
11.       TRDB will go into business with sufficient liquid resources
and a portfolio divested of apparent bad and doubtful loans. With the im-
plementation of Credit 217-TA and the proposed Tea Development project, it
should be able to build up a sound operation. As the major part of its re-
sources will consist of equity and IDA funds, passed on to it by Government
at an average of below 4% per annum, onlent at an average rate of over 6% per
annum, it will have a reasonable margin to cover its working expenses, provided,
however, that the intended extension into additional rural areas is undertaken
within the limits of its prospective income, the costs of administering Goverr-
ment's special (concessionary) loans fully recovered and debt collection
effectively controlled.
Accounts and Audit
12.       The present accounting system of NDCA, which will be continued by
TRDB, is satisfactory. NDCA has in the past been audited by Cooper
Brothers, Public Accountants, Dar es Salaam, and the last annual accounts
(March 31, 1970) carry an unqualified clean audit certificate. TRDB is
required by the Act to be audited by the Tanzania Audit Corporation, (TAC) a



ANNEX 7
Page 4
Government institution. IDA has not had previous experience with TAC and
it should reserve the right to require at any time an independent audit to
be carried out by a person or firm of professional accountants nominated by
it. TRDB would be required to submit to IDA its audited annual accounts and
TAC's audit certificate not later than four months after the close of its
finaancial year.
Project Participation
13.       TRDB would act as a credit channel for loans to TTA and the
cooperatives. To TTA it will channel funds for the tea factories'
processing equipment and buildings, vehicles and spares for leaf collection
services, establishment of nurseries and headquarters office equipment.
To the cooperatives it will make available loan funds for on-lending to
project growers for tea stumps and fertilizer.
14        TRDB would receive the project funds at 4% p.a. for a term of
28 years including 8 years of grace, and on-lend them at 8-1/2% p.a. TTA
would be given a similar repayment term. The cooperative loans would be
repaid by a deduction of T Sh 0.20 from each kg of green leaf brought to
the factories and this would be remitted directly to TRDB by TrA with noti-
fication of details to the relevant cooperative. At this rate the deduction
would repay the cooperative loan within 13 - 15 years including 3 - 5 years
of grace. Interest would be capitalized during the grace period because of
insufficient income.

TANZANIA
SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Green Leaf Collection
General
1.        The collection of freshly plucked green leaf for delivery to
factories in good condition from thousands of smallholders scattered over
many square kilometers of mountainous countryside is a difficult operation
demanding considerable planning, administrative ability and expenditures on
staff, collecting centers, roads and transport. Up to 1971 the collection
has been carried out by cooperative societies or private estates for manu-
facture in their factories. Hereafter the Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA) will
assume full responsibility for arranging and administering green leaf
collection from growers to factories. An example of the collection schedules
as now carried out is given in Table 1 to this Annex.
Present Leaf Collection System
2.        Outgrowers carry their freshly plucked leaf from their plots to
existing collecting centers in baskets, bags or cloth sheets up to 5 km
distance. The cooperative societies are responsible for weighing and recording
leaf, which is inspected in the presence of a society committee member and a
member of the Extension Staff.
3.        A variety of transport methods are utilized which include leaf
collection by private estates and cooperative society transport. In some
areas, notably Bukoba, the society has purchased a large lorry which has been
fitted out with racks for transporting leaf to the factory in open weave
baskets. Other areas use light lorries with enclosed wire mesh sides or
standard lorries with primitive racks on which bags are loaded.
4.        Factory personnel handle final leaf weighing and inspection.
All leaf is reinspected at the factory, although society staff are usually
present.
Proposed Leaf Collection System
5.        TTA intends to take over the leaf collection during the fiscal year
1971 and will, therefore, be responsible for coordinating plucking schedules,
leaf deliveries by growers, buying center operations and vehicle scheduling.
These tasks will be the responsibility of the area Tea Officers assisted by
the Transport Officers and Senior Field Officers of TTA's field staff. A
schedule of equipment purchase for leaf collection is shown in Table 2.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
6.        If good quality teas are to be produced, which is essential to the
success of the project, a high standard of plucking must be maintained.
At :Least 70% of the plucking should be only two leaves and a bud. The leaf
should also arrive at the factories in good condition. A steady flow of
leaf to the factories will be required throughout the day. Leaf collecting
centers would therefore be built along the main collection roads at intervals
not greater than 2.5 km. This would enable growers to bring their leaf to
the centers at frequent intervals, thus preventing heating up and bruising.
Wheni the leaf has been inspected, weighed and recorded, it would be held
unt:Ll the transport arrives. The societies would remain in charge of the
colLection centers and would be responsible, with help from TTA's staff, for
leaf inspection, weighing, recording and preparation for transport to the
factories.
Col:Lection Vehicles
7.        In all areas, transport would be mainly by tractors and trailers,
as shown in Table 2. Where distances are great in the first years of the
project, lorries will be required, but eventually (by fiscal year 1976) all
transport will be converted to tractors and trailers. Tractors of 40 HP
wou:Ld have adequate power for towing two-wheeled trailers carrying approxi-
mately 2,000 kg of leaf. The trailers would be constructed with two or three
fixed racks but would have drop down wire sides which, when in position,
wou:Ld prevent the bags and leaf from spilling during transportation.

SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Supply, Consumption, Marketing Charges, and Prices
Tea Supplies
1.        Tea production in Tanzania increased from 3.7 M kg in 1960 to 8.5 M
kg in 1970. Most of this production has been from private estates and
outgrowers. Acreage on private estates is not expected to increase very much
in the future but the planted area of smallholders is expected to increase by
8,300 hectares. Production of tea in Tanzania by 1985 is expected to be about
22 M kg. This estimate does not include plantings by smallholders after 1974
but it does include the output of expected planting under the project being
discussed in this report.
2.        Most of the Tanzanian tea is exported and only about 1.6 M kg
per annum was consumed within the country during the late 1960's. An increase
in domestic consumption of around 1 M kg is projected by 1975 with another
800,000 kg increase projected in 1980.
3.        The increase in consumption will be smaller than the rise in pro-
duction expected from tea planted prior to 1972. Production from this tea
is expected to rise from about 8.5 M kg to about 12.6 M kg by 1980.
4.        Exports of Tanzanian tea will increase because of larger production
by estates and outgrowers. Plantings under the project will increase exports
by about 9.5 M kg. This tea will be marketed primarily in Western. Europe,
North America, and Mombasa. About 80% of the tea produced in Tanzania is
exported to countries outside of East Africa.
Marketing Costs
5.        Costs of marketing made tea from Dar es Salaam to London are esti-
mated at about T Sh 1.16 per kg. These costs include port charges in Tan-
zania and in London; marine costs; brokerage, auction and commission charges;
and handling, warehouse and other charges in London (Table 1).
6.        In addition to the charges explained above, there are export taxes
and cesses of T Sh 0.24 per kg. These charges do not affect the economic
return to the country from tea, but they are deducted from the proceeds
which the factory and the growers receive.
7.        The cost of shipping made tea from factories to port varies ac-
cording to the location of the factory. The cheapest charges are, of course,
for the area closest to a port, West URambara. The most expensive charges
are for the area farthest from a seaport, Bukoba. The shipping charges for

Rungwe and Lupembe are expected to decline after 1975 because the Tan-Zam
Rai.lroad is expected to start running to Dar es Salaam in 1975/76. Shipment
of tea by rail will sharply lower transportation costs from factory to port
(Talble 1).
Prices
8.        Through 1980 prices in London for Tanzanian tea are projected at
about T Sh 7.35 per kg. After 1980 the prices may rise slightly to, say,
T Si, 7.72 per kg. The projected prices are lower than prices in recent
months (T Sh 8.43/kg in October 1970) because a surplus situation i8 ex-
pected to develop in world tea markets. The increase in prices which is
projected for the years after 1980 results from an expected adjustment in
tea production throughout the world because of these low prices. Some high-
cost producers will probably go out of production by 1980 (Annex 13).
9.        Projected London prices indicate FOB prices in Tanzania of about
T Sh 6.30 per kg through 1980 and about T Sh 6.66 per kg after 1980. Prices
to factories in the various areas (excluding export taxes and cesses) are
shown below:

SMALLUOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Market Prospects in the World Tea Economy -/
Production
1.        In 1967-69 world tea production was about 970,000 tons (Table
1). Sixty-three percent was produced in India and Ceylon and 10% in Africa,
of which some 7% was supplied by East Africa 2/. In the 1960's India's and
Ceylon's share of world production declined while the proportion produced
in Africa increased.
2.        From 1955-57 to 1967-69 world tea production increased by 2.9%
yearly. The growth in production has been highest in Africa, approximating
9.5% yearly from 1955-57 to 1967-69. This rate compares with 2.0% for
India and Ceylon. Over this period Africa added 66,000 tons to world
supplies, about one-third of the increase in tea supplies from Africa, India
and Ceylon. Future production is expected to increase between 2.9% yearly
and 3.2% yearly during the 1970's. The lower growth rate assumes that pro-
duction in India will continue to grow at the past rate. The higher growth
rate assumes that the process of replanting and new planting in that country
will be accelerated. So far there is no convincing evidence that this is
going to be the case.
Consumption
3.        From 1955-57 to 1967-69 total world tea consumption increased
by 2.9% yearly (Table 1). Tea use in Great Britain used to be the highest
in the world, but in 1970 consumption in India exceeded that in the Unlited
Kingdom for the first time. India is expected to maintain first place in
total world tea consumption.
4.        The proportion of tea consumed in the developed countries accounted
for 53% of world consumption. But this share has declined steadily in recent
years, while the share consumed in developing countries has increased.
5.        Based on demand analyses for individual countries it is estimated
that world consumption will increase by 2.9% yearly from 1967-69 to 1980 and
will reach 1,368,600 tons by 1980. This assumes that per capita consumption
in the United Kingdom will decline further. Otherwise consumption in 1980
would probably rise to 1,377,600 tons.

Tea Economy, EC-178, June 30, 1971.

Exports and Imports
6.        The principal feature of the international tea market over the
past decade has been the steady increase in export volume of about 2.0%
yearly and at the same time a stagnation in the total export value as the
result of the downward trend in prices. In 1955-57 world exports amounted
to 461,000 tons, representing an export value of about L sterling 206 mil-
lion. By 1967-69 exports had risen to 573,600 tons but export value remained
at E 206,100 million. Within this period, India's export earnings from tea
declined by E 11.8 million and Ceylon's by E 3.6 million. In contrast,
African exports increased by t 19.5 million mainly because exports increased
and the decline in prices was considerably less than for Indian and Ceylonese
teas.
7.        Projections for export availabilities and imports indicate that
both will grow at about 2.0Z yearly during the 1970's and will be in equilib-
rium in 1980. This forecast assumes that output expansion in India will not
exceed 2.0% yearly as indicated before. Otherwise a potential surplus of
about 35,000 tons could arise in 1980. The "Report on the World Tea Economy"
study describes the situation in detail.
Prices
8.        The international market price for tea is determined at three
malor exchanges -- London, Calcutta and Colombo -- but the London price is
the leading price indicator in the world market. The development of actual
ma-rket prices for individual teas and the average for all teas on the
London market are indicated in Table 2 and Chart I.
9.        Until 1958 prices for various grades of tea moved fairly par-
allel to one another. Since then there have been marked divergencies.
Indian and Ceylonese tea prices continued to decline with short interruptions
unl:il 1969, particularly after 1960. ln contrast, prices for African teas
hare not experienced the same declining trend since the late 1950's (even
though their prices fluctuated more than prices of other teas), and the
traditional premium commanded by Indian and Ceylonese tea prices, a reflec-
tion of quality differences, narrowed or disappeared.  These developments
mainly reflected improvements in quality and the fact that blenders incor-
porated a greater share of medium and CTC teas (which are supplied by
Africa) in their blends.
10.      In 1970 a drastic increase in prices was experienced and the world
market now appears to be in equilibrium. If world import demand and export
availabilities grow at 2.0% yearly during the 1970's the average price for
all, tea at London auction should remain at the 1967-69 level of 47 old pence/
lb (43.2 new pence per kg) 1/. It is likely that Indian, Ceylonese and Kenyan
tea prices will remain slightly above this average, while prices for Tanzanian
1/ In February 1971, the United Kingdom adopted the decimal system for its
currency. One new pence is equal to 2.4 old pence.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
tea will fall to the projected level. Fluctuations around this level, of
course, are possible. If a surplus should arise on the world market, London's
auction prices could conceivably fall to 42 old pence/lb (38.6 new pence per
kg).
International Action
11.       An international tea agreement is being discussed to achieve a
balance of export supply and import demand through export quotas. So far
these discussions have resulted in a short-term agreement for 1970, ex-
tended to cover 1971. Tanzania, however, is not a party to the agreement.
The Tanzanian Government maintains that an international agreement would
stifle expansion of tea production in Africa and allow inefficient producers
in India and Ceylon to continue increasing output exports. Whether a long-
term system will ever be established is not clear; but it is fairly certain
that it will not be achieved during the next three or four years.
Bank Involvement
12.       Exports from the project which have been incorporated in our
world export projections are estimated to amount to about 7,600 tons by
1980. They account for about one percent of projected total tea exports
in 1980.
13.       To date the World Bank Group has committed US$37.2 million for tea
expansion including road construction. The output from these projects will
amount to about 38,000 tons in 1980. With the exception of one loan made to
Kenya in 1964, all other loans were made after 1967. Since it takes at least
eight years before the tea plant reaches full maturity, exports from these
projects did not contribute to the decline in world market prices which was
experienced until 1969. Future output from these projects and others which
the Bank Group is considering for financing are included in our supply, de-
mand and price forecast.

SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rates of return were calcualted by using estimates
of prices for made tea as shown in Annex 12, but some modification of the
cost shown in Annex 8 was made (Table 1).
2.        The modification of costs concerns roads.  It was assumed in all
areas that the tea roads would be used for purposes other than Just collecting
green leaf And transporting made tea from factories. Therefore, only one
half of the road costs were allocated to the tea project in computing the
internal rate of return. Also, t:he equipment used in constructing the roads
would be given to Comworks for maintenance purposes and for constructing
other roads after tea road construction was completed. It was assumed that
the value of this equipment would be more than the cost of maintaining the
roads, which would be the responsibility of Comworks. Therefore, no costs
were shown for road maintenance in Annex 10. However, the actual costs of
maintenance by Comworks are estimated and half of these costs were used in
computing internal rates of return.
3.        Table 1 shows the rates of return using base costs and base prices.
The base costs are the best estimates that could be made at the time of
appraisal and the base prices are T Shs 7.35/kg through 1980 and T Shs 7.72/
kg after 1980, CIF London.
4.        Sensitivity analyses show rates of return with adjustments
in costs and benefits as shown below (Table 2):
(a) raising farm wages from zero to T Sh 1.92/day, one half
the legal minimum wage for agriculture - T Sh 3.85/day;
(b) increasing total project costs by 10% and 20% and
decreasing total project costs by 10% and 20%;
(c) raising and lowering fertilizer costs by 10% and 20%;
(d) lowering tea prices by 5% from the base price and raising
tea prices by 5% and 10% from the base price.
5.        The rate of return using base costs and prices showed 17.3% for
the total project and rates for the individual areas of 8.0 to 24.1%.
However, there were no costs for the Central Office of TTA included in the
calculation of the rates of return for the various areas.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
6.        The sensitivity analyses changed the rates of return for the
entire project to a range of 13.4% (project costs 20% higher) to 22.3%
(lowered by 20%). The returns for the various areas showed similar variations
(Table 2).
7.        Because of the low rate of return to West Usambara, analysis was
done wohich allocated the pro-rata (1/12 of the total) cost of the central
office of TTA to this area to determine the true rate of return. The
internal rate of return declined from 8% to 7%. Both calculations treated
the cost of the factory already completed as a sunk cost.
