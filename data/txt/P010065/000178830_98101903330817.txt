PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.       To relieve the severe shortage of telecommunications services in
PaR*itan, the Government and the Association agreed on the FY 1969-1972
Telecommunications Expansion Program, which is based on a UNDP-financed
study of requirements and provides for the most urgently needed facilities
for .e extension and improvement of domestic and international services.
The total cost of this Four-Year Program is PRs 910.3 million (US$191.2
million), with a foreign exchange component of PRs 388.7 million (US$81.6
millicn). An IDA Credit (145-PAK signed in March 1969) financed US$16.0
milliom, including consulting services to improve the organization of the
sector. A major portion of the remaining foreign exchange requirements
was secUlzd from bilateral sources, or was under negotiation, and a second
credit fcm the Association was anticipated.
ii.      The proposed second credit for Pakistan's telecommunications
sector amoults to US$15.0 million and will finance the foreign exchange
componentsrl the second project forming part of the same Program and
consisting oF items that could not be appraised at the time of the first
credit: the arachi-Rawalpindi microwave link (us$6.5 million) for which
technical d0^ils have become available only recently; local and junction
cables (US$6.C million) which have to be imported because of the delay in
constructionom the cable factory; and air-conditioning equipment for
exchange and oansmission rooms (US$1.5 million) which could not be adequately
financed frombilateral sources. The contingency amounts to US$1.0 million.
The total prooct cost is US$35.3 million; the local currency component of
US$20.3 milli4 equivalent will be financed from the resources of the
Telegraph and elephone Department (T&T). The part of the Project relating
to cables and &i-conditioners will be implemented during the Program period,
and the West Pasktan microwave system is planned to be completed in mid-1973.
iii.      All Pr,urement of equipment for the Project will be through
international conttitive bidding.  The Telephone Industries of Pakistan
(TIP) is qualifi4 to bid on the channeling equipment (total cost US$0.5
million); a 15% msrgin of preference requested by Pakistan and which is less
than the customs city, will be granted. Procurement under the previous
IDA Credit has bee delayed six months, due to administrative shortcomings
and inexperience Vth Association procedures. Action has been taken to
streamline the prourement process, and both IDA projects are expected to
be completed withii the specified dates.
iv.       Over the ast decade, T&T has outgrown the old organizational
structure. Implemertation of recommendations of the management consultants,
financed under the first credit, is expected to bring about improvements
in T&T's organizati,nal structure and operating efficiency.



- ii -
v.        T&T's financial results continue to be very satisfactory.  Self-
financing of total requirements in the Program period will amount to 81%.
The rate of return on net fixed assets in operation is expected to remain
above 13%. On purely financial grounds, the second IDA Credit would not
be required were it not for the lack of foreign exchange.
vi.       The project is of high economic priority.  The microwave links
are expected to yield an incremental rate of return of 43%. The cables
and air-conditioning equipment are essential for the expansion of the
local network up to the end of FY 1972, the incremental rate of return of
which is estimated to be about 20%.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$15.0 million
equivalent to be made available to the Government of Pakistan under normal
terms and conditions. The proceeds of the credit will be passed on to the
T&T Department at the Government's present interest rate of Eg% for a term
of 24 years, including a grace period of four years.



PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968, the Bank Group appraised Pakistan's 1969-1972 telecom-
munications sector Program, which was based on a UNDP-financed study, and
financed the foreign exchange component (US$16.0 million) of the first
telecommunications project in Pakistan. Credit 145-PAK for this Project
was signed in March 1969 and provided financing for imported goods and
the foreign currency cost of management consultants to advise on the
organization of the sector and the introduction of a modern accounting
system. It was then anticipated that the Association might consider further
financial assistance for other parts of the Program for which technical
details were not ready at the time of the first appraisal or for which
foreign exchange financing could not be secured from other sources.
1.02      In October 1969, the Government of Pakistan requested a second
credit amounting to US$15.0 million which would finance construction of
a microwave artery in West Pakistan linking Karachi with Rawalpindi, with
a branch to Lyallpur, to increase the capacity of West Pakistan's main
trunk routes and thus meet the anticipated requirements for circuits.
This credit will also finance cables, which cannot be procured from the
local factory as it is still under construction, and air-conditioning
for equipment rooms.
1.03      An appraisal mission composed of Messrs. F. Gheith, H.B. Meier
and D.J. Mortier visited Pakistan in November/December 1969. This report
is based on their findings and on information furnished by the Telegraph
and Telephone Department (T&T), which will be the beneficiary of the
proposed credit.

2. THE TELECOIMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Telecommunications in Pakistan's Economy
2.01      Pakistan's economy is still based primarily on agriculture, which
employs over 80% of the labor force but contributesonly one half of the
national income. Other sectors of the economy have been vigorously promoted
in order to provide income for the rapidly increasing population; industry,
for example, now accounts for about 14% of GNP. The average per capita
income has been increasing, but is still only US$110.
2.02      There is a pressing need for better telecommunications in Pakistan,
underscored by the fact that some 1,100 miles of Indian territory separate
the country's two wings and its 128 million inhabitants, of whom about 45%
live in the West Wing and 55% in the East Wing. Furthermore, within each
Wing there is a particular situation giving rise to the need for more and
better telecommunications facilities. In West Pakistan, the demographic
pattern is such that the main population centers (Karachi, Lahore and
Rawalpindi) are hundreds of miles apart. In East Pakistan, the densely
inhabited areas are separated by natural communications obstacles in the
form of numerous rivers which crissoross that part of the country.
2.03      Pakistan's telecommunications sector, with 0.1i telephones per
100 persons and 0.4% contribution to GNP., is one of the least developed
among the major developing countries. There is a huge unsatisfied demand
for both long distance and local services, as evidenced by the statistics on
traffic overflows and the present waiting list of over 70,000, which is
equivalent to more than half of the existing connections.
2.04      Government is well aware of this acute problem and of the importance
of telecommunications in the overall economic development of Pakistan.
Besides yielding high returns, telecommunication investments contribute to
the achievement of Pakistan's economic development plans by (a) making
possible modernized storage and marketing as well as efficient transporta-
tion; (b) facilitating the establishment of secondary industrial centers;
(c) allowing better inter-wing coordination; (d) providing an important
facility for export promotion; (e) increasing general business efficiency
through better management information and improved coordination; and
(f) supporting market forces in Pakistan through ready access to market
information.
2.05      Government is keen to improve the situation of the sector and
has agreed to allocate for T&T's 1969-1972 Program about 3.3% of all public
investments, not including investments in the telecommunications factories.
The resulting growth in T&T's contribution to GNP in the program period
will be more than 18% per year, and the yearly increase in telephone lines
per capita in the same period will reach about 9% (see Annex 2). Despite
this expansion, demand for telecommunication services will remain unsatis-
fied by the end of the program period. But the improvement, both in
quality and quantity, and the impact of the Program on the country's economic
development are expected to be of crucial importance.



- 3-
B.   Organization of the Sector
2.o6       The telecommunication sector consists of the T&T Department of
the Government of Pakistan, described in the following chapter, and four
factories closely:connected with the Department which are or will be
manufacturing a wide range of telecommunications equipment. Two factories
--Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP) in West Pakistanand Telephone
Industries Corporation (TIC) in East Pakistan-- have been established to
manufacture switching equipment and telephone instruments; plastic
insulated cables will be manufactured by Cable Industries of Pakistan
(CIP), starting in October 1970 and producing at full capacity by late
1972; Carrier Telephone Industries (CTI) will begin producing channeling
and carrier equipment by 1972. The factories and their production programs
are described in Annex 3.
2.07       Government exercises broad control over the sector through
various authorities whose functions are not always well coordinated and
whose procedures often have proved cumbersome. As a government department,
T&T is under the direct control of the Ministry of Communications and is
interlinked with other governmental authorities, such as the Ministry of
Finance (through the Financial Adviser -Communications), the Executive
Committee of the National Economic Council (it approves the annual budget
as well as the Five-Year Development Plan), and the Auditor General (see
Annexes 5 and 8). With respect to the four factories, Government exercises
control not only as majority shareholder but also by providing, via T&T,
financial and managerial resources.
2.08       The form of control the Government exercises over T&T and the
factories does not permit efficient administration of the sector. Hence,
the Association and the Government agreed at the time of the first IDA Credit
that management consultants should be brought in to advise on improved forms
of control over the sector. In addition, consultants will have to advise on
the establishment of a wholly commercial relationship between T&T and TIP,
which would become a model for the other factories as well. The appointed
management consultants, Messrs. A.D. Little (U.S.), began their work on
January 23, 1970, somewhat behind schedule. Their preliminary report is
expected by June 1970  and the final report by October 1970.   Implementation
of the reorganization is planned to be completed by the end of FY 1972
(see also paragraph 3.03).
2.09 cince the first IDA operation in 1969, there have been some improve-
ments in T&T's relationship with governmental authorities. The position of
Finance and Accounts Officer has been created to assist the Secretary of
the Ministry of Communications; one of his main functions is the scrutiny of
capital investment proposals, which previously were evaluated mainly outside
the Department there the technical knowledge was missing (see Annex 5). Also,
the cumbersome disbursement procedures have been simplified. Nshereas formerly
the Financial Adviser's authorization was required for the disbursement of
current expenditures already authorized in the budget, under the present
set-up his approval is required only for non-specific budget allocations.
Furthermore, to speed up administrative processes, T&T has been assigned a
Deputy Financial Adviser of its own.



- 4 -
2.10      Coordination with the Ministry of Finance also has been improved
with respect to procurement procedures that caused delays in project execu-
tion under Credit 145-PAK. The tender committee, composed of the Financial
Adviser - Communications and T&T representatives, did not work under
specific deadlines and was delayed due to lack of coordination and proper
communication among its members. T&T and the Financial Adviser have agreed
to streamline the procurement procedures and to follow a timetable (given
in Annex 4, page 2).



3. THE BENEFICIARY
A. TV's Internal Organization and Management
3.01      Besides the weaknesses resulting from its position within the
Government structure, T&T has some shortcomings in its internal organiza-
tion. The span of control at the top is excessively large; according to
the formal organization chart, 16 officers are supposed to report directly
to the Director General, and 8 others to the Chief Engineer - Development.
With the rapid increase in the scope of T&T's operations, the formal orga-
nization has proved unworkable. This has led to the formation of informal
channels of authority. These aspects of T&T's organization are discussed
in detail in Annex 4.
3.02      There is an excessive concentration of functions and responsi-
bilities at the top level,and this in turn causes considerable delays in
the decision-making process. Moreover, the information flow is extremely
slow and generally poor in quality, particularly between the directorate
general and the field organizations. Operational efficiency could be
considerably improved if more authority were delegated to the field,
particularly with respect to material control and personnel administration.
The various organizational shortcomings are partially responsible for
inadequate maintenance of equipment and delays in development programs.
3.03      With the full support of T&Ts management, who are well aware of
the organization's major weaknesses and are eager to correct them, the
management consultants financed under Credit 145-PAK are analyzing these
organizational problems, along with the relationships between T&T and
Government and between T&T and TIP (paragraph 2.08). While this basic
study is going on, T&T's management is already taking the steps discussed
below to improve efficiency.
3.04      The major functions within T&T have been defined since the
first appraisal mission's visit in 1968, and work has begun on new staff
standards, though with some delays. T&T is also studying ways of remedying
the low productivity of the excessive staff at the lower levels of the
hierarchy, such as by a gradual and partial upgrading of staff through
training associated with increased responsibilities. T&T has agreed that
over the project period the ratio of staff employed to number of stations
in service will be reduced by at least 4% per annum. In 1969 the absolute
number of staff remained practically unchanged while the number of stations
increased, improving the ratio by about 6%.
3.05      At all levels of T&T, the motivational system seems weak because
promotion and rewards are granted mostly on the basis of seniority rather
than merit. Management is studying this problem, but prospects are that
the requisite change in attitute can be brought about only over a period
of time.



- 6 -
3.06      Financial and economic factors are not given proper considera-
tion in investment decisions, due to the difficulty of finding staff who
are trained in investment analysis. This situation is also reflected in
the composition of T&T's management; out of the 40 top positions, only two
(in Accounting) are held by non-engineers.  Management has agreed to appoint
a chief finance officer, who would participate in overall policy-making
and in investment and finance decisions, and also would administer an in-
tegrated management information system.
3.07      The Director General, the Chief Engineer-Maintenance and Opera-
tions, and the local managers all devote an excessive percentage of their
time to interview%s with complaining subscribers and applicants. This is
particularly detrimental to efficient operations in view of the scarcity
of administrative and managerial talent. The Director General is taking
action to improve this situation through the nomination within the Directorate
of a high-ranking officer responsible for complaints, with corresponding
officers in the regions. Management stressed, however, that it will take
a long time for the people in Pakistan to accept the fact that the valuable
time of top management should not be wasted on answering customer queries.
B. Training
3.08      Training facilities for technical staff continue to be satisfactory
in both quality and quantity. In addition to the Staff College in Haripur
(capacity 350 trainees), the three regional training schools for technicians
located in Karachi, Lahore and Dacca (250 trainees each), and 16 vocational
divisional training centers (50 trainees each), T&T plans to establish new
regional schools in Peshawar, Rohri and Khulna and two divisional training
centers and also to expand existing facilities. A project to improve
instructional standards at the Staff College in Haripur is being approved by
the UNDP; the UNDP contribution would be US$0.84 million, while Pakistan's
would be US$2.5 million in kind and US$0.06 million in cash.
C. Existing Facilities
Local Network
3.09      By Mid-1969, the T&T Department had 466 automatic and manual
exchanges with a total line unit capacity of 185,000 lines, or 20% more
than in the previous year. Connected direct exchange lines amounted to
135,000, showing an increase of only 6.3% over the year before.  There were
a total of 185,000 connected telephone sets, representing a 7.6% increase.
3.10      This small growth in connections, despite a long waiting list and
a substantial increase in exchange capacity, has been due to a shortage of
cables, which in turn is attributable to delays in their procurement. The
delays were caused by various administrative shortcomings and inexperience in
dealing with the Bank Group's international competitive bidding procedures.



The main deficiencies have now been overcome.  Some cables obtained through
suppliers' credit are due to arrive shortly, and others under Credit 145-PAK
are expected towards the end of FY 1970. Since the other works (conduits, etc.)
in connection with the network have already been executed, the laying of cables
and the provision of connections will progress quickly after arrival of the
cables. The building of new exchanges and the installation of switching
equipment are progressing satisfactorily, although sometimes installation of
switching equipment starts before completion of the buildings, thereby exposing
the equipment to dust and damage. Management has agreed to improve coordination
of the phases of project execution so as to safeguard the equipment.
Long Distance System
3.11      The main long distance network of Pakistan is shown in Maps 1 and
2 and in Annex 15. The backbone of West Pakistan's network is a coaxial
cable (960 channels capacity), which links Karachi with the main cities in
the north; it is only half equipped with working channels. Channeling
equipment which would bring the fill of the coaxial cable near its optimal
capacity in most sections is under assembly in Telephone Industries of
Pakistan (TIP) at Haripur, and delivery is planned to begin in March 1971.
These additional channels to the coaxial cable, however, will not be
sufficient to satisfy demand in 1970 and subsequent years. Therefore the
microwave links discussed in para. 5.01 have to be provided as soon as
possible.
3.12      East Pakistan's main centers are connected with a 60-channel very
high frequency (VHF) system. For the most important Dacca-Chittagong link,
additional multiplexing to increase capacity is being provided under a
German credit.  The microwave link Barisal-Khulna, fiiianced by Exii Bank,
is under construction. Studies are underway to replace the planned microwave
link from Chittagong to Barisal by a tropospheric scatter link because
difficulties have been encountered in the use of repeater stations for micro-
wave on the intermediate islands in the Bay of Bengal. Minor trunk routes
in both East and West Pakistan consist of open wire lines and open wire
carrier systems. At present there is extensive delay in traffic and a large
number of ineffective calls between all centers, served by both subscribers
trunk dialling (STD) and manual operation.
Inter-Wing and International Facilities
3.13      Circuits to Teheran, Ankara, Rome and London are provided on the
Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) microwave route, the quality of which
does not meet current international standards. All other international
telephone telegraph and telex service are provided via high frequency (HF)
circuits, operating on daily schedules with more than 20 countries. The
inter-wing communications rely totally on HF, which is neither satisfactory
nor sufficient for this very important connection between the country's
two wings. Improvement of this service is being carried out under the first
IDA project. Satellite communications which are provided under the 1969-1972
Program (paragraphs 4.01 and 4.02) will take care of the unsatisfied demand
and future needs of both the inter-wing and the international services.



-8-
D. Financial Aspects
Accounting and Auditing
3.14      The Government budget accounting system being used in T&T has
several shortcomings; it provides inadequate data with considerable delay.
Responsibility for the accounting work is dispersed among several
authorities - namely, the Finance Kinistry, the Financial Adviser, the
Auditor General, and the T&T Department (Annexes 5 and 8). Furthermore,
T&T's cash flow is not separated from the Central Government's Consolidated
Fund, with the consequent lack of an integrated financial management. These
shortcomings, however, are being remedied as a condition under Credit 145-PAK.
A miajor task of the management consultants (paragraph 2.08), financed
under this IDA Credit, is the design and introduction by the end of FY 1972
of a modern accounting system and the corresponding organization.
3.15      T&T's budget accounts are audited by the budget accounts section
of the Auditor General of Pakistan.  As soon as the new accounting system
is introduced, accounts will be audited by experienced and competent
auditors acceptable to the Association, and sent to the Association within
six months after close of the fiscal year. This is also a condition under
the first IDA credit.
3.16      In order to have comparable figures for past and future years
and thus permit a meaningful financial analysis, the Bank's staff have
prepared proforma financial statements (Annexes 9 and 11) as though T&T were
an autonomous agency solely responsible for its financial operations.
Financial Position
3.17      A summary of T&T's tentatively evaluated assets, to be reviewed
by the consultants, is shown below. IMore detailed notional balance sheets
are attached as Annex 9.
Sumnmary of T&T's Assets as of June 30, 1969, in PRs Million
Ulet Fixed Assets                               904.4
Investments in factories and INTELSAT            71.9
Net Current Assets                               92.8
Total Assets                            1,069.1
Fixed assets in operation were estimated at PRs 1,039.2 million (US$218.3)
or 14% higher than the previous year; wzork in progress was about PRs 183.4
million and the notional depreciation reserve PRs 318.2 million resulting
in net fixed assets of PRs 904.4 million.



- 9 -
3.18      Investments (PRs 71.9 million) comprise Pakistan's participation
in INTELSAT (PRs 1.0 million), TIP in Haripur (PRs 50.2 million),the cable
factory in Nhulna.(PR.s 9.0 million). TIC ip Dacca (PRs 8.5 million_)y
and TCI in Islamabadc (PRs 3.2 million) . Net current assets consist of
subscriber accounts receivable (PRs 43.u million) and inventories (PRs 6h.7
million) minus current liabilities (PRs 14.9 million).  The accounts receivable
position, which has been rather high in the past, has been reduced to a more
reasonable level. The outstanding balance represents seven weeks' billing.
With the computerized billing system being introduced, the outstandings will
be further reduced.  Accounts receivables include outstanding accounts against,
semi-government agencies; T&T has made some progress towards a settlement
of these accounts. To prevent similar situations from arising in the futures
Government has agreed that its accounts as well as those of its agencies will
be kept on a current basis. Inventories continue to be high, but management
is taking steps to sell material the Department does not intend to use.
3.19      The notional basis for T&T's capitalization is explained in the
notes to Annex 9.  On the basis of that calculation, a net capital contri-
bution of PRs 154.9 million was made to T&T from the central budget since
the beginning of the Department's operations. According to the Association's
forecast, all inflows to and outflows fromthe .Consolidated Fund will have
balanced out by 1972. As of June 30, 1969, T&T's position was as follows
(in PRs Million):
Central Budget Contributions            154.9
Retained Earnings                        710.4
Total equity                        865.3
Bilateral Foreign Exchange Loans
(excluding current maturities)        203.8
Total                             1,069-.1
As the table indicates, T&T has had a high rate of self-financing while
loans represent only one-fifth of its assets. At present, the Economic
Affairs Division contracts and services foreign exchange loans for all
Government departments. Therefore, T&T does not collect and record all
relevant data on its debt. After introduction of the new accounting system,
however, T&T will assume all obligations in servicing its debt, including
repayment of foreign exchange loans to Government.
Tariffs
3.20      The level of tariffs continues to assure the financing of a high
portion of capital expenditures (paragraph 7.02). With effect from July 1,
1969, long distance telephone rates were increased to compensate for labor
cost increases (paragraph 3.22). The pulse 1/ rate for metered STD traffic
was increased from PRs 0.18 to PRs 0.20, while rates for manual service
increased by about 10%. On September 23, 1969, rentals for teleprinter
machines (including attachments), which had not been changed since 1949,
were fixed at PRs 5,400 per annum. A table of representative tariffs is
attached as Annex 12.
1/ Basic metering unit for the assessment of the call charge in
automatic networks.



- 10 -
3.21      The tariff structure is under continuous review.  The revision
of the low circuit rentals conceded to the railways is presently under
study and the inter-wing rates, which hardly cover costs, will be reviewed
by T&T as soon as the high quality satellite service is established.
Past Earnings
3.22      Shown below is a summary of T&T's proforma Profit and Loss
Statement (Annex 10), for FY 1967 through 1969 (in million PRs).
Year ending June 30         1967        1968         1969
Revenues                            217.5        246.1       290.0
Expenses (excluding interest)      (123.5)      (136.9)     (156.5)
Net income                           94.0        109.2       133.5
Rate of Return                       10.7%        11.0%       10.9%
The high-capacity utilization of telecommunication facilities and the
introduction of STD have brought very high revenues.  Despite overstaffing,
expenses were relatively low due to low wages for non-qualified staff.
This is indicated by the low operating ratio, which was between 54 and 57
over the past three years. The rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation (as defined in paragraph 7.08) was around 11%. Following the
political upheavals at the end of 1968, several decrees were issued in
early 1969 to increase salaries of Government employees in the form of
"Good Conduct Pay,"' "Ad Hoc Relief" or   -xation of minimum wages, re-
presenting labor cost increases of over 105q. The effect of these measures
was compensated by a tariff increase (paragraph 3.20) and an increase in
labor productivity (paragraph 3.04).
3.23      This good earning performance permitted T&T to finance a high
proportion of its expansion program.  As the following table shows,
internally generated funds were by far the most important source of funds,
and T&T has become a net contributor to the Central Budget.

4. THE PROGRAM
4.01      The 1969-1972 Telecommunications Expansion Program, as described
in Appraisal Report TO-695a, remains basically unchanged, with total costs
amounting to PRs 910 million (US$191 million). The Program is conceived to
provide Pakistan with high-quality international and inter-wing telecommunica-
tions services, a high-capacity trunk network, and a 19% annual growth in
subscriber facilities. It is the largest possible program that can be
achieved with the available human and material resources, and its execution
will require considerable effort on the part of T&T's management. The main
items of the Program, which are shown in more detail in Annex 6, are as
follows:
a.  Provision of 175,000 additional telephones;
b. Provision of 550 public call offices in rural areas;
c. Provision of 2,700 miles of open wire trunk lines, and
607 carrier trunk circuits on open wire lines;
d. Microwave and coaxial cable system extensions to the
main towns;
e. Extension of STD facilities to provide a full inter-
dialling network between main towns in both wings of
Pakistan;
f. Extension of the inter-wing and international network
by provision of two satellite ground stations, and, improve-
ment of the existing HF radio inter-wing and international
systems;
g. Extensions to the telegraph system; and
h. Miscellaneous complementary provisions.
4.02      Initial progress under the Program has been slower than expected.
The delay in the procurement of cables, and hence in the extension of the
local network, is explained in paragraph 3.10. Also delayed by a few months
were the survey and preparation of specifications for the coaxial cable and
microwave links Dacca/Sylhet, Dacca/ymensingh, and Kushtia/Rang Pur, due
in part to minor changes from coaxial cable to microwave system for topo-
graphical or climatic reasons, and in part to administrative shortcomings.
Bid documents for these links have now been issued. The contract for the
satellite ground stations has been awarded to RCA of Canada, and financing
has been secured from the Canadian International Development Agency (C IDA);
the credit amounts to US$10.4 million and has a term of 50 years including
a grace period of 10 years; there is no interest or service charge. Despite
initial delays, the timely completion of the Program is still possible with
concerted effort by all the participants.

5. THE PROJECT
The Project forms part of the 1969-1972 Program.
A. Description of the Project
5.01      The Project consists of --
a. A microwave route from Karachi to Rawalpindi consisting of
two microwave links (of a least 960 channels each) up to
Multan, with one continuing to Rawalpindi and the other
branching off to Lyallpur, together with the associated
multiplex equipment.  SPur connections are to be provided for:
Hyderabad - Mirpurkhas
Darya Kban - D.I. Khaq
Lahore - Gujranwala;NJ
b.  Local and junction exchange cables with the related aCcesscries
to be imported due to delay in construction of the local cable
factory;
c. Air-conditioning for equipment rooms for which adequate
financing could not be secured from bilateral sources;
The local and foreign exchange cost of these provisions are shown in detail
in the table below.
- ----PRs Million-- - ---- US$ Million-----
Local  Foreign  Total   Local  Foreign  Tota.l
1. Microwave Route, West

and studies                   22.1    32.4    54.5       4.7     6.8    11.5

5.02      The cable and air-conditioners forming part of the proposed Project
would be fully installed by mid-1972, while the proposed microwave links are
planned to be operative by mid-1973.
5.03      The total estimated foreign exchange cost of the Project, amounting
to US$15.0 million, would be financed by the proposed IDA credit. The agree-
ment of the Association should be obtained before any major expansion exceeding
US$2.0 million in aggregate is undertaken, which is not included in the
1969-1972 Programnor in that part of the Fourth Pive-Year PlAn scheduled to
be undertaken before June 30, 1973.



- 13 -
B. Procurement and Disbursement
5.04      All items to be financed by the proposed credit will be procured
under international competitive bidding. T&T requested that domestic
manufacturers be permitted to participate in the bidding for the West
Pakistan microwave link with a 15% margin of preference, which is less
than the custom duties levied on the equipment. This preferential treat-
ment will be granted with respect to the multiplex channeling equipment,
which is being produced by TIP and would cost about US$0.5 million equivalent.
5.05      For the other components of the West Pakistan microwave project --
namely, modulating and radio equipment -- there are no local production
facilities. If local factories for manufacturing these items are set up,
they could not begin delivery of these highly complex items in time for
the project, but they might be able to cater to the increasing demand for
this equipment after FY 1973 (Annex 13 - IIIA, page 5).
5.06      Disbursement would be made for the CIF price of imported equipment
and material. In the event TIP is the successful bidder on the channeling
equipment, the ex factory price will be reimbursed.
5.07      The unused balance of the Credit might, after consultation
with the Association, be used for additional provisions of items included
in the Project, provided that no extension of the closing date will be
required for the purpose.

6.  JUSTIFICATIai OF THE PROJECT
6.01      All parts of the project belong to the highest priority items in the
Program. The three components of the Project -- the microwave links, the
cables and the air-conditioners - are justified separately. The proposed
microwave investment, for which data were not ready at the time of appraisal
of T&T's Expansion Program, has been scrutinized in greater detail.
Microwave Investment
6.02      The proposed investment in West Pakistan's microwave link will
expand the most important trunk backbone of the Western Wging's telecommunica-
tions system. Projections of circuit requirements given in Annex 13 (Table 4)
indicate that by 1973 the existing coaxial cable, even with all channels
equipped, would meet only 60% to 80% of requirements on some of its major
sections, The microwave links would permit meeting I-est Pakistan's long
distance traffic requirements for at least two years after their completion.
Thereafter, additional investments for equal capacity units will cost only 20%
of the initial investment.
6.03      Alternative routing of the microwave links, the possibility of using
coaxial cables instead of microwave links, and alternative size and timing of
the proposed investment have all been thoroughly examined with the Pakistani
authorities. The agreed routing proposal and timing are fully justified by
demand (see Annex 13). Microwave on the proposed links represents the least
cost and most flexible alternative.  Furthermore, the proposed microwave
links would permit the trunk system in West Pakistan to achieve a high degree
of reliability.  WIith two modes (i.e., the existing coaxial system and the
proposed microwave system), which have different causes of failures and are
working side by side, the probability that any particular part of the network
will always be functioning is much higher than in a single mode system.
6.04      The incremental rate of return  / indicates the high benefits of
the Project for Pakistan. It has a mean value of about 43% and a 95% probability
of lying between 38% and 50% (see Annex 13 III, page 5).  This rate, however,
may overstate benefits because it was computed at official exchange rates. A
minimum economic rate of return was therefore computed whereby the value of
capital investments was corrected to account for the scarcity of foreign
exchange in Pakistan. The benefits, measured by the revenues from incremental
trunk traffic, are considered to represent the minimum economic benefits, since
what the marginal user (who belongs essentially to the business sector or to
the Goverrnent) is willing to pay is at least equal to the marginal productivity
of his use of the long distance telephone system. Reflecting the shadow pricing
of foreign exchange, the expected value of the minimum economic rate of return
on this basis is estimated to be about 37%, with a 95% probability of lying
between 33% and 43% (see Annex 13 IIC, page 6).  Details on additiqnal economic
benefits, which are only partially reflected in the incremental rate of return,
are given in Annex 13 IV.
it  omputed as the discount rate for which the net present value of incremental
cash flows to and from the economy is equal to zero. The incremental cash
flows are net of financial transactions; they have not been adjusted for
shadow pricing and represent monetary flows in current rupees.



- 15 -
Cables
6.05      The 1969-72 Program provides f or the installation and
commissioning of 175,000 telephones. Credit 145-PAK included US$6.8 million
to cover the foreign exchange component for thepurchase of local distribution
cables and overhead line networks. This was estimated to provide cables for
125,000 telephones; the remainder vas then expected to be supplied by the
domestic cable factory under construction. The delay in completion of the
factory has now made it necessary to import cables needed for the remaining
50,000 telephones.
6.o6      The expansion of the local network up to June 30, 1972, for which
the proposed cables will be needed, has been justified in Report TO-695a, in
which the investment was estimated to yield an incremental rate of return of
about 20%.
Air-Conditioners
6.07      Automatic exchange and transmission rooms must be totally enclosed;
air-conditioning is required to filter the air and keep it at constant
temperature and humidity. Absence of filtered air and proper humidity leads
to increased wear and tear of the switching contacts, and thus to deterioration
in the quality of transmission and reliability of service. Overheating of
equipment rooms occurs in the absence of air-conditioning due to highly
concentrated installations in small spaces, and this decreases the reliability
of exchange and transmission equipment. Lack of air-conditioning therefore
implies either increased maintenance, shorter lifetime or larger building
space requirements. Given that air-conditioning, where provided, represents
on the average only 5% of the cost of automatic exchange equipment, the
benefits are extremely high.

7.  FUTURE FINANCES
Financing Plan
7.01      The financial forecasts in this report reflect the fact that until
1972 T&T's fund flow will remain interlinked with the Central Governmentts
Consolidated Fund, while beginning in 1973 with the new accounting system T&T
will have the power to control its cash. Annex 11 shows the estimated sources
and uses of funds through 1975. A summary of the cash flows during the Program
period is shown below.
7.02      The total requirements in 1969-72 amount to FRs 1,024.4, of which
88.8% will be invested in fixed assets, 9.6% in telecommunications factories
and INTELSAT, and 1.6% in working capital. The foreign exchange requirements
of this investment will be financed by bilateral loans and credits (25% of
total investments) and IDA credits (13%). The remainder (62%) will be financed
from T&T's own generated cash.

- 17 -
As the above table shows, the proposed IDA credit is not required on purely
financial grounds. A surplus of sources over requirements amounting to PRs
196.2 million (which is more than the two IDA Credits) will be retained in
the Consolidated Fund to be used in other sectors of the economy. By the end
of FY 1972, the cumulative flow of funds to the Central Consolidated Fund is
estimated to have equalized the cumulative investments in T&T since its
establishment.
7.03      Foreign exchange requirements are now secured except for a minor
portion (US$10 million) under negotiation, and timely execution would thus
be assured. Assurances should nonetheless be obtained from Government that it
will promptly make available all funds (including the foreign currency) required
to execute the Project.
7.04      The proposed IDA Credit of US$15.0 million to the Pakistan Government
would be passed on to T&T at the Government's present interest rate of 6-1/4%
for a term of 24 years, including a h-year grace period.
Future Operating Results and Financial Position
7.05      Forecast income statements and rates of return are shown in
Annex 10. In the foreseeable future, T&T's revenues are likely to be
higher than its capacity to expand.  A reduction of tariffs, however, is at
present not advisable. The resulting increase in demand could lead to a
breakdown of those parts of the system where capacity is being fully utilized.
The inevitable surplus should therefore flow to the Government and be utilized
in other sectors of the economy. Beginning in FY 1973 when T&T becomes a
financially self-contained organization and surplus will not automatically be
retained in the Government's Consolidated Fund, T&T will pay the Government
(as agreed under Credit 145-PAK) an annual contribution of 6% on T&T's total
equity, or such other percentage as may be established from time to time after
consultation between the Government and Association. When these payments in
lieu of taxes are considered as part of T&T s operating expenses, this results
in rates of return of over 14% in FY 1974 and 1975.
7.06      Net income before contributions in lieu of taxes is forecast to
increase from PRs 133.5 million in 1969 to PRs 313.3 million in FY 1975.
After contribution in lieu of taxes, internal cash generation would still
cover debt service at least 4.4 times in the period up to FY 1975. In view
of the increasing debt service as a result of rapid expansion financed partly
with foreign exchange loans, T&T is committed to consult the Association prior
to the incurring of new debt if the maximum annual debt'service in the future
is not cbvered 1.5 times by net revenues (before charging depreciation or
contribution) of a 12-month period.
7.07      The projected balance sheets in Annex'9 indicate a sound
financial position throughout the period under review.



- 18 -
Rate Covenant
7.08      Upon introduction of the new accounting system -- i.e., beginning
in FY 1973 -- T&T is required under Credit 145-PAK to keep its expenses and
tariffs on a level that will permit a rate of return of at least 10% to be
attained on a rate base consisting of average fixed assets in operation plus
working capital equal to 4% on net fixed assets In operation. The return is
defined as the net income from operations after covering all operating expenses,
including a straight-line depreciation of at least 5% and the proposed
contribution to Government (see paragraph 7.05). Until introduction of the
new accounting system, the present tariffs will not be reduced without prior
agreement of the Association.

8. RECOO12DATIONS AND AGRE.EENTS
8.01     The proposed Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$15 million
to the Government of Pakistan under the following conditions which have been
agreed to during negotiations; they are almost identical with those of Credit
145-PAK.
a.   The qovernment of Pakistan will pass on the proceeds of the
Credit to T&T on conditions set out in paragraph 7.04;
b.   Levels of staffing related to the number of telephones in

Telecommunications Factories in Pakistan
I. Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP)
1. Establishment
TIP, located in Haripur, wes established in 1952, in collaboration
with Siemens (Germany) as a limited company. Since its establishment,
it has passed through four phases of expansion with corresponding increases
in share capital. At present (1969), the capital is PRs 73.72 million,
of which the Government of Pakistan contribution is PRs 58.45 million and
that of Siemens PRs 15.27 million.
2. Management
The Secretary of Communications is Chairman of TIP's Board
of Directors. The members are: the Director General of T&T, the Chief
Engineer Planning ard Development of T&T, thle Financial Adviser - C       -
cations, the Managing Director of TIP, -Wnd -Wo wiAmuers from Siemens._.(
There is close collaboration between TIP and T&T. As a condition
for Credit 1h5 PAK one of the duties of the consultants (A. D. Little),
who began their work in January 1970, is to undertake a review of the
relationship between T&T and TIP directed toward the introduction of a
fully commercial relationship between the two organizations that would
allow accurate costing of TIP-produced equipment.
3. Production
Since establishment, the factory has progressed from assembling
7,000 telephone instruments and 7,000 exchange lines in 195h/55, to the
almost complete manufacture of the following items:
1/ The three factories described herein have the same membership for
their respective Board of Directors.

The value of production increased from PRs 5.0 million in 1958
to PRs 40.0 million in 1969.
TIP has endeavored to atain self-sufficiency in its operations.
An exchange planning group was started in 1959 to draw up exchange specifi-
cations, as well as planning for installation of manufactured exchange
equipment.
h. a) Switching Equipment
Manufacturing includes all processes from raw materials to
finished products for racks, frame assemblies, coils, relays, resistances,
most of the condensers, and the complete EMD switch.
A special section manufactures all the necessary tools and jigs
for almost all parts. Only the jigs for the EMD switch are imported from
Siemens. Although the jigs prepared by TIP are finished manually, the
quality is satisfactory.
Mouldings for switches and telephone sets are completely manu-
factured in a modern moulding shop. In addition to the switching require-
ments of mouldings, the shop produces 80,000 telephone sets per year,
utilizing only half its capacity.
The feeding of the assembly line and preliminary testing of
assembled products are still done manually. An improvement and doubling
of the production can be achieved by chain or belt feeding. Most of the
factory is still working on one shift.
b) Quality
Testing of the finished products proceeds in a normal way and
shows satisfactory results. Production of END type exchange equipment
1/ To meet future demand, the TIP factory will expand in order to produce
Z0,000 lines per year. TIC (described later) will have a future production
of 30,000 lines, bringing the total for Pakistan to 90,000 exchange lines
per year.



ANNEX 3

started early in 1968, and now cons itutes most of the production, at a
rate of 100-140 switches per day. This rate enables TIP to supply
automatic exchanges of about 40,000 lines total capacity per year.
Some of the old two-motion switches (type Fl) are still manu-
factured as extensions to existing exchanges of the same type.
One working exchange of the EMD type was visited in Karachi.
It is operating in a satisfactory manner since its commissioning in
April 1969.
5. Teleprinters
TIP started the assembly of teleprinters mostly from imported
parts in 1963, at the rate of 400 sets/year.  Preparation is underway
for the manufacture of 50% of the parts, at the same time raising the
production to 1,000 sets/year by 1971/72, covering all of T&T's
immediate requirements.
6. Carrier Equipment
In 1958, TIP added the manufacture of carrier equipment to its
production, and actual deliveries started in 1960. During the initial
stage, manufacture was confined to the production of valve-type equipment
for 3 and 12 channel carrier systems. At the second stage, TIP produced
valve-type equipment for the extensions to the coaxial cable channels.
Total production of these types amounted to 709 channels in 1967/1968.
TIP started the production of transistorized equipment in
1969 for the supply of 1,110 channels for T&T. Channels and channel
modulator equipment (60-108 KC) are assembled and tested in the factory.
Group and super-group modulators and similar equipment for higher fre-
quencies will be supplied complete and ready for installation by Siemens.
Delivery is expected to start in March 1971. There is no valid reason
for this line of production to be transferred elsewhere at this stage of
capacity utilization.
7. Cost of Production
TIP's present cost accounting makes the exact costing of specific
products or product groups difficult. The management consultants financed
under Credit 145 PAK are therefore studying T&T's accounting practices and
advising TIP on systems or methods which would allow costing of specific
items on a current basis. The setting up of a new factory in Dacca while the
first factory has not yet reached its optimum size, will prevent TIP from
achieving optimum efficiency in the near future.
8. Training
Training of staff constitutes an important function 6f the
factory. It follows the German practice by recruiting high school



ANTNEX 3
Page 4 of 6 pages
students who attend 3-1/2 years of comprehensive courses covering
both theoretical and practical aspects of teleconmmunications. At present,
TIP has 350 students from West Pakistan and 47 from East Pakistan.  Dur-
ing the 1953-1959 period, 388 technicians graduated; 307 of them joined
the factory staff.
II. Telephone Industries Corporation (TIC), Dacca
1.        The Telephone Industries Corporation was constituted in 1967, as
a joint venture with Siemens. The capital of the Corporation is PRs 19.8
million, out of which the Government of Pakistan contributed PRs 13.2 million,
and Siemens PRs 6.6 million in the form of machines and tools for the
factory.
2.        The factory is planned to produce ultinately 30,000 telephone
sets and 20,000 telephone exchange lines per year, applying the same manu-
facturing processes as does TIP in Haripur. The requirements of East
Pakistan could easily have been supplied by TIP, thereby improving the
latter's economic standing. But internal political considerations have
caused the duplication.
3.        Buildings and civil works of TIC are in the final stages of
construction and will be completed by June 1970. Machinery started to arrive
on site in June 1969, and its installation will be completed by October 1970.
However, assembly of relays started early in November 1969, using piece
parts recei-ved from TIP.
4.        By October 1970, TIC plans to assemble 5,000 exchange lines (EMD)
with parts from TIP. In 1971, another 5,000 exchange lines will be pro-
duced with parts from TIP and 5,000 lines with parts will be produced
by TIC. By October 1972, production will be increased to 20,000 exchange
lines, and by 1975, to 30,000 lines.
5.        Even after the installation of all the machinery, TIC will con-
tinue for some years to import from TIP such items as aluminum castings,
plastics for telephone sets, printed circuits, telephone set transmitters,
receivers, condensers and dials. This arrangement was adopted to avoid
duplicating investments for expensive machinery.
6.        Jigs and tools will initially be supplied from Germany and the
tool-making shop will be engaged in the maintenance of these tools; but
at a subsequent stage TIC will start making its own tools. At present
(1969), 47 technicians are under training in TIP and another 80 will be
trained in TIC. This will cover the requirements for tool-making,
maintenance and other mechanical work in the factory.

III. Carrier Telephone Industries (CTI)
1.        Carrier Telephone Industires was constituted in April 1969 in
conlaboration with Siemens. The factory is to be located in Islamabad.
The authorized capital is PRs 20.0 million, of which the Government is
contributing PRs 12.7 million and Siemens PRs 7.3 million.
2.        The factory is planned to have the following annual production:
a.  3-channel open wire systems            16 terminals
12-channel open wire systems            48 terminals with
15 repeaters
b. Transistorized channel modulators    800 units
Channel terminal circuits           1,200 units
c. V. F. telegraph equipment              500 units
3.        Land has been acquired, building plans are almost ready and
tenders for the construction of buildings are expected to be called for
in the first half of 1970. Assuming no obstacles or delays of any sort,
production cannot be expected to started before mid-1972.
IV. Cable Industries of Pakistan (CIP), Khulna (East Pakistan)
1.        Cable Industries of Pakistan was constituted in November 1967
as a joint venture with Siemens. The capital is PRs 15.4 million of
which the Government of Pakistan contributed PRs 11.8 million, and
Siemens PRs 3.6 million in the form of machinery and tools for the factory.
2.        The factory is situated at Khulna, on a convenient waterway for
easy transportation of cables to various parts of East Pakistan and to
Karachi in West Pakistan.
3.        At its initial stage, the factory will produce plastic insulated
(cores and sheath) cables, for the installation of 20,000 local exchange
lines per year.
4.        A major part of the machinery has already arrived on site and
most of it has been installed. Installation will be completed by June 1970,
operation of the factory will start in October 1970, and full capacity
utilization is expected during 1972. There are ample space and facilities
for further expansion of the factory up to five times the initial production.
Installation of a second line to double the production is planned for
completion in June 1973/1974.

V.  National Radio Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC)
1.        The National Radio Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) was
constituted in February 1966 by the Government of Pakistan to produce radio
equipment for the Ministry of Defense. The capital, amounting to PRs 15 mil-
lion, was paid in by Government.
2.        The factory is in Haripur, adjacent to the TIP factory.  It
started its activities by assembling mobile-type radio equipment in the HF
and VHF ranges, with piece parts obtained from NEC, (Japan).   Very
little is produced by this factory at present. The idea now is to sell
this Corporation to T&T and to divert the factory to the manufacture of
microwave equipment.
3.        The factory has ample space for the purpose, but the nucleus
staff remaining with NRTC had no previous experience with microwave
techniques.
4.        At present, NRTC, is governed by a Board of Directors composed
of the Secretary/Communications (Board Chairman), the Financial Adviser -
Communications, two Army officers, the Director General and the Chief
Engineer Development from T&T, and the managing director of the factory.

Description of T&T'P Internal Organization
A. General Description
The overall organization of the T&T Department, up to divisional
level, is shown in Chart 1. The chart shows only the position of the top
150 Class I gazetted officers; there are 350 Class I and 700 Class II
gazetted officers. Altogether, the department has 30,000 employees.
The stated objectives of the organization, as expressed by the
chief executive, are the provision of an efficient service (technical per-
formance), public satisfaction (in terms of quantity and quality of service
and of tariffs), relative independence, and a good internal social climate.
These goals are widely shared among all the top officers, reflecting their
cohesiveness as the top management group.
The centralization of decision-making has lead to an excessively
large span of control within T&T's formal organization - particularly at
the levels of the Director General, Chief Engineer-Planning and Development,
and the Field Directors, and within the informal organization at the level
of Chief Engineer.
B. Organizational Structure and Functions
The Maintenance and Operations Wing of T&T is described in Chart 2
along with the functions of its officers. Only the Karachi/Southern Tele-
communications Region is described therein as an example of the field
maintenance and operation organizations.
The organization of the Development and Planning Wing of the T&T
Directorate General Department, and the functions of its officers are
given in Chart 3.
There are three field organizations in charge of exchange develop-
ment, headed by directors of development located at Karachi, Lahore and
Dacca. There are two directors in charge of satellite development, located at
Chittagong and Karachi. The director of development for microwave and HF
projects is in Dacca. He is assisted by a divisional engineer for microwave,
East Pakistan; a divisional engineer for VHF construction, West Pakistan;
divisional engineer for microwave survey, who is in Dacca; a divisional
rigineer for HF construction in East Pakistan; and a divisional engineer for the
iwalpindi - Lahore microwave survey.
The structure of the Field Development Organization is necessarily
f-iible and woaild adapt to requirements.  For the microwave project
flnced by the Association, divisional engineers could be added in the
orkization of the Director Development for Microwave and HF projects,
or, refc-rably an additional position of Director Development for Microwave
(l0tted at Karachi) could be created.

The principal staff functions and structure and the training
organization are described in Chart 4.
T&Tts accounting and audit functions, organization and procedures
are described in detail in Annex 8.
C. Major Relations of T&T Department with Outside
Entities and Within Inter-Departmental Committee
The major relations of the T&T Department with outside entities,
and T&Tts relevant officers, are shown in Chart 5. The main inter-department
committees are described below:
a. Tender Committee I
This Committee examines and approves on behalf of the Govern-
ment all tenders for bids higher than PRs 700,000. The Chairman is the
Director General of T&T, and the members are the Financial Adviser-Communi-
cations, the Chief Engineer-Development and Planning, and the Director of
Stores and Workshops. The Secretary of Tender Committee I is the Deputy
Chief Engineer-Coordination.
An agreement (concluded during the missionts stay in Pakistan)
between T&T and the Financial Adviser to streamline the tender procedure
will prevent delays such as those previously experienced. A maximum of five
weeks will elapse between the time the specifications are ready and the
Tender Committee approves them. The specifications will be distributed to all
Committee members and a first meeting will be held seven days after distri-
bution. If Bank/IDA concurrence is required and if changes are proposed, a
maximum of seven days will elapse between receipt of the Bank/IDA opinion
and final approval by the Tender Committee. In the bid evaluation, four
weeks (up to six weeks in the case of complex bids) following receipt of all
the bids will be allowed for designating the successful bidder.
b. Tender Committee II
This Committee fulfills the same functions as those of Tender
Committee I, and will follow the above-described procedure. It examines

Budgeting and Disbursement: Organization and Procedures
The Finance and Accounts Officer and the Financial
Adviser-Communications play a major  "ole in the budgeting and
disbursement decisions which are described in Part I. Part II
describes the operating budget procedures and Part III the capital
investment decision process.
PART -I:  ROLE OF TTE FILTNCP AND ACCOUNTS OFFIQCR
AND OF THE FINANCIAL ADVIS-R- CCMMUNICATIONS
I. The Revised System of Financial Control and Budgeting
1.           The position of Finance and Accounts Officer has been
created within the Ministry of Communications, and the interference of
the Financial Adviser (Communications) in T&T's day-to-day operations
has consequently been relaxed, by a law effective July 1, 1969.
2.           The law intends to permit more delegation of authority
to the kinistries and attached departments in those financial and
economic matters previously controlled in part by the Ministry of
Finance.   This  new control exarcised by the Finance and Accoiunts
Offic-r has been incorporated into the budget formulation process,
and at.the same time freedom has been granted to the Ministry of
Communications and to  WT  Department in the implementation of
the budget.
II. Finance and Accounts Officer
3.           The Finance and Accounts Officer is charged with advising
the Secretary for Communications on all financial, budgetary and
accounts matters. The position of Finance and Accounts Officer is
assumed by T&T's Chief Accounts Officer, who retains also his position
within the Department.
4.           As Finarce OfficAr and A'.ccounts Officer his duties and
responsibilities are to:
i)  coordinate and carry out internal scrutiny of the
budget estimates of receipts as well as expenditures of
the Ministry of Communications;
ii)  consolidate the annual development program, and ensure
that the development schemes of the Ministry are
prepared in accordance with prescribed procedures and
instructions;
iii)  give advice, when called upon, in fields wherein the
Secretary or T&T?s Director General heve full power and



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 7 ir-es
advise on matters relating to regulations, foreign
exclhange and provision of funds out of the "Contin-
gency Itemtr of the budget that are reauired to
be referred to the Ministry of Finannce through the
Financial Adviser- Communications;
iv)  maintain property accounts and reconcile them with the
actuals of the Auditor General's Cffice, maintain
1'liehbility registers"l in thc i4inistry and in T&T; control
the progress of expenditure and reeeipts;
v)  perform all work relating to the Public Accounts
Committee, and audit observations on appropriation
accounts and ensure compliance with the Committee's
observations and recommendations;
vi)  exercise intrrnal checks on irregularities, waste and
fraud;
vii)  ensure compliance with all other rules and orders
issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time;
and
viii)  scrutinize cases where reference to the Financial
Adviser is necessary as regards relevant rules and
orders, and furnish such further data as be requested
by the Financial Adviser for the proper disposal
of issues referred to him.
III. Financial Adviser- Communications
5.           The FinancialAdviser - Communicationr will continue to be under
the administrative control of the Ministry of Finance and to exercise
the power of Joint Secretary to the Ministry of Finance in relation to
the divisions to which he is attached (i.e. at present, Communications,
Commerce, Health, Family Planning, Labor, and Social Welfare). This
means that in most cases he will decide without reference to other Wings
of the Ministry of Finance.
6.           He will continue to deal with matters relating to the
interpretation, application and relaxation of service and financial rules
and regulations, the allocation of foreign exchange, and the provision
of funds out of the unspecified allocations of the budget.
7.           TNhile previously he had to obtain clearance from the
Ministry of Communications before he could refer a case to the
Ministry of Finance, he can now do so without its concurrence.   The
advice of the Financial Adviser in cases ,ihere the Ministry or T&T
Department have to refer to him will be birnding. In case of a difference
of opinion with the Financial Adviser, the Secretary -Communications may
take up the case with the Finance Secretary.



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 7 pages
8.           The Financial Adviser -Communications  is assisted in
respect to the Post and the Telegraph and Telephone Departments by a
Deputy Financial Adviser for T&T only located at Karachi. The position of a
second Deputy Financial Adviser has been decided uipon and will permit faster
and closer relations between the Deputy Financial Adviser and T&T.
Part II. operating Budget Procedures
9.           The budget integrates both current and capital operations,
but there are substantial differences between the operating and capital
parts as far as budget formation and disbursement are concerned.
10.          The Ministry of Communications has responsibility for
budgetary proposals, which are scrutinized by the Financial Adviser before
any budget provision is agreed upon.
11.           The preparation of the operating budget begins early in
the fiscal year preceding the year to which it relates. T&T Field Divi-
sional Engineers are asked by their General Manager or Director to
submit estimates of operation and maintenance expenditure requirements.
The Field General Managers or Directors scruitinize, correct and integrate
the estimates, which are then forwarded together with revenue forecasts
to the Directorate General. The Director General communicates to the
Financial Adviser proposals for establishment and other items of expend-
ture as they are ready.
12.          The Finance and Accounts Officer compiles and scrutinizes
all estimates of propoced current charges, revenues and capital
receipts, and submits them for approval and verification to the Finan-
cial Adviser.  The Fiancial Adviser then send them to the Budget Wing
of the Ministry of Finance.            -
13.          Once provisions for current expenditures have been made in
the budget and the budget has become effective, the Secretary -Commu-
nications has authority to sanction expenditure already allocated
in budget.  Reference to the Finnncial Adviser is only requested
in exceptional cases, such as expenditureR charged to the Contingency
Item in the budget, matters of interpretation, application and relaxation
of financial and service rules and regulations such as a new salary
scale, creation of a new permanent non-budgeted position, allocation of
.foreign exchange.

e) after discussions with the Secretary (Communications)
the Executive Council makes tentative allocations.
III. Expenditure Procedure for Capital Investments
22.          Prior to the law of July 1, 1969, all projects had to be
approved by the Financial Adviser or his Deputy before the Secretary
(Communications) or the Director General of T&T could proceed with an
expenditure for capital investment.
23.          Now the Financial Adviser's concurrence, or that of his
Deputy, is necessary only for lump sum budget allocations and in a
limited number of exceptional cases. As a rule, whenever a provision
for a specific scheme has been included in the budget expenditure,
sanction of such scheme may be given by the Director General of T&T
without further reference to the Financial Adviser.

Notes on Balance Sheet
1. Fixed Assets
The valuation of fixed assets is described in detail in Report
No. To 695a, Annex 7, page 2. The consultants work financed under the
first IDA Credit will include assessment of the value of T&T's assets.
In the projection of fixed assets for 1973-75 an annual increase of 13%
was assumed.
2. Work in Progress
For want of any data work in progress was estimated at 15%, of acca-
mulated capit,l outlay, this percentage was applied for past and future year..
3. Depreciation Reserves
This notional depreciation reserve was arrived at by calculating
an annual 51 depreciation on the annual average gross fixed assets in
operation since FY 1948.
4. Investments and Advances
Up to 1971 these consist of T&T's shares in TIP, TIC, CIP and
CTI. In 1972, a provision is also made for advances to the new factories.
After 1972 it was assumed that the relationis with all factories will be
on a fully cormmercial basis. It should be noted that T&T's present advances
to TIP are not showm in the accounts, because they are charged directly
under capital expenditures for which advances were given.
T&T's funds are in closed circuit with the Central Government's
Consolidated Fund.  The cash balance shown in 1973 and the following years
reflects the assumption that T&T will have the power to control its own
cash.
5. Customers Accounts Receivable
Up to 1969, actual collectible outstendings are showm; 1970
shows T&T's expectations while thereafter 1-1/2 months billings are
assumed outstanding.
6. Inventories
These accounts are rather high because of delays in charging
receiving accounts for transferred material, but also because much of tk_
material in workshops and stores is not needed and should be sold. WJith

the introduction of a more efficient inventory management, inventories
can be kept lower. Therefore, no allowance was made for increases in
the near future.
7. Accounts Payable
In the absence of records consolidating accounts payable, this
item was estimated. Since T&T should pay all bills before closing its
budget accounts, accounts payable are unlikely to be high. For past years
it was assumed that one month's material supply was payable.  This account
was projected to grow at 13% per annum.  T&T has no records on customerst
initial deposits. The funds are administered by the Finance Ministry.
8. Equity
Capital is allocated to the Department annually under the Certr.al
Government Budget, while on the other hand the Department pays its depre-
ciation provision and its surplus into funds maintained in the Mtinistry
of Finance. The balance of the Central Budget Contributions as of fiscal
year 196' amounting to PRs 187.1 million was arrived at by deducting
from total capital outlay, the part which could have been financed with
T&T's net contribution to the Renewals and Reserve (R&R) Fund and the
Surplus Fund. This difference between capital outlay and fund contri-
butions amounting to PRs 255.6 million is considered Government's
gross contribution, from which the outstanding foreign exchange loans of
PRs 68.5 million have to be deducted to arrive at the Central Budget's
own contribution of PRs 167.1 million.

T&T's accumulated contributions to the Surplus Fund           378.9

T&T's Total Contribution                             468.7

Financed by Central Budget Contributions 187.1
In the Pro Forma Balance Sheet 1965, T&T's contribution to the Surplus
and R&R Funds are recorded as Retained Earnings.  In the years followi-
fiscal year 1965, the net profits are added to this account while the
account Central Budget Contributions is the balencing item until fiscal
year 1972, when a modern accounting system is introduced.

9. Long Term Debt in Foreign Exchange
In TMT's budget accounts, foreign exchange loans assumed by
the Government to import telecommunication material form part of Central
Budget Contributions. The mission made an effort to put together various
parts and pieces making up T&T's foreign exchange obligations. T&T does
not in fact have to service long term loans any more than Budget Contri-
butions, but for the purpose of the financial statements it is assumed
that T&T does have to. The debt projections for fiscal year 1969-72
are based on a detailed estimate of foreign exchange needs, while for
the fiscal year 1973-75 it was assumed that one third of fixed capital
expenditures would require long term foreign exchange financing.

Notes on the Incone 3tatement
1. Revenues
Revenues in 1968 and 1969 correspond to cash receipts only,
thus understating revenues somewhat.  The breakdown of revenues in cate-
gories is estimated, because T&T's final accounts do not provide a meaning-
ful breadovyn.  Revenues for future years have for the first time been
proJected by T&T's staff and adjusted to somewhat more conservative
assumptions.
2. Expenditures
Total expenditures for operation and maintenance of the past
years are those shown in T&T's Budget Accounts, adjusted for expenditures
chargeable to capital accounts (credits to working expenses). The notional
depreciation was arrived at by calculating a 5/ rate (straightline) on
average fixed assets in operation. Interest on Central Budget Contributions
shows the likely net interest payable by T&T to Central Government Funds
for the period up to 1972,during which T&T is interlinked with the Consoli
dated Fund. Afterwzards T&T will pay a contribution to Government in lieu
of taxes calculating a rate of 65o on the equity at the beginning of the y
T&r2T is at present not responsible for servicing its debt and does
therefore not have all pertinent information.  On long term foreign ex-
change loans/credits for which conditions were exactly known, the actual
charges by the foreign creditor was applied,and for the rest an interest
rate of 5%3, the weightel1 average of 1968.

JUSTIFICATION OF TIE MICROWAVE LINKS IN THE
PROPOSED PROJECT
The methodology used in the demand forecast and rates of return
calculationsis described in detail below. Basic data used in the computatiorE
are given in Part II and the results in Part III. Part IV briefly describes
additional economic benefits.
I. METHODOLOGY
A. Demand Forecast
a. Traffic Fcrecast
Traffic, expressed in effective minutes, has been forecast for 20
years after the start of operation of the proposed microwave links, i.e.,
up to 1992; this corresponds to the estimated economic life of the microwave
equipment installed in 1970-730 The 98 basic connections between major
stations and their areas in lWest Pakistan on which traffic could be borne by
the proposed microwave links, or by further additional links, are identifiec".
They cover nearly 100% of the trunk traffic in West Pakistan.  Traffic on
these connections has been evaluated for fiscal year 1968/1969 on the basis
of observations made in mid-1969.
For each connection on which subscriber trunk dialing (STD) is
planned to be introduced, a stimulus factor has been estimated and applied to
the traffic figure at the expected date of STD introduction; it takes into
account community of interest between the two cities to be connected and LS
based on increases experienced in similar situations in the past. For con-
nections on which traffic is estimated to be presently supressed, the factor
by which the initial traffic has to be multiplied to account for the
relaxation of the shortage of circuits has been estimated on the basis of
existing overflow statistics.
Traffic growth for each of the 98 connections was ccmputed on a
yearly basis up to 1992. Cwing to the availability of additional data, up
to 1972 the growth in traffic originated by new subscribers has been dis-
tinguished from growth due to subscribers already existing in 1969; traffic
originating from existing subscribers has been assumed to increase somewhat
because of the general increase in economic activities and the extension in
the number of subscribers who can be reached by telephone. Each new sub-
scriber was assumed to generate, on the average, traffic similar but somewhat
inferior to that generated by the average existing subscriber; this is because.
although new telephone lines will continue to be granted mostly to non-
residential subscribers, new subscribers will generally belong to lower
priority socio-economic groups who use telephone facilities less intensively-



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 7 pagez
The projection of circuits requirements using the same methcdolcqy
as in the traffic forecast was made on the basis of an estimated average
natural annual growth rate based on past experience for every connection;
suppressed demand, and when appropriate, a stimulus factor for STD introductIna
were taken into account as well as the estimated effect on demand of a regular
small decrease in tariffs expressed in constant rupees.  Tariffs are assumed
to remain constant in current rupees, and it is reasonable to forecast a
small yearly increase in cost of living, which implies a small decrease in
tariffs in constant rupees every year. The effect on traffic is computed
through the price elasticity of demand for long distance services; the possible
range of values of this elasticity was estimated on the basis of past experLenrs
in Pakistan and other countries.
b. Forecast of Circuit Requirements
In the projection of circuits requirements, the same methodology as
in traffic forecast has been used. ',fhenever the traffic or the number of
circuits of a connection was missing for the base year, the conversion of thc
one into the other assumed a 20% day concentration factor, a 5% grade of
service, and 275 active days per year. Circuit requirements calculated for
every year and for every connection were increased by 15% to allow for tele.
graph and telex circuits, leased circuits, circuits to carry manual calls
between STD and non-STD exchanges, and circuits used for testing purposes.
Total circuit requirements on the main sections of the microwave system in
West Pakistan were calculated by adding the forecast circuit requirement
figures for the relevant connections.
B. Incremental Rate of Return
The incremental rate of return measures the financial return of
the nroject to the economy including taxes, interests, etc; it is defined
as the discount rate for which the net present 'ralue of incremental cash flows
to and from the economy is equal to zero. The incremental cash flows are
net of cash flows from financial transactions; they have not be-en ad-usted
for shado^- pricing and represent monetary flows. The flows are expressed in
current rupees, and take into account expected increases in the cost of livin-
and their effects on demand as well as capital and current costs.
a, Cash Outflows
i. Capital Investment Expenditures
The local component of initial capital investments was distinguis1-vf
from the foreign component. The latter was expressed in Pakistan rupeese by
using the official foreign exchange rate in the incremental rate of return
calculation and the shadow exchange rate for computing the minimum economic
rate of return.  The possibility of obtaining through international competit-.
bidding a slightly lower cost than the most likely estimate was explicitly
taken into account.



AN'NZ7 12I.)
Page 3 of 7 pages
The calculation of yearly total circuit requirements on all the
maajor sections of West Pakistants trunk backbone permitted the assessment
:f the timing of additional capital investments; these extensions were
assumed to be required a year before full capacity is likely to be reached.
They were expressed as a percentage of total initial capital investment, in-
corporating the same assumptions as used for the exchange rate and possible
range of costs.  A  small overall yearly reduction in the cost per channel
due to technological improvements was assumed roughly to compensate for the
cost of living increase effect on cash inflow.
ii. Other Cash Outflows
Incremental personnel costs have been estimated for the first year
of operation and have been supposed to increase proportionally to capital
investment and at an average rate based on experience of past wage and saLarv
increases.
The local component of other incremental operating and maintenanco
costs has been expressed as a percentage of the cumulative capital invest-
ment. It was further corrected to account for the increase in cost of living.
Incremental cash required for increased working capital has been
sxpressed for the incrermental accounts receivable as a percentage of the in-
crease in revenues, and for the increased current liabilities as a percentage
cf the incremental personnel and other operating and maintenance costs. The
tercentages were based on recent performance.
iii. Compensation for the Use of Local System
Facilities and for Trunk Switching and Exchanges
Twenty-five percent of trunk revenues were allocated to the funds
required for the rest of T&T's operations and expansion which directly or in'-
directly permit the development of the trunk traffic. This allocation was
split 3/4-1/4 between the local system facilities and the trunk switching
equipment and exchanges. It takes into consideration the fact that the ex-
nansion of the local network, the partial use for trunk purposes of local
exchanges, and the total use of trunk switching and exchanges are neceseary
-or the operation and expansion of the trunk network. The 25% allocation
'igure was based on the available estimate cost of the trunk switching and
exchanges up to 1972 and the relative capacity utilization of local faciliti-c:
for long distance purposes.
b. Cash Inflows
i. Incremental Revenues from Operations
STD tariffs for each of the basic 98 connections have been estinratzd
or recorded. For connections only partially using the proposed microwave lin'-,
only the incremental revenues corresponding to the use of the proposed micro-
wave were considered. Whenever an additional capital investment on the main
trunk backbone in West Pakistarn corresponded to a connection not initialJy



ANNE; X-
Page Z-of 7 pa.cs
covered by the proposed microwave, the tariffs on the routes using this
additional connection were increased starting from the year when the add ti,r-Js
ainvestment was estimated to be operating.
Total revenues on the proposed microwave links were computed from
the estimated traffic and tariffs on each of the 98 connections. Total
maximum revenues from the existing coaxial cable were canputed for every
year. Additional revenues due to additional investments for extension on
parts of the main trunk backbone not initially covered by the prcposed micrc-
wave links were also added for those connections after the extension was
assumed to be operative. Incremental revenues from the proposed microwave
investment and from additional investments were calculated by taking all
revenues on the microwave and coaxial route and subtracting, when appropriate
on additional links, the estimated maximum possible revenues from the coaxia1
cables.
ii. Residual Value of Capital Investment
Given the estimated 20 years of economic life of the microwave
equipment, the initial equipment has noresidual value. The equipment
corresponding to further extensions was assumed to have a residual value
proportional to its initial value by the ratio of remaining years of life
to total economic life.
C. Minimum Economic Rate of Return
The trunk telephone system in Pakistan is almost entirely used fo.
business and government purposes.  Given tht the marginal user is willing to
pay at least the value of the marginal productivity of the use of the trunk
telephone system, the estimated incremental revenues of the microwave links
are a rough measure of the minimum contribution of the proposed investment
to the income of the business and administration sector, and hence to
Pakistan's national income.
On the cost side, in order to better reflect the scarcity valuie
of foreign exchange to Pakistan, the opportunity cost of foreign exchange
was estimated at 9 rupees to the US dollar.
No shadow rate for labor was used, as the mission thinks that
over-valuation of certain salaries compared with their opportunity marginal
productivity, compensates roughly for the under-valuation of other salaries.
Using the shadow rate of foreign exchange, the minimum economic
rate of return was computed in the same manner as the incremental rate of
return.

D. Risk Analysis
Major elements of uncertainty were found in most of the estimates
underlying the demand and rate of return calculations.  These include the
following: the stimulus factors for introduction of STD, the measurement
of suppressed traffic, the growth factor of the demand of existing sub-
scribers and the attenuation factor of the demand of new subscribers,
the overall natural growth rate of demand, the initial value and growth
rate of personnel expenditures, the increase in cost of living, and the
price elasticity of demand. Instead of using most likely values with
qualifications, uncertainties were expressed in quantitative terms. Therefore,
major risk factors -ere identified and evaluated, while risk analysis was
applied to demand and rate of return computations. Two hundred samples
were taken at random. This permitted expressing the results by their mean
value and possible spread or risk, which in turn are expressed by probabi-
lity distribution curves or summarized by the standard deviations of the
distribution.
II. BASIC DATA
A.  Basic Data Relating to the 98 Connections
The attached table (1) gives the following data: the initial
traffic for the 98 connections and number of circuits in the base year
(1968/1969), the estimates of suppressed traffic, the STD stimulus factor,
the percentage increase in number of DEL of the cities on each connection
between 1968/69 and 1971/72, and the incremental revenue per minute
of traffic.
B. Risk Factors
Factors affecting the demand and rate of return, for which un-
certainties were quantified and taken into account in the computation, are
given with the estimated probability distribution in Table 2.
C. Other Data
Other important data used in the demand and rates of return
computations are given in Table 3 (pages 1 & 2).
III. RESULTS
A. Circuit Requirements
Circuit requirements, expressed by their mean value and standard
deviation, are given in Table 4 for every year up to 1992 for each of the
eight major links of West Pakistan's trunk backbone. This table shows
that, given the planned installed capacity in 1973, additional links
will be needed in 1974/75 between Lyallpur and Lahore; in 1975/76 between



ANNEI' 13
Page 60Tf 7y pses
Multan and Sargodha and between Karachi and Hyderabad; in 1978/79 between
Sargodha and Rawalpindi; and 1979/80 between Hyderabad and Sukkur, between
Sukkur and Multan, and between Multan and Lyallpur. Construction for these
extensions will have to start about two years before the required operation
date.
B. Incremental Rate of Return
The values obtained from the 200 samples have been graphed in
Charts 1 and 2. Chart 2 gives the frequency distribution and the best fit
density function curve approximated by a normal curve skewed to the right.
Chart 1 gives the cumulative frequency distribution and probability and the
corresponding best fit curve. The median of the incremental rate of return
is about 42.73%; its mean is 43.15% and its standard deviation 3.02%.
C Minimum Economic Rate of Return
Chart 3 gives the cumulative frequency and probability distributio'
and the best fit curve.  The median of the minimum rate of return distribution
is 37.0%; its mean is 37.4% and its standard deviation 2.5%.
IV. ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS
The expected high minimum economic rate of return is already an
Lndication of the priority of the proposed microwave investment. However,
the rate reflects only very partially the economic benefits of the expansiorn
of the trunk system in West Pakistan,
About 80-90% of all direct exchange lines will continue to be used
for business and government purposes many years after the projectts com-
pletion. The rate of use of these lines, particularly for long distance caUe5,
is much higher than for lines used by residential subscribers. The use of the
trunk facilities in W^Test Pakistan will therefore be mostly for production
rather than consumption purposes.
The proposed microwave links would make a substantial contributicn
to the production effort of Pakistan. They would save managerial time
otherwise spent in unsuccessful, repetitive attempts to make a long distance
call or in travel for face-to-face contacts. Business management would be im-
proved by better information, allowing easier decentralization with better
control and faster decision-making permitting for instance, faster procure-
ment leading to lower inventory levels.
The microwave links also would permit better transmission and
faster processing of government orders, They would be particularly crucia'l
in the implementation of political decentralization in four provinces, thiee
of which are in West Pakistan.

Industrial decentalization, intended to be fostered by the pro-
motion of secondary industrial centers, would be impossible without the
provision of proper communications.
The expansion of the trunk system would also permit increasing tro
role of market mechanisms by making it possible to obtain better and faster
information on market prices, conditions and alternative sources of supply,
and to shop for low prices.  The efficiency of the country's transport sectoe
would be enhanced by betber coordination such as through contacts with
carriers and information on alternative routing and transportation facilities.
Furthermore, with extensions into the rural areas, flood control, agricultura"_
marketing and storage would all become more efficient through the more rapid
communication provided by the expanded trunk system.

PAKISTAN
T & T Department
Work Schedule for the Karachi-Rawal-indi
Microwave System
Chart attached to this Annex shows the schedule for implementation
of the various phases of the Karachi-Rawalpindi microwave system. The
total period of execution is 42 months, with a starting date in December
1969. Execution of the various sections will be progressively carried
out, tested and commissioned beginning in June 1972. Ordering of equipment
is scheduled by November 1970, delivery from June 1971 to March 1973,
installation, testing and final proof of performance by June 1973.
Survey and System Design
The survey of the project will include propagation studies,
verification of "Line of Sight," and Fresnal Zone clearances. The exact
location of the repeater stations will be determined as a result of this
study.
System design will include determination of station parameters,
transmitter power, antenna gain, threshold margin, fading and signal to
noise ratio, so as to ensure that the system's overall performance is
in conformity with prescribed standards.
Installation
The installation will be carried out by departmental engineers
and technicians, under supervision of the suppliers' engineer.
Training
Engineers and technicians of the Department will be deputed
for training abroad with the contractor or other organizations for various
periods.  The total period of training will be 14 months.
