I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Ivory Coast has a population of about 6.7 million and a land area
of about 333,000 km2. During the last ten years, the indigenous portion of
its population has grown at an average annual rate of about 2.5% and, be-
cause of immigration from neighboring countries, its total population has
grown at an average annual rate of about 4%. This growth was accompanied
by rapid urbanization, the proportion of urban 1/ to total population
having increased from about 13% in 1955 to about 34% in 1975. Because of
the country's outstanding economic performance, the Gross National Income
per capita increased from about US$ 70 to US$ 500 in current prices respec-
tively in the period 1950 to 1975.
1.02      The combination of population explosion, rapid urbanization and
increasing affluence has strained existing public services and created
critical conditions where public services had not yet been established.
Water supply is among the services most affected by this rapid growth, par-
ticularly in the urban centers outside Abidjan where at present only about
15% of the population is receiving service through a house connection.
1.03      The Government is aware of the existing service deficiency and
has assigned high priority to the water sector in its 1976-1980 development
plan. The investment program for the water sector is ambitious and its full
implementation will depend in large part on the ability of the Ivorians to
attract the necessary financing. In this context, the Government has asked
the Bank to help finance part of its water supply expansion program for
provincial centers during 1977-1980.
1.04      A US$ 16.0 million Bank loan is thus proposed to cover the foreign
exchange component of a project which has a total estimated cost of US$ 23.0
million. The proposed project would be for installations in urban centers
outside Abidjan. It would include the equipment and civil works necessary
to expand some of the existing water systems and to install new systems as
well as provide for training and project related studies. A total of 15
centers which will benefit from the project have been identified and feasi-
bility and detailed engineering studies have been carried out with proceeds
from Loan 1076-IVC of January 17, 1975, for the Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage
project (para. 2.08). The remaining centers to be included in the project
would be identified in the early stage of project implementation, and the
related feasibility and engineering studies would be financed with proceeds
from the proposed loan.
1/ Urban population is population living in settlements of more than 4,000.

1.05      This project was appraised in November/December 1975 by Messrs.
C. Rietveld and M. Munasinghe of IBRD and M. Savard, consultant. Follow-up
missions were also made by Messrs. Rietveld and Savard in March 1976, by
Messrs. H. Busz and P. Koenig of IBRD in June 1976, and by Mr. Chaffey also
of IBRD in September 1976. This report was prepared by Messrs. Rietveld,
Busz, Gilling and Prenoveau.
II. THE SECTOR
General
2.01      The water supply sector of Ivory Coast is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Planning; the sewerage and drainage sector, that of the Ministry
of Public Works and Transport l/She Central Government enacts sector legis-
lation and, within the context of the country's Five-year Development Plan,
sets sector development objectives.
Sector Objectives
2.02      It has been the Government's policy to intensify ongoing efforts to
reduce the disparities in living conditions between the various parts of the
country and, in particular, between the capital and the rest of the country.
One of the strategies which has been adopted in support of this policy con-
sists of extending and improving infrastructure throughout the country, thus
upgrading living conditions, while at the same time reducing the appeal of
the larger centers to rural and semi-rural population.
2.03      The Government has thus identified water supply as one of the high
priority public services and has set ambitious objectives for the water supply
sector, namely: (i) providing every 'prefecture' and 'sous-prefecture' with
a piped water supply system by the early 1980's; (ii) extending existing
water supply systems; and (iii) providing all villages with a population of
100 or more with wells. These objectives form the basis of a 12-year water
development program (paras. 2.27 to 2.29) which when completed in 1985 will
increase the percentage of urban population having house connection from the
present 50% to 60% in Abidjan and from 15% to 25% outside Abidjan and the
number of village wells from about 1,100 to 10,300. It must be realized,
however, that during this period the population of Abidjan and the other urban
centers will have increased by about 90% and 83%, respectively. In absolute
terms, the urban population served would increase from 600,000 in 1975 to
1,550,000 in 1985. The cost of the 1977-80 four-year portion of this develop-
ment program has been estimated by SAH (para. 2.10) at CFAF 57.9 billion
1/  As a result of the July administrative rearrangements, the Ministry of
Planning now forms part of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning
and the Ministry of Public Works and Transport part of the Ministry of
Public Works, Transport, Construction and Urbanism.



(US$ 236.1 million) in  current  prices.  Full implementation in the
1977-80 period will depend on available financing. This is not critical,
however, because the total program is made up of numerous relatively small
investment increments which are not inter-dependent so that, if necessary,
investment in any number of centers could be postponed without jeopardizing
the rest of the program.
Water Resources and Existing Water Supply Facilities
Water Resources
2.04      Ivory Coast has two rainy seasons in the south, May-July and
October-November, which gradually merge into one season further north (see
Map No. 12765). Rainfall is heaviest along the coast (south) where no month
is without rain (Abidjan 2,093 mm), and decreases rapidly further inland
(Yamoussokro 1,500 mm). The coastal zone from Sassandra to the Ghanaian
border is the only area where ground water is found in large quantity.
Finally, four rivers running north-south constitute the principal surface
water resources.
2.05      Currently, Abidjan is supplied entirely from ground water, while
other centers derive about 80% of their requirements from surface water.
Urban Water Supply Facilities
2.06      As of mid-1976, Abidjan, Bouake and 53 other urban centers had
piped water facilities. These are detailed in Table 2-1. The existing
water systems are generally well equipped and maintained. Water losses
have been quite reasonable at about 15% in Abidjan and an average of about
20% elsewhere. The average length of pipe per connection is about 20 m in
Abidjan and 50 m in other centers. This is due to the lower population
density of the latter. The proportion of the population having access to
water in centers where some service exists, (para. 2.03) compares favo-
rably with that of other countries of Western Africa with similar per
capita income.
Rural Water Supply Facilities
2.07      Data are scant on rural facilities but an inventory of village
wells is currently underway. It is estimated that at present only about
1,100 wells or bore-holes exist and that the rural population is supplied
from concrete-lined wells, rarely equipped with pumps. Some of the village
wells occasionally dry up in the n,orth during the dry season and villagers
then have to resort to dug holes, ponds and streams which are sometimes
several kilometers away and where the quality of water is questionable.

Sewerage and Drainage Facilities
2.08      At present, only Abidjan has an organized sewerage and drainage
system. However, a five-year development plan is being prepared for the
larger centers outside Abidjan. A long-term improvement/expansion program
of the capital city's sewerage and drainage facilities is underway. Bank
Loan 1076-IVC of January 1975 is helping to finance the first stage of
this program, consisting mainly of the construction of 19.1 kilometers of
sewers and 3.6 kilometers of drains, the reallocation of the sewerage
sector responsibilities, and the setting up of the Fonds National d'Assai-
nissement et de Drainage' (FNA); of the total Loan of US$ 9.0 million,
US$ 1.2 million was set aside for the preparation of water sector feasibi-
lity studies. Effectiveness of the Loan was held up about one year mostly
because of delays in amending statutes and in setting up FNA. The project
is now progressing satisfactorily with disbursements affected only by the
original delay. Finally, about US$ 2.6 million of the US$ 44.0 million
Bank Loan for the Urban Development Project (1347-IVC) of December 1976,
is to help finance the construction of two trunk sewers with a total length
of 11.7 km. Procurement is in progress and bids for this component will be
received during the second half of 1977, about the time when this Urban
Development Loan is expected to become effective.
Allocation of Sector Responsibilities
Water Sector Responsibility
2.09      In line with its decision in the early 1970's to accelerate and
rationalize the development of the water sector, the Government has res-
tructured the sector organization. With minor exceptions (para. 2.15) the
Government has retained the property of sector assets which are all con-
structed by private contractors. Otherwise, sector responsibilities have
been allocated as follows:
(a) planning of sector development; scheduling and
supervision of construction; and supervision of
operation and maintenance: to 'Service Autonome
de l'Hydraulique Humaine' (SAH);
(b) operation and maintenance of all water system in
Ivory Coast; and construction of certain water
production facilities in the Abidjan area: to
'Societe de Distribution d'Eau de Cote d'Ivoire
(SODECI); and
(c) financing: to 'Fonds National de l'Hydraulique'
(FNH).

SAH
2.10      SAH is a specialized unit created in 1973, within the Ministry of
Planning (Chart 16094) for the purpose of planning, organizing and supervi-
sing the construction of sector facilities as well as supervising the main-
tenance and operation of these facilities on behalf of the Government.
2.11      SAH's professional staff of about 30 is made up mostly of engineers
provided by SCET, a French consultant, under a one-year renewable contract.
Most are expatriates. However, the Government has agreed to present, on or
before December 31, 1977, a recruitment and training plan acceptable to the
Bank for the gradual staffing of SAH with Ivorians; an amount of US$ 300,000
has been included in the proposed loan for training Ivorians abroad for the
equivalent of 10 man-years (para. 3.01) (g)). In addition, for the project
implementation period, the Government has agreed to continue employing
consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
2.12      Until now SAH has operated almost exclusively as a techni -l
department. It has done a satisfactory job in the areas of construction
planning, project design, bid evaluation, contract awards, project implemen-
tation, construction supervision, and maintenance and operation supervision.
However, it needs to reinforce its financial department so as to discharge
properly the remainder of its responsibilities, including the maintenance
of fixed assets and depreciation records for the sector, the programming of
investments, tariff studies, financial aspects of contracts, approval of
payments, and the financial supervision of SODECI. The Government has
agreed to have SAH carry out fully these duties and for this purpose to
strengtheit the financial department of SAH by adding one financial expert
and assigning one engineer to contract preparation and administration. The
fixed assets and related records prepared by SAH would be reviewed by FNH's
auditors as a part of FNH annual audit (para. 2.21).
SODECI
2.13      SODECI was formed in 1959 by 'Societe d'Am6nagement Urbain et Rural'
(SAUR), a French water supply company.  At present SAUR owns 46% of SODECI's
share capital, Ivorian nationals 45%, SONAFI, a Government finance company,
5% and French nationals 4%.
2.14      The operations of SODECI include not only the operation and mainte-
nance of urban water systems and public village wells, but also the operation
and maintenance of the sewerage and drainage sector facilities under contract
with SETti 1/, and contracting and consulting activities for its own account.
1/ SETU: 'Societe d'Amenagement des Terrains Urbains' is responsible for the
sewerage and drainage sector.

2.15      In the water sector, SODECT operates under two contracts with
the Government. The first is a conceF--ion contract 1/ for the Abidjan
area signed in 1959 for a period of 30 years with a repurchase option
after 15 years with two years' notice. It originally granted SODECI the
exclusive right to establish and maintain production, transmission and
distribution facilities in Abidjan. At the end of the concession all
these assets automatically revert to the Government. There have been
several amendments however, and this first contract is now tantamount to
a management contract under which SODECI is principally responsible for
the operation and maintenance of the Abidjan water supply system. Excep-
tionally, SODECI may still have to provide some minor water production
facilities but no major works and none of the transmission or distribution
facilities. The second is a management contract signed in mid-1974 for
the rest of the sector for a period of 15 years; it supersedes previous
contracts with individual municipalities and covers all urban water supply
outside Abidjan as well as rural water supply. Under this contract SODECI
is only responsible for operation and maintenance.
2.16      The present system for remunerating SODECI was introduced in 1974
in conjuction with the decision of the Government to institute country-wide
uniform water tariffs. A joint study made in the latter part of 1973 by
the Ministry of Planning and SODECI analysed the operating costs of various
types and size of centers, set standards as to the number and description of
the staff allowable in each center and the types and numbers of offices,
houses and vehicles to be used. The study also established norms for electric
power and treatment materials and supply consumption. Finally, all these
inputs were costed at the then prevailing prices to arrive at a basic average
remuneration per mJ of water sold. This basic remuneration is modified
each year on the basis of a price adjustment formula which includes factors
such as wages, welfare benefits, the price of electricity, the price of
water treatment materials, the value added tax on imported industrial pro-
ducts, and a wholesale price index.  This formula is to be used until the
total quantity of water sold reaches 75 million m3, probably during 1981.
It is expected that when that happens, another study, similar to that of 1973,
will be carried out and the contracts will be renegotiated. SODECI's
remuneration is based on water sold and ensures that systems water losses
are kept at a minimum. The operating cost of water systems of different
countries varies considerably because of the different characteristics of
the systems, and differences in the price of labor, power and materials.
1/ Under concessions contracts, the concessionaire is expected inter alia to
provide and finance fixed assets; the concessionaire is remunerated accor-
dingly and at the end of the concession, these assets revert to the
Government.

The global cost of operation per m3  sn six African countries -  including
Ivory Coast in 1976, ranged from abouit US$ 0.12 to US$ 0.35.  At US$ 0.23,
Ivory Coast ranked at mid-range of this group.  Overall, the quality of
service of SODECI is good, system losses are low (para. 2.06), and the
cost appears to be reasonably well controlled.
2.17      SODECI is required to submit statements of revenues and expenses
to the Government each year. In view of the diversity of SODECI's operations
and the implied allocation of overhead expenses to these operations, the
Government has agreed to use its best endeavors to have SODECI's accounts
independently audited each year, starting with 1977. The auditors will be
requested inter alia to review and comment on the adequacy of SODECI's costing
system.
2.18      SODECI has a total staff of about 1050; of this total, about 30
are French expatriates, mostly on secondment from SAUR of France, who occupy
the senior and middle management positions. However, SODECI has a policy of
Ivorianization, and at present the Deputy General Manager and all managers of
the provincial water supply systems are Ivorians.  Some of SODECI's Ivorian
engineers are receiving a one-year in-service training at SAUR in France,
and in-house training will continue to be used to prepare local personnel
to man SODECI's systems. Existing arrangements are satisfactory.
FNH
2.19      FNH is a fund created as an autonomous legal entity by the Government
in January 1976 for the purpose of financing water supply systems in Ivory Coast.
FNH is administered by a six-member Board, representing various Ministries 2/.
This Board meets at least twice a year to approve the water sector investment
program prepared by SAH, authorize borrowings, discuss the annual report and
financial statements of the Fund and approve its budget. The Minister of
Finance can veto any Board decision within 30 days of its publication.
1/ These countries are Nigeria, Tanzania, Liberia, Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast.
2/ These are representatives of the Ministries of Planning, Finance, Public Works,
Urbanism and Health and the Director of CAA. The Director of the 'Budget
Sp6cial d'Investissement et Equipements' is the Chairman of the Board; and
the Director of SAH attends meetings ex-officio.



- 11 -
2.20      According to its formation decree, FNH's resources may arise from:
(a) the water surcharge (para. 2.33);
(b) contributions from the Government;
(c) borrowings intended to finance water projects;
(d) the earnings from investment of accumulated
reserves; and
(e) any other source such as grants, etc.
These resources may be used to pay:
(f) FNH's own operating expenses;
(g) the cost of studies, construction and replacement
of water facilities, and
(h) the debt service.
2.21      FNH has no staff of its own.  Instead, its management functions is
handled by 'Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement' (CAA). CAA is an autonomous
legal entity which negotiates and services all debts -- local and foreign--on
behalf of the Government. All funds managed by CAA are deposited with, and
guaranteed by the Treasury of Ivory Coast. Under existing arrangements, CAA
negotiates all borrowings on behalf of FNH, receives the proceeds from the
water surcharge (para. 2.33), settles supplier's accounts as approved by SAH,
and services the debts of the water supply sector. CAA keeps separate accounts
for FNH, and Arthur Lnderson have recently been appointed to audit the accounts
of FNH. FNH has agreed to have its accounts and financial statements indepen-
dently audited each year, starting with 1977 and to prepare a pro-forma conso-
lidation of sector accounts no later than six months after the close of each
fiscal year (para. 2.32). Currently, CAA has a staff of about 50, who are
generally considered competent. However, there is a need to add to CAA's
in-house capability in the specific area of the financing of the water and
sewerage sectors. The Government has thus agreed to have CAA add one financial
expert to its staff by March 31, 1978. For this purpose the proposed loan
would include technical assistance consisting of one water and sewerage
financial expert for a period of three years.

The Water Supply Sector Development Program
Past Water Consumption in Urban Centers
2.22      Table 2-2 shows the water consumption and the number of connec-
tions in urban centers for the period 1969-75. Between 1969 and 1975,
the number of centers served outside Abidjan rose from 34 to 44; total
consumption increased at an average annual rate of 8.2% in Abidjan and
9.7% outside Abidjan; the number of connections increased at an average
annual rate of 13.2% in Abidjan and 12.3% outside Abidjan; and the con-
sumption per connection decreased at an average annual rate of 4.7% in
Abidjan and 2.2% outside Abidjan.
2.23      Table 2-3 shows the urban water consumption by category of users
for the years 1969, 1973 and 1975. Although the table is incomplete, it
gives an idea of the growth pattern, particularly for domestic consumption.
It also indicates that standpipe consumption has been going down, reaching
critically low levels. The percentage of water consumed through standpipes
in Abidjan was only about 2% of total in 1969, 0.9% in 1973 and 0.7% in
1975, a totally inadequate level in a city where, as previously mentioned,
only about 50% of the population enjoys a house connection. Outside
Abidjan, these percentages were 8% in 1969 and only 3% in 1973, while
population having a house connection was only about 20%.  By comparison,
in Cameroon, standpipe consumption recently accounted for about 16% of
total water consumption.
2.24      In part, there has been a certain reluctance to provide public
standpipes on the grounds that the municipal surcharge of the water tariff
(para. 2.33) would fast become insufficient, if the number of public stand-
pipes were increased substantially. The program initiated in 1974 (para.
2.27) called for all new centers to be served with piped water to be provided
with one public standpipe per thousand unserved population but foresaw no
additional public standpipes in centers already served. The Government has
agreed, however, as part of the tariff study to be financed under the pro-
posed loan (para. 3.01 (e)), to examine the criteria for providing public
stanTipipes as well as alternative methods for covering the cost of standpipe
water consumption.

2.25      The Government policy of promoting house connections for the popula-
tior. livin.g s.lthin reasonable distance from a water supply system, has also
contributed to reduce the relative importance of public standpipes. The two
principal measures adopted in support of this policy, i.e. the social connec-
tion and the social tariff block, are discussed below.
2.26      Initial connection charges of about CFAF 29,000 (US$ 120) had up
to recently precluded an important part of the population from getting a house
connection.  'This charge was substantially reduced in 1974, then completely
eliminated in 1976 for the smallest private connection, i.e. those having a
15 ItmL diameter.  The only remaining payment required at connection time is a
security deposit of CFAF 6,000 (US$ 25). The cost of these connections is
financed in. the same manner as the fixed assets to which they are incorporated
and is similarly recovered through the water tariff. Also in 1974, the
Government introduced a 'social' tariff block which covers the first 5 m3
consumed per month at a price equal to about two-thirds of the full tariff.



- i) -
This level of consumption is considered sufficient to take care of the
basic needs of about five or six persons per connection, i.e. about 25
liters per person per day. However, while the foregoing level may be
adequate in Abidjan, there is reason to believe that many more persons
share one connection in the centers outside Abidjan. The Government has
therefore agreed, as a part of the tariff study to be financed under the
proposed loan, to reassess and adjust as necessary the level of the minimum
monthly consumption of the social tariff block.
The 1974 Water Sector Development Program
2.27     In February 1974, SAE published, in support of the water supply
sector objectives (para. 2.03), a 12-year Development Program for 1974-85.
This program may be summarized as follows:
(a) provision by 1980 of water systems in 96
secondary centers presently without piped
water. This number was increased to 112
during 1975;
(b) gradual transfer of the responsibility for
operation and maintenance in the 30 secondary
centers with piped water from 'Socifte
d'Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire'
(EECI) to SODECI;
(c) expansion until 1985 of all existing water
systems including that of Abidjan to bring
the proportion of population having access
to watez supply to the levels indicated in
para. 2.03; and
(d) provision of 9,200 water points in rural
areas in order to serve all villages having
a population of over 100.
2.28     The 1974 program was technically well conceived, and its underlying
assumptions generally well considered. It constitutes a useful guide for
medium/long-term water sector planning in Ivory Coast. It is based on
macro-economic projections of population, water consumption per capita, etc;
it does not, however, result from detailed engineering studies and, before
projects are undertaken feasibility studies and project justification still
have to be prepared.

Revisions to the 1974 Water Sector Development Program
2.29     The 1974 program was ambitious, especially in the first years of
implementation. Insufficient time had been allowed for the 'start-up,
period, SAH was new, and FNH had not yet been formed. Not surprisingly,
substantial slippage has been experienced. However, the program has not
been completely re-phased, and some of the slippage has accumulated to
the point where the estimated cost of the first two years of the four-
year 1977-80 revised portion of the program accounts for 62% of total.
The Government has thus agreed, as a part of the sector and tariff studies
to be financed by the proposed loan (para. 3.01 (e)), to have the water
sector development program up-dated and re-phased by December 31, 1978,
taking into account the available resources of the sector, its borrowing
possibilities, and the combined impact of the sewerage and water sector
investments on the ability of the consumers to pay (para. 2.31).
Sector Financing Strategy
General
2.30     Concurrent with its desire to accelerate the development of the
water sector, in the early 1970's the Government reallocated sector res-
ponsibilities (para. 2.09) and formulated a new sector financing strategy
aimed at making the sector financially self-supporting. The Government
has already taken a number of steps and/or indicated how the sector would
be financed. The principal features of current financing arrangements,
which are discussed in paras. 2.31 to 2.36, are:
(a) centralization of the financing of fixed assets;
(b)  esLablishment of a uniform, country-wide tariff;
(c) financing of fixed assets with borrowings;
(d) servicing debt entirely with the water surcharge
of the tariff; and
(e)  paying for sector operation and maintenance
expenditures entirely with the operation charge
of the tariff.



- 17 -
Centralized Financing
2.31     Effective January, 1976, the responsibility for arranging sector
financing and debt servicing, which had been split between the Government,
municipalities and SODECI, was vested in FNH (para. 2.19). The new
arrangements are expected to strengthen the planning and control of sector
financing. However, integrated financial planning should be extended to
include the sewerage sector which also derives part of its revenues--the
sewerage surcharge--from the water tariff. The combined investments
currently under consideration for the water and sewerage sectors over
the next five years are roughly estimated at well over US$ 350 million,
an amount which may prove beyond the ability of these sectors to finance
out of sector revenues; in the absence of equity contributions, their in-
vestment plans may have to be pared down or implemented over longer periods
than originally planned. The Government has therefore agreed, startirng
with 1978, to entrust the 'Comite Interministeriel de Coordination du
Financement des Investissements Publics' with the review of the compati-
bility (i) between the annual investment and financing plans of the water
supply sector and those of the sewerage and drainage sectors; and (ii)
between such plans and the water supply tariffs and other financial
resources. In addition, FNH would continue to review and approve the
annual investment plans of the water sector (para. 2.19).
2.32     As a result of the centralization of financing and of the
streamlining of sector responsibilities (para. 2.09), the collection of
operating data and financial information necessary to assess the financial
performance of the sector as a whole will be simplified. This will also
strengthen sector financial planning. In this respect, the Government
has agreed to have sector accounts consolidated on a pro-forma basis by
FNH each year starting with 1977 on the basis of the independently audited
accounts of SAH, SODECI and FNH (paras. 2.12, 2.17 and 2.21).
Water Tariff Components
2.33     The water tariff in use in Ivory Coast is of the multiple component
type, each component being earmarked for a specific purpose, as follows:
(a) the 'operation charge' covers the operating and
maintenance expenditures of the sector under the
two existing contracts between the Government and
SODECI;
(b) the 'water surcharge' is intended to service sector
debt and cover FNH's operating expenditures;



- 18 -
(c) the 'sewerage surcharge' is intended to finance part
of the initial cost of the assets and the maintenance expen-
ditures of the sewerage sector;
(d) the 'municipal surcharge' is used to cover the cost
of water supply for public installations--including
public standpipes--and in the case of Abidjan and
four other large centers, to pay for garbage removal;
and
(e) the 'public health education surcharge'.
Uniform Water Tariff
2.34     Until 1974, there were two principal tariffs: one for Abidjan and
Bouake and one for provincial centers. These broadly reflected the local cost
structure and the physical arrangements for providing water. It is not un-
usual for the cost per capita to vary considerably from one urban center to
the next. For instance, in 1975, depending on the source of the water and
the size of the population, capital cost per capita ranged between CFAF
15,000 and CFAF 40,000. As can be seen in IBRD Chart 17149, capital costs
increase rapidly as population drops below certain levels. In this respect
Abidjan has the dual advantage of having a large population and sufficient
underground water, whereas the urban centers of the interior have small
populations and, taken as a whole, must rely on surface water for about 80%
of their requirements. In addition to higher capital costs, surface water
requires costly treatment which increases operating costs considerably.
The high cost structure of the water schemes of the interior has been one
of the major factors impeding/retarding the development of water systems
outside Abidjan. Past arrangements had precluded relatively small centers
of the interior from getting a water system because the tariffs of the
interior, high as they were; did not suffice to recover costs. By institu-
ting a uniform tariff, effective July 1974, whereby the Abidjan tariffs
were raised to the level of the tariffs of the interior, the Government
created a cross-subsidy system in favor of the centers of the interior.
This cross-subsidy is expected to play an important role in financing the
establishment of water systems in small centers in the future. However,
the uniform tariff may not provide sufficient incentive to conserve water.
For this reason, the Government has agreed, as a part of the tariff study
to be financed by the proposed loan (para. 3.01 (e)) to determine the level
and extent of cross-subsidization among centers and consumer classes.
Financing with Borrowings
2.35     Recent Government water sector investment and financing plans call
for financing sector assets largely with borrowings (Table 5-2). Although,
it is impossible to determine accurately the direct contribution of the

Government to sector assets in the past, this contribution has clearly
been important. This strategy represents an important move away from
past practices. There is every reason to believe that the foreign
component of the program will be covered by a combination of institutional
and supplier financing. However, arranging the counterpart financing at
reasonable terms may not be an easy task and the Government may have to
transfer some resources to the sector in the future.
Operating and Maintenance Expenditures
2.36     Operating and maintenance expenditures of the sector are met
separately for each of the sector entities. SAH is part of the Ministry
of Planning, and its expenditures are carried on the budget of that Ministry.
FNH's operating expenditures are covered by a portion of the 'water surcharge'.
Finally, the expenditures for operating and maintaining sector water systems
and village wells are covered by the 'operation charge' of the tariff which
is set in accordance with the two contracts between the Government and SODECI
(para. 2.16).
III. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01     The project consists of:
(a)  the improvement/extension of existing water systems in
ten secondary centers having an average population of
21,000 in 1975 (Table 4-1), including the construction
of two small earth dams with reservoir capacity of
5.4 and 3.0 million m3, improvement of river intake
works and wells, supply and installation of 22 pumps
with capacity ranging from 30 to 150 m3 per hour,



- 21 -
construction of three reservoirs with capacity
of 80, 200 and 300 m3, construction of two
elevated storage tanks with capacity of 300 and
400 m3, procurement and laying of 25 km of pipes
with diameters ranging from 60 to 100 mm, supply
and installation of 13 public standpipes, and
construction of 22 houses and 7 offices at plant
sites;
(b) the construction/installation of new systems in
five secondary centers having an average population
of 4,500 in 1975 (Table 4-1), including the drilling
and equipment of seven wells, supply and installation
of chlorination equipment, construction of five
elevated storage tanks with capacity ranging between
75 and 150 i3, supply and laying of about 50 km of
pipe with diameters between 60 and 125 mm, supply
and installation of 12 public standpipes and construc-
tion of five houses;
(c) the improvement/extension of existing water systems
and/or the construction/installation of new systems
in a number of secondary centers to be determined
during project implementation; these centers would be
selected according to criteria defined in para. 3.04;
and feasibility and detailed engineering studies would
be financed by the proposed loan (part d);
(d) the feasibility and detailed engineering studies for
part (c) and construction supervision for parts (a)
(b) and (c) of the project;
(e) the consulting services consisting of about 60 man-months
at an average rate of US$ 6,000 per field man-month,
including salaries and overhead and reimbursable expenses
payable to consultants at an average of US$ 2,000 per
field man-month, including housing, internal and external
travel, telecommunications, report preparation, etc., to
(i) update by December 1978 the country's water sector
development program, including inter-alia investment and
financing plans, for the period up to 1985, and (ii)
perform a tariff study covering the tariff structure as well
as the prospective tariff level requirements including those
of the sewerage sector (paras. 2.31 and 5.09). Terms of
reference for these studies have already been communicated
to the Borrower and agreed upon;



- 22 -
(f) technical assistance to CAA consisting of one water
and sewerage financial expert for a period of three
years (para. 2.21); and
(g) training abroad of Ivorians for an equivalent of ten
man-years as a first step in the gradual staffing of
SAH with Ivorians (para. 2.11).
Selection of Centers
3.02     The 12-year sector development program of 1974 (para. 2.27) esta-
blished the prospective water demand for each center or group of centers
with similar characteristics and proposed a sequence for initiating or
extending service of these centers. While safe water was urgently needed, it
was physically and financially impossible for the Government to take care
of all centers in the short-term. Thus centers were assigned a rank of
priority. The first step to set priority was to ensure that centers from
every region would be included in the program each year. Then within
each region, centers were assigned a rank in cooperation with the local
authorities, taking into account the size of the population and the per-
ceived economic importance of the centers. All centers included or to be
included in the project would form part of the Government priority list.
Fifteen centers have already been selected and feasibility studies comple-
ted (para. 3.05); the remainder will be selected in the early stages of
implementation in the manner and according to the criteria detailed below.
3.03     One of the objectives of the sector study to be financed under the
proposed loan (para. 3.01 (c)) is to update the water sector priorities
established in 1973/74. This study would not be available on time, however,
for the selection of the additional centers to be added during implementation
(para. 3.01 (c)) and they would be chosen therefore from the latest available
priority list. As in the case of the 15 centers already agreed upon (para.
3.01 (a) and (b)), feasibility studies to be financed under the proposed
loan (para. 3.01 (d)) would be carried out for the additional centers on the
basis of terms of reference and by consultants acceptable to the Bank. The
Government has agreed to have SAH review the feasibility studies and, after
ensuring that the systems proposed meet Bank criteria (para. 3.04), and--as
a condition of disbursement of the relevant category of the proposed loan--
request Bank approval for determining the specific additional centers to be
included in the project. SAH's request would include (i) a brief report on



- 23 -
each center commenting on their economic activities and on the project
technical and financial aspects; (ii) a cost summary detailing the im-
portant cost elements and showing separately physical and price contin-
gencies; and (iii) a statement demonstrating that the systems proposed
for these additional centers meet the criteria described in para. 3.04.
After Bank review and approval of SAH's request, detailed engineering
studies would be carried out by consultants acceptable to the Bank and
the civil works and equipment for all centers approved under this proce-
dure would be procured at the same time under Bank guidelines for inter-
national competitive bidding.
3.04     As pointed out in para. 2.34, with    the substantial transfer of
resources which now takes place through the uniform water tariff system
from Abidjan to the centers of the interior, a great number of those centers
will be provided with a piped water system. However, in determining which
additional centers would be included in the project (para. 3.01 (c)),
the Government has agreed to apply the following selection criteria:
(a) Priority. The water systems to be constructed/
extended would be selected from the latest available
Government priority list, as described in para. 3.02;
(b) Least Cost Solution. For each water system, the
alternative to be selected among different technical
alternatives would be that with the lowest present
value of incremental capital investments and opera-
tional expenses during the selected design period,
discounted at a rate equal to the opportunity cost
of funds in Ivory Coast; for this purpose a rate of
10% or other such rate as may be acceptable to the
Bank would be used;
(c) Financial Criteria. The following criteria would be
used for each water system to be included in the
project, except that in the case of extensions the
test would be applied to the entire water system of
which the extension is a part:



- 24 -
(i)  the water supply system's capital cost per capita
would not exceed by more than 30% the average
capital cost per capita for each type of system
(IBRD Chart 17149). The Government has agreed
to submit for Bank approval the updated cost
curves which would be used for this purpose; and
(ii)  each new centers and the extension facilities in
the case of an existing center would show a
positive rate of return.!/
Feasibility Studies
3.05     Feasibility studies for the centers included in parts 3.01 (a) and
(b) of the project were carried out by 'Bureau National d'Etude Technique et
de Developpement' (BNETD) and SODECI as consultants. The list of these
centers appears in Table 4-1. The feasibility studies were financed with
proceeds from Bank Loan 1076-IVC of January 17, 1975 for the Abidjan
Sewerage and Drainage project. The corsultants were responsible inter-alia
for establishing the population and water demand forecasts, for ensuring
that sufficient water would be available for the systems designed and for
establishing the least cost solution for each individual center (para. 4.07).
Cost Estimate
3.06     The project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$ 23.0
million, including foreign exchange costs of US$ 16.0 million or 70% of
total. The cost of the equipment and civil works was established by the
consultants with average prices of mid-1976 quoted in Ivory Coast for similar
water works (Tables 3-1 and 3-2). This cost was subsequently adjusted by
IBRD to early 1977 price levels, and the equivalent of about 4% of the early
1977 cost was added for construction supervision. Physical contingencies of
25% for dams and 15% for other works were also added. Finally, price con-
tingencies were calculated on the cost thus obtained at the rate of 9% per
year for civil works and 7.5% for material and equipment for the period
1977-79, and 8% and 7% respectively thereafter. This portion of the project
is ectiimated to cost US$ 13.9 million, including contingencies. Of the
remainder, US$ 8.2 million is allocated to the centers to be identified
during project implementation, and US$ 0.9 million to sector and tariff
studies, technical assistance and training, including contingencies (Table
3-3). All goods and services to be procured for the project are exempt
from taxes and duties.
1/  The rate of return is defined as the marginal discount rate which
equalizes the present value of costs and the present value of total
marginal revenues from the water tariff plus connection charges, if any.
These costs and revenues will be calculated in constant prices, with
-scs net of taxes and duties.

years including 3-1/2 years of grace. The Government has agreed to on-lend
the proceeds from the Bank Loan to FNH at terms satisfactory to the Bank.
The local component of the project cost is to be provided by FNH; however,
the Government has also agreed to provide or cause to be provided counter-
part funds as necessary for the timely completion of the project.
Implementation
3.08     The project would be carried out by SAH who would have overall
responsibility for construction supervision and for preparing the request
to the Bank for including the additional centers in the project during
implementation (para. 3.03). In these tasks, SAH would be assisted by
consultants. The Government has agreed to retain consultants satisfactory
to the Bank to (i) prepare in consultation with SAH and SODECI the feasibi-
lity and detailed engineering studies for the centers to be identified
during project implementation, and assist SAH to supervise the construction
of the entire project; and (ii) on the basis of terms of reference accep-
table to the Bank, perform the studies described in para. 3.01 (e) by
Bec,ember 31, 1978. The timing of project implementation appears in IBRD
Chart 17146.
Procurement
3.09     The procurement would be carried out in two stages.  The first would
cover the centers which have already been identified and the second during
project implementation after the remainder of the centers have been identified.
Bidding documents would group civil works and the laying of pipes for an
amount of US$13.9 million and the supply of equipment and pipes for an amount
of US$ 6.8 million broken down into lots of a size which would attract both
local and international bidders. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Consultant contracts amounting to US$ 2.4
million would be awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines.

Environmental Aspects
3.11     The water supplied as a result of the pioject will lead to an
increase in the volume of sewerage. This might eventually be of concern
in the more densely populated areas. However, as pointed out in para,
2.08, the Government is preparing plans for those centers.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
4.01     The project would support the Government's policy to improve the
standard of living in secondary centers, and heip to satisfy estimated
water demand--using the least cost solution--at reasonable capital cost
per capita; it would provide safe water to an estimated 400,000 additional
people when full system capacity is reached in the early 1990's. The factors
relating to the justification of the 15 centers which have already been
identified are discussed below. The criteria which would be used for the
remainder of the project (para. 3.04) woould result in the selection of
additional centers with similar characteristics.
Water Demand in Project Centers
Assumptions
4.02     The size of a water system depends on required production (demand)
which in turn is a function of projected consumption and expected system
losses and unaccounted for water.
4.03     The demand forecasts for project centers were prepared by the
consultants (BNETD and SODECI) in 1975. Population forecasts were derived
from general population projections based on the 1975 census and field
surveys and appear reasonable (Table 4-1); the domestic per capita con-
sumptions used (Table 4-2) are the national objectives of the 1974 Water
Sector Development Program and reflect the policy of promoting house
connections (para. 2.25). Industrial, commercial and administrative con-
sumptions were calculated on an individual basis. System losses and un-
accounted for water were assumed at 20% in centers with existing systems
(extensions) and 15% in centers where new systems are to be installed; this
reflects SODECI's experience which is likely to be maintained because of
the incentive provided by remunerating SODECI for water sold rather than
produced. Finally, as pointed out in paras. 4.04 and 4.05, the forecasts
of the consultants have been updated by the Bank to reflect the postponement
of the expected completion date and the latest consumption trends.

Demand Forecasts - Centers with New Systems
4.04     The criteria used to forecast water demand in the centers where
new systems are to be installed are reasonable. However, the first year
of operation will be 1979 instead of 1977 as assumed by BNETD/SODECI.
Forecasts have therefore been updated on the basis of the new timing
(Table 4-3). The type and size of initial facilities to oe provided
are not materially affected.
Demand Forecasts - Centers with Existing Systems
4.05     A comparison of the aggregate of BNETD/SODECI demand forecasts
for the systems to be expanded with historical data in Ivory Coast and
other African countries suggests that these forecasts were somewhat high.
The global average daily consumption (domestic plus other) of these centers
was forecast to increase from the present 21 liters per capita per day to
50 by 1988. Factors favoring more rapid growth than in the past include
(i) the fact that SODECI, who will henceforth operate these centers (para.
2.27 (b)), promotes development more than EECI and that (ii) connection
charges, except for a security deposit of 6,000 CFAF (US$ 25)(para. 2.26),
have been eliminated for the 15 mm diameter connection. Factors militating
against more rapid growth than in the past include the fact that (i) new
connections will be mostly domestic and their average consumption will be
less than the overall system average; and that (ii) a portion of the water
to be consumed by many prospective customers is now supplied from the piped
network but distributed by water vendors; thus this consumption would not
result in growth but would merely be a transfer from one account to another.
On balance, the Bank estimates that (i) consumption will reach only about
40 liters per capita per day by 1988; (ii) the number of connections which
increased at an annual rate of 15% in 1976, will increase at 20% per year
by 1978 and then only 14% by 1982; and (iii) population served will increase
from about 17% in 1976 to 63% by mid-1991, when capacity is reached
(Table 4-4). It is estimated that the original facilities to be built
are  not     materially affected except that full capacity utilization would
be reached about two years later than forecast by BNETD/SODECI.
4.06     At the outset the percentage of population served by house connections
in the new centers (Table 4-3) is expected to increase rapidly. However, after
the original back-logged demand has been satisfied, growth in the rate of con-
nections is not expected to be as high as in the centers which already have
systems (Table 4-4). This is due to the fact that the latter already have
much larger population, are more attractive, and their rate of connection are
expected to grow faster in the foreseeable future. As pointed out in paras.
2.25 and 2.26, the Government is promoting house connections; nevertheless,
at the stage of development of Ivory Coast, a large segment of the urban

population cannot afford to make either the required CFAF 6,000 (US$ 25)
deposit or the monthly payments for their consumption. Thus, in the
project centers (para. 2.24) public standpipes are to be provided at
the rate of one per 1,000 population without house connection and their
consumption has been estimated at five liters per capita per day,
taking into account the seasonal use of wells and the resale of water
from private connections of individuals as well as water vendors.
Least Cost Solution
4.07     Feasibility studies were prepared for each center included in
the project to ensure that facilities to be constructed would provide
water at least cost for the specified standard of service. Groundwater
from wells costs less than surface water which requires costly treatment
and was the automatic choice where it was available and suitable. Where
alternative designs were feasible, they were compared on the basis of a
discounted cashflow analysis to determine the optimum solution. Designs
were standardized as much as possible, however, to simplify planning
and construction, to reduce inventory costs of operating and maintenance
material, and to reduce training requirements and permit flexibility
in staffing.
4.08     The proposed Bank Loan would help to finance basic water source
works, treatment plants, and transmission facilities to meet demand to 1991
and distribution facilities for a first phase of expansion to meet demand
through 1981 and 1982 respectively for extension and new centers. Further
expansion of the distribution facilities would be made in a second stage;
this would provide an opportunity to re-assess the pattern of demand
growth for house connections thus minimizing the risk of incorrectly
locating facilities. A 12-year design interval was adopted to provide the
optimal economic size of facilities for production and distribution;
finally, dams were sized to meet demand to 2000.
Average Investment Costs
4.09     Average investment costs per connection and per capita served at
capacity are shown in Table 4-5. These costs are the total undiscounted
value of capital expenditures for production and distribution facilities
installed during stages one and two.

4.10     Direct comparison among water projects is difficult because of the
wide variation in situations and project components; however, the project
average investment costs compare favorably with the Bank estimated range
of US$ 1,000 - US$ 3,000 per connection and US$ 100 to US$ 300 per capita
served for new or major expansions.
Rate of Return
4.11     The discount rate which equalizes the present values of the
streams of readily quantifiable benefits and costs over the life of the
project has been calculated for extension and new centers, using the
project parameters and pricing method described in paragraph 4.12. The
rates obtained--about 3% for extensions and 2% for new centers--are low,
but not unusually so for small-sized centers such as those included in
the project, particularly in this case, where virtually only surface water
is available, a situation which inevitably results in additional capital
costs for civil works, transmission facilities and treatment plants,
as well as in additional treatment plant operating and maintenance costs,
including water treatment materials. In addition, the existence of a
uniform tariff precludes the possibility of testing the consumer's
willingness to pay the long-run marginal cost of water supply in different
centers. Finally, the benefits which will accrue from health improvement
and reduced migration from centers of the interior to Abidjan are not
easily quantifiable and have not therefore been taken into account in the
above calculations. The rates of return are somewhat sensitive to variations
of certain elements of the project (Table 4-6). However, a combination of
a 10% increase in capital and operating costs with a 10% drop in consumption
--a rather pessimistic assumption--still yields positive rates of return.

4.12      Table 4-7 shows assumptions used in the calculation of the rates
of return and Tables 4-8 and 4-9 show the cost and benefit cashflow streams
for extensions and new centers respectively. The calculations have been
done in terms of constant 1976 prices. Cost and benefits were converted
from domestic to border prices to reflect the efficiency prices of goods
and labor. The expected life of the civil works, i.e. 50 years, was
used as the project time horizon; and replacement has been provided for
inputs with a shorter life. Finally, sector revenues which have been
used as a minimum proxy for benefits have been valued at weighted average
prices, for water consumed via house connections and public standpipes.

ding contingencies (Table 5-1). For reasons mentioned in para. 2.29, the
construction slippage of prior years has been passed on to the following
years, and as a result the distribution of investments is skewed in favor
of the early years of the program.

Program Financing Plan
5.02      As pointed out earlier, full implementation of the Investment Program
in the 1977-80 period will depend on available financing, but this is not cri-
tical because the program is made up of relatively small investment increments
which are not interrelated and which can be postponed without affecting the
remainder of the program.
5.03      Table 5-2 shows the financing plan for the 1977-80 program.  The
financing requirements of the sector consist of (i) the operating expenditures
of SAH; (ii) the debt service which is to be settled with sector revenues
accruing to FNH; (iii) the operating expenditures of FNH; and (iv) the
Estimated Construction Costs which are expected to be financed 95% with borrow-
ines. The 'oDeration charge' resultinR from the two existing contracts between
the Government and SODECI has not been shown here as revenues would equal
expenditures under the actual compensation mechanism (para. 2.16).

5.04     Of a total CFAF 54.9 billion of required borrowings, about CFAF
16.9 billion has been secured and another CFAF 12.1 billion is currently
under consideration, including the proposed Bank Loan, leaving about
CFAF 25.9 billion to be arranged between now and the end of the program.
This may prove difficult,but not critical (para. 5.02). Nevertheless, a
strong financial discipline will be required lest the sector incur a high
proportion of short/medium-term debt (para. 5.13).
5.05      Villages do not pay for the maintenance of public wells.  In
principle in the past, they were expected to contribute about 10% of the
construction cost of these wells. However, during 1976, village contri-
butions have fallen far short of the 10% target, and the Government has
agreed to review within the tariff study (para. 3.01 (e)) the ability
of the villages to pay a share of the investment cost from their own
revenues and the feasibility of establishing a village well maintenance
tax.
Impact of the Program on the Water Surcharge
5.06      SAH's projections assume that the level of the water surcharge
would be adjusted each year as needed to meet the overall debt service
requirements of the sector (para. 5.12). On this basis, an average in-
crease of less than 15% per year in the water surcharge would be required
to carry out the 1977-80 program. The water sector operating cost per m3
of water sold in the 1977-80 period would be linked to changes in general
price levels (para. 2.16), which are roughly estimated at about 12% per
year, as would the other components of the tariff. Thus, in the program
period, the total average price of water per m3 would increase by about
13% per year, which is feasible.
The Water Tariff
5.07      Table 5-3 shows a comparison between the June 1974 tariffs--just
before the uniform tariff was instituted in July 1974--and the January 1977
tariffs, currently in force. Prior to July 1974, the major block of the
domestic tariff of the centers of the interior was 45% higher than that of
Abidjan. The July 1974 tariff action put them on a par. Since then, the
uniform tariff has increased three times, about 48%, 12.5% and 10.9%
respectively in January of 1975, 1976 and 1977. Water consumption was not
noticeably affected by these increases. The major domestic tariff block,
which is referred to as the 'full tariff', now stands at CFAF 132 per m3
and ranks among the highest in Western Africa.

5.08      The projected average revenues per m3 billed by component for 1977
appear in Table 5-4. It will be noted that the sewerage sector received
only about 12% of the total 'water' revenues. This is a relatively small
proportion, and pressure can be expected to increase for raising the sewe-
rage sector's share in the future; this situation reinforces the need for
coordinating the financing plans of the water and sewerage sectovs (para.
2.31).

5.09      The existing tariff structure needs to be studied mainly to:
(i) reassess the level of the minimum monthly consumption of the 'social
block' (para. 2.26); (ii) determine the extent to which the declining block
prices applied to industrial and large commercial users (Table 5-3) deviate
from the long-run marginal cost of supply; (iii) determine the level and extent
of cross-subsidization among centers and consumer classes (para. 4.12);
and (iv) establish a basis for allocating 'water revenues' between the
water and sewerage sectors. The Government has agreed to carry out a
tariff study by December 31, 1978 of the structure and level necessary
to satisfy the combined requirements of the water and sewerage sectors;
and to review by July 31, 1979, in consultation with the Bank, (i) the
findings of this study and (ii) the list of actions to be taken and their
timing. This study would be carried out with proceeds from the proposed
loan (para. 3.01 (e)).

Major Aspects of Sector Financial Performance
5.10      Until now there has been no consolidation of sector accounts
(para. 2.32), and sector information has been incomplete. With the new
organizational structure of the sector, this is being remedied. The two
major aspects of the sector financial performance--return on fixed assets
and debt service--are examined below.
Return on Fixed Assets
5.11      Table 5-5 shows the projected rates of return on revalued average
net fixed assets in service for the urban water sub-sector in the period
1976-81. These rates drop rapidly from about 6.1 in 1976 to about 3.1 in
1979, then rise slowly up to 3.7 by 1981. The sharp drop between 1976 and
1979 is due to the fact that consumption--and revenues in 1976 prices--
increase by only about 20% whereas fixed assets in service--also in 1976
prices-increase by about 110%. However, as the pace of investment slows
down in subsequent years and consumption continues to rise the rate of
return starts to increase. Thus, the Government has agreed that effective
1978 the water surcharge would be adjusted as required to provide revenues
sufficient to yield a return of not less than 3% each year on the current
value of the average net fixed assets in service in the urban water sub-
sector.  The Government has also agreed  to have SAH continue to develop
and maintain sector fixed assets and related depreciation and other accounts.
Debt Service
5.12      Table 5-6 shows the water sector projected revenues and debt
service requirements for the period 1977-85. Each year since the establis-
ment of the water surcharge in 1974, revenues have been greater than the
debt service requirements, resulting in a surplus which was about CFAF 2.5
billion at the end of 1976 and is expected to reach about CFAF 3.3 billion
by the end of 1977. However, due to the magnitude of planned investment
(para. 5.01), this surplus is projected to go down, especially in the
early 1980's as large amounts of principal become payable on the newly
acquired debt. However, at its lowest point, at the end of 1984, the
surplus from the water surcharge would remain at a satisfactory level, i.e.
the equivalent of 23% of the debt service of the following year. The
Government has agreed that, effective with the date of the proposed loan,
no additional debt would be incurred on account of the water supply sector

SAH's projections, a CFAF 2.4 billion grant was received from the Caisse de Stabilisa-

this table take this into account.

unless tne revenues trom the water surevhrao fnr the fizcal year irmer'iately
preceding such incurrence or for a later twelve-month period ended prior
to such incurrence, whichever is greater, is at any time sufficient to cover
the sum of the debt service requirements and FNH's estimated operating
expenditujres for the subsequent fiscal year. For this purpose, revenues
would be increased as necessary by the amount of the then existing water
surcharge surplus and cash from other sources, provided such surplus is not
reduced below the equivalent of two months of the sum of the debt service
requirement and FNH's estimated operating expenditures for the subsequent
fiscal year.
5.13      As of the end of 1976, the sector debt outstanding amounted to
about CFAF 17.4 billion; it had an original average maturity of about 12.0
years including 3.7 years of grace and an average rate of interest of
about 6.1%. About 15% of the sector debt outstanding consisted of loans
with an original maturity of less than seven years. While some short/
medium term financing is necessary for temporary working capital require-
ments, the current level is excessive and should be reduced. The Govern-
ment has agreed, effective with the date of the proposed loan, to ensure
that FNH will incur no debt with an original maturity of less than seven
years unless the outstanding amount of such debt has been reduced to, and
afterwards maintained at or below, the equivalent of 5% of the total amount
of debt outstanding for the sector.
Financial Position of SODECI
5.14      SODECI has been in operation for nearly 20 years.  Its 1973-75
balance sheets appear in Table 5-7. They reflect a generally good financial
position. In the 1973-75 period the current ratio declined from 1.7 to 1.4
reflecting the increase in receivables from an equivalent of 4.7 months to
5.9 months of sales due to problems with billing when a new computer was
introduced. Otherwise collections have been satisfactory. Its fixed
assets are for the most part water production and treatment facilities in
Abidjan. Finally, long-term debt represents mostly consumer guarantee
deposits. Table 5-7 shows SODECI's Income Statements for the years ended
December 1973, 1974 and 1975. In reading SODECI's Income Statements
(Table 5-8) it should be remembered that, as pointed out in para. 2.14,
SODECI's operations include more than operation and maintenance of the
water sector. In the three years which appear in Table 5-8, the proportion
of water sales revenues (operation charge) to total revenues has not
changed very much. Costs have been going up faster than sales, most
notably for materials, energy and personnel, so that with a doubling
of operating revenues, net income has remaindd constant.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECONMENDATIONS
6.01      The principal assurances which have been obtained from the Government
and other sector entities may be summarized as follows:
(a) a tariff study would be conducted with proceeds
from the proposed Bank Loan by consultants
acceptable to the Bank to review the appropria-
teness of the tariff structure, i.e. as it
affects consumers, including villages; and the
tariff components, i.e., the adequacy and the
way revenues are split between the water sector,
the sewerage sector, the municipal and the
public health surtaxes (paras. 2.26, 4.12, 5.05
and 5.09);
(b) the water supply sector development plan would be
updated by December 1978; this study would be
financed with proceeds from the proposed Bank
Loan (para. 2.29);
(c) starting in 1978, an Inter-Ministerial Coordi-
nating Committee will review the compatibility
between the annual investment and financing
plans of the water and sewerage sectors, and
between such plans and the water supply tariff
(para. 2.31);
(d) consultants satisfactory to the Bank would be
retained in the project implementation period
to (i) prepare the feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for the centers to be
identified during project implementation;
(ii) assist SAH in the supervision of project
execution; and (iii) on the basis of terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, update the
water sector development program and perform
a tariff study (para. 3.08);
(e) effective 1978, the water surcharge would be
adjusted as required to provide revenues sufficient
to yield a return of not less than 3% each year on
the current value of the average net fixed assets
in service in the urban water sub-sector (para.
5.11);



- S5 -
(f) effective with the date of the proposed loan, no
additional debt would be incurred on account of
the water supply sector unless the revenues from
the water surcharge for the fiscal year immediately
preceding such incurrence or for a later twelve-
month period ended prior to such incurrence, which-
ever is greater, is at any time sufficient to cover
the sum of the debt service requirements and FNH's
estimated expenditures of the subsequent fiscal
year. For this purpose revenues would be increased
as necessary by the amount of the then existing
water surcharge surplus and cash from other sources,
provided such surplus is not reduced below the equi-
valent of two months of the sum of the debt service
requirement and FNH's estimated expenditures for the
subsequent fiscal year (para. 5.12); and
(g) FNH would incur no debt with an original maturity
of less than seven years unless the outstanding
amount of such debt has been reduced to, and
afterwards maintained at or below, the equivalent
of 5% of the total amount of debt outstanding for
the sector (para. 5.13).
6.02      As a condition of disbursement against the category reserved
for the additional centers to be included in the project during implemen-
tation, SAH would provide a report on each center demonstrating that Bank
criteria have been applied and request Bank approval for inclusion of the
proposed centers in the project (para. 3.04).
6.03      With the assurances obtained, the project forms an appropriate
basis for the proposed loan.
