INDIA
SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Economic growth and improvement of the standard of living in
India depend critically on the development of the power sector. Over the
last two decades, India's power demand has grown roughly twice as fast as
the economy, and the power sector now takes the largest share of India's
public investment resources. This is mainly due to the rapid industrial
development in general and power-intensive industry in particular, and to
the impressive expansion of rural electrification, especially for
irrigation.
1.02      In spite of an almost five-fold increase in the country's
generation capacity, from 5,600 MW in 1960 to about 33,000 MW at present,
power shortages have been experienced in various parts of the country for
a number of years, and continuing gaps between supply and demand will be a
major constraining factor for the foreseeable future.
1.03      Before 1975, almost all  power facilities in India were planned,
constructed and operated by each State, each to meet its own needs.
Because of the rapid growth of the power sector, the Government of India
(GOI) decided to create new institutional structures in the power sector
and to emphasize central planning of generation and high voltage
transmission with the ultimate object of central control through a
national grid. In 1975 GOI established two companies, the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC),
responsible for the design, construction and operation of large
centrally-owned power stations and their associated transmission
facilities. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) performed studies of
the national power system, and GOI decided to proceed with the
construction of four large centrally-owned thermal power stations located
adjacent to coal fields--the 2,000 MW Singrauli, the 2,100 MW Korba, the
2,100 MW Ramagundam, and the 2,100 MW Farakka stations--supplying bulk
power to the States through an interconnected 400 kV transmission system.
IDA/Bank has financed the first stage of 600 MW at each plant, and its
associated transmission. In addition, IDA credits for the second stage of
Singrauli (1,400 MW) and the second stage of Korba (1,500 MW) have been
approved. The second stage of Ramagundam--comprising three additional 500
MW units with associated transmission facilities--is the subject of this
report. A loan of US$300 million is proposed.
Energy Resources
1.04      Commercial primary energy accounts for about 46% of total energy
in India with the balance (54%) coming from non-commercial sources (mainly
firewood, agricultural and animal waste). The main commercial energy
resources are coal, oil, natural gas and hydro power. There are also
resources of nuclear fuels, principally uranium and thorium. Some



-2-
geothermal energy sites have been identified, but the potential appears
to be limited. Over the past ten years total energy consumption in India
has grown at an annual rate of about 4%. Consumption of commercial energy
has increased faster (about 5% p.a.) than that of non-commercial energy,
thus resulting in a steady decline in the share of non-commercial energy
in total energy consumption. This is mainly due to substitution of
commercial energy for non-commercial forms of energy.
1.05      Coal and hydro power have an important role in meeting the
country's commercial energy requirements, covering at present about 70% of
total consumption. The consumption of petroleum is relatively low in
India in comparison with other developing countries, and accounts for
about 20% of total demand for commercial energy. Despite the low
petroleum consumption, the extensive development of domestic energy
resources such as coal and hydro power, and the recent development of
offshore petroleum resources, the country has not attained energy
self-sufficiency and remains dependent on imported oil to meet part of its
primary energy requirements. Moreover, in recent years there has been a
growing demand for petroleum products mainly because of difficulties in
coal supply and inadequate coal production. The impact on India's balance
of payments of the increase in world oil prices after 1973 is evident from
the following: while oil imports have grown by 40% (6.9 million tons)
between 1973/74 and 1980/81, the cost of imports rose by some 800% from
US$719 million in 1973/74 to about US$6.5 billion in 1980/81, equivalent
to more than 72% of India's merchandise exports. Domestic energy
resources such as coal and hydro are large enough to supply most of
India's future commercial energy requirements, particularly for industry
and for power generation. However, known oil and gas resources would not
be sufficient to meet the demand for oil in sectors (such as
transportation and residential) where further substitution by other fuels
is limited. Therefore, the exploration for new petroleum reserves and
development of existing sources is one of India's most pressing
priorities.
1.06      Coal constitutes the main domestic source of commercial energy
in India. Coal reserves to a depth of 600 m and of seam thickness of more
than 1.2 m are currently estimated at 85.4 billion tons, of which 17.9
billion tons are of the coking variety and 67.5 billion tons of the
non-coking variety. The Geological Survey of India has recently estimated
that an additional 26.1 billion tons of coal deposits exist at depths
below 600 m.
1.07      From 1953/54 to 1970/71, the share of coal in commercial primary
energy supply declined from 80% to about 60%, while production increased
from 34 million tons to about 65 million tons per year. Since 1970/71,
the share of coal has remained constant whereas production has grown at an
average annual rate of 5.5% (to 114 million metric tons in 1980/81).
Despite the production increases, shortages developed in 1977/78 and



-3-
reached an estimated 10 million tons in 1980/81. The main reasons for the
shortfalls are poor capacity utilization, shortages of explosives, floods,
labor problems, and bottlenecks in the transportation and distribution
systems.
1.08      The economically exploitable hydroelectric potential of India is
estimated at about 400,000 GWh of annual energy generation which might
sustain an installed capacity of 100,000 MW at 45% load factor. About
11,000 MW (one third of the total installed generating capacity) of hydro
potential is developed, 4,700 MW is scheduled for commissioning by 1984,
and a further 23,000 MW is under study for development. Some 70% of the
total hydroelectric potential is in the north and northeast, in remote
areas difficult to access.
1.09    India also has sufficient reserves of uranium (34,000 tons
equivalent of U308, of which 15,000 tons is considered economically
exploitable at current international prices) and thorium to meet the
foreseeable nuclear power program. The existing nuclear power plants have
a total installed capacity of 860 MW, consisting of two boiling water
reactor units at Tarapur (Maharashtra) and two pressurized heavy water
reactor units at Kot (Rajasthan). In addition, two units of 235 MW are
under construction at Kalpakkam (Tamil Nadu) and two units of the same
size at Narora (Uttar Pradesh). It is planned to set up two new stations
of two units of either 235 MW or 500 MW each. The construction of a
prototype fast breeder reactor is in progress. It is expected that it
will be possible to commission fast breeder reactors, as part of the power
system, by the mid-nineties. Beyond the year 2000, the fast breeder
reactors are expected to play a major role in the nuclear power
generation. An installed nuclear capacity of 5,000 MW has been visualised
by the year 2000. However, given the limited options available for
meeting the growing power demands and the likely role that nuclear power
may have to play beyond the year 2000, GOI considers that it may become
necessary to accelerate the nuclear power development to achieve an
installed capacity of 8,000 - 10,000 MW by the turn of the century.l/
1.10    India's prognostic recoverable reserves of oil and gas are
currently estimated at 6.5 billion tons of oil equivalent. Of this,
proven recoverable reserves are about 360 million tons of oil equivalent,
of which 294 million tons are oil and 66 million tons are gas. Over 60%
of the recoverable oil reserves are offshore.
1.11    Domestic oil production has increased from 0.5 million tons in
1961 to 11.8 million tons in 1979 and currently meets about 40% of India's
1/   See "Report of the Working Group on Energy Policy", 1979, Government
of India, Planning Commission.



-.4-
internal requirements. Gas production, now concentrated in the
north-eastern region, is currently estimated at about 2 million tons of
oil equivalent, of which about half is used as fuel or feedstock for
fertilizer plants and about half is flared, mainly because there is no
market for it within a reasonable distance from its dispersed production
sites. At present, it does not appear practical to use the relatively
small and dispersed amount of gas which is now flared, for power
generation. The utilization of natural gas for power generation or
alternatively as feedstock for fertilizer or petrochemical production is
being examined in the long-range power development study which GOI has
agreed to complete by April 1982 (see paras. 1.45 and 1.51)
1.12      In 1980/81 the power sector used about 44 million tons of coal
equivalenti/ (representing about 40% of total consumption of commercial
primary energy). Of power generated, 44% came from hydroelectric and
nuclear plants, 50% from coal, and 6% from oil. Over the past ten years
the share of coal in thermal generation has fluctuated between 85% and
90%, and this is expected to continue in the future. The share of primary
(hydro and nuclear) electrical energy in total generation has varied
between 43% and 50%. It is expected that by 1987/88 the power sector will
no longer use oil for electricity generation.
Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.13      The Bank has made ten loans to India for power projects
amounting to US$358.5 million, and IDA fifteen credits totalling US$2,096
million, for an aggregate of US$2,454.5 million. Of this amount, US$1,820
million involved financing of generating plant, US$23 million the purchase
of construction equipment for the Beas hydroelectric project, US$380
million the provision of high voltage transmission, and US$232 million the
purchase of rural electrification equipment. Fourteen loans and credits
have been completed including nine for generating plants, the Beas project
(Credit 89-IN), the first three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN,
Credits 242-IN and 377-IN) and the first rural electrification project
(Credit 572-IN). The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) is in an
advanced stage. The closing date of Credit 604-IN has been extended to
December 31, 1982 to enable full utilization of the funds. The Third
Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN) was approved in April 1978
and is well underway. The Singrauli (Credit 685-IN), Korba (Credit
793-IN) and the Ramagundam Thermal Power Projects (Credit 874-IN and Loan
1648-IN) and the Second Rural Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN) are
being implemented. The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power
1/   The following conversion factors were used:  1 ton of coal equivalent
(or 7 million kilocalories) is equivalent to 0.72 ton of crude oil
and 3,030 kWh.

Project (Credit 1027-IN), the credit/loan for the first stage of the
Farakka Thermal Power Project (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN), and the
credit for the Second Korba Thermal Power Project were approved in May
1980, June 1980 and July 1981, respectively.
1.14      The Singrauli, Korba and Trombay projects are on schedule.  The
Farakka and Ramagundam projects, and the Fourth Power Transmission Project
are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding modest initial delays in
implementation and a substantial delay in preparation of specifications
and review of tenders for the more sophisticated load dispatch equipment
for the transmission project. The Second Rural Electrification
Corporation Project is well ahead of schedule.
1.15    A Project Performance Audit Report on the Second Power
Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN) was issued on June 3, 1980. The
Report stated that the project was successful in assisting the nine
beneficiary SEBs in extending their transmission systems in order to help
to meet their growing power requirements over the extended project period.
Utilization of the generating capacity in the nine SEBs exceeded the
appraisal forecast. Institutional objectives mainly concerned the
rehabilitation of the finances of the SEBs, and while the results achieved
by the time of project completion were modest, the improvement effort was
continued by the Third and Fourth Power Transmission Projects (Credits
377-IN and 604-IN respectively). In FY 1980, seven of the nine SEBs
reached their target rate of return of 9.5%. This compares with three in
FY 1977 (the latest year by which all of the SEBs were to have earned a
9.5% rate of return). The conclusions of the Report pointed to: (a) the
impossibility of adequately supervising the work on the project (other
than the procurement aspects) which consisted of many sub-projects
scattered all over India, and (b) the absence of a close working
relationship between the Bank Group and the beneficiary SEBs, which denied
opportunities for effecting institutional improvements. The Report
suggested that a more direct involvement with the SEBs in projects of this
nature would be beneficial.
1.16    Besides its involvement in the power industry, the Bank Group is
also involved in India's oil and gas subsector. In 1977, the Bank made
a loan of US$150 million (Loan 1473-IN) for Phase III of the Bombay High
Offshore Development. This was followed in 1980 by a loan of US$400
million (Loan 1925-IN) for Phase IV of the same development.  In view of
the considerable impact on the economy of increasing oil prices, the
acceleration of production from existing fields, primarily the Bombay
High, remains an important priority. With regard to natural gas, the Bank
Group is cooperating with GOI to ensure that the development of the South
Bassein gas field, which is capable of producing 18 million Nm3/day of
non-associated gas, is carried out in an optimal manner, and that a basis
for a longer-term gas resource strategy is prepared in order to maximize
the benefits of this new source of energy to the economy.

Sector Institutions
1.17      The principal agencies in the sector are:  (i) the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs); (ii) the Atomic Energy Commission; (iii) the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA); (iv) the Regional Electricity Boards
(REBs); (v) the two central power corporations, NTPC and NHPC; and (vi)
the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd., (REC).
1.1-8     The SEBs are constituted by the State Governments under the
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, to promote the
coordinated development of the generation, transmission and distribution
of electricity within their respective States in the most efficient and
economical manner, and for the control and regulation of other supply
undertakings which are private licensees. These comprise municipal
utilities such as the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Undertaking, and
private utilities, the largest of which are the Tata Electric Companies
(Bombay), the Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC), and the Ahmedabad
Electric Supply Company. At the present time, the States effectively own
or control well over 90% of electricity supply facilities. While the SEBs
are corporate entities in their own right and enjoy some autonomy in the
management of their day-to-day operations, they are under the control of
their State Governments in such matters as policy, capital investment,
tariff changes, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.19      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with responsibility for
developing a national policy for power development and coordinating the
activities of the various agencies involved in electricity supply. At:
that time, it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power
Commission (CWPC). As a result of administrative changes introduced in
October 1974, responsibility for power was transferred to the Ministry
of Energy, which was created to bring together ministerial responsibility
for coal and power. This involved the transfer of the Power Wing of the
former CWPC to the CEA, which now comes under the Department of Power of
the Ministry of Energy and is responsible for developing a sound national
policy for the electricity supply industry. The Department of Atomic
Energy, which is directly responsible to the Prime Minister, deals with
nuclear power generation.
1.20      CEA's powers were enlarged through amendments to the general
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which were enacted on
November 30, 1976. In addition to its general responsibilities for
national power policies, it is now responsible for the formulation and
coordination of plans for power development, optimization of investments
in the power sector for the whole country, development of interconnected
system operation, training of personnel, and research and development. It
includes specialist engineering organizations which provide comprehensive
project engineering services to the electricity supply industry. The
Thermal Department also takes responsibility for monitoring the



-7-
performance and maintenance records of thermal power stations and for
organizing the training of power station personnel. The Economic and
Commercial Department accumulates data on economic, finance and accounting
aspects of the power industry in India, both at Center and State levels,
with particular reference to the operations of the SEBs. CEA is playing a
leading role in advising State Governments and their SEBs on measures to
be taken to implement the amendments to the financial provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, which were enacted in June 1978, and which
provide for the operation of SEBs on more commercial principles with a
financial objective of achieving a reasonable level of self-financing.
However, the introduction by the States of financial policies to give
effect to these amendments has been delayed pending Central Government
directives concerning implementation of improvement measures for the
sector. The CEA has also embarked on a program of reform of SEB
accounting practices and steps to introduce a standardized system of
commercial accounting are now underway. It is expected that
implementation of the new system would begin by April 1982. When
implemented, this system will bring uniformity to the procedures relating
to the preparation of accounts and will permit meaningful comparison of
SEB financial results.
1.21      The SEBs and the other licensed electricity undertakings are
required to submit their investment proposals to the CEA for technical and
economic appraisal and to the Energy Division of the Planning Commission
for inclusion in the Five Year Plan. The Planning Commission is
responsible for the allocation of plan funds among the States and among
sectors. Planning of generation, transmission, and distribution
development has traditionally been undertaken by each SEB for its own
State rather than on a regional or national basis. However, with the
rapid growth of the power sector, GOI recognizes the necessity for an
integrated national approach to sector development.
1.22      As a means of improving collaboration between the SEBs and
establishing power systems on a regional rather than a State basis,
Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) were set up for each of the Northern,
North Eastern, Southern, Eastern and Western Regions. The chairmanship of
each REB is assumed in rotation by the Chairmen of the SEBs within the
Region and they are staffed by engineers seconded from their constituent
SEBs. The general functions of the REBs are to plan integrated operation
of the power systems in the Region for the maximum benefit of the Region
as a whole, to coordinate overhaul and maintenance programs, to determine
generation schedules to be followed and the power available for transfer
between States, and to determine a suitable tariff structure for the
transfer of power within the Region. At present, the Boards function
mainly in an advisory role in relation to the SEBs. The REBs were
established between 1964 and 1966 by common resolution of the State and
Central Governments, to help develop integrated power systems in the
respective Regions, and thus prepare for the transition from separate



-8-
power systems at State level to regional systems and finally to an
interconnected national grid.
1.23      With most of their facilities under construction, currently NTPC
and NHPC are not in a position to take a leading role in the generation
and sale of power. At the present time, the construction of four large
central thermal power stations has been started as mentioned in paragraph
1.03. NHPC is constructing several large hydroelectric projects. A
transmission wing has also been established in NHPC to design and
construct the 220 kV and 400 kV overhead transmission associated with
hydro-projects, and any other transmission work which it might be
commissioned to undertake. A new central organization may soon be formed.
to assume ownership of these lines and to develop national or regional
grids. In most States, the SEB will continue for some time to be the
largest power undertaking. However, as future planning envisages a larger
share of new capacity in central organizations, NTPC and NHPC shall be
playing an increasing role in the power sector.
1.24      REC was incorporated in July 1969 under the Indian Companies
Act, 1965, as a company wholly owned by GOI, under the general supervision
of the then Ministry of Irrigation and Power (now under the Ministry of
Energy).  REC's chief objective is to finance rural electrification
schemes throughout the country, acting as a financial intermediary with
technical expertise, and administering funds received primarily from GOI.
It is REC's function to ensure efficient allocation of these funds by
establishing policies, procedures, and criteria for the formulation,
approval and implementation of such schemes. In doing so, REC is directed
to adopt a "project approach," coordinating electrification with other
inputs in rural development in order to achieve increased agricultural
production and overall economic development.
Existing Facilities - All India
1.25      The total installed generating capacity in the whole of India
as of March 31, 1981 was about 33,000 MW, including 2,736 MW of
non-utility capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial
consumers to meet their own needs. The generating capacity is shown in

1.26      Transmission is at 400 kV, 220 kV and 132 kV, and
subtransmission at 33 kV. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V.
The supply, in general, is reliable, but power shortages, especially
during the summer months, necessitate load shedding, shutdowns and
brownouts. System losses are still high, accounting for about 20% of
units sent out. This subject has been examined by the "Committee on
Power" (para. 1.55).
Power Supply/Demand Balance - All India
1.27      India's installed power generating capacity increased at an
annual rate of 10% during the 1950s and 1960s while gross electricity
generation grew at just under 12% during this 20 year-period due to a
better utilization of generating capacity. Although local and
intermittent shortages did occur during this period, system failures did
not present a major problem. However, by the early 1970s, the supply
situation had grown more serious, and potential unconstrained demand
consistently outpaced supply in a number of States. This situation was
due to several factors such as: failure to implement projects in
accordance with planned schedules, inadequate transmission development,
operating and maintenance problems leading to a low plant availability at
peak that at one point fell to about 64%, inadequate budget allocations



-10-
and the absence of adequate monsoon rains, particularly during the early
1970s, which led to lower hydro output.
1.28      The shortage situation was most serious in 1974/75, 1977/78 and
1979/80, particularly in the Eastern Region. The estimated deficit of
energy throughout India (calculated as actual supply compared to potential
unrestricted demand) during the 1970s ranged between 5% and 15%.
Estimates for 1980/81 indicate that the deficit was of the order of 10%.
1.29      Power shortages, particularly in the industrial sector, have
affected the output of the country, and the cost in terms of industrial
production foregone has been substantial. Generally, energy restrictions
fall on industry and there is relatively little loss to the economy on
account of power shortages in either the residential or agricultural
sectors. Lost value-added due to lost industrial production because of
power restrictions has been estimated to be in the neighborhood of 3% of
GDP.1/
1.30      The growth of the power sector during the last 10 years and the
pattern of consumption during this period is shown in Annex 1. Sales to
agriculture and irrigation increased substantially during the 1970s,
mainly because of the rural development programs. Industrial demand as a
proportion of total demand has declined, and there has been a small but
steady increase in domestic demand. It is expected that these trends in
demand pattern will continue with a gradual improvement in the annual load
factor.
Future Development - All India
1.31      The countrywide peak demand supplied in 1980/81 was 19,080 MW
(after supply restrictions); according to CEA's estimates, unconstrained
demand is expected to increase to about 25,000 MW in 1981/82, 21,000 MW of
which are expected to be met by available capacity.
1.32    India's tentative development program in the power sector
anticipates an expansion of generating capacity during the 10-year period
1980/81-1989/90 by about 50,000 MW to eliminate supply shortfalls by the
end of the decade; installed capacity by March 1990 would be about 80,000
MW. Only about 60% of this additional capacity has been approved by GOI
at the time of appraisal; further approvals are expected as resource
availability in future years becomes clearer. The additional capacity
scheduled for commissioning during this period is shown in more detail in
Table 1.2. Furthermore, the construction of some 15,000 km of 400 kV

Report No. 2335-IN, paragraph 68).

transmission lines is planned to enable full integration of the regional
systems and the evacuation of the output from the proposed new power
stations. The Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85), finalized in early 1981,
provides for a capacity addition of 19,666 MW and identifies the need for
an additional 30,000 MW during 1985-90. With the completion of the
long-range power development study currently being undertaken by GOI, a
detailed investment plan until 1990 will be finalized.

1.33      Annex 2 shows annual projections of planned installed capacity,
available capacity, potential peak demand, and the forecast of energy
requirements and availability (not taking into account diversity) until
1990. The data referring to the peak demand and energy requirement in
1979/80 and 1980/1981 show the demand constrained by supply; the estimated
unsuppressed power and energy demand would have been higher (para. 1.28).
The forecasts of peak load and energy requirements are based upon
continuous monitoring of development trends during the preparation of the
annual CEA electric power surveys of India.
1.34      Both unconstrained peak demand and annual energy requirements
are projected by CEA to grow at an average annual rate of about 10% until
1990. If the program of generation development can be achieved on time,
the present shortage of energy (about 10% of potential demand) would be



-12-
eliminated from 1984/1985 onwards, but there would still be a peak
capacity deficit throughout the 1980s, only to be eliminated by 1990. The
forecast capacity deficit decreases from the present 15% of potential
demand to about 2-3% in the late 1980s, a margin which is smaller than the
degree of accuracy of the forecast data input. In addition, the
projections by CEA employ a low expected availability factor of generating
plant. The peak availability in India under present operating conditions
is about 65% of installed capacity; the norms used by CEA in establishing
future availability of plant reflect this situation (Annex 3). An
improvement in the availability factor, however, is likely because of the
expected development of system interconnection and better maintenance
practices; a small improvement after 1985 may have the effect of
eliminating the capacity deficit even before 1990. In the short-run until
1985, little can be done to eliminate the present shortfall of capacity.
1.35    The All-India data of Annex 2 mask vast differences in shortages
in different regions, which develop because of insufficient
interconnection. The bulk of the aggregate deficit in the late 1980s is
attributable to the Northern Region; its regional expected capacity
deficit amounts to 10-15% of potential peak demand. In contrast, the
remaining regions show an approximate balance of supply and demand after
1985.
Southern Region Demand and Supply - Ramagundam Supply Area
1.36     The major authorities supplying the Southern Region are the Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala State Electricity Boards, and
the Mysore Power Corporation (MPC). In addition, a number of small
municipalities are engaged in power supply. All entities except MPC
supply electricity to final consumers, but only the four SEBs and MPC own
generation facilities. MPC supplies about 85% of the power made available
to consumers by the Karnataka SEB.
1.37      The Southern Region is the only fully integrated electricity
supply region in India, controlled by a Regional Load Dispatch Center at:
Bangalore. Load frequency control equipment at Bangalore is now being
tested and is expected to be operational soon. The large hydro component
in the system allows energy to be transferred during the monsoon from SEBs
with a reservoir-spilling surplus to others in the Region, while in the
early summer months thermal generation is maximized to husband scarce
water. In addition to its internal integration, the Region often operates
in parallel with the Western Region, particularly In the States of
Maharashtra and Gujarat. Maharashtra transfers off-peak energy to
Karnataka and receives peak assistance. The Union Territory of
Pondicherry receives power from Tamil Nadu. Annex 4 illustrates the
inter-State and inter-Regional exchanges during 1979/80.



-13-
1.38      The major Regional load centers are located in the State
capitals of Hyderabad, Bangalore and Madras, and in major industrial
locations such as Ramagundam in Andhra Pradesh and Belgaum in Karnataka.
Regional consumption shows a distinct evening peak, and a sustained
daytime plateau. Peaks in individual States do not occur at the same
time: the diversity factor is about 1.1. In line with the national
pattern, Regional consumption is heavily oriented towards industry: about
61% of total consumption are attributable to industrial consumers, about
18% to agricultural consumers for irrigation purposes, and about 11% to
domestic consumers. This pattern masks significant differences among
States. The share of agricultural consumption in Tamil Nadu and Andhra
Pradesh is more than 20%, while 75% of Karnataka's and Kerala's supplies
go to industry and only 5-8% to agriculture. Tamil Nadu is the dominant
State in the Region with about 40% of total consumption (Annex 5). Sales
in the Region have been growing at a steady rate of about 7% p.a. between
1970 and 1980, most of this in periods of supply restrictions. Generation
and sales growth in 1979/80 was a minimal 2%, largely due to widespread
supply difficulties and low reservoir levels (Annex 6).
1.39      System losses in the Region have been increasing during the last
five years, but have not substantially exceeded the All-India loss level
of about 20% of units sent out. Much of this may be due to rural
electrification programs introducing a wider distribution system. This is
particularly true of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, while Tamil Nadu and
Kerala have already achieved almost 100% village electrification. There
is evidence of some reduction of system losses in 1979/80.
1.40      As of March 1981, the total installed utility capacity in the
Region was about 7,650 MW, consisting of 63% hydro, and 37% conventional
thermal. Andhra Pradesh is the only State in the Region that has more
than 50% thermal capacity; Kerala and Karnataka are purely hydro (Annex
7). In addition, about 490 MW of major captive industrial generating
plant exist in the Region. While installed capacity has grown at about
6.5% p.a. between 1970 and 1980, actually available capacity at peak
showed a growth rate of about 7.5%, resulting in a significant improvement
in availability from about 65% to more than 70% (Annex 6). As energy
consumption has been increasing at an annual rate of 6.5%, the system load
factor decreased to about 57% in 1980, from more than 60% in the early
1970s, making the system peak more pronounced.
1.41      As in previous years, severe supply restrictions were imposed
on consumers in 1980, ranging from 15% to 60% of potential demand or
connected load (Annex 8). Overall, the Region experienced an estimated
shortfall of about 13% of potential unrestricted demand. 1979/80 was a
particularly poor year for supply because the hydro-dependent Region
suffered from a poor monsoon. A satisfactory monsoon in 1980, however,
significantly reduced the expected shortfall for 1980/81. The
restrictions affected almost exclusively industrial consumers (reducing



-14-
their supply in absolute terms), while domestic and agricultural consumers
benefitted from some growth in supply (Annex 5).
1.42      Potential unconstrained peak demand in the Region is expected
to grow at about 9% p.a. until 1990. As total installed capacity (derived
from identified generation projects and limited by expected fund
constraints) is anticipated to grow at about 10.5% p.a., and available
capacity at slightly less than that, the present estimated overall peaking
capacity shortage of about 6% of potential demand will be reduced to 2-3%
in the late 1980s, and practically eliminated by 1990. The energy
shortage, a major problem of the Region in poor hydro years, is expected
to be practically eliminated by the mid 1980s, but will increase again to
reach about 8% by 1990 (Annex 9). Much depends on timely approval and
implementation of generation projects. In this precariously balanced
situation, the proposed project's 1,500 MW addition by 1989 will
constitute about 10% of Regional peak demand and may make the difference
between balance or shortage.
1.43      Expected capacity additions during the coming decade show an
emphasis on hydro capacity, but with a decreased share of about 56% of
the total. By 1990, this will reduce the hydro share in total capacity
to 59% from the present 64%, making the Region less vulnerable to poor
monsoon seasons (Annex 10). The proposed project, with a final level of
sales to SEBs of about 7,300 GWh per year, will contribute significantly
to this shift in emphasis towards a better hydro-thermal balance.
Future Integrated System Operation
1.44    With the increasing size of the power sector in India and its
far-reaching impact on the country's economy, annual demand surveys and
Five-Year Plans at the State level have become inadequate as a basis for
power development planning. The larger size of power plants, their
consequent longer construction period--on average six to eight years for
thermal plants and eight to ten years for hydro plants--as well as their
gradual interconnection require a long-range perspective for investment
decisions on a regional and national level.
1.45    In recognition of the need for coordinated power development
throughout the country, provision was made in Credit 604-IN to help
finance the cost of consultants to develop a long-range national plan for
the sector, including technical, financial and economic aspects. Such a
plan would include, inter alia, detailed demand forecasts, investigation
of power generation schemes to meet load growth requirements for a 15-20
year period (including costs and sequencing of investments to optimize
resources), development of primary grid configurations (including the 400
kV system study which CEA has started but has so far limited to a 1987--88
perspective due to lack of overall long-term planning of power plants and
coordination with plans for other sectors in determining resource



-15-
requirements), and recommendations on responsibilities and needed
operational policies at the State, regional and national levels.  Such a
study is an essential prerequisite for formulating sound policies for
future development of the sector and GOI has indicated its intention to
complete such a study by April 1982, based on the terms of reference
agreed with the Association (para. 1.51).
1.46   The operation of regional systems, which will be integrated in the
future into a national grid, requires large numbers of personnel who will
have to be trained in the use of sophisticated load dispatch equipment and
interconnected systems operation. Programs for training staff to operate
the future load dispatch centers have been set up by CEA, and the
Association is being kept informed about the development of these programs
under the Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN).
Bank Group's Strategy in the Sector
1.47    The Bank Group's strategy in its involvement in the Indian power
sector, has been one of cooperation with GOI in seeking solutions to the
many difficult and politically sensitive problems which have confronted
the Indian electricity supply industry since Independence.
1.48    The Bank Group's main objectives in the sector are:
(a) assistance in accelerating the installation of generating
and transmission capacity and promotion of measures to
improve the operation and maintenance of existing plant, in
order to gradually eliminate the prevailing power shortages
in the country;
(b) assistance in introducing long-range system planning on a
nationwide basis which would assure implementation of a
least-cost power development program;
(c)  promotion of appropriate measures with respect to improving
the sector organization and training; and
(d) strengthening of the finances of the institutions involved
in the sector, particularly of the State Electricity Boards
(SEBs), through setting of rate-of-return targets or levels
of self-financing and advising in design of appropriate
tariff systems.
1.49    Under the Constitution, power supply is a "concurrent" subject.
This means that the responsibility for supplying electricity is shared
between the Central Government and the State Governments, requiring full
agreement between the Center and the States for the implementation of most
actions. The States develop and operate, through their Electricity



-16-
Boards, most of the power facilities. The consequence of this arrangement
in many instances has been a local or State approach where a national or
at least regional approach would have been more beneficial. Given these
difficulties, the improvements achieved so far have been encouraging.
They include the following:
(a) with the establishment of the Regional Electricity Boards
(para. 1.22) and later of NTPC and NHPC, the first important
steps towards an improved organizational structure of the
power sector have been made. GOI intends to gradually
strengthen the authority of the REBs and to increase their
role of coordinating the SEBs in matters of power development
and operations;
(b)  CEA was reorganized and had its powers enlarged through the
amendment in 1976 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948
(paras. 1.19 and 1.20);
(c) The amendment in June 1978 of the financial provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 requires that tariffs be sel: at
levels sufficient to enable the SEBs to finance from internal
sources a reasonable proportion of their investment program;
(d) Between 1978 and 1981, SEBs have, with some success, been
developing and implementing plans designed to improve their
financial performance at least to the extent of achieving a
rate of return of 9.5% as agreed under previous transmission
credits/loans. These plans consist of tariff increases,
rationalization of manpower requirements, improved
maintenance practices and other cost-effective measures;
(e) with a view to the reassessment of tariff policies, the
majority of the SEBs have recently completed tariff studies
based on marginal cost pricing principles. The Bank Group's
review of these studies recommended the standardization of
certain assumptions so as to produce a uniform methodology
for general application by all SEBs.
(f) NTPC's generation/transmission construction program (paras.
3.01 and 3.02), which is in the process of staged
implementation with Bank Group assistance, will make an
important contribution to the gradual elimination of the
present deficit in the country's power balance, and is
planned in the national interest, a move away from the
provincial attitude prevailing in the past with SEBs
constituting the almost exclusive source of power supply.
The proposed project would help to continue this program.



-17-
1.50    There are two specific areas which have been the cause of concern
to the Bank Group and also have been the subject of a continuing dialogue
with GOI. These are:
(a) the weakness of nationwide long-range planning for power
development; and
(b) the weak financial position of some SEBs.
1.51    So far, long-range power planning on a nationwide basis has not
been carried out in India, a major reason for the unreliable power supply
in the country. The only regular planning activities carried out in the
past were on a State-wide basis in the context of the various Five-Year
Plans and the Annual Power Reviews carried out by CEA. Consequently,
discussions were held with the Indian authorities both on the content of a
long-range power development study designed to prepare a least-cost power
development program and on CEA's capability to undertake such a study with
its own staff. GOI agreed with the terms of reference suggested by the
Bank Group. The study is underway and is to be completed by April 1982
(para. 1.45). During negotiations for the Second Korba Thermal Power
Project GOI provided to the Bank Group a copy of a document outlining the
status of preparation and schedule for completion of the ongoing
long-range development study. During negotiations, the status of
preparation of the study was discussed with GOI and found satisfactory
(para. 6.01a).
1.52    While the financial performance of some SEBs (the sole prospective
customers of NTPC) has been marginal in the past in achieving the 9.5%
rate of return, as covenanted under previous lending operations for power
transmission and rural electrification projects, there was a big
improvement overall during FY1979 and FY1980 when, out of a total of
sixteen major SEBs, eleven and thirteen SEBs, respectively, reached or
exceeded the target. This compares with seven and six in FY1977 and
FY1978, respectively (see Annex 11, Attachment 1 for further details).
The implementation by these SEBs of action programs designed to restore or
maintain their target rates of return has proved effective in most cases.
In the case of Uttar Pradesh SEB, the subsidization by the State
Government of rural electrification losses 1/ has enabled the SEB to reach
its target rate of return for the first time. Overall, the SEBs'
performance for FY1981 is expected to be maintained at the FY1980 level.
1/ In accordance with Credits 604-IN, 572-TN, and 911-IN, subsidies in
respect of rural electrification losses are to be included in "operat-
ing income" in calculating the annual rate of return.



-18-
1.53    In the context of this project, special attention is being given
to the SEBs of the Southern Region which would be recipients of Ramagundam
power/energy. The Southern Region is comprised the States of Andhra
Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The Union Territory of Goa
will also be a recipient of the Ramagundam output. The actual results of
these SEBs for FY1980 are set out in Annex 11, Attachment 1. Five year
projections through FY1985 are presently being prepared and it is expected
that in each case the covenanted rate of return of 9.5% will be either
maintained or exceeded.
1.54    Considering its increasing level of involvement in the Indian
power sector, the Bank Group requested more comprehensive information on
the sector during negotiations of the Farakka Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1053-IN/Loan 1887-IN). This request was formally made to GOI in
June 1980 when a suggested format for the monitoring of technical and
financial performance of the sector was forwarded to GOI for review and
approval. During appraisal, the reporting format was further reviewed
with CEA. This was also discussed between the Bank Group's
representatives and the Indian delegation during the Korba II negotiations
and an agreement was reached with regard to the format for technical
performance reporting. GOI has also indicated that it considers the Bank
Group's proposal regarding financial reporting requirements broadly
acceptable.  The performance reporting would be provided annually within
one year following the close of of the Indian fiscal year. The first
report would relate to the fiscal year 1981/82.
1.55    The Indian authorities have recognized that with the rapidly
expanding power sector in the country, all aspects of the sector should be
reviewed and that satisfactory solutions must be found for the various
sector problems. Consequently, GOI established a high-level committee in
November 1978, called the "Committee on Power" under the chairmanship of
V. G. Rajadhyaksha, former member of the Planning Commission. This
committee was assigned the task to examine and make recommendations for
improvement of the, power sector. It completed its task and submitted its
conclusions to GOI in September 1980. All major aspects of the power
sector were considered, including: planning, project formulation and
implementation; operation and maintenance; organization and management;
finance, financial management and tariffs; rural electrification; and
research and development. The recommendations of the Committee on Power,
most of which are satisfactory in the light of the Bank Group's strategy,
form a useful basis for improvement of India's power sector in all its
aspects.
1.56    Implementation of some of the Committee's recommendations is
already underway or, among others, better planning procedures and improved
operating and maintenance management. Although other important
recommendations made by the Committee may have considerable impact on long
established structures and deep-rooted habits, it is of the utmost



-19-
importance that GOI acts expeditiously in initiating the implementation of
measures to bring about the required improvements.
1.57    In addition to the actions already discussed with GOI (paras. 1.51
and 1.52), the Bank Group considers that actions to accelerate improvement
in the following areas are of high priority:
(a) Performance of thermal power plants: the measures to be
taken should focus on achieving better utilization of rated
capacity through improving maintenance practices, overcoming
delays in the supply of spare parts, reducing the duration of
maintenance shut-downs, improving the quality and flow of
coal supplies and upgrading the skills of personnel engaged
in operation and maintenance.
(b) Co-ordination of power development and growth in other
sectors: in connection with the long-range power development
plan, demand forecasting which is currently done on the basis
of unrestricted power supply should be related to realistic
projections limiting the growth of demand to the available
supply; this would be accomplished by adjusting the
connection policy for new consumers and by stressing
conservation and demand management measures for existing
consumers in order to make the optimal use of installed
generating capacity.
(c) Intensification of hydroelectric development: only 11% of
the economically exploitable potential has so far been
developed (para. 1.08); the measures to be taken should
include not only increased investment allocation, but also
appropriate project preparation procedures through
managerial, technical and administrative improvements.
(d) Strengthening of the role of the Central sector in power
generation and inter-State high voltage transmission: the
current transition from local grids to regional grids and
then to a national system should go in parallel with the
implementation of adequate institutional structures, which
should permit gradual shifts of the responsibility of
planning and operating power plants and inter-State
transmission linkages of 220 kV and above, from State level
to national level.
(e) Establishment of financial objectives and policies for their
implementation, principles for evolving rational tariff
policies and improvements in management information and
accounting systems for each SEB: to comply with the
provisions of the financial amendments to the Electricity



-20-
(Supply) Act, 1948 (para. 1.20), in terms of improving the
SEBs' self-financing capability to the extent of producing a
reasonable contribution towards future expansion, alternative
methods of financing of the SEBs must first be evaluated in
order to determine the impact both on consumers and on State
budgets.
1.58    The concern of the Bank Group with regard to the above-mentioned
areas of India's power sector is also reflected in the recommendations of
the Committee on Power. During the Korba II negotiations, GOI agreed to
provide to the Bank Group, by April 1982, an implementation plan and
schedule outlining the steps to be taken in each of the five priority
areas of power sector improvements listed above. In addition, tentative
agreement was reached during the appraisal of a proposed Third Rural
Electrification Project to accelerate the implementation of financial and
accounting improvements in SEBs, particularly with respect to commercial
accounting practices and SEBs' self-financing capability.

II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
Legal Status and Authorities
2.01    NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit, was established in
1975 under the Companies Act, 1956. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,
has been amended to give the Corporation statutory recognition. NTPC is a
company wholly owned by GOI under the general supervision of the Ministry
of Energy. Its initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million
(US$149 million) was increased to Rs 8,000 million (US$1,000 million) in
June 1980 and Rs 15,000 million (US$1,875 million) in September 1981. The
paid-up capital of the Corporation on September 30, 1981 was Rs 5,862
million. The Corporation has a Board of six Directors.
2.02    The Companies Act, 1956, confers broad powers on NTPC to carry out
its work. However, the tariffs to be applied as well as any changes in
such tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital budgets, have to be
approved by the Government. NTPC is also subject to periodic examination
by the Committee on Public Undertakings--a body established by GOI to
monitor the performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03    The main objectives for which the Corporation was established are:
(i) to design, construct, and operate large central thermal power
stations and the associated transmission systems; and
(ii) to transmit and sell the power generated.
NTPC will initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission
system over which power will be distributed from each plant and sold in
bulk to SEBs. Later these systems will be part of the 400 kV
interconnected regional systems which, still later, will be integrated
into the national grid.
2.04    NTPC's present program provides for the construction of four
thermal power stations (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka). It is
also possible that NTPC might ultimately take over ownership of the 510 MW
Badarpur station near Delhi, which is at present being managed by NTPC on
a management fee basis. The station is presently planned for an ultimate
capacity of 720 MW. The feasibility of installing two more 210 MW units,
which would increase the capacity of this station to 1140 MW, is being
investigated. NTPC has also undertaken investigations for identifying
additional sites for thermal power stations in the Central sector. Based
on these studies, feasibility reports submitted by NTPC for pithead
developments at Waidhan (Madhya Pradesh), Kehalgaon (Bihar), Talcher
(Orissa) and Pench (Madhya Pradesh) are under consideration by GOI.
Feasibility studies for other sites, i.e., Second Singrauli (Uttar
Pradesh) and Mangur (Andhra Pradesh) are under formulation. The capacity



-22-
to be installed at these sites in the first instance is likely to be about
5,000 MW while the ultimate potential is estimated to be nearly 14,000 MW1.
Organization and Management
2.05    NTPC's organization, which at present is necessarily construction
oriented, is shown in Annex 12, page 1. The complete range of management:
systems is shown in Annex 12, pages 2 and 3.  NTPC has also designed an
organizational structure (Annex 12, page 4) for the next stage of
development, when it will be taking up operation of large thermal plant
along with its increasing construction responsibilities. The new
organization structure is being progressively implemented.
2.06    NTPC has adopted a three-tier organizational structure.  The first
tier consists of the corporate functions of Planning and Marketing,
Personnel, and Finance which are entrusted with normal corporate level
responsibilities, such as the development and formulation of policies andl
their implementation. The other services relevant to the projects (second
tier) have been centralized as Service Divisions located at headquarters.
These are Technical Services, Contract and Procurement Services, Quality
Assurance and Expediting, and Project Management Services.
2.07    The third tier, which embraces project activities, consists of a
project organization for each of the four power plants under construction.
Each project organization is headed by a General Manager who is entrusted
with total responsibility for implementation of all aspects of the
project's construction program.
2.08    Good progress has been made in building up the organization since
1975 when NTPC was established. The number of staff appointed by August
1981 was 3,665 comprising 1039 executives, 204 executives in training and
2,256 non-executives. NTPC has also taken over the majority of the
employees of the Badarpur Project and Power Station (para. 2.04).
2.09    To date, NTPC has developed along sound lines.  Its founding
Chairman and Managing Director, a competent administrator with an
established reputation in the formulation and development of large
industrial undertakings, has been appointed Secretary of the Ministry of
Heavy Industry and a new Chairman has recently been appointed. NTPC's
well-trained staff is expected to carry on its work without noticeable
interruption. Remarkable progress has been made in all activities in the
NTPC's first five years and providing this impetus can be maintained with
no deterioration in management, NTPC should with the assistance of
consultants, be capable of handling the present large development program.
Site organizations are effectively functioning at all projects. The
centralized functions which, in addition to corporate personnel, are
planning/marketing and finance, provide the engineering, contracting and
project management input. They are organized to meet the project



-23-
requirements and to ensure an effective coordination of the projects under
construction.
Training
2.10    NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
demands of its large construction program. The next phase of expansion
will involve the need to recruit and train operating staff. When all
current developments have been completed and commissioned, NTPC's
establishment will have grown to a figure in the neighborhood of 15,000.
The importance, therefore, of implementing training programs for the
various skills required during the construction and operational phases
cannot be too highly stressed.
2.11    NTPC has placed special importance on this aspect of its
organization, and training programs are being developed by the Corporation
which will, in due course, be backed by a training school equipped with
200 MW and 500 MW simulators, financed from the proceeds of Credits 793-IN
and 1053-IN, as well as other modern facilities for instructing and
training the operating staff.
2.12    NTPC's training programs which so far have concentrated on
pre-operational spheres of activity such as Planning, Design and
Construction Management, are now additionally being aimed at its
operational sphere. Some of the current major activities are:
(a) Professional engineering training for Executive Trainees
(Engineering).
(b) Professional engineering training for Supervisory Trainees
(Engineering).
(c) Management development programs.
(d) Seminars and lectures on selected topics.
(e) Familiarization courses for both accounting and managerial
staff on the accounting systems and procedures being
implemented.
Recruitment of young executive trainees is mainly from engineering
graduates belonging to mechanical, electrical and civil disciplines on
appointment, who are inducted into a one-year training program. The first
group of young executive trainees was recruited in February 1977, the
second in December 1977 and the third by mid-1978, comprising 35, 45, and
84 members, respectively. The fourth group comprising 131 trainees was
recruited in November 1979 and training commenced in November 1980. The
training programs have been well designed to provide exposure to power



-24-
stations under construction and operation, equipment manufacturing plants,
engineering descriptions and project management services. For these
purposes, assistance is taken from a large faculty of experienced
engineers and managers selected from all over the country. NTPC is also
utilizing the facilities of the Central Electricity Generating Board
(U.K.) for training of operation and maintenance staff.
2.13    With the first 200 MW generating unit (at Singrauli) scheduled
to commence commercial operation in February 1982, NTPC has finalized
comprehensive plans for training operational staff, particularly the
non-supervisory staff in the various technical and non-technical trades,
to provide foremen for the first two units at Singrauli.  The manpower for
these is being drawn from experienced staff as well as from fresh
recruitment. Recruitment of manpower has commenced and key personnel,
such as the station superintendent, are already in position.  Sixty-three
executives including those experienced in power plant operation and
ninety-five supervisory staff are in position at Singrauli. Recruitment
of operation manpower also commenced at Korba and seventeen executives are
in position.
2.14    On-the-job training has high priority.  The methodology includes
classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions
supported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits.
Overall training plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Sale of Power from the Project
2.15    As in the case of NTPC's other projects being financed with Bank
Group assistance, GOI has undertaken to allocate at least 85% of the
proposed project's power/energy to the States in the region in which the
project is located. The remaining 15% will be sold in accordance with
priorities to be determined by GOI to States with the greatest need.
During negotiations, GOI confirmed that allocation of 85% of the output of.
power from the project to the SEBs of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala,
Tamil Nadu and the Electricity Department of the Union Territory of
Pondicherry has been agreed in principle. Undertakings to this effect
from these organizations, endorsed by their State Governments were
received by the Bank Group (para. 6.01b).
Accounting Organization and Systems
2.16    NTPC continues to report good progress in the planning of NTPC's
finance and accounting organization (Annex 13) and in the design and
implementation of accounting systems and procedures. The design of
accounting systems for both the construction and operational phases of
NTPC's activities has been completed. Implementation of systems for the
construction phase is either complete or at an advanced stage both at the
corporate center at headquarters, and also at the sites, while the



-25-
consultants' proposals for the operational phase are at an advanced stage
of discussion with management. To familiarize staff with the systems and
procedures, training courses are being conducted by the consultants in
conjunction with staff members from NTPC's corporate center.
Audit
2.17    The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a
professional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the
recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The
auditor is normally a member of the Indian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, and his audit report on NTPC's financial statements is
subject to comment by the Auditor General. Auditors Messrs. V.K. Mehta
and Company, Chartered Accountants, Delhi audited NTPC's accounts from
its incorporation up to and including FY 1979 and their audit reports
expressed satisfaction at the state of the company's affairs during this
period. For the audit of the accounts for FYs 1980 and 1981 two auditors
were appointed, Messrs. Raghu Nath Rai and Company and Messrs. Prasad Azad
and Company, both firms of Indian Chartered Accountants. There were no
adverse comments from the auditors on the accounts of either year. It
should be borne in mind that NTPC's activities will cover only project
construction until FY1982 when power will be sold for the first time.
NTPC has already undertaken in connection with previous credits and loans
to furnish to the Bank Group audited financial statements within seven
months of the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, together with a
certified report by the auditors, and a review of the accounts by the
Director of Commercial Audits. This has been restated in connection with
the proposed Loan (para. 6.01c).

III.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01    NTPC's current development program, comprising the four central
thermal power stations of Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka, with
associated 400 kV transmission, is part of India's power development
program which is described in paragraphs 1.31 through 1.35. The four
power plants, totalling 8,300 MW, have been located at coal fields, since
it is more economical to transport electricity than coal to the load
centers.
3.02    The first stages of the four central power stations consisting in
each case of three 200 MW generating units and associated transmission are
under construction. The commissioning of the power plant units is
scheduled between February 1982 (first 200 MW unit at Singrauli) and April
1990 (last 500 MW unit at Farakka).
The Project
3.03    The project represents the second stage of the Ramagundam
development comprising three 500 MW units with associated transmission
totalling about 1,400 km of 400 kV lines. This extension would bring the
power plant to its final installed capacity of 2,100 MW. The project also
provides for the purchase of a 6-8 seat, twin engine airplane to be used
for supervisory visits of NTPC's present and future plants.
3.04    The Ramagundam development which is described in detail in Annex
14 is being constructed in the Karimnagar district of Andhra Pradesh,
south of the Godavari river, in the vicinity of the Godavari coal fields
(see attached maps).
3.05    The coal for the Ramagundam development will be supplied from thLe
South Godavari coal fields located adjacent to the power plant. The mines
belong to the Singareni Colliery Company jointly owned by GOI and the
Andhra Pradesh Government. The South Godavari mining area has estimated
coal reserves of 1,135 million tons in four seams. The top two seams with
an estimated reserve of 567 million tons are of grade suitable for power
generation. The extractable reserves of 372 million tonnes, based on a
60 percent recovery in underground mining and 90 percent recovery in
opencast mining, would be sufficient to cover the coal consumption
capacity of a 2,100 MW power plant for about 50 years. The coal
requirement for the power plant would be met from thirteen mines, of which
eleven are already in production. The mines are planned to have a
capacity of 7.55 million tons by 1988/89. Ramagundam's demand is expected
to build gradually from 1983/84 to a maximum of 6.4 million tons by
1992/93, of which 1.9 million tons would be for the fist stage of the
power plant (600 MW) and 4.5 million tons for the second stage (1,500 MW).



-27-
The requirement of the second stage (the Project) would commence from
1987/88. The output from the mines would be adequate to meet the coal
requirement of the Ramagundam development. As in the case of the first
stage, GOI agreed during negotiations that necessary steps will be taken
to ensure adequate coal supplies for the efficient operation of the power
plant (para. 6.01d).
3.06    The cooling water system envisaged for the project is a closed
circuit system using cooling towers. Water requirements for the power
plant would be met from the Pochampad reservoir on the river Godavari,
located about 160 km upstream of the project site. The Pochampad
reservoir has a live storage capacity of 3.4 billion m3. Although total
water requirements of the power plant will be of the order of 85 m3/sec,
real water consumption for boiler make-up, ash disposal, addition of
cooling water, etc., will be only about 5.6 m3/sec. The consumptive water
requirements will be supplied from the Pochampad reservoir through an
irrigation canal system which reaches the area of Ramagundam. The Andhra
Pradesh Government has confirmed that the necessary water would be made
available and also assured that this shall have priority over all other
requirements. In order to ensure the continuity of water supply even
during canal maintenance or in case of a canal failure, a balancing
reservoir at the power plant, which will store its requirement of water
for about three months, is being constructed under the first stage of the
Ramagundam power project.
Estimated Cost
3.07    The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, duties and taxes, is Rs 11,308 million (US$1,414 million).
On the assumption that most of the contracts will be won by Indian
suppliers, the direct and indirect foreign currency costs are estimated
at about Rs 3,910 million (US$489 million) and the local currency cost at
Rs 7,398 million (US$925 million). The estimated costs of the project
are set out in Annex 15 and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

also based on estimates received for the 400 kV transmission associated
with the first stages of the Singrauli, Korba and Ramagundam thermal power
plants and on the costs of 400 kV facilities at various locations in
India. Physical contingencies of 10% on civil works and of 5% on plant
and transmission costs have been allowed to provide for unforeseeable
factors. In assessing price contingencies, it has been assumed that
contracts will be fixed price or with ceilings on price inflation for the
plant equipment as was the case for NTPC's other projects under
construction. Costs for equipment and erection have been escalated at 15%
for FY1981, 9% for FY1982, 8% for FY1983, 7% for FYs 1984 through 1986 and
6% yearly after FY1986.

g-ectE Financin-g
3.09    The proposed credit of US$300 rallion, representing about 21% of
the cost of the project (excluding duties and taxes and interest during
construction), would be applied to the CIF and/or ex-factory costs of
plant and equipment, excluding the 500 MW turbines and generators and
associated equipment and consultants' services. The turbines and
generators would be financed by the Federal Republic of Germany
(Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), which has been requested by GO!,
and is expected to extend a loan of US$150 million equivalent to support
the proposed project in financing those parts of the 500 MW
turbo-generator units which will be manufactured in Germany (para. 3.13).
A US$30 million loan froTu the OPEC funds is also under consideration.
Civil works, plant erection costs, inland transportation costs, interest
during construction, duties and taxes and any other costs not financed
from the credit of KfW or the loan from the OPEC fund would be financed by
GOI in the form of loan and equity share capital2 However, GOI has
indicated that it may seek additional sources of financing for the
project.
Engineering and Construction
3.10    Consultants (United Engineers, U.S.A.) were appointed under Credit
1027-IN (Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project) for NTPC's program for
installation of 500 MW units to: (i) review NTPC's basic engineering and
design; (ii) assist in the more sophisticated areas of design; and (iii)
review specifications, as required by NTPC and the Association.  GOI has
also agreed to appoint consultants for engineering of 500 MW units under
the credit for the Second Korba Thermal Power Project. A similar
arrangement is proposed for the project to (i) review NTPC's basic
engineering and design; and (ii) assist in other areas as required by NTPC
and the Association. Supervisory services for erection and commissioning
of the main equiDment, such as turbo-alternator units and steam
generators, would be provided by the manufacturers of the equipment.  The
review engineering consultancy requirements for the project are estimated
at about 90 man-months, at an average cost of US$12,500 per man-month,
including salary, costs, fees, interrnational travel and subsistence.
3.11    The project is comprised of a number of major works which
coordinated to ensure efficient progress. To this end, NTPC has developed
comprehensive project management systems, including program coordination
and supervision of construction of -,he power stationis and has already
appointed a foreign consultant firm (United Engineers, U.S.A.) to review
these systems and their initial implementation.  The review was taken up
in January 1981.  To ensure an effective coordination of the projects
under construction, NTPC' uses PERT ohLsrtcs, vWhrich not only plan the
progress of various physical ncti-vitles but also indicate the phasing and



-30-
quantum of inputs such as financial resources, manpower of different
types, scarce materials, etc.
3.12    The project construction schedule is shown in Annex 16,  Project
completion is expected by September 1989.
Procurement
3.13    Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed
credit would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Association's guidelines. Documents for individual
contracts above US$2,500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review
by the Association. Bidding documents for such equipment, including
tender analyses and recommendations for award of contracts, would be
prepared by NTPC, and approved by the Bank Group. To facilitate contract
coordination, the invitation to tender for major plant contracts would be
on a supply and erect basis. This could include civil works in certain
cases where these cannot be di-associated from the plant contract--i.e.,
coal handling, substation structure, and transmission lines. Local
manufacturers would be expected to bid for all categories of equipment. A
domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, would be
applied in bid comparison for equipment contracts. To prevent
administrative procurement delays, in case the lowest evaluated bidder is
a foreign manufacturer, GOI has agreed that it would grant import
permission for such items without further review by any agency of the
Government (para. 6.01e). There are competent local contractors in India
and also manufacturing facilities covering most of the equipment for the
project. All goods not financed from the proposed credit (and from the
expected KfW loan) will be subject to local procurement procedures, which
are satisfactory. The 500 MW turbines and generators are being built by
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) under license from Kraftwerk tfnion
(KWU), Germany. BHEL is progressively taking over the manufacture of the
500 MW generating units, Although a substantial part of the turbines and
generators for the proposed project would be manufactured by BHEL,
critical components would be manufactured in Germany by KWU. KfW would
finance those parts manufactured in Germany.
Disbursement
3.14    The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 17.
Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100% of the
cost of consultants retained for the 500 MW units (para. 3.10), and
against the cost of the equipment to be financed from the proposed credit
as follows:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment manufactured in
India after international competitive bidding; and



-31-
(b)  100% of the foreign cost of equipment procured from abt -
Disbursements will be fully documented in accordance with IDA's standard
requirements.
Ecological Aspects
3.15    The ecological and environmental aspects of the project were
discussed during appraisal. GOI confirmed that the Ramagundam development
had received the approval of the Indian National Committee on
Environmental Planning for the final installed capacity of 2,100 MW and
NTPC agreed to comply with all environmental quality standards prescribed
by this committee in the design, construction and operation of the
project.
3.16    As in the case of the first stage of the Ramagundam development,
the principal environmental concerns with the proposed project are: (a)
location; (b) stack emission; (c) heat dissipation; (d) ash disposal; and
(e) effluent discharge. These are outlined below:
(a) Location. The proposed Ramagundam power station is a pit
head station and is situated far from any urban area.
Accordingly, there are no problems other than the need to
ensure the health and environment of the operating staff who
will be housed in a residential area to be constructed some
2.5 km from the power station. They would not be affected
because of the high stack.
(b)  Stack Emissions.   Electrostatic precipitators with an
efficiency of 99% will be installed and the stack will be
220m high to ensure that emitted particulate matter will be
spread over a sufficiently wide area to reduce the density of
pollutants to an acceptable level.  DusS emission at the
stack outlet will be limited to 300mg/m . The sulfur content
of the coal is in the range of 0.3% to 0.5% which is low and
does not present a pollution problem. The ambient
coiicentratiou of S02 and dust at ground level is estimated
at 0.05 mg/ml and 0.07 mg/m3, respectively, well below the
threshold limits. The above target figures of stack
emissions will be monitored after commissioning of the power
plant through analysis by chemical and physical methods of
carefully collected samples.
(c) Heat Dissipation. The cooling water system adopted for the
project is a closed circuit system with cooling towers.
Hence only blow down from the closed circiit will be
discharged into storm water drain. This will not have arny
adverse impact on marine life.



-32-
(d)  Ash Disposal.  The ash will be pumped as slurry through a
pipeline to an ash dump area located to the west of the
Kazipet-Ballarshah railway line. Water from the ash disposal
area will also be discharged into the Godavari river. Tests
at other locations have shown that this does not have any
detrimental effect on the ecological system and that the
downstream water is fit for irrigation purposes. To reduce
pollution due to windblown ash, trees are being planted
around the ash disposal area.
(e)  Effluent Discharge.  The effluent from the water treatment
plant will be neutralized suitably in neutralizing pits and
discharged into storm water drains.  Any oil spillage from
the fuel oil storage area and transformer yard will be
drained to a separate drain and absorbed in the ground
through percolation in soak pits.  Sewerage from  the plant
and township area will be treated before discharging it into
a natural stream.
3.17    With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel
must confirm, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are
concerned the turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, which
is the noisiest area of the plant, has a sound pressure level of less than
90 decibels which is well below the maximum acceptable threshold for the
normal 8 hour/day shift worker.  Fans and safety valves are being provided
with silencers to limit the noise. All the control rooms will be provided
with sound proof doors, windows and walls.
Project Risks
3.18    The project represents one phase of an overall development program
comprised of 8,300 MW of generating plant and some 7,000 km of 400 kV
transmission. It is part of a tightly designed program with plant and
transmission coming in at phased intervals throughout the period 1982
through 1991. Maintaining this program on schedule requires careful
coordination and expert supervision at all levels. The principal risk is
the possibility of slippage which could give rise to delayed commissioning
of plant and loss of revenues. With a program of construction of this
magnitude, there is no guarantee that some delays will not occur, but
these will be kept to a minimum through careful coordination and
supervision during construction and careful attention, when placing
contracts, to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery
schedules.



-33-
3.19    Other risk areas are in engineering design, equipment quality,
cost quality, cost overruns and problems of commissioning and operation
during the early operational stage with resultant loss of revenues. There
is also the risk of damage due to fire, explosion, etc., but this is
covered by insurance provided by the respective contractors during the
construction stage and through a comprehensive insurance policy which NTPC
is formulating for its operation stage.
3.20    These risks have been carefully assessed and the following
safeguards taken:
(a) NTPC is being assisted by consultants and sub-consultants,
and this should minimize problems due to error at the
engineering and design stage;
(b)  plant and equipment costs are based on similar works
currently in progress in India; provision has been made for
cost escalation and there should be little risk of any
substantial cost overrun; and
(c) a number of large generating units will have been in
operation for some years before the project is commissioned,
thus providing experience and trained manpower for the
project.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Investment Program
4.01    NTPC is currently in the sixth year of an investment program wrhich
originally envisaged the construction of four large thermal power stations
with an aggregate capacity of 7,300 MW, together with almost 6,000 circuit
kilometers of associated 400 kV transmission lines, at an estimated cost
of about Rs 41,000 million (US$5,125 million). The power stations and
transmission facilities were to have been commissioned on a phased basis
during the period February 1982 through March 1988. However, because of
rescheduling and expansion of the construction program, the investmeni
program has been subject to continuous review during the past five years,
with appropriate revisions being made during appraisal of the Ramagundam
(Credit 874/Loan 1648-IN), Second Singrauli (Credit 1027-IN), Farakka
(Credit 1053/Loan 1887-IN) and Second Korba projects. The revisions iwere
necessary to reflect:
(a) increases in the expected base prices of equipment;
(b) increases in price contingency factors because of higher
expected rates of inflation for the period of construction
of the balance of NTPC's investment program;
(c) rescheduling of the commissioning dates of individual
generating plants;
(d) the addition of 1,000 MW (two 500 MW units) to the final
installed capacity of the Farakka station; and
(e) additional transmission facilities at Singrauli, Ramagundam
and Farakka.
A further minor revision was made during appraisal of the proposed
project to reflect a further increase in onlending interest rates by GOI
to NTPC (para. 4-.04).
4.02    The financial impact of these revisions is to increase the
estimated cost of the initial investment program by about 63% (Rs 25,970
million, US$3,246 million) with the additions to the generating capacity
and transmission facilities accounting for about Rs 10,700 million
(US$1,338 million) or 42% of the increase. Finance for the increased
investment program costs will come from increased internal resources
arising mainly during the three year period of the extended construction
program (from March 1988 to end March 1991), and from GOI in a combination
of long term loans and equity share capital. Financial statements showing
both past performance and future forecasts of NTPC's operations are



-35-
provided in Annexes 18 through 20. Assumptions made in preparing the
forecasts are provided in Annex 21.
Future Earnings
4.03    NTPC will commence commercial operations in February 1982 when its
first 200 MW generating unit at Singrauli is expected to be commissioned.
Additional generating capacity, scheduled for commissioning during the
succeeding nine year period, is set out in Annex 21, page 1, para 2(a).
NTPC's projected earnings are based on the assumption that NTPC will
supply bulk power at 400 kV to State Electricity Boards at a tariff level
which will enable it to earn a reasonable return on its investment.
Initially this was defined under previous Bank Group support of NTPC's
projects as being a tariff level sufficient to produce a rate of return of
not less than 9.5% on the book valuel/ of the average net fixed assets in
service in FY19892/, and applied from the date of commissioning of the
first generating unit at Singrauli in FY1982. However, mainly because of
the rescheduling of the 500 MW unit construction program, energy sales in
FY1989 are now forecast at only about 60% of maximum. Accordingly, the
extension in the rate of return qualifying year to FY1991, wghen sales
volume would approach 90% of maximum, was agreed under the Second Korba
project.
4.04    The Income Statement in Annex 18 shows the projected operating
results of NTPC from FY1982 through FY1994. The forecast earnings
performance of NTPC is satisfactory. On the basis of the FY1991 forecast
the average bulk supply price will be 31.8 paise (US cents 4.0) per kWh,
excluding fuel surcharge.   This price is used to project the annual
revenues each year from FY1982 through FY1991 and has also been maintained
thereafter. The bulk supply price compares with 31.7 paise (US cents 4.0)
per kWh calculated at the time of the Second Korba appraisal in October
1980 and 29.1 paise (US cents 3.6) per kWh calculated for the appraisal of
the Farakka Project and based on a qualifying rate of return year of
FY1989. Increases in projected operating costs, profit requirement
1/ There are no requirements within India, for commercial accounting
purposes, to note fixed asset and depreciation data at current price
levels. The equivalent in real terms of a 9.5% rate of return on a
rate base stated at historic cost in FY1991 is about 7.0% (Annex 22).
2/ The first fiscal year in which all generating units at Singrauli were
projected to operate at their maximum capacity.



-36-
(because of increases in the capital base) and interest costsl/ have been
offset only partially by the increased sales volume in FY1991 and have
resulted in the increase in the bulk supply price. Minor losses in FYs
1982 and 1983 are acceptable as part of NTPC's development program. NTPC
will become profitable in FY1984 and, following the rapid commissioning
of plant from FY1984 through FY1991, earnings will rise rapidly
thereafter, and will reach the stipulated rate of return of 9.5% in FY1991
when the investment program is fully commissioned. Following the decision
taken in 1980 to expand the Farakka station's capacity by 1,000 MW,
additional earnings will accrue from FY1990 onwards on the incremental
output. The rate of return will accordingly rise to 11.8% by end FY1994
when all generating units in each of the stations would be operating at
maximum capacity. Consequently as in previous NTPC Bank Group assisted
projects, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that NTPC will
achieve in FY1991, and maintain thereafter, a rate of return of not less
than 9.5% on the net fixed assets in operation, and will set tariffs from
the time the first generating unit at Singrauli is commissioned at levels
not lower than estimated to achieve the required 9.5% rate of return in
FY1991 (para. 6.01f).
Taxation
4.05    NTPC is liable for income tax under the Income Tax Acts.  However,
because of the large capital expenditure program between FY1979 and
FY1991, an income tax liability will not arise in the foreseeable future
and, accordingly, a tax equalization reserve is not necessary.
Internal Cash Generation FY1977-FY1994
4.06    A Statement of Sources and Applications of Funds covering NTPC's
current investment program is provided in Annex 19, page 2.   As a result
of the rescheduling of the commissioning dates, particularly the 500 MW
units of the second phase station developments and the addition of 1,000
MW at Farakka, the duration of the initial construction program has been
extended by three years through FY1991. A rapid buildup of internally
generated funds would occur from FY1990 and would be available to finance
future projects. Dividends on equity share capital are not included in
the forecasts on the assumption that surplus funds would go towards the
expansion of NTPC's activities beyond its current investment program.
Recently, GOI indicated that it has under consideration an expanded
investment program for NTPC (para. 2.04). After the first year of
1/ GOI onlending rates were increased by 0.5% to 10.75% from July 1, 1980
and by a further 1% to 11.75% from June 1, 1981.



-37-
operation debt service coverage would be not less than 1.3 times, which is
satisfactory.
NTPC's Financing Plan (FY1983-FY1990)
4.07    The financing plan for the eight year period during which the
project will be constructed is set out in table 4.1 and is satisfactory.
The financing plan covers a time-slice of NTPC's total investment program
and provides for construction of the ongoing first and second Singrauli
and Korba projects, the first and the proposed second Ramagundam projects
and the Farakka project, together with the balance of the generation and
transmission construction program discussed at paras. 3.01 and 3.02. The
investment cost of the proposed project represents about 24% of
construction expenditures in the financing plan.
4.08    The proposed Loan would be onlent to NTPC by GOI in accordance
with an acceptable onlending agreement as a condition of effectiveness of
the Loan (para. 6.02). As in previous operations, the terms of the
onlending agreement would provide for maturity in 20 years, including a
grace period of five years, and repayment of principal in equal semi-
annual installments, with interest payable on outstanding balances at
11.75% per annum. This is the rate of interest at which GOI currently
lends to industrial and commercial undertakings in the power sector and
reflects the increase of 1% from June 1, 1981 (para 4.04). The rate
compares with about 13-15% from domestic lending institutions for similar
types of lending., The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
Goverment. An assurance was also obtained during negotiations that GOI
will ensure prompt availability to NTPC of sufficient funds to complete
the project including any additional funds which might be required due to
cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors (para. 6.01g).
4.09    Bank financing of the proposed project, US$300 million, together
with Bank Group financing of NTPC's investment program to date, in
aggregate US$1,850 million, represents about 20% of the total costs
involved, excluding duties, taxes, and interest charged to construction.

Future Finances
4.10    Actual and forecast balance sheets, at March 31 annually from
FY1977 through FY1994, are provided in Annex 20 and are satisfactory. The
balance sheets reflect the build-up of the construction program, the



-39-
commencement of commercial operations in February 1982, and the financing
of NTPC's capital requirements by GOI through a combination of long-term
borrowing and equity capital, in a ratio which would normally not exceed
1:1. Project-wise, equity would be released initially followed later by
loan capital. Table 4.2 summarizes NTPC's projected financial position at
three significant points in its development:
(a) at March 31, 1982 - end of the year in which NTPC will become
revenue earning;
(b) At March 31, 1990 - end of the year following the
commissioning of the proposed project; and
(c) at March 31, 1991 - end of the year following the
commissioning of the last generating unit in the investment
program.
4.11    These forecasts indicate that by March 31, 1982, shortly after
NTPC will become revenue earning, total capitalization will be Rs 11,495
million (US$1,437 million), divided between GOI loans, including the
onlending of Bank Group finance and equity capital in a ratio of 20/80.
Eight years later - end of FY1990, after the proposed project is complete
- total capitalization will have risen to Rs 61,891 million (US$7,736
million) with a debt/equity ratio of 45/55. No new debt is forecast after
FY1990 towards the completion of the current investment program and this,
combined with a significant increase in internal cash generation, will
reduce the debt/equity ratio to 42/58 by FY1991. NTPC's authorized share
capital will be raised progressively during the period FY1982 through
FY1987 from the present 15,000 million (US$1,875 million) to a figure of
Rs 35,000 million (US$4,375 million).

Borrowing Powers
4.12    The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.1d) limits borrowing by NTPC
to an amount equal to the aggregate of the paid up share capital and "free
reserves" (i.e., those which are not set apart for a specific purpose),
except with the consent of the Corporation in general meeting. During
negotiations, an assurance was obtained that NTPC will inform          the Bank
Group beforehand of any proposal to alter or modify existing limitations
on the borrowing powers of its Board of Directors (para.6.01h).
Commercial Arrangemens for Sale of NTPC Energy
4.13    Under previous credits and loans NTPC has agreed to prepare bulk
supply contracts for the sale of energy on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank Group. NTPC intends to complete all the
necessary commercial arrangements prior to the sale of energy from each
project. In order to ensure that such arrangements are satisfactory,
prior to the first sale of energy by NTPC (from Singrauli station in



-41-
February 1982), during negotiations a draft of the bulk contract for the
sale of energy from the Singrauli station was reviewed and found
satisfactory in principle. NTPC has also agreed to sell the output of
power from the Ramagundam station to SEBs under bulk supply contracts,
satisfactory to the Bank Group, a final draft of which will be forwarded
to the Bank Group by August 1, 1983 (six months prior to the first sale of
energy) (para. 6.01i).
4.14     NTPC recognizes that the regionalization of its bulk tariff would
better reflect the nature of its individual thermal power stations as
integral parts of regional power systems, at least until a national power
grid is established. This could be achieved in a manner acceptable to the
Bank Group and compatible with NTPC's tariff covenant with the Bank Group
(para. 4.06) by applying the tariff formulation on an individual station
basis to better reflect different cost components as between regions. The
following regional tariffs would emerge:
Paise/kWh
Singrauli                Northern Region                      23
Korba                    Western Region                       30
Ramagundam               Southern Region                      41
Farakka                  Eastern Region                       34
Average                  All Regions                          32
Variations in the above regional tariffs reflect regional differences in
coal prices, investment timing and level of energy output in FY1991.

V. JUSTIFICATION
General
5.01    The proposed project, defined as the expansion by 1,500 MW of the
first 600 MW stage of the Ramagundam thermal power station and associated
transmission investment, is justified as the least-cost solution to meel:
part of projected base load demand in the Southern Region from 1987/88
onwards. The project's economic internal rate of return is about 15%.
5.02    The minimum of about 7,500 GWh (net of auxiliary use) sent out
per year from the project from 1993 onwards (first output is scheduled for
1987/88) will contribute about 9% of total energy supply to consumers in
the Region. This is a significant marginal contribution if seen against:
the precarious balance that is expected to be achieved in the Southern
Region by 1990 even if all identified projects come on stream on time.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.03    Given the existing and forecast power shortages in the Southern
Region (paras. 1.41 and 1.42), the need for additional capacity is urgent.
The necessary base load capacity addition of the required size and
reliability can be provided by thermal pit-head plant of the type proposed
under the project. Concurrent SEB investment plans provide for
complementary hydro capacity development to cover peaking requirements
(Annex 10). 470 MW of additional nuclear capacity is planned in the
Region during the 1980s. A fully integrated system of Regional investment
planning is now being created: steps have been taken by GOI in
consultation with IDA to formulate a least-cost long-term investment plzn
for the Indian power sector by March 1982, a significant improvement for
purposes of future analysis of investment decisions (para 1.52).
5.04      The only realistic alternative solution to the incremental 1,500
MW of Ramagundam is advanced implementation of smaller coal-fired stations
that are at present identified for later construction by individual SEBs.
The theoretically most attractive solution is the expansion of existing
sites. The obstacles in this approach are that the expansion potential of
many existing sites is limited, and that many expansion projects are
already allocated to be developed concurrently with the project.
5.05      The alternative, consisting of smaller stations, would encompass
an expansion of a pithead station in Tamil Nadu, and new load-center
stations in Karnataka ad Andhra Pradesh, with a combined capacity
approximately equal to that of the proposed project. The Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh sites would require transport of coal. The larger pithead
station's size would be 630 MW, while the load-center stations' capacity
would amount to about 420 MW each. An appropriate allowance for



-43-
transmission investment is included in the cost of the alternative
solution, reflecting the different needs for power evacuation in the case
of scattered individual stations (Annex 23).
5.06      All costs are expressed in economic terms, i.e. in CIF/FOB
prices where available, and adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors
to border prices where necessary. Unskilled labor has been shadow priced
at 75% of the market wage, skilled labor at full market wage. The
economic cost of coal was calculated as long-run marginal cost of
extraction (Annex 24). The cost of both the project and its alternative
are phased to provide capacity and energy in the same pattern (Annex 25).
5.07      The present value of the cost stream of the project is lower
than that of the alternative at any discount rate within a reasonable
range. The project, therefore, constitutes the least-cost solution for
satisfying the future 1,500 MW portion of base load demand in the Southern
Region gradually from 1987 onwards. Annex 29 shows the present values of
the cost streams of both options, assuming an opportunity cost of capital
of 10% as the discount rate, with a discount rate of 13% as a sensitivity
test. The cost advantage for the project in present value terms amounts
to about Rs 857 million (US$107 million) at 10%, and about Rs 685 million
(US$86 million) at 13%. Only under the most pessimistic assumption in the
sensitivity analysis (project cost increase by 10% and alternative cost
decrease by 10%), the cost advantage for the project is lost.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
5.08      A two-stage approximation approach has been adopted for the
quantification of economic benefits arising from an expansion of
generating plant that is integrated into an existing and growing system:
(i) average retail tariffs in the Region have been assumed to represent
a proxy for the minimum willingness to pay for power; and (ii) in order
to quantify any additional consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the cost
incurred by industrial consumers in maintaining and operating standby
generating sets has been assumed to represent a proxy for industrial
consumers' maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply.
5.09      The incremental amount of energy sold is adjusted to account
for system losses typical for the Region. The weighted average of 1980
tariff revenue at retail level in the Region has been estimated at Rs
0.29/kWh (US$0.04/kWh), and converted to border prices for purposes of the
comparison with economic cost. The industrial tariff revenue of about
Rs 0.31/kWh (US$0.04/kWh) is replaced by the observed average willingness
to pay for continuous power supply, amounting to about Rs. 0.43/kWh
(US$0.05/kWh) in economic terms (Annex 26).
5.10      Corresponding to the definition of economic benefits as
willingness to pay at the retail level, additional costs of transmission



-44-
and distribution investment (including operating and maintenance expenses)
have been allocated to the cost of the project in line with the general
Regional investment pattern (Annex 27). This additional cost is net of
the transmission element already included in the project cost. Benefit
and cost streams are presented in Annex 28.
5.11      The minimum economic rate of return is about 15%, falling to
about 12% if more pessimistic cost and benefit assumptions are tested
(Annex 29). The true internal rate of return is likely to be considerab:Ly
higher than the minimum quantifiable estimate, if the derived consumers'
and producers' surpluses of industrial, agricultural, and commercial
output made possible by the alleviation of shortages are taken into
account, and if indirect benefits accruing to the Indian economy are fully
considered. Furthermore, benefits accruing to non-industrial consumers
are likely to be understated by the use of the tariff as benefit proxy.
Tariffs
5.12      Using only retail tariffs as measure of the benefit, the
internal rate of return of the project is about 8%, falling to about 4%
with the most pessimistic scenario (Annex 29). These results indicate
that retail tariffs including electricity duty in the Region are
economically somewhat inadequate to ensure an acceptable financial return
on the proposed project at the retail level.
5.13      The implied financially justified regional bulk supply tariff of
about Rs 0.41/kWh (para 4.14) that NTPC would charge its consumers
receiving power from the project is compatible with the other bulk
exchange tariffs between SEBs that are expected to prevail in the Region
during the first years of project output. The average accounting cost of
generation as calculated by SEBs may be substantially lower than the NTPC
tariff, unless the trend towards a higher share of thermal generation wiLl
result in a significant increase in cost. At the time of first sales from
the project, no major difficulties should be expected in the willingness
of prospective NTPC customers to pay a price that is financially
satisfactory for NTPC, except possibly in the case of Kerala and
Karnataka, two fully hydro-based States.
5.14      The economic marginal cost of NTPC operations projected for
1987/88, the first year of sales from the project, is below the intended
bulk supply tariff at about Rs 0.38/kWh in border price terms, and about
Rs 0.44/kWh if converted back to domestic prices. The marginal cost
recovery by NTPC, therefore, will be satisfactory in economic terms if the
presently planned regional bulk supply tariff would be applied to project
output (Annex 31).

VI.   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations the following issues have been raised with
GOI and NTPC and satisfactory agreements or assurances have been obtained
with regard to:
(a) The status of preparation of the long-term development plan and
timing of the completion of its different parts (para. 1.51);
(b) Undertakings, endorsed by the State Governments, to buy
allocated power (para. 2.15);
(c) audit (para. 2.17);
(d) provision of adequate coal supplies (para. 3.05);
(e) import permission without Government review (para. 3.13);
(f) rate of return and tariffs (para. 4.04);
(g) provision of the balance of capital to complete the project,
including any additional funds which might be needed due to cost
overruns or other unforeseeable factors (para. 4.08);
(h) borrowing (para. 4.12); and
(i) commercial arrangements for sale of NTPC energy (para. 4.13).
6.02      Effectiveness of the Loan would be conditional on the conclusion
of an acceptable onlending agreement between GOI and NTPC (para. 4.08).
6.03      Subject to the foregoing, the project forms a suitable basis for
a Loan of US$300 million equivalent.

CEA Norms for Estimating Capacity and Energy Availability
1. Thermal
(i)  Effective Capacity:  In the case of existing thermal generating
units the derated capacity, if any, is considered.  In the case
of newly commissioned thermal units, no benefits are taken
during the first three months after the unit is commissioned
and subsequently 50% of the capacity during the next 9 months,
and thereafter full benefits are considered.
(ii) Retirement of old sets: Deduction on this account are made at
e percent ot the installed capacity available at the end of
the base year 1977-78 and it is increased cumulatively at 
percent per year.
(iii) Planned Maintenance: The figures for planned boiler and
capital maintenance have been obtained from computer study
conducted to optimise the maintenance schedule. A period of
4 weeks per year for boiler maintenance and an extra allowance
of further 4 weeks one in three years to account for capital
maintenance have been considered.
(iv) Forced Outages: These are calculated at 18.5% on the balance
capability obtained each month after allowing for retirement,
planned and capital maintenance from the effective capability.
(v) Partial Outages; This is calculated at 10% of the capacity
available for operation after accounting for the forced
outages.
(vi)  Auxiliaries:  This is calculated at 9%-of the capacity available
for operation after accounting for the forced outages.
(vii) Norms for energy calculations: The basis on which the energy
on an annual basis is computed for existing and new generating
units is as given below: -



- 49                        ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
For new units at 2,500 kWh/kW gross during the first year,
4,000 kWh/kW gross during the second year, 5,000 kWh/kW
gross during the third year and 5,350 kWh/kW gross during the
fourth and subsequent years. These figures account for
energy losses due to planned maintenance and all types of
outages allowances.
2. Hydro
(i) Generating Availability: The generating availability figures
are based on the designed head conditions on month-to-month
basis computed for 90% dependable year.
(ii)  Retirement:  Deductions on this account are made at  percent
of the installed capacity available at the end of the base
year 1977-78 and it is increased cumulatively at  percent per
year.
(iii) Planned maintenance: The figures are worked out such that as
far as possible the hydro generating units are maintained
during lean periods only, keeping in view the peak system
demand to be met vis-a-vis the hydro generating availability
obtainable in each month during the year.
(iv)  Capital Maintenance:  This is worked out at 3% of the effective
generating capability obtained after deducting retirement from
the gross generating availability.
Cv) Forced Outages: An allowance of 5% on the effective generating
capability is made towards forced outages.
(vi)  Auxiliaries:  On the balance capacity available for operation,
an allowance of % towards auxiliaries consumption is taken.
(-vii) Spinning Reserve: A spinning reserve of 5% on the capacity
available on bars has been taken for the hydro units.
(viii)  Energy output from hydro generating units:  The month-wise
energy figures based on 90% dependable year in respect of all
the stations are considered.

INDIA
SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Financial Performance of the State Electricity Boards
1.      The problems associated with the SEBs' financial performance have
been the subject of continuing dialogue with GOI. Under previous transmis-
sion credits/loans, the beneficiary SEBs undertook to achieve and maintain
rates of return after tax of 9.5% (on a rate base stated at actual cost), in
some cases on a graduated basis, in order to take account of individual
circumstances (see Attachment 1). In all cases the 9.5% rate was to be
achieved in FY1979. Results have been moderately succcessful, but with a
wide variation in performance between SEBs. By FY1977, seven 1/ out of the
sixteen major SEBs achieved their target rates of return, with a further two
SEBs 2/ reaching their targets in FY1978 with the help of rural electrifica-
tion subsidies from their State Governments under the conditions of
eligibility for the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 572-IN).
Uttar Pradesh SEB reached 9.5% in FY1979 mainly through receiving a subsidy
from its State Government on rural electrification losses, under eligibility
criteria of the Second Rural Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN). Eleven
SEBs reached their targets in FY1979 and preliminary results indicate that
thirteen will do so in FY1980. This represents a big improvement during FYs
1979 and 1980 and can be attributed to remedial action taken by the SEBs
coupled with the beneficial effects of direct subsidizatiqn of rural elec-
trification losses by State Governments in accordance with the conditions of
the First and Second Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and
911-IN). Of the SEBs not reaching their targets, Assam is affected by
political unrest and is in a difficult position; Bihar is under investigation
with a view to implementing a rehabilitation program; Haryana suffered
unusually high RE losses because of preferential allocation of power to
agriculture in conditions of severe drought (Haryana does not as yet benefit
from a rural electrification subsidy from its State Government). With the
exception of the SEBs of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (where rates of return
will probably fall back somewhat from 9.5% because of lumpy additions of
fixed assets to the capital base in FY1981), and the DESU, where electricity
duty is extremely high at 8-10% relative to a target of 1.5%, other SEBs are
expected to maintain their agreed 9.5% rates of return.

Tamil Nadu.
2/ Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.

2.      The main reason for the poor financial performance of some of the
SEBs is that tariffs have not kept pace with increases in operating costs,
thus not ensuring that a healthy ratio between operating income and capital
base is maintained during periods of expansion. Other major factors which
have adversely affected financial performance are: low availability of plant
due to technical problems and difficulties in coal supply, and of power
imports from neighboring State systems, and increased cost of these imports
because of a higher proportion of expensive thermal power where previously
cheaper hydro power was available. It can be justifiably argued that the
situation faced by some SEBs did not constitute "normal circumstances" and
that the achievement of agreed rates of return could not realistically be
expected. The introduction of rehabilitation programs to achieve a corporate
rate of return of 9.5% have been relatively successful. However, from a
commercial point of view, even this performance is marginal in that a rate of
return of 9.5% was not sufficient to enable some SEBs to meet their debt
service requirements to their State Governments.
3.      The financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, were
recently amended to put the operations of the SEBs on a more commercial basis
by enabling them to generate internally a reasonable contribution to their
capital investments. Under the Amendments (Section 59(1)), the State Govern-
ments are now required to specify the level of annual surplus which should be
earned by their SEBs to enable them to comply with the amended legislation.
The manner in which this will be achieved is a subject which has been under
evaluation by both the State Governments, in conjunction with their SEBs, and
by the Committee on Power whose report and recommendations are currently
being reviewed by GOI. Complex issues are involved which will require
"tailoring" by each State Government to meet the particular circumstances of
its SEB, while at the same time giving due consideration to State resources
and impact on consumers. CEA has issued guidelines to the State Governments
and the SEBs explaining these issues and pointing out the measures that need
to be taken by each of them and the options which are available.
4.      The guidelines emphasize the following:
(i) special steps to increase sales volume;
(ii) economies in both operating costs and capital expenditures;
(iii) more efficient asset utilization;

Page 3 of 3 pages
(iv) timely commissioning of new-projects;
(v) reduction in line losses;
(vi) improved financial management;
(vii) tariff revisions to reflect cost of supply;
(viii)  capital structure adjustments - SEBs may now receive funds from
the State Government in the form of share capital, and State
Government loans may now be converted into share capital;
(ix) disposal of arrears of State Government loan interest; and
(x) basis for charging depreciation of fixed assets.
5.      Because of the far-reaching consequences of the above measures, the
State Governments and their SEBs are awaiting the formulation by GOI of
sector improvement measures which will emerge from GOI's review of the report
of the Committee on Power. GOI has assured the Bank that new policy sugges-
tions will be discussed with the Bank at an early stage. The Bank's comments
on the recommendations of the Committee of Power are being formulated in the
context of the proposed Third Rural Electrification project.
6.      Rate of return forecasts for the five years through FY1985 of the
Southern Region SEBs of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are
shown in Attachment 2 of tnis Annex.

INDIA
SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of the Ramagundam Development
1.      The Ramagundam development is the third of a serbs of large thermal
power stations planned by the Government of India to feed into a 400 kV
interconnected transmission system of the Southern Power Region and supply
bulk power to the States of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu
and the Union Territory of Goa. The 2,100 MW power station is being installed
at Ramagundam in Karimnagar.
2.      The development will include six generating units with boilers,
ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment and associated 400 kV transmis-
sion facilities. The First Ramagundam Project (Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-
IN) consists of three 200 MW units and about 1,040 km of 400 kV transmission
lines. The Second Ramagundam Project will consist of three 500 MW units and
about 1,400 km of 400 km transmission lines.
3.      The 200 MW turbines are three cylinders, 3000 rpm tandem compound
double flow exhaust type reheat units operating at 150 kg/cm2 with a steam
temperature of 5350C. The generators with a rated output of 235,300 kVA have
a direct water cooled stator and a direct hydrogen cooled rator. The boilers
are natural circulation, pulverized fuel fired, dry bottom, balanced draft
type using direct firing system. Each boiler will have a maximum continuous
rating of 670 t/h with a superheater outlet pressure of 156 kg/cm2 and a
temperature of 5400C. Each 200 MW generating unit will be connected to a
240 MVA generator transformer and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
4.      The 500 MW turbines will be three cylinder reheat condensing type
having one H.P. cylinder, one double flow IP cylinder and one double flow
LP cylinder with initial steam conditions of 170 kg/cm2 (abs) and 537C/
5370C. The generators are rated at 588 MVA and will be hydrogen and water
cooled. The boilers will be controlled circulation pulverized fuel fired,
balanced draft type using direct firing system. Each boiler will have a
continuous evaporation rating of 1725 t/h with a superheater outlet pressure
of 178 kg/cm2 and temperature of 540C. Each generating unit will be con-
nected to its three single-phase transformers of 200 MVA, 20-24/420 kV having
one spare transformer for the three units of 500 MW.
5.      The salient features of the development are:
POWER STATION
Capacity - 2100 MW (3 x 200 MW + 3 x 500 MW)
Fuel - Coal from the South Godavari Coalfields of the
Singareni Collieries Company located at a

distance of about 15 km from the project. Annual
consumption of the 2100 MW power plant station, at
5,500 hours operation per year, is 6.6 million tons.
The gross calorific value of the coal averages
4300 kcal/kg. The coal has an ash content of about
30% and a moisture content of 5 to 7%.
Transport of - A captive railway system with bottom discharge wagons
Coal          which are unloaded while moving.
Cooling   - Recirculating system using cooling towers.  The cooling
System    water requirements of the power station will be of the
order of 85m3/sec, while the consumptive water require-
ments for boiler makeup, ash disposal (ash sluicing),
cooling, etc. will be about 5.6m3/sec only. The
consumptive water will be supplied from the Pochampad
irrigation reservoir on the Godavari river, 160 km
upstream of the project, through a canal system which
reaches the area of Ramagundam. In order to ensure the
continuity of water supply even in case of a canal
failure, a balancing reservoir at the power plant, which
will store the requirement of water for about three
months, is being constructed under the First Ramagundam
Thermal Power Project. Makeup water from the balancing
reservoir will be fed to the cooling water pump house
by gravity and then pumped into the system. A common
duct for the three 200 MW units and an individual duct
for each 500 MW unit have been provided to carry the
cooling water from the pump house. The hot water will
be conveyed through similar ducts to the induced draft
cooling towers.
Ash        - Fly ash from the precipitator  and bottom ash from the
Disposal   boilers will be pumped in the form of slurry to the
ash disposal area at a distance of 3 km west of the
power plant. The ash disposal area will be enclosed
with a dam which will be progressively raised, in
stages, with earth. The discharge point of ash slurry
will be shifted along the dam by modifying the pipelines.
Land - A total area of approximately 4,000 hectares (9,800 acres)
of land is required including 750 hectares (1,850 acres)
for the power plant and coal transport system, 530 hectares
(1,310 acres) for ash disposal, 180 hectares (445 acres)
for the residential colony and 1,960 hectares (4,840 acres)
for the&b1lancing reservoir.  Out of the above, about
3,600 hectares (8,900 acres) of land is already in NTPCts
possession.

(f) _&M Expenses
Power Station - 2.5% on original cost of 200 MW plant
- 2.0% on original cost of 500 MW plant
Transmission - 0.5% on original cost
(g)  Depreciation
Power Station - 3.1% of original cost
Transmission - 2.6% of original cost
NOTE: Section XVII(8) of the 6th Schedule of the Electricity
(Supply) Act 1948, provides for depreciation "from
the beginning of the year of account next following
that in which the particular asset became available
for use in the business." Under recently enacted
financial amendments to the Act, in the future,
depreciation is to be charged in accordance with
directions to be issued by GOI. GOI has issued
notifications annually which make no change as yet
in the 1948 Act provisions.
(h)  Tariffs.  NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return
of not less than 9.5% on the forecast average net fixed assets
in service by FY1991, and from the commencement of its commer-
cial operations in FY1982 to set tariffs at levels not lower
than those required to achieve a 9.5% rate of return on the
forecast data for FY1991. On this basis, and bearing in mind
the time it takes for the generating plant to reach an operating
level of 5,500 hours a year, the average price of 31.79
paise/kWh calculated on the FY1991 estimates, is assumed as the
average price for all sales from February 1982.
(i)  Fuel.  Fuel costs are based on the prices per ton shown in
paragraph 2(c) and escalated until FY1982. Thereafter a fuel
clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract, to permit
adjustment to meet any further variation in fuel costs. The
effect of any fuel price variation is shown separately in the
forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel surcharge.
(j) Rate Base
(i) Singrauli. Construction costs are based on 1980 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below except where
orders have been placed when escalation is applied from
award date onwards. The main plant equipment costs for
the three 200 MW phase are, however, based on the award
made in 1978.



- 93 -
ANNEX 21
Page 4 of 5 pages
(ii) Korba. Construction costs are based on 1980 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below.
(iii)  Ramagundam.   Construction costs are based on 1978 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below; however,
the main plant equipment value for the three 200 MW units
is based on the actual awarded value in 1980.
(iv) Farakka. Construction costs are based on 1979 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below.
(v) Escalation Schedule
Price Escalation:
a. 15% per annum for FY1980-81
b.  9% per annum for FY1981-82
b.  8% per annum for FY1982-1983
d.  7% per annum for FYs 1983/84 through 1985/86
e.  6% per annum for FYs 1986/87 through FY1990/91
The turbo-generators and boilers are, however,
subject to the following maximum price escalation from the
date of order:
Singrauli 200 MW units - 25%
Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka 200 MW units   - 20%
500 MW units for all   - 15% turbine generators
projects                   20% steam generators
Physical Escalation:
Civil works             - 10% of construction costs
Equipment               - 5% of equipment costs
(k) Capital Requirements
(i) The proposed loan and credit would be relent by the GOI
to NTPC for a period of 20 years from the date of with-
drawal of the first installment including a five year
initial grace period, and repayable in equal semi-annual
installments of principal, together with interest at the
rate of 11.75% per annum on unpaid balances.



- 94 -
ANNEX 21
Page 5 of 5 pages
(ii) Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in
the form of debt and fully paid up equity capital,
provided that the unpaid debt at the end of each year
would not exceed the sum of the issued share capital
and the "free" reserves, that is to say, those which
are not required for specific purposes. Advances would
be in the form of equity capital followed by loan
capital taken project-wise.
(iii) GOI loans (including the onlending of both the proposed
credit and also previously approved credits and loan)
are assumed to finance either defined projects or
individual generating units and transmission lines
included in NTPC's investment program. Interest on the
loans up to the date of commissioning of each unit of
plant would be charged to construction, and subsequent
interest accruals would be charged to revenue. Repay-
ment of principal is assumed in 30 semi-annual install-
ments commencing on the first anniversary following the
end of the five year grace period.
(1) Working Capital. Variations in working capital represent the
.differences between the sums of the individual items making
up current assets less current liabilities at the beginning
and at the end of the year.
(m)  Balance Sheets (Annex 20)
Current Assets
(i)  Receivables are assumed at a level equivalent to one-
twelfth of the revenue for the year;
(ii)  Inventories are assumed at 1% of gross assets at the end
of the year; and
(iii) Current liabilities are assumed at a level of one month's
fuel cost, plus 4% of the annual operating and mainten-
ance expenses.

SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Shadow Pricing of Cost and Benefits
Conversion Factors
1.        Where CIF or FOB prices of tradeable goods (or tradeable inputs
into only domestically manufactured goods) are not readily available, the
following factors are used to convert non-traded goods' domestic costs to
border prices:
Standard conversion factor:                 0.87
Capital goods conversion factor:            0.78
Shadow Wage Rate
2.        Before converting labor cost to border prices, using the
Standard Conversion Factor, the following assumptions about the economic
value of labor are made:
Skilled labor:           100% of market wage
Unskilled labor:          75% of market wage
About 60% of the total labor cost of the project in terms of 1980 constant
market prices are assumed to be attributable to skilled labor.
Economic Cost of Coal
3.        Rather than using the domestic administered price of coal, its
economic value is expressed by identifying the marginal extraction cost of
coal.  Assuming Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of coal production to be rep-
resentative of marginal extraction cost of coal, the economic cost of coaLl iS
about Rs. 145 per ton. Since coal reserves are abundant, the depletion pre-
mium beyond AIC is negligible.

AIC = 75,724/521 = Rs. 145/ton.
4.        For the alternative to the project, the cost of coal at the two
load center sites includes transport from the closest location. The
long-run marginal-cost of coal transport by rail, as calculated by NTPC,
amounts to Rs 0.08 per tonne-Km for diesel traction, and Rs 0.06 per tonne-
Km for electric traction.
Opportunity Cost of Capital
5.        A range between 10% and 13% is assumed to reflect the estimated
rate of return on public investment in the economy.
Benefits
6.        The alternative use of funds allocated to tariff payments by
consumers and to expenditure on other proxies for benefits of electricity
supply, is assumed to be expenditure on a basket of tradeable goods. Con-
sequently, the standard conversion factor is used to convert these benefit
proxies to border price equivalents.

INDIA
SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Benefits
Method
1.        The approach used is one of identifying a proxy for the minimum
benefit that reflects the willingeness of consumers to pay for incremental
power supply. The traditional method uses tariff revenue for this purpose,
bearing in mind that actual, non-quantified benefits are considerably higher,
both because of the existence of a consumers' surplus, and because of the
generally subsidized level of power tariffs. Some of this surplus is iden-
tifiable if the cost incurred by industrial consumers for the purchase and
operation of diesel standby generating sets (necessary in the case of not
fully reliable power supply) is included in the benefits. A further re-
finement would be to express   benefits in terms of industrial and agri-
cultural output gained by the project's alleviation of power outages that
interrupt production. Additional benefits such as greater work, leisure,
and educational benefits accruing to domestic consumers are quantifiable
only with difficulty.
2.        At the time of commissioning of the proposed project, the
Southern Region is still expected to face a tight power supply situation
(Annex 8). As shortages affect the larger industrial consumers more than
agricultural, domestic, and commercial ones, it is likely that the use of
industrial standby generating capacity still will be widespread. Assuming
a mix of grid supply and own generation of industry (implying a downward-
sloping demand curve for industrial energy input), the result is a decreas-
ing average valuation of the kWh unit with increasing energy use of decreas-
ing share of standby generation: a movement along the demand curve. The
average industrial willingness to pay is assumed to be the average of the
cost of own generation and the industrial tariff.
Energy Sales
3.        The amount of energy sold to final consumers is arrived at by
reducing the kWh sent out from the project (after auxiliary use) by the
average regional system losses:

State                              Consumption    System Losses

4.        The minimum proxy for benefits in the region is arrived at
as follows:

Industrial Willingness to Pay
5.        Assuming an average 1980 purchase price of a generating set of Rs
3,350/kW (including 10% installation cost), the total cost can be expressed
per kWh as follows, assuming that an industrial consumer satisfies his
demand by using own generation predominantly.
Life of set:   15 years
Average utilization
at 50% load factor:   4,400 hours/year
Purchase price:   Rs 3,350/kW
Annual charge
at 10% discount rate:   Rs 440/kW/year    or    Rs 0.10/kWh

and Rs 1.90/kg        .                              Rs 0.44/kWh
Total cost - financial:                              Rs 0.58/kWh
- economic :                            Rs 0.56/kWh
6.         The economic cost of Rs 0.56/kWh (at the assumed load factor)
represents the observed maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply.
The average industrial tariff in the region is about Rs 0.31/kWh, representing
a lower limit of value attached to power supply by industrial consumers:

The resulting average benefit proxy for industrial consumers
is Rs 0.43/kWh in economic terms. If the benefits accruing to other
consumer categories are valued at their respective weighted averages of
regional tariffs, the total minimum average valuation of the energy unit
at consumer level is Rs 0.37/kWh:

Additional Transmission and Distribution Cost
1.        The tentative Southern Region Investment Program 1980-85 (page 2
of this Annex) provides for about 60% of total regional investment expen-
diture (excluding miscellaneous projects) to be allocated to generation,
the rest to transmission, distribution and rural electrification. Non-
generation expenditure, therefore, accounts for about 66% of generation
expenditure. During the later years, however, the share of T & D invest-
ment falls to about 60%. For the investment years beyond 1984/85, there-
fore, a T & D share of 60% of generation is assumed.
2.        The cost of the project already includes a transmission element
which accounts for about 2-53% of the generating plant component in indi-
vidual years. The difference between this and the regional share is,
therefore, allocated to the project to allow a comparison with tariff
revenue and other benefits at the retail level: it is an investment
necessary to serve final consumers.
3.        The comparative shares of transmission and distribution invest-
ment are as follows:
T & D investment as % of generation investment

87/88                2                   60
4.        Operating and maintenance expenditure of the additional T & D
investment is assumed to be 2% of the cumulative value of the assets
installed. The split by cost components of the additional investment
is expressed in economic terms identical to those of the original trans-
mission component included the project.

Regional Exchange Tariffs and Cost of Generation
1.        The implied NTPC regional financial bulk tariff of more than
Rs 0.40/kWh for supply from Ramagundam to the Southern Region needs to
be seen in the general context of exchange (bulk) tariffs and costs
prevailing in the Region. Sample tariffs charged among supply authorities
for energy exchanges in 1979/80 were as follows for supply at 11 kV ancd
above (daytime demand):
Paise/kWh (incl. dui-)
Kerala sales to Karnataka                                      23
Kerala sales to Tamil Nadu                                     28
Regional emergency assistance                                  25
2.        An elaborate system of guidelines exists for power exchanges
in the Region, defining the method of calculating cost-related tariffs
for such instances as peaking assistance, short-term emergency assistance,
and wheeling. In practice, the exchange tariff levels are often arrived
at by negotiations between SEBs.
3.        The 1979/80 average exchange tariff of about Rs 0.25/kWh, if
regularly adjusted for expected general inflation, could reach about
Rs 0.47/kWh in 1987/88, when the first energy from the second stage of
Ramagundam will be supplied, and about Rs 0.60/kWh in the early 1990's,
the time of full output from the project.  The projected NTPC tariff at
Ramagundam, therefore, appears to be well within the range of expected
general Regional bulk prices during the first years of sales, but may
become a relatively low price for power in later years.
4.        The accounting cost of power supply at 11 kV has been calculated
by SEBs in the Region to amount to about Rs 0.13/kWh in 1980/81. Assuming
an accounting cost of about Rs 0.12/kWh for higher voltages, an adjustment
for future inflation would result in a cost of about Rs 0.20/kWh in 1987/88,
and about Rs 0.25/kWh in the early 1990's. The expected NTPC tariff may
appear costly to some SEBs calculating their own cost of generation,
mainly because the high share of hydro capacity in the Region makes histo-
rical-cost-based calculations appear low. This is particularly valid for
the purely hydro-based States of Kerala and Karnataka, while Andhra Pradesh
and Tamil Nadu may find their cost of generation compatible with the
NTPC bulk tariff. Regional exchange tariffs already reflect the more costly
nature of marginal power supply.

SECOND RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Marginal Cost of NTPC Operations
1.         The following assumptions are necessary to make marginal cost
analysis for NTPC a relevant exercise that can enter as input into tariff
considerations:
(a) Each station is reviewed as an independent system
selling power in bulk to the Region concerned;
(b) NTPC at each of its regional stations will ultimately
operate at its capacity limit: this implies that
any incremental demand will have to be satisfied by
further investment, and justifies the inclusion of
representative marginal capacity cost in the tariff;
(c) All sales of energy will be at the level of 400 kV;
(d) There will be no seasonal and only minor daily
variation in NTPC's load demand: all stations will
be operated as base load for the participating SEBs,
thus eliminating any peaks in NTPC operations; and
(e) For each station, the program of commissioning of
units and annual hours of operation is taken as
planned by NTPC.
2.         The method used for the computation of an approximation of long
run marginal cost is the concept of Average Incremental Cost (AIC), smoothing
out any fluctuations by averaging over the entire known investment program.
The results are expressed in terms of both (a) a uniform energy charge,
incorporating both marginal capacity and energy costs; and (b) a two-part
tariff consisting of a capacity charge and an energy charge, recovering marginal
capacity and energy costs, respectively.
3.         The basic computation is performed in terms of constant 1980 costs.
In order to arrive at marginal cost in future years when energy will be sold
to SEBs, it is assumed (in the absence of a longer-term investment plan) that
any investment necessary to satisfy incremental demand beyond NTPC capacity
at the time will have the same pattern as the investment envisaged for the
late 1970's and 1980's. For this purpose, marginal cost for future years is
arrived at by updating the 1980 marginal cost by projected inflation rates,
ranging from 9% p.a. initially to 6% p.a. in 1986/87 and beyond. All marginal
costs are expressed in constant prices of the year in question, and discounted
at 10% p.a.
