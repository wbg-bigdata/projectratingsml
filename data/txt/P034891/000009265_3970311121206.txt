MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
THE VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for US$72.5 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance the
Village Infrastructure Project for Java.
2.    Backpround. Indonesia has been successful in reducing poverty; even so, the absolute poverty
incidence is still around 15 %, comprising some 27 million people, and many more people remain just
above the poverty line. The Government has made further poverty reduction one of its main objectives
in the Five Year Plan (Repelita VI) that started in April 1994. It aims at decreasing poverty incidence
to 6%, less than 15 million persons, by the year 2000. The instruments to achieve this objective are an
outward oriented, labor-intensive economic growth strategy (expected to generate more than 2 million
new jobs per year), human resource development (especially expanded education and health programs),
and a new program targeted to poor villages (IDT, literally, villages left behind, based on facilities,
housing, the environment and population characteristics). Under the IDT program, poor villages are each
given a $10,000 equivalent grant for loans as seed capital for productive uses by the poorer households,
who have to repay their loan so that other villagers in turn can use the funds; results so far are positive.
Bureaucracies are bypassed, in line with Repelita VI's other aims of furthering decentralization of
government functions, of increased community participation and decision-making at local levels, and
increased targeting of programs by type and by region.
3.    The Bank has prepared two poverty assessments of Indonesia: 'Strategy for a Sustained Reduction
in Poverty", in 1990, and "Public Expenditures, Prices and the Poor", in 1993. The latter report has
been an input to the Government's current poverty programs, on which this proposed project also builds
on.
4.    Infrastructure needs at the subdistrict and village level have been addressed with relatively small
govermnent programs, and with self-help. Most investment programs have been directed to projects of
national or provincial importance. Central governrment transfers to local levels are important in local
economies and are needed for equity objectives, because the central government has the most tax bases
(oil, gas, import duties, etc.). Most transfer categories are based on equal amounts per capita, per
jurisdiction and per area size of the jurisdictions; in tum, many of the transfers are earmarked for specific
uses, but are small. Villagers have organized self-help efforts to tackle their priority infrastructure needs,
but as they are unable to pay for materials, the results are often of low quality and short-lived. Thus,
local infrastructure service levels remain low. A 1994 study estimated hat providing for basic
infrastructure needs in terms of access roads, drinking water and sanitation in all "poor' Indonesian
villages could cost more than US$1 billion, based on unit costs of the Ministry of Public Works.
5.    Java. Java, with a population of 107 million people of which only 36% is urban, has about 8
persons per hectare (1990), one of the highest densities in the world. More than 55% of Indonesia's
poor, or more than 15 million, live on Java; some 9 million of then live in rural villages. Some 6,000



2
rural villages have been classified as "left behind" for the IDT program. The 1994 study mentioned in
para. 4 above estimated that providing basic infrastructure (access roads, piers, drinking water and
sanitation) for some 4300 poor villages on Java could cost some US$140 million, of which US$80 million
would be required for the poorest 765 villages. This exceeds available funding, and does not even
represent all the infrastructure needs.
6.     Lessons from Previous Bank Experience.  A general lesson is that for poverty reduction
programs, involvernent of the intended beneficiaries in program design and implementation, and
contributions in kind or cash, are essential for more relevant subproject choices and sustainability. Also,
multilayered top-down processes and centralized approval requirements considerably slow processes down
and add to overhead costs; however, central criteria and guidelines are useful, as is the availability of
technical expertise and advice at the local level to improve understanding of choices and quality of
implementation. The period of starting up activities tends to be longer than planned, and programs need
some flexibility in implementation tine-unless the opportunity cost of their time is nil, people generally
need time to choose and commit to a new activity, and need some certainty about the sustainability of the
initiative. Starting small and expanding programs as demand for them increases at each location seems
a safe way to proceed.
7.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank fully endorses the Government's strategy for poverty
reduction in Indonesia. The project is consistent with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), that
was discussed by the Board March 21, 1995. Poverty reduction forms the central basis of almost two-
thirds of the Bank's lending program through efforts to improve the quality of basic social services,
infrastructure projects for roads, power transmission and distribution and water supply, agricultural
support services and research. In order to target the projects better towards the poor, and to increase
participation of the poor in the design and inplernentation of these projects, the Bank is increasingly
moving away from large, national (in coverage), and centrally-managed projects to a multiplicity of
smaller, regional and more locally-managed projects, such as this proposed one. (The Government of
Japan is supporting a somewhat similar project off-Java.)
8.    Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project aims at reducing poverty, providing village
infrastructure and employment paid in cash, and increasing decentralization. More specifically, the main
objectives are:
a) empowering villagers to decide priority uses of the grant funds available under the project for
their village, and to implement the works;
b) providing public infrastructure needed in poor villages;
c) creating jobs paid in cash for underemployed villagers to construct the public works, especially
in dry seasons--though fishing villages may differ from farming villages in terms of the best
season for works;
d) mobilizing village contributions towards the agreed public works; and
e) supporting the Goverunent's decentralization policies, including its Action Plan to reduce non-
infrastructure constraints to trade and transport in the rural areas.

9.    Project DescriRtion. The project is a pilot to test over 2-3 years the above objectives in some
1200 of the poorest villages on Java--only 6% of the Javanese villages and the bottom 20 % of the poorest
villages on Java. It seeks to improve their living standards while building public works-such as access
roads, bridges, water supply schemes, sanitation facilities, drainage, markets, piers or other small
infrastructures. The project would help finance (a) village works and employment, up to a US$55,000
equivalent grant per village, and (b) technical assistance/engineering services, to help with design and
implementation of the schemes at the village level and, at the central level, for the Project Managemient
Unit (PMU) to coordinate activities, supervise project implementation and monitor and evaluate its
impact, and if needed, to help implement the Govenmment Action Plan intended to reduce levies imposed
on transporters at the district level and to provide more information on producer prices to farmers, to
increase villager incomes.
10.   The project is innovative in the extent of its decentralizationL/grassroot approach: the villages
selected are to decide in meetings with their Village Head, the works they want and that comply with
simple economic criteria; technical assistance is to be provided directly to village groups; financing will
be provided directly to village bank accounts and be delinked from the budget late releases. The focus
is also on employment: villagers doing the work are to be paid cash in proportion to work progress and
to an agreed lumpsum amount, and works are to be organized seasonally or as convenient for labor
availability. (On the other hand, while so far the Government has had some village programs
implemented at the subdistrict and even village level, generally district or higher level agencies are fully
in charge and village laborers are often not paid ,a cash but expected to contribute "free" labor. Bank
infrastructure projects in Indonesia are also no;mally implemented via goverrnent agencies because
normally the works are of a large scale and complex.) The village grant does not cover all estimated
infrastructure needs, though unit costs via village implernentation are expected to be lower than estimates
by the Ministry of Public Works.
11.   Project Costs and Financing Flan. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$83.8 million
equivalent, of which the proposed loan would finance US$72.5 mnillion equivalent. Schedule A provides
details on project costs and financing. Retroactive financing is proposed for eligible expenditures incurred
after January 1995 for consultant services and village grants, up to a maximum US$7.2 million; the
Government did not want to delay project start until the proceeds of the loan became available. Schedule
B sets out the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key
processing events, and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13776 dated April 26, 1995 is being distributed
separately.
12.,  Project Implementation. Bappenas, in particular its Bureau of Regional District and Rural
Development, will be the overall coordinating agency of the project. A Project Management Unit (PMU)
has been established including representatives of Bappenas, the Ministries of Finance, of Public Works,
and of Home Affairs, and a Secretariat. The Secretariat will be strengthened under the project. Works
will be implemented by the villages, assisted by field engineers. The objective is to complete the project
in 2.5 years, but it may take 3.5 years-the approach is new at this scale and has to be tested. NGOs are
welcome to assist villagers directly and to bid for monitoring contracts to be awarded under the project.
13.   Project Sustainabilitv. The assistance of engineers should increase the quality of design and
construction of works, and a program for subsequent maintenance of the works is to be agreed in the
villages. Should the pilot project prove satisfactory, then the same approach could be used for more
public work programs in the future, especially maintenance of district and subdistrict roads.

14.   Environmental and Social Impact. The project has been classified in environmental category B.
The scope of village subprojects will be relatively minor. Access roads would be built with appropriate
alignments, cross and longitudinal drainage and gradients to lengthen the road life and minimize erosion
that higher standard roads may create. With an all weather access road to each village, use of some
alternative earth tracks may be reduced thus lessening erosion along the tracks. Better provision of water
in the project areas which are normally short of water in dry seasons should have a beneficial
environmental impact and may even help grow vegetative contours. Overall the environmental impact
is expected to be small and mostly positive. Given the programmatic nature of the project and the small
environmental impact expected, no environmental impact assessment will be prepared up front. The
Project Manual includes environmental guidelines and prototype designs that would minimize adverse
impacts. Progress reports would indicate any problems encountered and solutions adopted during
implementation.
15.   No families will be displaced because of the project. Traditional processes are followed in
villages when some land is needed for a public infrastructure; the concept of a small private contribution
toward the conmnon good has long been accepted. Nevertheless, compensation in kind is provided when
the impact is considered large enough to warrant it, as would be agreed within the village. Much of
village land is common property and such land is used for compensation. The project would rely on the
traditional approaches to land acquisition. Any land matter will be settled in the village consultation
process to choose the priority works to be done with the village grant. Subprojects involving
compensation for land or other asset acquisition (e.g. larger than 20% of a person's land) will not be
approved by field engineers unless adequate compensation arrangements have been agreed in the village,
and would not start until the agreed compensation has been made.
16.   Impact on Poverty. Employment and cash compensation to village laborers is an important
feature of the project. Many villagers in the selected poor villages have just subsistence livelihoods, with
a minimum of cash incomes that however are necessary to buy clothing, medicine, school materials,
transport services and other necessities. Many are living on no more than $100 equivalent per year. The
cash to be earned under the project should provide an important addition to the poorer household budgets;
works can be scheduled so as not to interfere with other income earning activities. With the cash eamed,
villagers ought to be able to improve their assets and current consumption. More of the funds would
actually reach the poor villagers compared to funds under other targeted public programs with higher
delivery costs and less self-targeting. By setting wages at a low level, poor seeking unskilled work are
expected to self select.  Labor-intensive methods are also efficient for the public budget.  The
infrastructure to be built will also provide important benefits for the poor, as mentioned in para. 20
below.
17.   Actions to be Taken. The following was confirmed at negotiations:
a) Village coverage: villages for the second year program starting in 1996 shall be selected by
September 1995 and the village list (and an eventual third year list) will be reviewed with the
Bank in December 1995;
b) Project information dissemination: villages selected for the program will be informed no later
than April 1, 1996 and if applicable, 1997 and be provided with public information about the
program;



5
c) Government staff: Bupatis would designate Pimpros T. kII in the selected kabupatens by March
31 every project year. Cumats would endorse subprojects by May 30, 1995 and March 31, 1996
(and 1997 if applicable);
d) Project Manual: a Manual comprising implementation arrangements and procurement formats
and procedures, reporting formats, project performance indicators to be used for monitoring,
guidelines for compensating negatively affected persons, environmental standards, maintenance
provisions, and subproject selection criteria, was agreed; and
e) Audits and mid-term review: financial and technical audits would be conducted no later than
October 30, commencing in 1996, and a mid-term review will be conducted about February 1996.
18.   Project Benefits and Risks. The population of the poor villages to be assisted totals some 3
million. Assets to be built under the project have high rates or return, that can be expected to average
20%. Subprojects are likely to be mostly all weather, low standard, access roads and bridges; their
economic returns would exceed 30% as small investments make accessible services, schools, jobs and
markets in the rainy season-the heavy rains render impassable many roads and rivers when crops mature
and should be sold. Provision of water-water is scarce in the dry season-is a priority in many villages
and would release time used for fetching surface water, would improve health conditions, and could help
control soil erosion and grow more crops. Other infrastructures should also have high returns, as they
would have been chosen as a prioriiy by the village, and a minimum number of beneficiaries should have
been identified.
19.   The engineering inputs foreseen under the project should help enhance productivity levels and
imrprove quality of designs and works, but there is a risk that not enough qualified field engineers may
be found for the project. However, self-help projects and small local contractors already employ often
labor-intensive methods, and cost savings would compensate risks of labor intensive works. There is also
a risk of faulty subsequent maintenance of the infrastructures; the field engineers are to help villagers
prepare maintenance programs. And, there mnay be a risk of diversion of funds, that should have been
minimized by the project transparency, by the funds being made available directly to the villages and by
the monitoring systems foreseen. During project implementation, independent monitoring, audits and
supervision should all help identify problems and take early corrective action.
20.   Recomnendation. 1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
