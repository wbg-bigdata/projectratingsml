IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2890-JO)
PREFACE
I.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Seventh Education Project in the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, for which Loan 2890 in the amount of $40.0 million was approved on
December 10, 1987 and made effective on April 20, 1988. The loan was closed on November 30, 1995,
eleven months after the original closing date of December 31, 1994. The final disbursement took place
on March 31, 1996 at which time a balance of US$5.54 million was canceled.
2.    The ICR was prepared by the Human Resources division of the Middle East and North Africa
Region (MN2HR), and was reviewed by Mr. Jacques Baudouy, Chief, MN2HR. Preparation of the ICR
began during the completion mission (December 1995). The report is based on material in the project
file, discussions with the Borrower and information collected during the ICR mission. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR with its own evaluation of the project's execution (see Annex 2)
and has also commented on the draft ICR.
Cancellation is still pending.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Introduction: The project was initiated during the Third Five-Year Plan (1986-90) when the
Government of Jordan shifted its development strategy from a capital-intensive approach to one based
more on human capital development. Education sector development was given prominence. Bank
support to the education sector had begun in 1972 and had continued with a series of loans including the
loan for this project. The broad objectives of all the projects were to help enhance access and to improve
the quality of education while increasing the supply of skilled manpower.
2.    In September 1987, the year this project was prepared, the Government was preparing a ten-year
education reform progran, which was begun in 1988. The overall educational reform strategy includes a
reshaping of basic and secondarv education policies and curricula, together with sector-wide institutional
development initiatives. The reform program continues to provide a sound long-term policv framework
for the sector. Two education sector loans, the Human Resources Development Sector Investment
Project HRDSIL-I (Loan 3106) in 1989 and HRDSIL-II (Loan 3864) in 1995, have provided support for
the reform program.
3.    Proiect Obiectives: The objectives of the Seventh Education Project were to: (a) improve the
quality, relevance and cost efficiency of education; (b) reinforce institution building; and (c) strengthen
the linkage between education/vocational training and skilled manpower demand. Thev were to be
achieved by: (a) introducing cost-effective teacher upgrading programs for basic education and secondarv
school teachers; (b) increasing the availability of instructional materials and training teachers to use them;
(c) replacing pedagogically unsuitable rented premises with 58 compulsory-level schools and achieving
savings by applNing cost-effective design norms and space standards; (d) strengthening school
maintenance svstems; (e) introducing pilot vocational programs for girls in areas of rapid employment
growth; (f) initiating office technology and computer maintenance training; (g) modifying community
college curricula and programs; (h) expanding the use of a management information system by the key
directorates of the Ministry of Education (MOE); (i) establishing an integrated system for measuring
student and teacher performance and evaluating the effects of different combinations of educational
inputs on education qualitv and cost: and (j) strengthening project implementation capacity.
4.    Implementation Experience and Results: The project was largelN successful in meeting its
objectives. It should be noted that objectives were conceptualized in terms of inputs and training and did
not include changes in student learning outcomes. Nor was monitoring and evaluation of such long term
outcomes included in the design of the project.
5.    The first objective, improving the quality, relevance and cost efficiency of education, was met by
providing new instructional materials and conducting the associated teacher training, by replacing rented
facilities with 62 modem school buildings (four more than planned), which also permitted a reduction in
double shifting, and by laying the basis for a modem school maintenance system. A school building
maintenance study was completed and led to the establish.aent of a maintenance program that is being
institutionalized under the second sector loan (HRDSIL II Ln. 3864). In addition, the cost efficiency
objective was met as the revised accommodation norms and design standards were adhered to. As a
result, average gross area per student was reduced to agreed targets. A good proportion of the $30
million equivalent savings projected at appraisal from this change was realized. Enrollments in the new
schools are now at 56,500 (86 percent of the appraisal estimate) because girls' enrollment fell short of the



- iii -
target (Part II, Table 5) for reasons that are not vet clear. The one major change in the sub-components
under this first objective was that the teacher training program was incorporated into the Comprehensive
Plan of Teacher Education program financed under the subsequent first sector loan (HRDSIL I Ln. 3106)
(Part I, para.6). This decision, made jointly by the Govemnment and the Bank during the preappraisal for
HRDSIL I, was implemented so that critical thinking and reasoning skills could be included in the
education system. The curriculum was revised and so was the teacher training program. It was therefore
felt appropriate that the initially envisaged teacher training component under this project should be
dropped from the scope of the project. The funds allocated for the component were used for additional
school construction to meet the increasing demand, and the balance was cancelled. The lesson from this
is that the Bank showed appropriate flexibility in modifying the scope of the project to adapt to new
developments without diluting a major objective.
6.    The project made a clear contribution to institution building in the education sector and thus met
its second objective. Planning and management in the Ministry of Education were upgraded through
training and provision of some equipment to the Directorates of Examinations, Planning, Projects and
School Buildings and Personnel. The European Union (EU)-financed technical assistance program
helped the MOE introduce a new set of standardized student and teacher performance evaluation systems
and conduct nine research studies on key issues. It also included training for PIU staff, for MOE staff
responsible for measuring and monitoring student achievement, and for MOE staff in the Research
Directorate (Part I, para. 14). (See Part II, Tables 7A & B). Although delayed, the work supporting
institution building was generally well executed.
7.    The project was also fairly successful in meeting the third objective - improving the
responsiveness of vocational training to labor market needs. It provided the planned support to the pilot
secondary level vocational training programs for girls and boys, and initiated office technology and
computer maintenance training. Outcomes were reviewed by the Borrower in a 1991 study, which
concluded that they were successful in helping students acquire marketable skills. The one partial failure
was the community college curricula and program study, which was completed, but most of its
recommendations, with the important exception of the introduction of a new testing and curriculum
system, were not implemented. This was mainly a matter of timing as it coincided with other studies
being done. Since then the Bank has continued a dialogue on the role of communitv colleges through the
second sector loan (HRDSIL II Ln.3864) and the Higher Education studv (Part I, paras.I 1, 25). The
lesson learned is that studies need to be carefullv timed and synchronized with other work being carried
out by the Borrower.
8.    Project sustainabilitv is highly likelv. The recurrent costs of the schools constructed are
consistent with the svstem average, the quality improvement, institutional development and vocational
training objectives remain central to the Government's education reform program, and a number of the
programs initiated under the Project (basic and secondary education; learning resource centers;
maintenance of school building facilities; and vocational training) are being continued under the two
education sector investment loans. Most importantlv, the Government has a continued political and
financial commitment to the education sector and to education sector reforn.
9.    Project Costs. Financin! and Time S. - dules: Actual expenditures were $80.98 million (25
percent less than estimated at appraisal) due to the devaluation of the Jordanian Dinar; unplanned grant
financing of equipment; use of very few local consultants; and as a result of the transfer of the project's
teacher training component to the HRDSIL I project. The Bank loan of $40 million was 84% disbursed
at project closure, and the undisbursed balance of $5.54 million was canceled. Project Financing. The
EU provided a US$2.5 million equivalent grant for technical assistance (expert services and fellowships).



- iv -
The disbursed portion of the Bank loan ($34.46 million) financed 41% of civil works. 45% of furniture
and 100% of equipment and materials. The Government financed the balance of project costs ($44.02
million). Time Schedules. Construction of schools began on time and: with the exception of a few
schools, was completed a year ahead of schedule. Fumiture and equipment procurement was completed
on time, with additional items acquired using some of the uncommitted funds. There was a three-year
delay in the start up of the technical assistance program because of delavs in finalizing the EU grant and
in contracting the technical assistance provider.
10.   Major Factors Affecting Achievement of Maior Objectives: The decision to transfer the
teacher training program to the first sector loan, which started implementation in 1989 (Part I, para. 6),
caused some delay, but the original quality and relevant objectives were still achieved. The delay in the
technical assistance program also delayed the achievement of the project's institutional development
objectives. The EU had allocated funds for technical assistance but delayed its appraisal and
commitment of funds. These delays were compounded by delays in contracting the TA provider. When
the program did begin, it was reasonablv well executed and provided the planned support to the relevant
MOE directorates. The lesson is that the processing timetable for donor cofinancing for technical
assistance and subsequent development of terms of reference and contracting arrangements should be
planned in advance of project start-up and monitored to ensure the best results (Part I, para. 18). The
availability of uncommitted loan funds permitted the construction and equipping of four additional
schools and the rehabilitation and/or extension of about 2,350 classrooms. A lesser factor was that the
August 1995 MOE reorganization dissolved the project implementation unit (PIU) and delegated the
PIU's functions to four separate general directorates within the ministrv which had little or no experience
in project implementation. As a result. the remaining procurement for the project could not be carried
out on time (Part I, para. 19). The lesson is that the abrupt dissolution of a well functioning and well
staffed PIU which is familiar with Bank implementation procedures can disrupt project implementation
and result in the non-use of, in this case, a small amount of loan funds on which the Government has paid
commitment fees and interest charges. Such changes need to be carefully implemented.
11.   Bank and Borrower Performance: Bank performance during both design and project
implementation was satisfactorv. The appraisal report and legal agreement were well documented and
flexible and provided sound guidance for the Borrower to implement the project. Project supervision was
consistent and provided pertinent information on the status of activities throughout the project's
implementation phase. With the exception of the last few months of project implementation when the
PIU was dissolved as a result of the MOE's reorganization, Borrower performance was satisfactory
during both project preparation and implementation. The Borrower submitted good qualitv audit and
progress reports on time and complied with all legal covenants.
12.   Findings, Future Operations. and Key Lessons Learned: The project met its main objectives
because it was consistent with the Govermment's education reform program, was supported by the
Government and was well designed and executed. These factors have also contributed in a major way to
ensuring project sustainabilitv. This is the key lesson from this project. It contributed to meeting the
compulsory-level enrollment needs of the country, and its initiatives for vocational education at the
secondary level were determined successful in the 1991 study that reviewed their outcomes. A good
proportion of the $30 million savings on school construction costs estimated at appraisal were realized.
The dissolution of the PIU in August, 1995 resulted in some late planned procurement not being
completed prior to the Closing Date. Future Operations: Most project activities, including support to
basic and secondary education, learning resource centers, maintenance of school facilities, an educational
management information system, and vocational training, have been continued under the first and second
sector investment loans. Key Lessons of Experience are that:



- v -
(a) the project enjoyed the strong ownership of the Government because it was consistent with
Jordan's education reform program and was well designed. This has also helped ensure project
sustainability (Part 1, paras. 3,20);
(b) by transferring the teacher training program to the first sector loan the Bank showed
appropriate flexibility in modifying the scope of the project to adapt to new developments without
diluting a major objective (Part 1, para. 6);
(c) studies, in this case the community college study, need to be carefully timed and
synchronized with other work being carried out by the Borrower (Part 1, para. I 1);
(d) the processing timetable for donor cofinancing for technical assistance and subsequent
development of terms of reference and contracting arrangements should be determined in advance and
monitored to ensure the best results (Part 1, para. 18); and
(e) the abrupt dissolution of a well functioning and well staffed project implementation unit
which is familiar with Bank implementation procedures can disrupt project implementation and result in
the non-use of, in this case, a small amount of loan funds on which the Government has paid
commitment fees and interest charges. Such changes need to be carefully implemented (Part 1, para. 19).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THE SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.    The Seventh Education Project (Ln. 2890) evaluated in this report was prepared by the Borrower
with assistance from Bank staff between December 1985 and November 1986. The project was
appraised in April 1987. Negotiations were held in October 1987 and the loan for $40 million was
approved by the Board on December 10, 1987. The loan was signed on February 10, 1988 and became
effective on April 20, 1988. The project was originally conceived and designated as a sector investment
loan, but at Bank management's request its name was modified because it was to finance a series of
discrete high-priority investments, and not a time-slice of the overall Five-Year education plan.
2.    The project continued the Bank's assistance to the Govemment's investments in education and
training. This was consistent with the country's education development effort started in the early 1970s,
when Jordan emphasized that human resources were the country's most important productive asset.
Bank support to the sector began in 1972 with the First Education Project (Cr. 285) and was followed in
1975 by a Second Education Project (Cr. 534). Bank lending continued in 1979 with the Third Education
Project (Ln. 1781) and again in 1981, 1983, and 1984 with the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Education Projects
(Loans 2068, 2246 and 2368) respectively. There was strong emphasis in the earlier projects on
vocational/technical education.
3.    These projects were successful in improving access to education and increasing the supply of
skilled manpower. The present educational system is well developed and has been generally successful
in improving the standard of living in the country. Literacy rates and participation in education in Jordan
are among the highest in middle income countries. In the mid 1980s, the primary level gross enrollment
rate was 112 percent and the adult literacy rate was 74 percent. In 1989, the first education sector loan
was approved (First Human Resources Development Sector Investment Project - HRDSIL I-Ln.3106)
followed by the second sector loan in 1995 (Second Human Resources Development Sector Investment
Project - HRDSIL II-Ln. 3864). The sector loans are supporting national programs and subprojects in
curriculum reform, textbook development, teacher and supervisory staff upgrading, educational
technology, improvement of school facilities, vocational training and education research and
development.
Objectives and Description
4.    The objectives of the Seventh Education Project were to: (a) improve the quality, relevance and
cost efficiency of education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels; (b) reinforce institution



- 2 -
building; and (c) strengthen the linkage between education/vocational training and skilled manpower
demand. The project had the following components:
(a) Improving the qualitv of education by:
(i) introducing cost-effective teacher upgrading programs for basic education and
secondary school teachers; and (ii) increasing the availability of instructional materials
and training teachers to use them.
(b) Improving the quality of phvsicalfacilities and reducing cost per student place by:
(i) replacing pedagogically unsuitable rented premises with 58 compulsory-level
schools and to achieving savings by applying cost-effective design norms and
space standards; and ii) strengthening school maintenance systems.
(c) Improving the responsiveness of vocational training to skilled manpower
needs by:
(i) introducing pilot vocational programs for girls in areas of rapid
employment growth; (ii) initiating office technology and computer
maintenance training; and (iii) modifying community college curricula and
programs.
(d) Strengthening education planning. management and the svstem for
measurement and evaluation of education quality by:
(i) expanding the use of the Management Information System (MIS) by the
key directorates of the Ministry of Education (MOE); (ii) establishing an integrated
system for measuring student and teacher performance and evaluating the effects
of different combinations of educational inputs on educational quality and costs;
and (iii) strengthening project implementation capacity.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.    The project's overall objectives were executed as indicated below:
I. lInproving the quality of education:
6.    The teacher upgrading program for basic education teachers, headmasters and supervisors was
not implemented under the project as planned. At the Government's request it was incorporated instead
into the Comprehensive Plan of Teacher Education program financed under the subsequent first sector
loan (HRDSIL I Ln.3 106) for reasons of efficiency and comprehensiveness. This decision was made
jointly by the Government and the Bank during the preappraisal for HRDSIL I. The training program:
(a) upgraded more than 5,000 teachers holding community college diplomas by providing two additional
years of university education; (b) expanded the preservice teacher education capacity of the universities
of Jordan, Yarmouk, and Mu'tah, and (c) provided short-term in-service training to introduce teachers,
principals and supervisors (around 40,000) to the objectives of the educational reform plan, new



curricula, textbooks and new pedagogical methods. The pace of implementation was satisfactory,
although somewhat slower than originally anticipated.
7.    Instructional materials were provided and teachers trained in their use. Three pilot learning
resource centers (LRCs) were established and equipped as planned at Karak, Irbid and Amman and they
provided support to teachers in the preparation and use of instructional materials. Systematizing and
expanding the production/procurement and distribution of audio-visual aids to schools was also
completed. Additional equipment was procured in 1995 with uncommitted project funds. School
libraries were installed for each of the schools constructed under the project. After the initial stock
placement, additional books were supplied with uncommitted funds. The textbook rental scheme was
dropped, as after initial experience, ministry officials considered it too difficult to carry out.
II. Improving the quality of physicalfacilities and reducing cost per study place.
8.     The school building program of 58 compulsory level schools with a total capacity of around
61,500 places was completed. All 58 schools were constructed, furnished and equipped. An additional
four schools from the first sector loan with about 4,100 places were also constructed with uncommitted
funds. The project's school building program has contributed significantly to improving the quality of
education through the replacement of rental facilities. The application of the revised accommodation
norms and design standards agreed during project preparation resulted in the reduced average gross area
per student target being met; and as construction costs were close to estimates it is likely that some of the
$30 million savings projected at appraisal were realized. It is not possible to determine the magnitude
because of the impact of the large devaluation of the Jordanian Dinar during this period. Enrollments at
project schools for the 1994/95 school year totaled 56,542 (22,351 males and 34,191 females - Part II,
Table 5), or 86 percent of estimate, and are expected to reach their target shortly. Female enrollment was
to be about 48,960, and the reason for the shortfall is not yet know.
9.     The school renovation program included the Taj Technical School for Girls, which was used as
a pilot vocational technical school, as well as the rehabilitation or addition of about 2,400 classrooms in
existing schools. A school building maintenance program was implemented as planned and further
promoted cost efficiency in the system. It included the rehabilitation of existing schools and a school
building maintenance study which was completed in October 1993 under the project's technical
assistance program financed by the European Union (EU). In completing the maintenance study, the
expert worked closely with MOE staff engineers in developing a computerized school buildings
database. Most of the study's recommendations have been incorporated into a school buildings
maintenance sub-component of the second sector loan.
III. Improving the Responsiveness of Vocational Training to Skilled Manpower Needs:
10.    Pilot vocational programs for girls in areas of rapid employment growth were carried out
under the project. Specifically, A former girls secondary general school was converted to accommodate
an increased number of female students in a vocational program to serve as a pilot for similar efforts in
other general secondary schools. Another activity to expand vocational training for girls was managed
by the MOE Directorate of Vocational Education and included training at two locations (Amman and
Irbid). It covered dressmaking, beauty care, nursing and office management/financial courses.
Technology and Computer Maintenance Training was carried out as planned. The program assisted
students at two boys and two girls schools in acquiring marketable computer skills combined with
administrative and office management techniques. The MOE carried out evaluations of these programs,
which judged them successfully introduced. There were no tracer studies done.



11.    With the assistance of EU-financed experts, a review and modification of the Community
College (CC) curricula as well as CC testing and evaluation was completed in December 1993. One of
the review studies noted that community colleges were "falling short of target in the programs which
they were pioneering. For example, an indication of the lack of relevance of CC curricula is the
seemingly high unemployment rate for graduates of Computer Science Programs -- a field where there
appears to be many employment opportunities according to the Chamber of Commerce". The review
was performed at a time when CCs have lost a significant proportion of their enrollment, as
responsibility to prepare basic school teachers shifted to universities. The recommendations of the
review had little impact in changing the way the CCs operate. The CC system is still considered to be
overly rigid, centralized, preoccupied with diplomas and constrained by its curricula. The results of the
review were taken into account in the recent Bank study on Jordan's Higher Education Development and
there are indications that change is forthcoming as a result of the continuing dialogue with the Bank,
particularly as HRDSIL II was being processed.
IV. Strengthening education planning, management and the systemfor measurement and evaluation
of education quality.
12.   Expansion of the MOE computer-based MIS to various general directorates was completed
satisfactorily by EU-financed expert services between July 1993 and March 1994 and training was
implemented in cooperation with NCHRD. For the MOE's improved MIS, twelve PCs were installed for
the General Directorates of Examinations, Personnel, Planning, Projects and School Buildings to
establish the system and the relevant staff were trained. The MIS is being further developed to link
regional directorates to the Ministry. Fellowship training in systems and program analysis and
development were provided as well as some computer equipment purchases for the MIS. A team of six
Jordanian computer engineers from the MOE formed the program's development team with the EU
expert and interfaced with the team of MOE engineers and the specialist who designed the school
building maintenance database.
13.   The project also introduced standardized scholastic and other tests to measure and monitor
student achievement. These activities strengthened the technical capacities of the General Directorate of
Examinations by laying groundwork for establishing an integrated system to measure and monitor the
quality of student achievement and teacher performance and evaluate education programs, processes and
their cost effectiveness. The program was financed under the EU-assisted technical assistance program.
The experts began their assignments in July 1993 and, with their Jordanian counterparts, carried out test
construction, training and selection, item banking, data analysis and storage, inventories of training needs
for directorate staff and training activities. About twenty Jordanian staff members benefited from short-
term training under this program.
14.    Strengthening project implementation capacity. The project helped establish mechanisms for
evaluating educational projects, programs and processes. A General Directorate of Research and
Development was established in the MOE (1989/90) and carried out several studies on higher education
(Part 11, Table 7A), some of which were submitted to the Bank in lieu of the five commissioned under the
1986-90 Plan. The Research and Development directorate was reorganized in August 1995 and became
the Directorate of Studies. Paralleling this project, an extensive program of research studies has been
carried out under the HRDSIL I project by the National Center for Human Resources Development
(NCHRD). The PIU received the planned project support through the procurement of equipment and
vehicles, as well as through the technical assistance program. Forty-one staff months of expert services



and fellowships were used to train PIU staff in areas which strengthened their expertise in project
development (e.g., construction engineering, quantit surveying, accounting and procurement).
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.   Project implementation was satisfactory, especiallv in the earlv stages, which was reflected in the
good loan disbursement performance. For example, 84% of the loan was disbursed bv its original
closing date (December 1994) and the uncommitted funds were used to continue the school building and
rehabilitation programs, as well as to purchase additional equipment and fumiture. Factors that had a
major impact on the project's implementation include the following:
16.   Project Costs  Actual expenditures for the project were less than estimated at appraisal ($108.3
million planned versus $80.98 actual). This was due primarily to the devaluation of the Jordanian Dinar;
the transfer of the teacher training component ($7.5 million) to the HRDSIL I project; contribution of
some equipment, software and materials by the EU, which was not planned; and to almost no local
consultants being used.
17.   Civil Works With the exception of one school, which was delaved for contractual reasons, all
originally planned schools were completed on time or ahead of schedule. The Govemment requested the
Bank to extend the closing date of the project bv one year so that (additional) civil works and equipment
procurement could be completed.
18.    TechnicalAssistance The technical assistance program ($2.5 million equivalent) was well
designed and implemented although its start up was three years late primarily because of the difficultv in
finding a responsive TA provider. The experts worked well with their Jordanian counterparts. A good
measure of institutional capacity was achieved through interactions of the experts with the staff of the
General Directorate for Examinations (MOE), the Higher Committee of Curriculum (MOHE).
Community College Directorate, General Directorate of Planning, Research and Development and other
specific units in the Ministries of Education and Higher Education. For example, eleven experts worked
with MOE staff on testing. measurement, and evaluation methods; audio visual aids; educational TV;
planning, development and research; computer network systems; school building maintenance; and
educational evaluation. Fellowship training in Europe was also undertaken (Part II, Table 7B). A
summarv of the program is provided in the table below.

19.    The Project Implementation Uni The PIU was well organized and staffed with people who had
been involved in the implementation of past Bank loans. Progress and audit reporting were done well.
The Directorate of Projects and School Buildings (where the PIU was located) implemented project
activities in a timely manner (civil works, technical assistance coordination, equipment and furniture
procurement). Slight delays in construction progress occurred when the responsibility for civil works
was transferred to the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. This decision was reversed when
Government realized that project implementation delays were occurring. However, in August 1995
(three months before the project's closing date) a major reorganization of the ministry completely
dispersed the functions and staff of the PIU to newly formed directorates of the ministry. As a result, the
planned additional equipment and furniture procurement utilizing some of the uncommitted loan funds
could not be completed prior to the Closing Date.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.    Project sustainability is likely. The recurrent costs of the schools constructed are consistent with
the system average. The two education sector investment loans are institutionalizing activities which
were initiated under the Seventh Education Project, such as school maintenance systems, vocational
education and learning resource centers. The Government has a strong political and financial
commitment to education sector reform to enable it to continue.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
21.    Bank performance at the design and implementation phases of the project was generally
satisfactory. The preparation and appraisal mission teams were suitably staffed, and the appraisal report
was well documented and provided sound guidance for the Borrower to implement the project. The legal
agreement was flexible enough to permit the inclusion of additional schools and activities without the
need to amend the project description. Project supervision was consistent and staff reports provided
good information on the status of activities throughout the project's implementation phase. Bank staff
and management responded without undue delay to Government requests to reallocate loan proceeds,
extend the closing date, provide a mechanism to alleviate financial hardships being experienced during
the Gulf crisis, and use uncommitted funds. The Bank could have done more to try to ensure that
acceptable recommendations of the community colleges review were implemented, and could have
followed up on the delays in EU financing and recruitment of TA (para. 18).
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.    With the exception of the last few months of the project's implementation phase when the PIU
was disbanded as a result of the MOE reorganization (para. 19), Borrower performance was satisfactory
and MOE staff collaborated closely with the Bank during project preparation. Bank supervision missions
received good cooperation from MOE counterV: lrt staff, which greatly facilitated the work of these
missions. Audit and progress reporting were well executed and reports were submitted to the Bank on
time. All legal covenants were complied with.
23.    The effort to secure grant assistance for the project's technical assistance component was
eventually successful and additional grant funds enabled the PIU to purchase more computer equipment.



- 7 -
Fellowship participants were identified and dispatched expeditiously. The PIU worked well to
implement ongoing project activities, including civil works, the coordination of the technical assistance
program; and the procurement of equipment, furniture and materials for the schools. In March 1995 the
PIU's senior executive prepared a completion report on the project (attached as Annex 2).
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.    The project's overall performance is satisfactory with most of its objectives met. Although a
major component of the project (teacher upgrading) was not achieved under the project, the decision to
incorporate it into the national teacher training program being implemented under the first sector loan
was justified and did not cause undue delay (para. 6). The project's technical assistance program
although delayed resulted in substantial capacity development at several MOE directorates (para. 18).
The community college review conducted by EU-financed experts with the MOHE, on the other hand,
did not have a major impact on the CC programs (para. 11).
H. FUTURE OPERATION
25.    The project's support for basic and secondary education, vocational training, learning resource
centers, school building maintenance, community colleges and development of the educational
management information systems are being continued under the ongoing HRDSIL I and 11 loans. The
first sector loan ($73.0 million) is fully committed and 95 percent disbursed. It is currently scheduled to
close in June 1997 and implementation has been successful. The Japan Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) provided cofinancing of $73.0 million equivalent and additional grant assistance came
from the British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) ($1.4 million equivalent) and Japan ($2.2
million equivalent). Implementation under the second sector loan ($60.0 million) began in July 1995 and
progress has been satisfactory to date.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.    The project implementation phase provided the following key lessons:
(a) the project enjoyed the strong ownership of the Government because it was consistent with
Jordan's education reform program and was well designed. This has also helped ensure project
sustainability (Part I, paras. 3 and 20);
(b) by transferring the teacher training program to the first sector loan the Bank showed
appropriate flexibility in modifying the scope of the project to adapt to new developments without
diluting a major objective (Part I, para. 6);
(c) studies, in this case the community college study, need to be carefully timed and
synchronized with other work being carried out by the Borrower (Part 1, para. I 1);
(d) the processing timetable for donor cofinancing for technical assistance and subsequent
development of terms of reference and contracting arrangements should be determined in advance and
monitored to ensure the best results (Part 1, para. 18); and



- 8 -
(e) the abrupt dissolution of a well functioning and well staffed project implementation unit
which is familiar with Bank implementation procedures can disrupt project implementation and result in
the non-use of, in this case, a small amount of loan funds on which the Government has paid
commitment fees and interest charges. Such changes need to be carefully implemented (Part 1, para. 19).

NOTES:
I.        At appraisal, the need to strengthen the information base for higher education policy and program planning was recognized.
It was decided therefore, that the Third Five-Year Plan (1986-90) would undertake studies that would:
(a)      make higher education planning more relevant to labor market needs and review existing methods of planning and
financing higher education;
(b)      review the employment status of Jordanian graduates qualified in Jordan and abroad, the relevance of their training
to their jobs, and the financial retums of investment to such training;
(c)      evaluate the effectiveness of community college programs and their relevance to community and labor-market
needs;
(d)      provide accurate data on the number, location, type of course/specialization, and source of financing of Jordanian
students studying abroad; and
(e)      identify the number of secondary education graduates likely, for each year of the plan, to gain admission to higher
education or to join the labor market in order to review the expansion plans of institutions of higher education and
their admission and cost-recovery policies.
2.       Under the EU-financed technical assistance program, a detailed review of the community college programs (c) above was
undertaken.
3.       The following studies were carried out by the MOE Research Department during the project's implementation phase, with the
guidance and coaching of an EU-financed expert:
(a)      The Educational Climate in Jordan's Secondary Schools
(b)      Priorities of Research According to Ministry Policy Makers, School Principals and
Teachers
(c)      Evaluation of the Teacher-Parent Committees
(d)      Evaluation of the Use of the Jordan Educational Journal 'Risalat Almualim'
(e)      Public Costs of Education in Jordan
(f)      Family Costs of Education in Jordan
(g)      Evaluation of the Functioning of the (extra-curricular) Activity Period
(h)      Evaluation of the functioning of Assistant Principals

Notes
I. The percentage reimbursed by the Bank for civil works was set at 41% during the appraisal process, but revised
by the Bank following a Government request in 1991 to 80%. The higher percentage was utilized for one year
(through December 1992), after which time the Government reverted to using the 41% figure so as not to deplete
loan funds prematurely.
2. Rehabilitation work has been included in the 'actual' civil works figures
3. Technical assistance under Appraisal Estimate includes teacher training and under Actual Estimate includes EU-
financed program only.
4. Price contingencies have been included in total 'actual' figures.
5. Books were included with equipment, software & materials items.

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THE SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2890-Jo!
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT MISSION
(December 5-14. 1995!
AIDE-MEMOIRE II
A. INTRODUCTION
1.             An implementation completion report mission composed of Mr. George Za'Rour (Senior General
Educator) and Ms. Patricia Maughan (Operations Officer) of the Human Resources Division, Middle East and North
Africa Region (MN2HR), visited Jordan from December 5 through 14, 1995 to collect information for the
preparation of the implementation completion report (ICR) for the Seventh Education Project (Ln.2890-JO) which
closed on November 30, 1995. The mission wishes to express its appreciation for the consistent support and
cooperation received from the Ministry of Education (MOE) general directorates supported under the project, and in
particular from the staff of the General Directorate of Projects and School Buildings (GDPSB) during supervision
missions for the project and also during the ICR mission. Appendix I to this aide-memoire lists the individuals who
were responsible for providing direct support to the project's implementation activities and development objectives
as well as to the ICR mission.
2.             A substantial part of the data collection for the mission had been accomplished during the
preceding year. The project's task manager (Ms. Patricia Maughan) began familiarizing the MOE staff concerned
with the ICR process and in this regard, the Borrower provided its report on the implementation phase of the project
during the supervision mission of April 1995 (ICR Annex 2). The completion mission reviewed: (a) the status of
remaining procurement activity; (b) project costs and financing; (c) the degree of achievement of project objectives;
(d) project outcome; and (e) the continuation of project-initiated activities (the plan for the project's future
operation). The mission also met with staff of the Jordan office of the European Union (EU), which provided about
1.8 european currency units (ECUs) in grant financing (approximately $2.5 million) in support of the project's
technical assistance objectives. An overview of the technical assistance program is provided in the ICR.
B. PROJECT STATUS
3.             At project closing, the loan was 86% disbursed. It was anticipated that before closing, the
unutilized balance of $5.5 million would be fully committed for disbursement before the end of the disbursement
period, March 31, 1996. However, two tenders (one for educational materials and another for equipment) could not
be finalized due to insufficient procurement processing time. Final procurement activities slowed down
considerably during the last six months of the project due in part to an internal ministerial reorganization which
shifted the responsibility for key project-related activities (procurement, accounting and technical assistance
reporting) which were previously carried out by the GDPSB. These functions were assigned to staff of three other
general directorates who were unfamiliar with the project and Bank procurement and reporting guidelines.
4.             Project objectives were substantially achieved. The implementation phase of the project was
successful and the project has assisted the Government of Jordan to further develop and implement its medium-term
education and training strategy. Sustainability of the project is highly likely as two sector loans (the Human
Resources Development Sector Investment Loans - Lns.3 106 and 3864-JO) are ongoing to continue and solidify the
"1     This is the final version of the aide memoire prepared by the ICR mission in Jordan.

education reform program. The first sector loan in the amount of US$73.0 million, which is fully committed and
94% disbursed, is currently scheduled to close in June 1996. The loan is cofinanced by an OECF loan (also for
US$73.0 million) and is supported by the Overseas Development Agency (ODA) for US$1.4 million, and a
Japanese Grant in the amount of $2.2 million equivalent. The second sector loan in the amount of US$60.0 million
became effective in July 1995 and implementation progress is good.
C. COMPLETION ACTIVITIES
5.            It was agreed that the draft ICR would be transmitted by the Bank to the Government for review
and comment. The Secretary General, MOE stated that this review would be coordinated by the Director of
Educational Development, Dr. Mohammed Atiyyah. As the program of technical assistance supported by the EU is
expected to be completed around February 1996, the mission was unable to obtain an evaluation report of the
program. EU officials confirmed that they would prepare this report and the mission has requested Dr. Atiyyah to
obtain and transmit it to the Bank as soon as it is available.
6.             With regard to the project's operational phase, five program areas which were initiated or
developed under the project are being continued under the First and Second Education Sector loans (Lns.3 106 and
3864-JO). They are: Learning Resources Centers; Vocational Training; Community Colleges; Teacher Training;
and an Educational Management Information System. Their future development will be discussed in detail in the
ICR.

ANNEX 2
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
THE SEVENTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2890-JO)
BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION
I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.     There were no real critical variances between planned and actual project implementation except for one
school out of the fifty-eight schools whose delay was due to some natural landslides at the school site. Thus, the
project has been extended for eleven months, from December 1994 to November 1995, to enable the Ministry of
Education (MOE) to complete the school and ongoing technical assistance. The delay in completing the school
couldn't have been avoided because of the shortage of land in the center of a densely populated city like Kerak.
2.     Delays in construction were caused by the consequences of the Gulf crisis and the split of responsibility for
school construction between MOE and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, which did not last long since the
responsibility of construction was given back to MOE after the intervention of the Bank.
II.    PROJECT RESULTS
3.     The overall objectives of the Seventh Education Project were satisfactorily achieved. The capacity of the
education system was greatly increased by the project. The education quality and the schooling conditions were
also improved by replacing rented facilities and reducing the double shifting. The fifty-eight schools provided
opportunities to students in the basic cycle to learn in modern and suitably lit and ventilated classrooms in the most
densely populated areas and improved access to education in small towns, villages and rural areas as well.
4.     The gross area per student place is slightly lower than proposed at the appraisal for the basic cycle, but
construction costs were almost identical to estimates at the appraisal. Meanwhile, the furniture and equipment costs
were slightly more than half of the appraisal estimates, a matter that reflect surplus funds estimated at US$ 5.6
million. All the furniture and equipment have been purchased and found to be satisfactory and adequate.
III.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
5.     Since basic schools constitute the backbone of the education system, the provision of adequate school
facilities at this cycle is very important for good quality instruction. The Seventh Education Project schools will all
soon reach their target enrollments, and the expenditures for their operation match with the education system norms.
When the schools of the project reach their full capacity, the instruction will be improved at a reasonable
percentage. As the schools of the project will evacuate rented facilities and get rid of double shifting, this will add
its contribution to decrease expenditures in MOE recurrent budget as a result of saving rentals.
6.     The fact that this project is fully integrated into the educational system will help assure its sustainability.
Investment in education remains the Government's top priority, and financing will be forthcoming. The school
maintenance problem needs to be given further attention.

IV.     BANK PERFORMANCE
7.     In the conceptualization and implementation of the Seventh Education Project, Bank performance was very
much satisfactory. Both the content and the objectives of the project were appropriate and contributed substantially
to improving the Government's education strategy.  The Bank responded promptly to a request from  the
Government to accept financing from the European Union (EU) for technical assistance. In order to further
contribute to the educational objectives of the project, the Bank agreed to extend the project's closing date for one
year to finalize one uncompleted school and ongoing technical assistance. This extension enabled MOE to complete
the components of the project and use some uncommitted funds. During the several missions, the members of the
Bank staff in those missions supervised the steps of the implementation of the project very satisfactorily, and were
all cooperative with the MOE's staff in the best way. They were all specialized and capable to carry out their tasks.
V.   BORROWER PERFORMANCE
8.     MOE promptly acted in expediting actions necessary for project processing, and the original physical
components of the project were completed almost on schedule. The technical assistance component is being
implemented in a satisfactory way and in full cooperation with both the financing agency (EU) and the
implementing agency.
VI.    PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
9.     Supervision was regular throughout project implementation as shown in the project files. An excellent
working relationship was developed by the Bank through its supervision missions. The Government authorities were
involved in project implementation and showed responsibility for school construction, furnishing and equipping.
The Bank worked in close cooperation and collaboration with MOE officials which was the factor that contributed
substantially to better understanding on both sides of problems encountered and the appropriate solutions.
VII.   CONSULTING SERVICES
10.    The project, as shown in its appraisal proposal, included a technical assistance package to be financed by
the EU at an estimated ECU 1.8 million. The package comprised: 255 manmonths of fellowships and 99
manmonths of consultancies. It is Government policy to explore possibilities for ensuring such assistance via grants
from financing agencies soon after loan effectiveness. Implementation of technical assistance started in late 1993
and is scheduled to be completed by the closing date of the project. The implementation of the technical assistance
program is satisfactory.
VIII. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
11.    Records related to the project at the Bank headquarters, including working papers of missions for
preparation, supervision and monitoring are well documented. Progress reports and financial records were provided
by MOE regularly. The staff appraisal proposal was comprehensive and enabled the Government to implement the
project without much difficulties.
