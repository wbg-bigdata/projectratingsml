REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REGIE NATIONALE DES CHEMINS DE FER DU CAMEROUN
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR THE DOUALA RAILWAY STATION AND
MARSHALLING YARD ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Rggie Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun (REGIFERCAM) with the
guarantee of tihe United Republic of Cameroon, for the equivalent of US$ 2.3
million to help finance feasibility and engineering studies for the Douala Railway
Station and Marshalling Yard and provide other consulting services to REGIFERCAM.
The loan would have a term of ten years, including two years of grace with interest
at 8-1/2 percent per annum.  The loan would be refinanced under any later loan or
credit that the Bank Group might make for the Douala Railway Station and Marshalling
Yard Project itself.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The report, "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon" (No.72-247),
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27, 1972.  A special
economic mission visited the country in February and November 1975, and its
conclusions are reflected in the following analysis.
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon has a population of about 6.5 million (mid-1975) and covers
an area of 475,000 km2, about the size of France.  Cameroon's natural resources
are varied, but not always easily accessible. Soils and climatic conditions
permit cultivation of a wider range of crops than is commonly found in West
Africa. The forest areas of the southeast contain large untapped timber
resources, and the north holds promising potential for livestock development.
4.        While the main opportunities for development lie in the expansion
of agricultural production, Cameroon also has potential for expanding pro-
duction of import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, and the
processing for export of alumina and agricultural and forestry products. A
bauxite project is in the early stages of preparation, while offshore oil and
gas exploration has so far yielded only modest results.
5.        Commerce, transportation and transit services are important economic
activities: Cameroon is a relatively large country with its main economic
centers separated by vast underpopulated areas, and the country serves as a
main export route for landlocked Chad. As a result, large investments in port
and inland trc:..nsport infrastructure are prerequisites to promoting agriculture,
forestry and industry, and strengthening Cameroon's role as a regional trade
center.

Third Education ?rcject, dated April 7, 1976.

Past Performance
6.        During the first decade of independence (1960-1970), the Govern-
ment's primary objective was to unify the nation and to ease serious internal
political and social tensions. GDP at constant prices grew a-t a satisfactory
rate ofL nearly 7 percent a year. Cash crop production rose steadily due to
good export prices and favorable weather ionditions, and manufacturing pro-
duction increased as a result of the liberal investment climate that attracted
substantial foreigri private capital.
7.        During the 1960s gross total investment averaged about US$ 200 million
annually (in constant 1974 dollars), i.e. 14 percent of GDP. Public invest-
ment accounted for about 57 percent of total investment with the largest part
devoted to the transportation network, the most inmediate development
constrailnt, while substantial effort was also directed at expanding education
and diversifying agriculture. Significant increases in fiscal revenues, com-
bined with stringent expenditure controls, produced sizeable budget surpluses
that made it possible to finance a large part (up to 40 percent) of public
investments out of local revenues as well as to accumulate reserves. How-
ever, this policy also imposed excessive restraint on much needed current
expenditure in such areas as road maintcenance, public health, and education.
8.        In the early 1970s, economic growth slowed dovm to less than 3 per-
cent per annum or little more than population growth. This was mainly caused
by (i) low export prices for cocoa and coffee during 1971-72 and a drought
in the north, and (ii) a decline in private investment induced by the relative
stagnation of the agricultural sector- and by the completion of the most obvious
import substitution projects during the preceding decade.
9.        The Government reacted to these developments by stepping up public
investment, whose volume increased by 50 percent to reach annual averages
of about us$ 180 million in constant 1974 dollars during the Third Develop-
ment Plan (FY72-76), and resulted in a substantial drawdown of Treasury
reserves and a major increase in foreign borrowing. Fortunately, the avail-
ability of well-prepared, high priority projects enabled Cameroon to obtain
most of the increased inflow of foreign capital from public aid donors on
concessiona,ry terms. For this reason, as well as the country's low foreign
debt before the 1970s, Cameroon's external debt service has remained modest
(about 4 percent of export earnings in 1974).
10.       During the 1970-1974 period, low economic growth had significantly
reduced import demand, while exports maintained a remarkable growth and pro-
fited from higher prices in 1974. Therefore. the balance of payments was not
under excessive pressure and the large inflow of foreign capital remained
sufficient to cover the current account deficit. However, the situation
worsened in 1974/75; the combined effect of a 50 percent increase in import
prices with a 45 percent decline in timber exports (mainly due to depressed
construction activity in Europe), resulted in a high trade deficit and a sharp
decline in foreign exchange reserves during the first half of 1975, announcing
an era of more severe balance of payments problems.



-3-
Prospects and Development Strategy
11.       As a result of the current and proiected deterioration of
Cameroon's terms of trade, exports will play a l.ess dynamic role in econo-
mic expansion, while domestic demand is still too small to take up the
slack. Therefore, overall growth in the next decade might run well below
the rates achieved during the 1960s, in spite of Government efforts to
maintain a high volume of public investment and to develop the country's
considerable opportunity for diversification, particularly within the
rural sector.
12.       Steady economic growth will depend largely on the extent to which
the Government comes to grips with several structural problems: (i) rural
production (except forestry) suffers from a lack of financial and technical
assistance particularly for small farmers, who produce nearly 90 percent of
the country's agricultural output; (ii) despite heavy investment in recent
years, the basic transport infrastructure is still insufficient; the Douala
port and the Douala-Yaound6 corridor (the main transport route) require
increases in capacity and the road system in general needs better main-
tenance as well as adaptation to traffic growth especially for the develop-
merLt of new agricultural and forestry zones; (iii) the education system
still is not responding adequately to the country's changing needs; and
(iv) serious c;:onomic imbalances persist among regions, between the towns
and countryside, and between modern and traditional sectors.
13.       To meet these challenges, the Government must strength;..!n its
ability to choose, prepare, and implement projects, particularly in the
rural sector. Progress is being made in this direction. Special planning
units are gradually being established within the technical ministries. A
para-public consulting firm - SEDA - was created under the Planning Ministry
to accelerate project preparation. Commercially oriented public c.-ora-
tions are also serving to strengthen the project implementation capacity
of the public sector.  Nevertheless, further improvements are needed, par-
ticularly in the management of public finance, and in strengthening and
coordinating rural development institutions.
14.       Completing the overall transport infrastructure program already
underway will absorb a high proportion of future public investment. If the
Government succeeds in its present efforts to accelerate preparation and
implementation of projects in the other sectors, particularly for rural
development, future total public investment is likely to exceed US$270 mil-
lion annually (in constant 1974 dollars) during the Fourth Development Plan
(FY77-81). Budgetary revenues already reach 20 percent of GDP, and cannot
be expected to increase much faster than the economy as a whole, while
surpluses of the stabilization funds are likely to stagnate or even decline
considering the depressed price outlook for most export crops. Current
expenditures, on the contrary, will expand as a result of recent increases in
public investments in transport, education, and health, as will pu-blic debt



service charges. Furthermore, savings of public enterprises are expected to
decline since debt service will absorb a higher share of their operating
surpluses. As a consequence, in the next five years, public savings after
debt service will probably not exceed 25-30 percent of public investment, as
compared with about 40 percent over the past few years. Hence Cameroon will
have to rely on external financing for the bulk of its public investment, and
on average, foreign lenders should be prepared to finance more than two-thirds
of total project costs. Particularly for rural development projects this
would imply some local cost financing.
15.       Increasing reliance on foreign borrowing will require careful for-
eign debt management during a period of relatively slow economic growth and
poorer terms of trade. If, however, borrowing on conventional terms does not
exceed 50 percent of foreign public capital inflow, the foreign debt service
ratio could be maintained around 10 percent by the early eighties. Cameroon's
ability to make effective use of external resources and the Government's
dedication to development are reasons for increased external support. To
avoid further rapid buildup of debt service, lenders, including the Bank
Group, should provide a substantial part of their assistance on concessionary
terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
16.       The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to -US$200.7
million and cover fifteen projects: six in agriculture, five in transporta-
tion, two in edu(.:ation, one in public utilities and one small- and medium-
scale enterprise project. Transportation represents the largest share (53
percent) o'f our past commitments followed by agriculture (33 percent).
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
February 29, 1976, and includes notes on ongoing projects. Although delays
and setbacks have been occasionally enicountered in the execution of projects,
the Government has consistently shown willingness to collaborate with the
Bank in seeking and applying satisfactory solutions.
17.       For the future, the Bank Group's strategy is to support the Gov-
ernment in its efforts to create productive employment in rural and urban
areas, to upgrade and improve operation and maintenance of the country's
infrastructure, to stimulate investment by local entrepreneurs, and to
increase the efficiency of Cameroon' s institutions,
18.       In agriculture, we have been able to hrlp the Government further
diversify production by financing its oil palm and rubber plantations in
the east and west, and rice irrigation and livestock in the north. The
cocoa project approved in September 197.4 will modernize cocoa growing by
smallholders and raise rural productivity in an area south and west of the
capital. The rubber project approved in June 1975 would develop the south-
west coastal region. Identification work for rural development projects in



-5-
populated but poor regions, mainly the north and the western highlands, is
underway. Besides promoting much needed foodstuff production, increased
Bank Group lending to agriculture will support the Government's effort to
organize itself and focus on rural development in order to correct geograph-
ical and economic imbalances in Cameroon's development.
19.       Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investment to this sector. The Bank Group
together with bilateral institutions has substantially helped develop ade-
quate transport facilities. The Second Highway Project of 1973, despite
some difficulties caused by cost overruns, partially alleviated by a re-
cently approved supplementary credit, will help complete the basic trunk
road system but at the same time provided for technical assistance to
improve and strengthen planning capability for the roads sub-sector and
a study directed towards establishing an effective maintenance progran.
The Second Railway Project of 1974 has focused on track improvement and
expansion of the equipment needed to maintain and augment the rallway's
overall carrying capacity. Implementation of this project has suffered
from cost overruns due to currency realignments, and it is,proposed to
transfer the consulting services included in the project to the proposed
engineering loan (see para. 47). Given projected sharp traffic increases
and the backlog of required investments, massive injections of capital are
still necessary particularly for the proposed expansion of the port of
Douala, and some related facilities such as the railway station and mar-
shalling yard. The project presented in this report will help complete
the engineering of the railway station and marshalling yard to be built
outside the port area. Improvement of the Douala-Yaounde transport cor-
ridor may also require substantial investment. A study, financed by the
Bank and scheduled to be completed in FY77, will help determine an econom-
ically optimal investment strategy for this corridor. Future investments
in the transport sector will be concentrated on road maintenance and on
feeder roads to provide links to local markets and facilitate exploitation
of Cameroon's forests.  In other sectors, the small- and medium-scale enter-
prise projeCt approved in 1975 will focus mainly on developing local entre-
preneurship. A third education project which has just been submitted to the
Executive Directors for approval, places special emphasis on rural education
and training.
20.       In all our projects, we will as in the past include training, tech-
nical assistance, and other provisions necessary for strengthening institu-
tions and improving sector policies. In addition, through our economic work
we will continue to advise the authorities, at their request, on development
questions in general, and on particular matters such as economic management,
problems of urban migration and manpower development.



-6-
21.       Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in ten of our fifteen projects, joint or parallel cc-financing arrange-
ments have been made.
22.       Over the second half of the last decade disbursements of foreign aid
amounted to about US$40-45 million a year. While at t7le beginning of this period 65
percent of aid funds were grants, the proportion of loans has been slowly in-
creasing. A major part of external assistance was provided by France and concentra-
ted in infrastructure and productive sectors.  The aid giving agencies of the EEC
(European Development Fund and European Investment Bank) directed their lending
mainly to agriculture, with infrastructure in second place. Bank Group disburse-
ments were small during this period. From 1972 to 1974 disbursements of foreign
aid increased to about US$60 million with one-third as grants. The Bank Group's
share of these inflows amounted to about 25 percent. Public debt outstanding and
disbursed as of December 31, 1974 amounted to US$280 million and is projected to
reach US$1,300 million in 1980. Public debt service as a proportion of export
earnings amounted to about 4.0 percent in 1974 and is projected to reach 10
percent in 1981. At that time disbursements may be over US$250 million with
only 15 percent in grants. At present Bank debt outstanding and disbursed
amounts to nearly 11 percent of all public debt and 10 percent of public debt
service. IDA credits outstanding and disbursed amount to nearly 13 percent
of public debt outstanding and 0.9 percent of public debt service. Bank Group
lending is expected to account for nearly 12.5 percent of public debt service
in 1980.
23.       In October 1974, Cameroon became IFC's 100th member and, in a first
operation approved on May 22, 1975, the Corporation will invest in the equity
of Bata - a foreign owned shoe complex - and assist in the sale of its shares
to local private investors.
PART III - TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
24.       The basi.c transport network in Cameroon has been considerably ex-
panded and improved in the last ten years; however there are still serious
inadequacies in the system. Furthermore with growth of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) projected at 5 to 6 percent during the next decade, pressures on the
transport system will increase, especially in areas where development potential
is still untapped. In recent years, the lack of basis transport infrastructure
over long distances through difficult terrain has caused the transport sectcr
(including communications) to absorb some 40 percent of total public investmeim.
The critical issue now and for the future is to provide and properly maintain
an adequate transport system for Cameroon without absorbing a disproportionate
share of the country's limited resources.
25.       Douala is the focal point of Cameroon's transport system. The port
handles nearly 90 percent of Cameroon's external trade and a substantial share
of Chad's. It is the starting point for the two main axes of road/rail trarns-
port to West Cameroon and to Yaound4 and the north respectively.



-7-
26.       The port of Douala has three main forms of traffic: bulk (alumina,
clinker, petroleum), timber and general eargo, including agricultural exports.
The general cargo and timber berths are currently overutilized. With increases
in both import and export traffic forecast, congestion would rapidly occur. The
proposed Second Douala Port Project, now under appraisal, would improve the
operation of the port and provide the capacity necessary for timber and general
cargo until at leat 1985.
27.       The railway system comprises two lines.  The line serving West
Cameroon is of minor economic importance. The Transcameroon system, com-
prises the old central line from Douala to Yaound"e (300 km), which carries
the bulk of ehe railway's traffic, and the recently completed extension to
Ngaoundere (600 km), which at present carries little traffic except timber
from Belabo (300 km from Yaounde). The marshalling yard at Douala is oper-
ating at capacity in a poor location and investment in new facilities is
necessary to handle future traffic growth and improve railway operating
efficiency.
28.       In the north, an extensive road system continues the Transcameroon
route towards Chad, and also has adequate capacity to meet local requirements
for mary years. The road system between Douala and West Cameroon competes with
the old railway line and serves local markets. Betwee-n Douala and Yaounde it
largely complements the railway, with roads feeding into the railway system.
A study financed by the Bank and scheduled to be completed in 1977 uill help
determine an economically optimal investment program for the Douala-Yaounde
corridor.
Transport Planning and Coordination
29.       The Ministry of Transport is formally responsible for transport
planning, but the Ministry of Economy and Planning has considerable influence
on sector investment priorities. The Ministry of Equipment, responsible for
roads, acts largely as an executing agency. None of the Ministries has ade-
quate staff for transport administration or economic analysis; an overall
long-term development strategy and system of project preparation and eval-
uation has not yet evolved. As a result, non-economic considerations may
tend to have had a disproportionate influence on investment decisions, al-
though a significanL misallocation of resources has no_ occurred.   HoW-
ever, current transport problems, such as the choice between road and rail
investment in the Douala-Yaounde corridor, road upgrading versus expansion,
and the inter-relationship between transport investment and regional devel-
opment, indicate the need to strengthen the policy-making and coordination
machinery within the sector and to implement studies and preinvestment work
expeditiously in a number of areas.
30.       Past attempts to reinforce the organization and machinery of plan-
ning have rnot been very successful, but there are now indications of growing
Government awareness of departmental weaknesses. A UNDP-financed expert has
recently been appointed to advise the Ministry of Transport. Steps are also
being taken to recruit the experts in transport planning and coordination
provided under the Second Highway Project (Loan 935/Credit 429-CM). Besides
playing a major role in reinforcing the staff of the ministries concerned,
these experts will assure on-the-job training for Cameroonian counterparts.
Discussions of measures needed to strengthen further transport sector manage-
ment have been initiated and will continue during the forthcoming negotiations
for the proposed Second Douala Port Project.



8-
Government Objectives and Achievements
31i       During thte Third Plan (1972-76), public investments in the trans-
port sector (including communications) are estimated at over CFAF 80 billion
in current terms (out of total public sector expenditure of about CFAF 200
billion). The primary objectives were substantially to improve the transport
links between Yaounde and the north, and to take the initial steps to improve
east/west communications in the country. The Government has been largely
successful in these efforts.
32.       One-third of the draft Fourth Plan (1977-81) road program is de-
voted to completion of ongoing projects; however proposals for new projects
show somke increase in outlays for the development of secondary and feeder roads.
The Government recognizes that expenditure on secondary and feeder roads, par-
ticularly in the forestry areas, will need to be stepped up, as much of the
planned investment in the sector as a whole is dependent on additional tim-
ber traffic. The highway maintenance study provided for under the Second
Highway Project is expected to indicate the level of additional resources
required and the other measures needed to establish an effective program.
33.       The Government has made slow progress in establishing the appro-
priate strategy, policy, and institutions for utilization of forestry
resources, an essential pre-condition for developing a suitable road program
in the newer and less-developed forestry areas. However, the Government
is taking steps to recruit the forestry experts provided under the Second
Highway Project (Loan 935/Credit 429-CM).
Longer-Term Prospects
34.       The Government's Fourth Plan objectives include balanced re-
gional development, a fuller utilization of resources and the transport
needs associated with these. However, the objectives have not yet been
translated into specific projects. The tendency is to concentrate trans-
port investment on the Douala-Yaounde corridor. While this is currently
appropriate, the long-term transport requirements of the region to the south
of the corridor, may require that some consideration be given to the possi-
bility that development of port facilities in the Kribi area in the mid-
1980's could relieve pressure on Douala. Accordingly, towards the end of
the 1970's, when the studies now underway or planned for the Douala-Yaounde
corridor, for forestry road development and for the Kribi Master Plan are
expected to be comple-ted, steps should be taken to produce a systematic
long-term program for transport investment in the southern part of Cameroon
as a whole. Government planning and studies will also have to take account
of further improvement in links with neighboring countries (in particular
CAR), measures required to improve utilization of the existing infrastruc-
ture and management in the sector.



-9-
PART IV --THE RAILWAY
Organization, Management and Operations
35.       REGIFERCAM is a public sector corporation functioning under Govern-
ment guidelines as stipulated in a 1974 Presidential Decree. The Board of
Directors consists of twelve members, mostly Government representatives, in-
cluding the Corporation's General Manager as Chairman. The Board has the
dual function of implementing the Government's policy guidelines and super-
vising the railway's management which is headed by the General Manager and
two Deputy General Managers, all appointed by Presidential Decree. Past
experience indicates, however, that REGIFERCAM operates with a reasonable
degree of independence in its day-to-day operations.
36.       Over the last five or six years, REGIFERCAM has faced difficult
operating conditions stemming from a shortage of rolling stock and motive
power and from poor track conditions on the Douala-Yaounde portion of the
existing line. The Bank's First and Second Railway Projects focused on
alleviating these difficulties by meeting urgent track and equipment needs.
As a result, the quality of service, which had been deteriorating, has
begun to improve and although the operational targets established during
negotiations of the Second Railway Project have not been achieved, recent
operating statistics show a positive trend (see Annex IV). Further improve-
ment, however, will be largely a function of better organization and manage-
ment.
37.       Some internal restructuring of REGIFERCAM has recently been under-
taken to strengthen the position of the General Manager (by coupling this
position with that of Chairman of the Board) and to clarify lines of depart-
mental responsibility. The Railway has also succeeded in Africanizing its
top management by appointing qualified Cameroonians to high-level positions.
While these actions are fundamentally sound and commendable, there remain
critical areas of organizational and personnel weakness. The Second Railway
Project provided for consulting services to review management shortcomings
and to assist in implementing necessary changes and improvements. These
services are expected to start in May 1976. As the funds Drovided under the
Second Project are no longer sufficient to meet disbursement requirements, it
is proposed to transfer the financing of these consulting services to the
proposed Loan (paras. 47 and 50).
Finances
38.       During the period 1965-68 the railway's financial situation was
satisfactory, with rates of return on net fixed assets in use ranging from
5 percent to 7.3 percent. Subsequently, however, the financial position
deteriorated (see Annex V). Operating costs (including depreciation) rose
sharply due to the expansion of service over the Transcameroon link and
inflationary pressures. Traffic growth slowed and capacity constraints ap-
peared. More recently traffic, particularly timber, was adversely affected



- 10 -
by the world-wide recession and its impact on the important European timber
market. Tariff increases were not adequate to compensate for rising iosts.
As a result of the financial deterioration and the sharp increase in FEGTFER-
CAM's fixed assets following completion of the Transcameroon line, the rate of
return fell to zero in 1973 and to minus 1.5 in 1975. The railway's cash
shortage is presently being eased by Government subsidies.
39.         These negative factors are now beginning to abate.  Traffic volumes
for both passengers and freight except for timber, have recently been high.
and overall growth prospects are satisfactory (see Annex VIII page 4). Detailed
studies indicate that the longer-term demand forecasts for Cameroonian timber
are good and there are indications of a recovery in log sales. Meanwhile, the
railway's capacity constraints have been alleviated and the quality of service,
although still not satisfactory, has improved (para. 36). The management consult-
ing services (para. 37) are expected to lead to additional improvements in ser-
vices, and together with anticipated traffic growth are expected to increase
productivity.
4o.         It is clear however that REGIFERCAM cannot regain a sound financial
position until it implements a policy of periodic and substantial tariff increases
designed to recover lost ground and to cope with future inflation. Therefore,
during negotiations for the Second Railway Project, agreement was reached with the
Government and REGIFERCAM on measures for improving the railway's financial si-
tuation, as well as on financial targets to be achieved (Loan 1038-CM Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.02; Loan Agreement, Section 5.10). However, implementation
of these measures has lagged. In particular, tariff rates were not increased to
the level necessary for achieving the agreed financial targets. REGIFERCAM's
current financial situation and prospects were discussed during negotiations for
the proposed loan. The Second Railway Project's financial targets were retained
(Section 4.01 of the draft Loan Agreement) and the Government and REGIFERCAM
undertook to take the necessary measures including tariff increases, to achieve
the target set for 1978/79.  The first tariff increase of 12.4 percent will be
implemented, effective June 1, 1976. Decision to this effect has already been
taken by Cameroonian authorities. REGIFERCAM's budget that will be presented
to its Board of Directcrson April 20, 1976 reflects these tariff increases.
41.         Two subsequent tariff increases will be implemented on July 1,
1977 and 1978 respectively. To determine the extent of these tariff in-
creases, presently expected to be of the same order as the June 1976 in-
crease, specified working ratio targets have been agreed upon for the two
fiscal years beginning at the above dates. (Supplemental letter on sections
4.01 and 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreeemnt.) Achievement of these working
ratios would reestablish an acceptable financial position for REGIFERCAM by
1978/79. The implementation of this policy will be ensured through an annual
review by the Government, REGIFERCAM and the Bank of the kailway's financial
position and prospects and the ensuing determination of the measures needed
to achieve agreed targets, including t;he exact level of tariff increases
(Section 3.02 of the draft Guaretatee Agreement and Section 4.02 of the draft



Loan Agreement). Furthermore, one of the objectives of the management cor-
sulting services is to provide a thorough analysis of traffic demand and the
requisite tariff structure. The findings of the consultants will be valuable
inputs into the development of a comprehensive tariff policy and the Second
Railway Project provides for timely consultation between REGIFERCAM and the
Bank on the implementation of the findings, beginning in 1977.
42.       The Railway's cash position, although now being eased by Govern-
ment subsidies and bank overdrafts, will remain tight through 1977/78 even
assuming implementation of the above tariff increases. The Government pro-
vided assurances under the Second Railway Project that it would protect the
railway's financial position through subsidies or other appropriate measures
in the event of a cash shortfall, and it has complied satisfactorily with this
agreement. The same assurances have been incorporated for reference in the
draft Guarantee Agreement (Section 2.02). REGIFERCAM's debt/equity ratio is
satisfactory because construction of the Transcameroon extension, which
accounts for about 60 percent of the railway's assets, was financed mainly by
grants.
PART V - THE PROJECT
Background
43.       The proposed engineering project was appraised in November 1975,
Negotiations were held in Washington on March 4 and 5, 1976.   The Cameroonian
Delegation was led by Mr. E. D. Quan,tcharge d'affaires, a.i. Embassy of the
United Republic of Cameroon to the USA. A Loan and Project summary is in
Annex III. Summaries of relevant technical, financial and economic information
are in Annex IV through VIII. There is no separate appraisal report for this
project.
44.       The need for more adequate railway terminal facilities at Deuala has
been clearly identified for several years, and REGIFERCAM had planned to carry
out the engineering and construct these facilities. REGIFERCAM was, hovever,
unable to obtain the required financing and the works were not carried out.
Since the existing accomodations are approaching their capacity limits, and since
the proposed extension of the Port of Douala will need complementary marshalling
capacity to avoid a possible constraint on expected traffic growth, the need for
new facilities is becoming more urgent. The Government has therefore requested
the Bank to help finance the engineering required for the eventual construction
of a station and marshalling yard. During 1976, the railway will erect some
simple temporary facilities on part of the land reserved for the new yard and
station for use until the proposed new facilities become available. These works
will be executed by the railway's departmental forces with available, used mate-
rial. Due to their simple design, operational constraints, and the quality of
the material to be used, the lifespan of these temporary works is estimated at
only about five years.

45.      The newa Douala railway station and marshalling yard project, for which
a feasibility and engineering study loan is proposed, would essentially consist
of:
ti)  a passenger station with tracks and platforms;
(ii) a set of tracks for services and parking passenger
coaches;
(iii)  a marshalling yard with two sets of tracks for freight
traffic;
(iv) a platform and surfaced areas for cargo-handling, in-
cluding required service sidings;
(v)  a warehouse and its service tracks;
(vi) a wagon maintenance shed;
(vii)  paved internal service roads and parking areas; and
(viii)  road access to the station and yard and a road bridge
to replace the present level-crossing on the Douala-
Yaounde" Road.
Preliminary estimates indicate that construction of the marshalling yard cover-
ing items (ii) through (viii), would cost about US$12 million (1975 prices)
with the passenger station building costing a further US$5 million (1975 prices).
46.       The new yard will require a peak-season capacity of 230 incoming
wagons daily, corresponding to the expected traffic in 1985/86; about 25
percent of these wagons would be forwarded directly by blocktrains from the
main line to auxiliary shunting facilities to be constructed under the pro-
posed Second Douala Port Project. However, the feasibility study included
in the present engineering project may demonstrate that railway terminal
facilities in the Douala area would be best concentrated largely in the new
yard, and consequently that part of the facilities included in the port proj-
ect should also be located there. It was agreed with the Government that
the railway facilities to be included in the proposed project for the devel-
opment of the port of Douala will be based on an economically and technically
sound distribution of capacity between the port and the proposed railway sta-
tion, consistent with the conclusions of the feasibility study described in
para 48 below (Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement and para 4 (b) of
Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).
47.       The proposed loan also includes financing of consulting services
for railway operations, costing, budgeting and management, and for the study
of optimum inter-modal distribution of investment in the Douala-Yaounde cor-
ridor. These consulting services were originally included in the Second
Railway Project. The bulk of this Second Railway Project was intended for
hardware items (track, rolling stock), and for construction of the Japoma
bridge. Bids for these items were already in hand at the time of Board
approval. However, the exchange rate fell from a US$1 = CFAF 250 at that
time to an estimated weighted average of US$1 = CFAF 213 during project im-
plementation. As a result, additional financing of US$1.72 million (after allow-
ing for other cost savings) is required to cover the cost of part of the



- 13 -
equipment already ordered and the consulting services. REGIFERCAII has ar-
ranged to obtain a supplier credit of US$800,000 for the equipment. It is
proposed to transfer the consulting services from the Second Railway Proj-
ect to the proposed engineering project. An amount of US$925,000 for fi-
nancing the foreign exchange cost (including price contingencies) of these
consulting services has been included in the proposed project.
Items to be Financed Under the Proposed Loarn
A.   The Engineering Project
48.       The project comprises:
(i) A feasibility study to:
(a)  determine, as part of a master plan, the capacity
demand for railway terminal facilities (passenger
and freight) in the Douala area by 1985;
(b) determine the optimum distribution of total capacity
among individual facilities, particularly between
the port of Douala and the proposed marshalling
yard (para,46);
(c)  produce a preliminary design, tentative construc-
tion timetable, and cost estimates for the new rail-
way terminal and its ancillary facilities;
(d) evaluate the economic and financial implications
of the construction of the proposed installations
based on preliminary design and cost estimates
referred to in (c) above;
(e) prepare draft terms of reference for the final
engineering studies, as well as an execution
schedule and cost estimates.
(ii)  Based on the above, final engineering of the new Douala
passenger station and marshalling yard, including geo-
technical studies, preparation of cost estimates, con-
struction planning and tender documents for the compo-
nents listed in para.45 above.
49.       A condition of disbursement for the final engineering work is that
the Government, REGIFERCAM and the Bank shall have agreed on the main con-
clusions drawn from the feasibility study, in particular that the proposed
design for the various components of the project (and specifically for the
road access to the station and yard and the road bridge to replace the pres-
ent level-crossing) have been determined to be technically and economically
sound (para 4 (b) of Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).

B.   Consulting Services Transferred from the Second Railway Project
50.       These consulting services comprise:
(i)  managerial assistance to reorganize the railway's manage-
ment, costing, budgeting, commercial activities and oper-
ations. About 85 man-months of consulting services will
be required to make recommendations in these areas and
assist in implementing them.
(ii)  a Douala-Yaounde Corridor Study aimed at defining an
optimum intermodal distribution of investment in the
Corridor. The results of this study will provide guid-
ance as to the best investment policy, given the pros-
pects for both road and rail development. About 25
man-months of consulting services will be required for
the execution of this study.
REGIFERCAM has already selected SOFRERAIL and SOFRERAIL/OCCR (France) respec-
tively to execute these studies. Consultants are expected to start work in
early May 1976.

12 percent in 1977; and 12 percent in 1978. No price contingency has
been added to one contract in item (iii), representing 20 percent of the
total cost of this item, since this contract has a fixed price.
The cost of the feasibility and engineering studies (20 and 160 man-months
respectively) is estimated on the basis of proposals received for the con-
sulting services (109 man-months) included in the Second RailwayX Project



- 16 -
where the man-month rates ranged from US$5,600 to US$7,500 with an average
rate of US$5,850.
Finaircing and Disbursements
52.       The proposed loan of US$2.3 million would finance the entire for-
eign exchange cost of the project. Disbursements would be made against 100
percent of foreign expenditures for contracts awarded to foreign firms and 80
percent of total expenditures for contracts awarded to local firms. REGIFERCAM
would finance the local costs (estimated at US$592,000 equivalent), part of
which are for preliminary survey works, and some studies of track layout al-
ready made by the railway. The estimated schedule of disbursements from the
proposed Loan is shown in Annex VI.
53.       Because of the urgent need for implementation of the management
consulting services and the feasibility study for the new yard and station,
work on these project items is scheduled to start in April/May 1976. Depending
on the date of signature of the Loan documents, some retroactive financing may
be necessary and an amount of up to US$400,000 is therefore proposed for
this purpose.
Execution
54.       The feasibility and final engineering studies would be carried
out by consultants to be selected an terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank. The layout of tracks for the passenger terminal and the marshalling
yard will be designed by REGIFERCAM assisted, if necessary and in agreement
with the Bank, by the Office de Chemin de Fer Transcamerounais. Consulting
services for assistance to REGIFERCAM operations and management and execution
of the corridor study will be provided by SOFRERAIL and SOFRERAIL/OCCR who
have already been selected following procedures consistent with the Bank's
guidelines.  The final engineering elements of the project are expected to be
completed by October 1977, and the other consulting services by June 1978. A
tentative implementation timetable is attached as Annex VII, and was reviewed
with and accepted by REGIFERCAM during negotiations.
Economic Evaluation of Proposed Construction Project
55.       The existing marshalling yard was fully utilized in the handling
of 1973/74 traffic volumes. Delays in wagon turnaround occurred then which
were largely attributable to congestion and to the generally poor operational
conditions experienced during the rainy season.
56.       Traffic through Douala marshalling yard facilities is forecast
to increase by nearly 120 percent between 1973/74 and 1985/86. This esti-
mate is based upon recently prepared forecasts of traffic through the port
of Douala, and the assumption that the existing relationship between port
and railway traffic volumes will continue.



- 17 -
57.       The proposed new marshalling yard will have a much larger capacity
than the existing one, and will also be located at a better site and closer
to the Douala workshops. Three main sets of benefits are therefore expected
to result from the project:
(a) improved productivity of the wagon fleet;
(b) reduced costs of movement of locomotives between
yard and workshops, shorter mainline hauls, and
elimination of delays and damage caused by periodic
flooding of the existing yard;
(c) avoidance of diversion to road transport of addi-
tional traffic which the existing marshalling yard
could not handle; road transport is generally
more expensive than rail due to climatic and road
conditions, therefore, the diversion costs would be
significant.
Additionally, benefits will probably be obtained from reduced pilferage
and from an improvement in urban traffic flows; however, there is not enough
data to quantify these benefits. All the above benefits are directly attri-
butable to the proposed project.
58.       The best present estimate of the economic return on the construction
project is 29 percent and sensitivity artalysis indicates that the return would
Btill be over 20 percent even though assumed incremental traffic were reduced
by one-third, in line with sensitivity assumptions employed for the proposed Se-
cond Douala Port Project. While these returns are tentative for reasons given
in the detailed economic evaluation (Annex VIII), and are subject to revision
once the consultants' report is issued, they suggest that the engineering pro-
ject is fully justified. The returns apply only to freight traffic; benefits
from the investments that relate to passenger traffic have not been calculated.
About one-tenth of the project's benefits would accrue to landlocked Chad.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Regie Nationale
des Chemins de Fer du Cameroun, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United
Republic of Cameroon and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
60.       Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 40 to 42 of this report. A condition
of disbursements for expenditures incurred for the final engineering of the
railway station and marshalling yard would be that REGIFERCAM and the Bank



- 18 -
agree that on the basis of the studies included in Part A of the Project, the
proposed design of the Douala railway station and marshalling yard is techni-
cally and economically justified (see para. 4 (b) of Schedjile I to the draft
T
LUoan Agreement and para. 49 of this report).
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.,
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490    CAMDEV Project:  US$11 million Credit of March 28,
1967; Effective Date: July 7, 1967; Closing Date:
June 30, 1972 and US$7 million Loan to CAMDEV of
same date; Effective Date: July 7, 1967; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977 (Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1974).
The planting programs are now nearly completed, satisfactorily,
and the company is entering into a much needed consolidation period. High
level management is now Cameroonized, and the take-over from the expatriate
General Manager went smoothly. However, the new General Manager, a capable
person with a financial background, needs seasoning and technical support
for some time. The project is now running on a sound basis and. with some
managerial improvement, the prospects are good.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp. Ln.     Oil Palm Project:  US$7.9 million Loan to SOPAME
No. 886                     of April 15, 1969; Effective Date:   August 14,
1969; Closing Date:  December 31, 1976 and
US$1.7 million Supplemental Loan of April 9,
1973; Effective Date: October 19, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project is progressing satisfactorily and the plantation
of 8,500 ha of oil palm are nearly completed. The establishment of the
last 600 ha due to be planted in 1975 will, however, be deferred until
the 1976 planting season because it was necessary to use available plant-
ing stock to replenish young palms destroyed by rodents. The second mill,
at Eseka estate, was commissioned in May/June 1975. The estate housing
improvement program is underway.   Early yields are in line with appraisal
projections; palm oil prices are higher than expected but so are pro-
duction costs because of general inflation; nevertheless, the financial
prospects are good.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 604      Water Supply Project:   US$5 million Loan to SNEC of
June 2, 1969; Effective Date: November 4,1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974 (Original
Closing Date: May 31, 1972).
This project was completed on schedule with savings which have
been approved for investment in further water distribution works; however,
disbursements lagged due to the strong working capital position of the
Borrower and the closing date was postponed three times in order to allow
remaining funds to be disbursed. SNEC and Government (Guarantor) have
accepted the Bank's proposal for closure of the loan as of December 31,
1974 and the Bank has cancelled the unused balance of US$70,000.
Cr. No. 161      First Education Project:   US$10.5 million Credit of
September 23, 1969; Effective Date: April 29, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976 (Original Closing
Date: June 30, 1974, first postponement December 31, 1975).
The implementation of this project was slow, especially in the
initial years. This resulted from delays in (i) selecting the consultants,
(ii) reaching agreement on schedules of accommodation, (iii) revising the
bidding documents, (iv) starting construction work for which over-priced
initial bids had to be cancelled,.and (v) awarding contracts. The project
is now well managed and near completion. With the exception of additional
site-works, the construction of the project schools is completed. The pro-
curement of furniture is completed and the procurement of equipment will soon
be completed. All the schools are in operation. The technical assistance
program is about 30 months behind schedule due to slow selection process;
hence the closing date has been extended from December 31, 1975, to December
31, 1976. In May 1975 a supplementary Credit of US$1.2 million was approved
to cover cost increases due to currency realignments.
Cr. No. 229    Douala Port Project:   US$1.5 million Credit of January 14,
1971; Effective Date: April 14, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974; (Original Closing Date:   June 30, 1973).
The Douala Port Project commenced in July 1972 and physical
work under the Credit was satisfactorily completed in November 1974. Credit
covenants and undertakings given during Credit negotiations have been
reasonably fulfilled, but financial targets have not been achieved in recent
years. Remedial measures are now being urged by the Association.
Cr. No. 302    SENRY Rice Project:   US$3.7 million Credit of April 26, 1972;
Effective Date: July 28, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project started in mid-1972 and is progressing satisfactorily.
Implementation is on schedule. Results achieved by the project in the fields
of production yields and agricultural practice improvements have largely ex-
ceeded anticipated targets. The project has been less successful in attract-
ing qualified Cameroonian staff and establishing an adequate financial manage-
ment. Attempts to correct these shortcomings are being made. The devaluation



Page 4 of 6 pages
of the US dollar and additional works have increased costs by about 3b percent.
The Government, CCCE and FAC are financing the cost overruni.
Cr. No. 320    Second Education Project:   US$9 million Credit of June 28,
1972, Effective Date: February 27, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Due to difficulties in selecting architects and agreeing on the
designs, project implementation was delayed by twenty-four months, but no
extension of the closing data of June 30, 1979, is expected. The project
is generally well managed, but faces severe cost overruns due to the ac-
celerated price increases which have occurred since 1973. Consequently
one item is to be financed under the proposed Third Education Project.
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935   Second Highway Project:   US$24 million Credit of
September 26, 1973; Effective Date: December 20,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978 and
US$24 million Loan of same date; Effective Date:
December 20, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
Because of inflation and the price escalation clause, bids for the
construction of the three roads were 30 percent higher than the appraisal es-
timates and costs are continuing to climb. The Government has awarded con-
struction contracts for roads at the oriainal bid price and works have started
in December 1974. Construction of the Garoua-Mora road (260 km) is progress-
ing satisfactorily whereas it now appears that some delays of up to one year
might affect construction of the roads Douala-Pont du Nkam (161 km) and
Pont du Noum-Foumbari (50 km). Progress of the project's consulting ser-
vice and technical assistance components has also been disappointing. The
project was re-appraised in September 1975 and the total cost is now esti-
mated at US$143 million. This would leave a financing gap of about US$74
million. In view of the unexpected magnitude of the cost overruns and the
absence of additional financing from new donors, the Government has agreed
to postpone construction of one road section (90 km). This would reduce
total project cost to about US$121 million of which about US$83 million are
foreign exchange costs. A supplementary credit of US$15 million was approved
in March 1976 to help alleviate the burden imposed on the Government by the
project's cost overruns.
Ln. No. 983    Livestock Project:   US$11.6 million Loan of May 14, 1974;
Effective Date: September 16, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980.
Project implementation is generally good and appointment of project
staff has been completed. Results obtained at one of the project ranches are
exceptionally good, but a second ranch has encountered serious start-up dif-
ficulties. Bids for the construction of the two slaughter plants are to be
invited by March 1976. About 70 livestock credits are expected to be pro-
cessed during 1976, and the tsetse-fly eradication campaign is likely to start
in December 1976, as scheduled. Disbursements have been slow, but are expected
to accelerate when the construction of the slaughter plants begins.

Ln. No. 1038    Second Railway Project:  US$16.0 million Loan to REGIFERCAM
of Septemhcr 18, 1974; E'ffective Date: December 18, 1974;
Closing Date: D)ecember 31, 1977.
Procurement of main project items is well underway; track
material is being delivered and rolling stock should be available by end
1975. Problems were encountered in the construction of foundations for
the Japoma Bridge. Selection of consultants for the management assistance
and for the Douala-Yaounde transport corridor sttudy is proceeding satis-
factorily and contracts are expected to be signed soon. Due to the present
world slump in the timber market and a recent substantial increase in staff
costs, REFIGERCAI will have difficulty in attaining the financial covenants
included in the Loan Agreement. The project is also confronted with a
financing gap of about US$2 million due to currency realignments. Other
financing agencies have been approached to fill part of the gap. Addi-
tional financing for the studies is being recommended under the proposed
Third Railway Project (Douala Railway Station and Marshalling Yard Engineering
Project).
Ln. No. 1039     Cocoa Project:  US$6.5 million Loan of September 18, 1974;
Effective Date:  February 26, 1975.   Closing Date:   June 30,
1981.
The Project has made continuing progress in establishing its
structure as well as organizing the training program and field development.
The management is still somewhat weak and, as a result, efficient coordina-
tion of the various activities is lacking. No serious cost overruns are
expected, except for a small shortfall during the Project's first two years
which has been estimated at about US$0.3 million; Government's contribution
will be increased by this amount. The roads program component of the
Project is, however, not progressing well. Measures envisaged by the Bank
are: (a) enlisting RMWA's help in organizing a mission of the Highway
Engineer to review the situation and to make recommendations for the setup
of an operational Feeder Roads Department, and (b) exploring the possibility
of having an expatriate Highway Engineer put at the head of this Department.
Project implementation in the field is proceeding satisfactorily. Thc
project's planting program is carried out in line with appraisal forecasts.
Supply of inputs has been satisfactorily organized and nturseries properly
developed.
Credit No. 574 Niete Rubber Estate Project: US$16.0 million Credit of

Activity at the Niete Rubber Estate got under wav immediatQlv
upon the arrival of management personnel on-site in August 1975. Some
planting has already been done in advance of scheduile, and a first
village for laborers is under conistruction. The management team, pro-
vided under contract by a plantation firm, SAFACAL, is highlv competent

Assumptions Used to Forecast Income Accounts
I. Operating Revenue
1.        Freight traffic in ton-kilometers is expected to increase by some
70% between 1974/75 and 1978/79. This forecast is based on the analysis car-
ried out for the appraisal of the proposed Second Douala Port Project. The ex-
pected increase in the average transport distance and the existing taper in
the tariff will reduce the revenue per t/km bv about 4%.
2.        Passenger traffic increased sharply between 1973/74 and 1974/75,
due to the opening of the Transcameroon extension between Belabo and
Ngaoundere'.  Its volume, expressed in passenger-kilometers, is now expected
to grow by about 5% p.a. Unit revenues are forecast to remain unchanged ex-
cept for tariff adjustments.
3.        Tariff increases, expressed as a percentage of REGIFERCAM's operat-
ing revenue are as follows:
(i) an actual tariff increase as of July 1, 1975 averaging
7.7%; and
(ii)  proposed increased of 124/% in each of the three fiscal
years between 1976/77 and 1978/79.
4.        The proposed tariff increased are considered necessary to re-
establish REGIFERCAM's financial viability. A satisfactory debt service
coverage of 1.6 times would be achieved by 1977/78, and an acceptable rate
of return of 3.7% one year thereafter. The Second Railway Project stipulates
for 1978/79 a target rate of return of 3.5%.
5.        The indices shown below indicate that even after implementation of
the above increases the railway's tariffs would still lag behind past and ex-
pected inflation in Cameroon. Past and forecast increases of both the rail-
way's traffic volume and its productivity would make important additional
contributions toward improving the railway's financial position.

ANNEX V
Page 3 of 5 pages
6.        The proposed tariff increases are considered feasible without
significantly affec-ting traffic levels for the following principal reasons:
(i)  rail relaying under the First and Second Railway Projects
has and will produce benefits to customers in terms of
reductions in delays, and thus more reliable rail services;
(ii) the marshalling yard project will enable faster turnaround
of freight wagons, and thus reduced transit time and risk of
pilferage of goods while awaiting marshalling; and
(iii) the management consulting services included in this project
are designed to substantially improve the quality and
reliability of REGIFERCAM's services, thus strengthening
the railway's competitive position.
IIL Working Expenses
7.        A strong correlation exists in the case of REGIFERCAM between the
number of staff and traffic volume. This correlation can be described in
the following equation:
X = 2266 + 3.83 Y,
where X is defined as number of
staff employed at the end of each fiscal year and Y as millions of traffic
units, counting one passenger-km for 1/3 of a ton/km. The correlation co-
efficient for the above equation is 0.977, which is good. The above equation
has, therefore, been used for forecasting future staff numbers. Its implica-
tions on labor productivity are pointed out in paragraph 8 below.
8.        Labor productivity would increase from 118,000 traffic units per
man-year in 1974/75 to 151,000 in 1978/79 (3 passenger/km being one traffic
unit). This corresponds to an annual productivity increase of about 6%, which
is feasible for REGIFERCAM without major problems under conditions of rapidly
growing traffic.
9.        Average cost per man employed is expected to grow largely in line
with the forecast internal rate of inflation in Cameroon.
10.       Other costs, including all working expenses except staff costs, are
forecast to increase by 16% p.a., including a provision for cost inflation.
III. Depreciation and Capital Investment
11.       Future increases of depreciation have been determined according to
the following tentative investment program which is based on REGIFERCAM's
preliminary five-year investment plan and on mission estimates:

12.       The huLk of the above capital investment, with the exception of
the ongoing Yaounde-Otele realignment, is considered necessary to increase
REGIFERCAM's transport capacity in line with forecast traffic volumes and to
maintain the quality oE the raiLway's fixed assets zat present levels, or to
improve it wlhere justified.
13.       No provision has been made for realignment of the Douala-Yaounde
railway line beyond ()tele, as no final decision has yet been made with regard
to the execution, timing, and financing of this very large project.
IV. Interest Charges, Debt Service, and Subsidies
14.       Interest clharges and debt repayments are calculated:
(i)  for the existing debt on actual termis; and
(ii)  for future debt on assumed terms, including an interest rate
of 8% and repayment in 17 annuities after three years of grace.
This reflects the average terms and conditions of borrowing
whicii REFIGE'RCAM may expect to obtain for financing part of
the proposed investment program.



ANNEX V
Page 5 of 5 pages
15.       The ongoing Yaotunde-Otele realignment and the construction of a
new telecommunication system between Douala and Yaounde will be financed
mostly through bilateral grants and loans to the Government of Cameroon,
which undertook to assume the corresponding debt service. The capital out-
lay for the above projects is, therefore, being considered as an equity
contribution from the Government to REGIFERCAM.
16.       REGIFERCAM's  current positiorn is presently very tight, with net
current assets of only CFAF 359 million as of June 30, 1975. To rebuild a
reasonable current position through an increase of net current assets of
CFAF 500 million p.a., it is expected that:
(i) REGIFERCAM's contribution from its cash generation to
capital investment will be zero until 1976/77 and CFAF 1.9
billion during the remainder of the forecast period,
corresponding to a rather low 7% of the investment volume
for the entire forecast period; and
(ii)  the Government will continue to subsidize REGIFERCMI's ope-
rations, albeit with decreasing contributions, through the
current and the subsequent fiscal years for an amount
totalling CFAF 0.9 million. No subsidies would be paid
thereafter.
17.       A cash flow forecast reflecting the above assumptions, is
summarized as follows:

DOUALA RAILIWAY STATION AND MARSHALLING YARD ENGINEERING PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.        This evaluation is tentative at this stage for the reasons noted
below; however, the forecast rate of return of 20 to 29 percent is adequate
to justify proceeding with the proposed studies. The principal uncertain-
ties are:  (a) the economnically optimal relationship between yard capacity
and traffic volume, and distribution of capacity between yard and port,
remain to be established; (b) construction cost estimates are provisional;
(c) the extent of possible improvements in wagon turnaround time is not yet
precisely established; (d) traffic forecasts will have to be reviewed in the
light of any inter-relationship established by the feasibility study between
demand for railway services and efficiency improvements.
2.        Three sets of economic benefits are expected to arise from the
project. Two of these relate to 1973/74 traffic volumes, which are esti-
mated to represent the capacity of the existing installations; the third
relates to the incremental traffic between 1973/74 and 1985/86 forecast
volumes, which could not be handled by the complex of Douala railway facil-
ities in the absence of the project. The 1985/86 traffic volume forecast
is based upon recent consultant estimates for the proposed Second Douala
Port Project. It is assumed that the historical relationship between port
and railway traffic volumes, which has not changed significantly in recent
years, will continue to 1985/86. The benefit sets are as follows:
(a) Rolling stock productivity increases resulting from
improved turnaround time at yard and port.
(b) Reduced operational costs resulting from the location
of the new marshalling yard.
(c) Avoidance of traffic diversion to road which would be
necessitated if marshalling yard capacity were not in-
creased.
3.        Benefit A.  This set of benefits will result from a reduction
in the idle time of wagons at Douala which is due to the fact that con-
gestion in the existing yard prevents marshalling in the minimum opera-
tional time. In effect, the port facilities are used as a wagon stock-
yard, and the difference noted in Annex 7 in the average wagon stay
during the reference (peak) period between the marshalling yard and
port is a measure of this stock time. There are probably some opera-
tional reasons for a longer period to be spent in the port, but making
due allowance for this, the potential reduction in stay which would re-
sult from removal of capacity constraints is estimated as 3 to 4 days
for log carriers, and I to 2 days for general cargo wagons. These reduc-
tions can be translated into increased productivity of the wagon fleet,
and thus to a potential postponement of the need for new capacity to
meet future increases in traffic.



.ANN 1EX \' I1 1]
Page 2 of 5aCages
The potential productivity increase would postpone the requirement for new
log carrying stock from 1980 to 1982 or 1983, and for covered wagons fromn
1976/77 to 1978/79. The annual benefit for this productivity increase,
employing the curre.nt estimate of the internal cost of capital in Cameroon
(of 8-10 percent), is estimated to total about CFAF 225 million for 1983/84
onwards.
4.        Benefit B.  The second set of benefits results from the location
of the new yards. As thle central transfer point from main line traction
to marshalled traffic, the yard will afford a reduction in main line hauls
of about 8 kilometers on average.  The benefit ascribed to this is reduced
locomotive operating costs, and amounts to about CFAF 12 million per annum.
Additionally, the time required for the average round trip haul, and more
importantly, the transfer time for locomotives from yard to workscLops,
should be reduced by about 1 hour and 1-1/2 hours respectively.   The val-
ue of these reductions were estimated by REGIFERCAM as CFAF 15 million per
annum. It is possible that part of this saved time may not be fully util-
ized due to scheduling constraints, but on the other lhand, the costs avoided
by not having to program transfer movements of locomotives over the 3-1/2
kilometer between the existing yard and workshops was not quantified, and
would probably offset any scheduling constraint effect.
.         A further locational benefit is from aroidiarce of delays caused
by flooding of the existing yard.  This occurs about 20 times a year, with
rolling stock and locomotives being immobilized for about 150 hours, and
with an estimated delay cost of about CFAF 24 million per annum. The addi-
tional maintenance costs of rolling stock, and particularly of locomotives,
occasioned by flooding, are assessed at about CFAF 10 million per annum.
6.        Finally, there are probably some additional congestion and ser-
vice deterioration costs which are not subsumned in the estimated productiv-
ity improvements analyzed in Benefit A. However, the new yard will have
a larger area of rail and road surface than the existilng one, and the addi-
tional maintenance costs will at least partly offset the above-mentioned
congestioni saving benefits.
7.        Benefit C. The third set of benefits stems from the increase
in marshialling capacity which the project affords.  The capacity of the
existing yard is considered saturated at 1973/74 traffic volumes, and
thus incremental traffic could not be handled.  This would necessitate
eitlher discharge of vagons at intermediate stations outside the Douala
complex, or substittution entirely of truck for rail movement for certain
trzaffic.  In fact, the poteatial capacity for discharge at other stations
within reasonable proximity of Dotiala is very limited. Also, a stubstan-
tial volume of railway traffic is generated wi.thin 150-300 kilometers of
Douala which is a potentially economic truck catcmlment rndius, and is in
any case subject.to truck transport over part of its total journey. It
is thus assumed that all this incremental traffic would be carried by
road in the absence of the project.

8.        Road transport costs, differentiating between fixed and varia-
ble, were established for the Second Railway Project for the mixture of
road conditions current in the above-mentioned catchment area. These
have been updated to allow fbrinflation, and checked against more recent,
comparable data. For the railway, current costs of the necessary wagons
and locomotives were employed, together with current REGIFERCAM unit oper-
ational costs. Account was taken of transfer costs from road to rail which
would be avoided if total movement were by truck.
9.        The net rail cost advantage per ton/kilometer was calculated as
CFAF 9.0 for general cargo movement in box cars, and about CFAF 2.7 for
logs. The average distance to be travelled by the diverted traffic was
calculated by employing the traffic origin/destination/distribution on the
Douala-Yaounde line estimated by consultants for the Douala-Yaounde realign-
ment study, together with the assumption that most of the Douala-Nkongsamba
(Northern Line) traffic would be diverted to road. It was additionally
assumed that the diverted traffic would be equally divided between logs
and general cargo. This is consistent with the analysis of sensitivity
of rail traffic to road competition undertaken for the Second Railway Proj-
ect, and the fact that currently 50 percent of rail log traffic originates
within 300 kilometers of Douala. The net benefit from avoidance of traffic
diversion to road is estimated as rising from zero in 1975/76 (when 1973/74
traffic levels are again expected to be reached) to CFAF 1,080 million in
1985/86. For sensitivity analysis, a reduction of one-third in incremental
traffic was assumed.
10.       Additional benefits could be expected to arise from reduced pil-
ferage and improvement of urban traffic flows as a result of the re-
duced number of railroad crossings. These benefits are however unquantifi-
able on the basis of existing data. Additionally, some elements of track
investment will confer minor benefits on passenger traffic which has not
been calculated.
11.       The rate of return on the constructior project is estimated as 29 per-
cent; under the sentivity assumption it would still exceed 20 percent. The
rate of return reflects benefits to both Cameroon and Chad as follows:
Cameroon 26 percent and Chad 3 percent; under the sensitivity assumption,
Cameroon 23 percent and Chad 2 percent. The above returns apply only to
freight traffic; benefits from the elements of the investment which relate
to passenger traffic have not been calculated.
