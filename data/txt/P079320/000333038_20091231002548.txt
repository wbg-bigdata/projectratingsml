1. Project Context, Development Objectives

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The project addressed key Government of Timor-Leste (GoTL) concerns at time of design,
namely those expressed in the 2002 - 2007 National Development Plan (NDP) and the Ministry
of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF)I 2003 "Road Map for Implementation of NDP
Programs". In particular, the NDP prioritized reduction of poverty in all regions and sectors and
promotion of economic growth that is equitable and sustainable. MAF's major goals at the time
were "attaining food security, improving self-sufficiency and generating rural employment", and
were closely aligned with the NDP.

         The project was designed as the consolidation phase of agricultural rehabilitation, a
continuation of the efforts under the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP I) that emphasized
 rapid rehabilitation and the Second Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP II), which was
 designed as a transition phase "from a heavily subsidized sector to one with limited government
funding". The Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP III) relied on learning from lessons
 under ARP I and II and focused on "long-term sustainable agriculture and rural development,
 income generation and natural resources management".                            .

          The main lessons taken into account in the design as per the PAD were: (a) "the needfor
flexibility and periodic evaluations" (adoption of a phased, flexible approach to implementation);
(b) "a 'Farmer First' approach" (flexible demand-based assistance to rural households and
strengthening of community-based organizations); (c) "balanced investments between irrigated
and upland areas" (to correct ARP I's focus on irrigated areas and promote food security); (d)
"direct grant assistance to communities" (considered a better option to input provision as per the
findings of the 2001 Donors' Mission); (e) "ensuring sustainability" (not to promote dependence
from external assistance in rural areas by promoting self-reliance by communities); (f) "policy
and strategy support" (policy level technical assitance at MAF headquarters found to be valuable
as per the ARP II experience); (g) "monitoring droughts and floods" (collection of agro
meteorological data for improved food security); and (h) "capacity building" (through long term
foreign advisors, particularly in specialized fields as per lessons of ARP I and II).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (pDO

        The key project development objective was to "strengthen the capacity ofMAFF and its
development partners to assist rural communities in increasing their production and income in a
sustainable way".

As per the PAD main report the indicators2 were:



I MAFF was renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) in the second half of 2007. The reminder of this document uses
MAF, unless the text is directly quoted from older documentation.

2 Themain performance indicators for the project development objective included in the PAD show differences between the technical
Annex 3 on the Results Framework and the project description summary section of the PAD main report. There are also differences in
number and precise terminology of the indicators when compare to the TFET grant agreement between the World Bank and GoTL and
the Administration Agreement between the World Bank and the European Commission.
        1.  all major project activities integrated into MAF programs and funded by the Government
            by the end of the project (EOP);
        2.  average rice yields in rehabilitated irrigated areas increasing from 1.5 to 2.0 metric tons
            per hectare per crop by EOP;
        3.  cropping intensity in Caraulun scheme at 160 percent by 2008; and
        4.  70 percent offarmer beneficiaries satisfied with the services received.

        In addition the PAD results framework has six further indicators:

        1.  number of products resulting from small group activities that are (a) consumed, and (b)
            sold;
        2.  percentage of small groups still active by EOP;
        3.  cropping intensity in community irrigation schemes increasing to 100 by 2008;
        4.  65 percent of farmer respondents claiming increased knowledge of agriculture as a result
            of information provided;
        5.  15 percent increase in production offarm animals;
        6.  Monetized income obtained by Village Livestock Workers (VLWs) for private services
            (in US$); and
        7.  amount produced and sold by Tural Producer Organizations (RPOs) assisted by MAFF's
            Agro-Business Unit.


    1.3 Revised     PD~     and Key Indicators

        The PD~ and key indicators were not formally revised. 3 However, changes were
incorporated at the Mid Term Review (MTR) Aide-Memoire (March 2006) with the agreement of
the European Commission (EC) and GoTL. These included the following two revisions:

          "15 percent increase in the production of farm animals" was changed to "Reported rates
           of livestock mortality and morbidity reduced", and

          "Monetized income obtained by VLWs for private services (US$)" was changed to "75
           percent of trained VL Ws active".

        Although no other revisions to indicators were incorporated, the MTR Aide-Memoire
includes footnotes regarding rice yield and cropping intensity targets [MTR Aide-Memoire p. 8]
indicating respectively:

          "the MTR mission considered that the PD~ would be achieved if average rice yie.lds in
           rehabilitated irrigated areas increase by >0.3 tonslhalseason by EOP"; and

          "the MTR mission considered that a more realistic target would be: average yields
           exceed 1.5 tonlhalwet season and area cultivated (>90% in wet season, >0% in dry
           season)".




j    That is, fonnal changes are those approved by the original approving authority.



                                                                     2

        These changes at MTR resulted from the difficulties in gathering data for the PAD
indicators and discussions with MAF staff. Most importantly, despite these changes at MTR, the
following supervision missions do not mention the new indicators and use the old ones from the
PAD. Moreover, despite significant changes to Component 1 activities at MTR (see Section 1.6
below) the associated performance indicator was not reported upon.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

         The project description and economic analysis sections contained in the PAD provide
detailed numbers of target beneficiaries (see Annex 8 for detailed beneficiary targets). Overall, it
was estimated that ARP III would directly benefit MAF's central and district staff and a broad
range of farmer households in Timor-Leste. Although not clearly stated, capacity development of
MAF would also support other development partners' activities in rural development. Overall the
program management activities were expected to benefit a broad group of secondary beneficiaries
during and beyond the project implementation period by supporting MAF to "develop key
national policies and strengthen the Ministry's managerial and technical capacity" [PAD p4].
Finally, the project had clearly defined gender targets in terms of both quotas for facilitators and
membership of beneficiary farmer groups.

         The direct benefits to MAF in terms of capacity building would come from investments
in equipment, training and technical assistance at MAF headquarters and district offices. In
addition, a significant number of farmer households at national level would benefit not only from
the improved capacity ofMAF, but also directly from the different component activities such as
(for details please see Annex 2 and Annex 8):

      small group grants for natural resource management, which would create additional
       income earning opportunities;

      irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation to increase irrigated area thereby increasing
       yields and cropping intensity;

      dissemination of agricultural information for better farming techniques, thereby
       improving productivity; and

      access to animal health services to reduce livestock mortality.


1.5 Original Components


        ARP III had two funding channels. All components received grant funding through the
Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET). Components 2 to 4 were also funded by a European
Commission grant (ECTF). The PAD treats all components as one project regardless of funding
source and this completion report uses the same approach. The project components at appraisal
were the following:

    1.  Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management (TFET US$I.2
        million). To support MAF's main program of assistance to upland and coastal
        communities, aiming to strengthen their resilience and make them less vulnerable to

                                                3

         external shocks. This included grants to farmer groups, training of farmers in Natural
         Resource Management (NRM) activities, training of MAF staff, facilitators and NGOs,
         technical assistance and financing of equipment and incremental operating costs for MAF.
    2.  Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management (ECTF EUR2.5 million; TFET US$O.4
        million). To support MAF's main program of assistance to rural communities in lowland
        irrigated areas, based on procedures developed under ARP I and II. This included civil
        works to rehabilitate 24 small and medium irrigation schemes, one large irrigation
        scheme and 25 access roads, construction supervision, technical assistance on irrigation
        rehabilitation and Water User Associations (WUA), training for irrigation staff, surveys,
        equipment and incremental operating costs for MAF.
    3.  Services to Farmers (ECTF EUR2.7 million; TFET US$O.S million). To help
        institutionalize three essential services to farmers: (a) information; (b) animal health; and
        (c) agri-business support. Information to Farmers included technical assistance,
        information materials and programs, equipment, small works, training and cross visits,
        translation services, and incremental operating costs. Sustainable Animal Health Services
        financed technical assistance, vaccines and veterinary supplies, equipment, vaccination
        campaigns, vehicles, training and cross visits, and incremental operating costs. Support to
        Agri-businesses financed technical assistance, small works, agriculture and office
        equipment, farm inputs, training, and incremental operating costs.
    4.  Program Management (ECTF EUR1.6 million; TFET US$O.4 million). To assist
        MAF in developing key national policies, strategies, and legislation, strengthen its
        managerial and technical capacity, and carry out project management. This included
        funding technical advisors, workshops, MAF staff training, study tours, equipment and
        incremental operating costs.

1.6 Revised Components


         During the MTR an upland farming program was added to Component 1. This reflected
that livelihood activities under Component 1 included few technological interventions to improve
productivity and also gave too little attention to food security issues. Moreover, the whole
component lacked a proper conceptual framework. The adjustments at MTR were done without
any amendments to the legal agreements and were financed within the unspent balances of the
project. Also, some minor adjustments were made to Components 2, 3 and 4 (Table 1).

1.7 Other significant Cbanges


         With the evolution of the EURlUS$ exchange rate over the course of the project, the
value of the EC grant in US$ terms increased substantially thereby allowing more funds to be
allocated to the different components, from a total of US$6.9 million equivalent at the time of
appraisal in mid-2004, to almost US$8.5 million in December 2008. The additional funds were
mostly used in supporting more training and technical assistance under Component 4, as this was
rightly considered important to enhance achievement of institutional 'capacity building as per
PDO. An additional protection wall to safeguard the intake structure at Caraulun in late 2008 was
also financed.

         As project implementation suffered from severe civil disturbances in 2006 and was also
delayed because of elections and subsequent change in Government in 2007, it was agreed to
extend the project period to December 31, 2008 (one year for both the EC grant and the TFET
grant; previously the TFET grant had been extended for six months to align the closing date with
the EC grant).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


        Assessment of project preparation indicates that the rationale for Bank involvement was
strong, building on a solid foundation of experience through ARP I and II. At the time there was
no Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), but the 2000 Transitional Support Strategy and the PAD
carefully showed how the project was aligned with both the country's National Development Plan
2002-07 (NDP), MAF's Road Map programs and the World Bank's strategy. The following four
positive factors during the lending process contributed to implementation and outcome.

       1.  Project scope and complexity: The overall design of the project seeking to support a
           broad range of MAF directorates at central level was judged appropriate at the time of
           appraisal given the lack of capacity throughout the institution;

       2.  Joint funding: Moreover, pooling of resources from TFET and EC was a good approach
           to ensure broad and consistent support for capacity building within a single design
           framework;


                                                               5
   3.  Project management: Full integration of project activities in MAF without a PMU
       resulted in ownership by Government officials and created a sound background for
       capacity building; and

   4.  Government commitment: prior to project start the government commitment was strong,
       with the full integration of ARP I and II activities into MAF's regular line functions.

        However, there were significant design weaknesses which caused implementation
problems and affected outcomes. These may have been partly due to the short design period in
response to pressure for rapid action to support the country's post-conflict transition.

    I.  Lessons not adequately learned from ARP II's ICR: while lessons from ARP II
        supervision reports were incorporated into design, some important conclusions from the
        ARP II experience were not taken into consideration as the project became effective
        before the completion assessment of ARP II. In particular, ARP II's ICR highlights some
        of the efficiency problems in irrigation system rehabilitation, which had not been
        previously recognized.

   2.  Over-optimistic scheduling: the original project period was too short at three years
       given the stated objective of "consolidation" of activities versus the "transition" phase of
       ARP II. This resulted in focusing on quick output delivery, without time for adequate on
       the-job training of central and district MAF staff;

   3.  Complex institutional demands: while planned component activities were generally
       sound, their diversity and the multiple required institutional interactions (such as among
       MAF directorates) led to a high degree of complexity that constrained achievement of the
       different outcomes;

   4.  Weak integration of activities: complementarity between the different components was
       inadequate and this is most significant in the lack of support to the crops directorate and
       absence of activities directly focusing on crop production. These would have
       complemented, among others, the investments in irrigation rehabilitation. The latter was
       highlighted as a key issue in the recommendations from ARP II's mid-term review [PAD,
       p. 19];

   5.  Over-ambitious irrigation planning: irrigation rehabilitation activities were based on
       the track record of ARP I and II, which despite satisfactory output target achievements
       already showed some of the fragilities in terms of quality and sustainability. The target of
       covering 24 small and one large scheme all over the country on a very short time frame
       was ambitious. This translated into speedy designs and insufficient attention and support
       being provided to maximizing the value of investments and ensuring sustainability
       through capacity building of WUAs and training of district irrigation officers;

   6.  Deficient preparation of gender focus: gender targets for farmer group membership and
       especially for WUAs were particularly ambitious, but the PAD did not specifY how they
       would be achieved;

   7.  Unbalanced investments: the desirability of "balanced investments between irrigated
       and upland areas" was a lesson from ARP I noted in the PAD, but was overlooked with
       most of planned investments being directed at lowland irrigated areas. This also


                                                6

        contradicts the country and sector background analysis in the PAD, which highlights the
        higher poverty levels and food security problems of upland farmers;

    8.  Weak Monitoring and Evaluation design: while the project designed appropriately
        emphasized flexibility to maximize results given the country's evolving post-conflict
        situation, more support for M&E would have been warranted in order to provide quality
        information to appropriately assess performance and improve decision-making.
        Indicators and targets were inconsistent and poorly defined across the PAD and legal
        documents and in certain instances difficult to measure, as for example in the case of
        farmer satisfaction levels; and

    9.  Lack of description of implementation arrangements: the documentation lacked a
        description and discussion of implementation mechanisms for flexible implementation
        arrangements. While the project design requires and refers to flexibility, the PAD does
        not provide details.

2.2 Implementation


         Despite the challenges raised by violent riots in 2006 throughout the country and
elections in 2007, with a one year extension the project concluded most of its activities. The riots
in 2006 (immediately after the MTR of March 2006) resulted in substantial loss of equipment and
information at MAF (including project information), local officers working in an uncertain
environment and several of the international advisors leaving the country. Uncertainty persisted
until the general election held in mid-2007 when a new Government was appointed, and which
also resulted in some changes at MAF. In such a difficult environment, achievements can be
attributed to: (a) MAF staff involvement in, and commitment to project activities; (b) experience
gained from ARP I and II, which had followed similar implementation procedures; and (c) a large
team of international advisors providing technical support to implementation (in particular,
adequate support to financial management and procurement services).

        Although most project activities (such as construction works for scheme rehabilitation
and road rehabilitation) were carried out, outputs delivered were, however, to a significant extent
below original targets, especially in irrigated area rehabilitation and Component 1 (NRM). Key
reasons for this underachievement are:

      undue investment focus: although mostly a design issue, the ambitious targets set at the
       onset and reduced project period led to a focus of technical assistance and MAF staff on
       carrying out investments rather than on the proposed objectives of consolidation of
       efforts of earlier ARPs and looking for sustainability and quality of outputs;

      weak monitoring of and poor technical quality of advisors: there was no suitable
       mechanism to monitor international advisor performance and it was also difficult to
       ensure good collaboration between individual consultants;

      poor construction quality: quality control mechanisms were not put in place by the
       project at district level, especially for irrigation rehabilitation works and maintenance
       aspects, often leading to poor construction quality. This was also partly due to lack of
       knowledge transfer from advisors and capacity building ofMAF district staff; and



                                                 7
      ineffective M&E system: the M&E system did not provide quality information for
       decision-making. This was in part due to inadequate staffing at the division level and
       health issues of key staff (see more on M&E below).

        Project implementation was also affected negatively by progress reporting errors that
while suspected earlier, clearly emerged in early 2008, prompting the request by the Bank for
independent technical reviews of components by international short term consultants. These
showed that overstated output information was repeatedly given to project management and to
Bank review missions. This led to implementation issues not being flagged and corrective steps
not being taken in a timely way. It also contributed to implementation progress being rated
moderately satisfactory throughout most of the project. Only on the last supervision mission
following the results of the technical reviews was the project rated unsatisfactory. Even though in
several discussion the wrong reporting was acknowledged by MAF, the latest half yearly report
(July-December 2008), submitted in April 2009, MAF still reported, for example, for the
community irrigation schemes 3,570 ha of irrigated area - rather than 1,760 ha out of the
envisaged 3,000 ha as the ICR mission estimates (see Annex 2). Similarly progress on road works
was overstated by about 50 percent.

         Besides the last supervision mISSIon, project implementation was rated moderately
unsatisfactory only in August 2005 due to delays in implementing key parts of the agreed action
plan of March 2005. Delays reported by supervision included: (a) implementation of Component
1 (minimal progress in supporting existing 29 villages); (b) operationalization of the agribusiness
unit within MAF (Component 3); (c) weak collaboration between MAF divisions; (d) insufficient
number of qualified staff to undertake agreed work plans; and (e) lack of several key counterpart
staff to work with international advisors. While MAF acted to nominate all needed staff, some of
the concerns on lack of qualifications given the ambitious work plans were never properly
addressed during the remainder of project implementation.

        At the mid-term review the main activity changes introduced, mainly based on finding
from the ARP II ICR, were never properly implemented mainly due to turnover of advisors, but
also because of unforeseen delays due to the civil unrests in 2006 and the election period in 2007.
The MTR also requested strengthened M&E, more focus on quality and transfer of technical
knowledge to MAF staff, none of which occurred due to the same reasons.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


        M&E design. The monitoring and evaluation foundation of the project was weak, both
as a basis for the M&E function during implementation and for the assessment in this report. The
PAD did not provide much guidance on technical specifications of the M&E system, it also
included only very limited support for such activities through three person-months of evaluation
experts and some NGO surveys. This was insufficient to provide for informed decision-making
during project implementation.

        The project development objective was poorly defined at design stage, giving prime
emphasis to institutional change rather than to desired development outcomes. The associated key
performance indicators did not capture the main outcomes expected. There are no indicators for
assessing increases in rural production and household income or for judging the sustainability of
production systems, all of which objectives are explicitly mentioned in the PDO. In addition,


                                                8

several other indicators lack proper numerical targets or can be difficult to measure in such a
post-conflict situation with very low capacity. Capacity building outcomes were to be measured
only through "integration a/project activities into MAF', which lacked a qualitative dimension 4 
Production indicators do not take into consideration rainfed agriculture which is clearly
mentioned as very important in the lessons learned section of the PAD in relation to food security,
and is key to improving overall incomes of project beneficiaries. Finally, yield targets are not
fully consistent between the results framework and the economic analysis. In the case of Caraulun,
the results framework indicates 2.0 Mt/ha as target for all rehabilitated schemes and the economic
analysis in the PAD uses values of 2.SMtlha in first season and 2.0Mt/ha in second season after
five years.

        M&E implementation. Process monitoring and impact evaluation were poorly
implemented. This was a result of both the weak design and lack of resources both in terms of
MAF staffing and project funds. M&E performance was also constrained by reporting difficulties
between the different directorates, field staff and the M&E service within the Planning
Directorate, caused mostly by lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities.

         M&E utilization. Available M&E data was used for production of the half yearly
reports (for WB and EC) but did not seem to have had much effect on project performance. In
particular, the fact that these reports were often misleading (with overstated data) obscured
performance shortfalls and the need for changes during implementation.

         Methodological "soundness", data quality and M&E sustain ability. The baseline
survey conducted for the project followed a country-wide approach and lacked an appropriate
empirical methodology, namely to allow establishment of causality between project activities in
irrigation scheme rehabilitation and improved production and incomes. The quality of data
collected by the project even at output level was poor, and this remained so despite the issue
being flagged during supervision missions. The M&E unit within MAF received some technical
assistance support, but it may have been insufficient to sustainably improve MAF's data
collection activities. Also, based on requests from previous supervision missions, in 2008
independent specialists reviewed the different components and conducted surveys of irrigation
schemes. However, despite valuable insights provided by this work, it can make only a second
best contribution to understanding project impact, because of the weak empirical base.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


        Procurement Related Aspects. While there were no major critical issues found during
implementation of the project and procurement arrangements for the project were overall within
acceptable limits, the supervision of contracts could have been done better and the keeping of
records was poor. A consistent problem throughout implementation was the use the Procurement
Plan that was only updated periodically and only when absolutely necessary, despite several
requests. It appears as if the Procurement Plan was not used as a planning and monitoring tool. It




4 It is not easy to assess capacity building qualitatively, but some degree of measurement could be achieved through independent
reviews of technical capacity of MAF staff, for example on key areas such as irrigation where the project invested heavily in training
and technical assistance,



                                                                   9

needs to be noted that the procurement unit was fully integrated into MAF and managed both
MAF and project related procurement.

         Financial Management (FM).          FM arrangements for the project were overall
satisfactory with no critical issues. Delays systematically occurred in releasing funds to the
components which occasionally affect the pace of implementation, but not significantly. The FM
unit was fully integrated into MAF and managed both Ministry internal and project related
processes and transactions. Possible areas for improvement include reducing payment approval
layers, tighter internal controls, and improved management of cash advances and expenditure
documentation.

        Due to the change of the fiscal year the outstanding audit report covering the period from
July 2007 to December 2008 was not available when this report was being drafted, but the
auditors indicate that there are no substantial issues. The World Bank FM Specialist will follow
up as part ofthe regular fiduciary supervision activities in the Timor-Leste country portfolio.

         Environmental and Social Safeguards. These were appropriately rated as category B at
appraisal. The small size of the irrigation systems to be rehabilitated and their locations implied
that the impact of the project would be generally small and dispersed, and that the project would
provide a low-risk opportunity to build environmental expertise and experience within the MAF.
The project complied with the World Bank's safeguard policies and financed training, materials,
specialist technical assistance. Early supervision missions raised issues regarding polybag
disposal and erosion from access road run-off, which MAF has generally addressed satisfactorily.
Compliance with social safeguards was satisfactory and safeguard compliance relating to land use
in Component 2 has been institutionalized.


2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase

          There is no follow-on project planned or other significant capacity building support to
MAF with a fully integrated approach as in ARP III. Despite an exit strategy for ARP being
mentioned clearly in the PAD, this was not developed further and raises questions on the ability
to sustain some of the capacity improvements of the project. However, as most investments have
been to privately owned farms and to members of WUAs, ongoing operation of project
investments is generally the responsibility of individual farmers. Unfortunately, though funds
have been allocated to training and capacity building of farmers and WUAs, the achievements in
terms of operation and maintenance standards are limited. The support by the District Irrigation
Officer (DIO) and other MAF staff seems to be restricted by technical and financial capacity. As
highlighted above there are also significant concerns over the post-completion operation of
rehabil itated infrastructure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


         Relevance of Objectives.        The project objectives of strengthening MAF and
development partners as well as increased production and incomes continue to be highly relevant.
In particular food security and rural development are two of the current Government's national
priorities and have attracted substantial donor attention. The observed insufficient technical

                                                10 

capacity at MAF at several levels, in particular in the field (where inexperienced extension staff
have been deployed recently), point to continued attention to these issues.

          Relevance of Design. The core design elements of an integrated approach through
Government budget processes (instead of a separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU) approach)
are still sound as a means to create ownership, as highlighted by discussions with MAF staff and
the recent experience of other donor-funded projects that are not directly Government
implemented. However, the broad approach followed with multiplication of activities in different
sub-sectors may prove too complex at present given the expansion in MAF staff numbers and
activities. A more focused approach narrowed to specific themes within rural development is
possibly more appropriate. The continuation of major investments in irrigation rehabilitation
needs to be revisited given water availability issues and irrigation infrastructure concerns (low
reliability and high operation and maintenance requirements). Such investments may prove to be
of lower value when compared to alternatives for improving incomes and production.

        Relevance of Implementation. Key issues to be addressed include a higher emphasis on
practical technical assistance in the field in addition to some higher-level individual consultants at
MAF Head Quarter (HQ) and providing more time for implementation activities and on-the-job
training of local staff. In addition, appropriate accountability mechanisms for international
technical staff, tailored to the Timor-Leste context, to improve coordination and team work as
well as monitor their performance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Project Development Objective: "To strengthen the capacity ofthe Ministry ofAgriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries and its development partners to assist rural communities in increasing
their production and income in a sustainable way n.

       The project has one single broad PDO with two dimensions: (a) MAF capacity building;
and (b) rural household production and income improvements (and their sustainability).
Unfortunately, as discussed in Section 2.3, the indicators in the Results Framework are
inadequate for quantitative assessments in support of outcome conclusions. Consequently this
assessment must rely more on qualitative judgments of outputs (see Annex 2 for output details).

(a) MAF capacity building

         Institutional strengthening of MAF. There has been considerable change in MAF
during implementation of ARP III. The Ministry made serious efforts to adjust its role as a
development agency rather than as a project implementer and thereby looking at the longer term
benefits and impact of its activities. At EOP, MAF is now fully funded by the CFET
(Consolidated Fund for East Timor) and has taken up ownership to further continue, in general,
all the components included under ARP III. Operational Divisions under MAF responsible for
implementing different components have now being made as National Directorates. A separate
Agri-business Directorate was established by MAF in June 2005 under ARP III and it is now
fully established with staff at MAF HQ and districts. Irrigation rehabilitation activities have
covered additional 'schemes such as Oatolari, and vaccination campaigns are being conducted.
Although upland fanning was not properly implemented, the concept has been adopted and is
being developed at a modest scale by the Forestry Directorate ofMAF.

       CFET funds for MAF have increased from approximately US$0.8m and US$1.5 in 2003
04 and 2004-05 respectively to around US$33m in 2009. Overall staff numbers have also

                                                 11 

increased dramatically from about 200 in 2004 to about 1,300 (about 300 permanent and about
1,000 temporary) in 2008 and in excess of 1,800 in 2009. 50 percent of these staff now work in
the districts instead of the earlier practice of locating more staff (about 70 percent) at the MAF
HQ in Dili. It is clear that in some cases such as agribusiness causality can be easily established
between the project investments and the expansion of MAF. However, not all these changes can
be attributed to the project because they are also linked to the overall growth in Timor-Leste's
public administration and increases in the GoTL budget. Moreover, not all approaches of ARP III
have been internalized by MAF in their current investments. A good example is in irrigation,
which received a significant amount of project funds. Although an inventory was compiled based
on reported areas of irrigation schemes, no effort was made to measure the different scheme
performances even though topographic surveys were reported to be completed for a number of
them. Furthermore, it is observed that priority was given (and mostly still is) to construction of
works, while improving system operation and maintenance was neglected, which will weaken
sustainability prospects.

         Still, the project was unique in its type, as it focused on MAF as a whole providing key
support simultaneously to administrative and technical areas and assisted in coordinating donor
efforts. It is recognized by MAF staff that ARP III helped coordination of the Ministry during its
rapid expansion phase and also helped improve technical capacity through on-the-job training and
financing study periods for personnel. Despite the achievements in supporting MAF, the
following two issues were identified as limiting the progress and the longer term sustainability of
the capacity building and institutional support provided under ARP III:

       as most of the programs were implemented with the guidance of high level consultants
        located in Dili, investments were made with a top down development approach. This is
        particularly clear in the irrigation sector with field staff only receiving limited technical
        exposure and interventions being made directly from MAF HQ thereby restricting their
        in-field training opportunity and capacity building. Capacity building through some in
        service short term training proved ineffective and made sustainability of the project
        investments uncertain; and

      the lack of a suitable co-ordination mechanism between the different directorates, district
       agricultural officers and field level functionaries hampered efficient implementation of
       different programs in a transparent manner. A suitable coordination and accountability
       mechanism should be instituted early for efficient functioning of the directorates.

        Training. A total of 295 Government officials received training in different areas
including long-term study periods abroad. In addition, long term advisors have provided some
capacity improvements at MAF although quality has not always been good. In some cases, as
with the agribusiness directorate, the strengthening of MAF has also benefited other development
partners that have been active in developing value chains such as GTZ and USAID.

        There has been no formal review of training quality. However, the independent reviews
of components conducted in 2008 and the mission's own direct assessments provide insights on
overall capacity at MAF for implementing ARP III activities. The conclusion is that although
some progress was achieved this was mainly in procurement and financial management, as well
as some other basic services at MAF. There are, however, still significant technical and
organizational capacity constraints that hinder MAF's ability to deliver effective services to
farmers. For example, on irrigation rehabilitation, the DIOs are still not conversant in preparation
of operation and maintenance plans for efficient delivery of irrigation services in the irrigated
command areas and there is lack of adequate resources for conducting regular visits.

                                                  12
         Moreover, on upland farming, models for different agro-climatic zones have not been
appropriately developed, tested and finalized as was intended following MTR. The main reasons
for these shortcomings include implementation problems but also the limited time frame for the
original design of the project (which resulted in less focus on quality and knowledge transfer) and
the fact that most project capacity building activities targeted MAF HQ, while on-the-job training
to field staff by advisors was insufficient. Moreover, the consultants engaged worked individually
out of headquarters and there were no middle level consultants working continually at the district
or regional levels. Finally, the disturbances during implementation led to some of the advisors
leaving, being replaced with significant delays and in some cases several times. These continuous
changes and the need for frequent adaptation to new advisors further reduced the capacity
building efforts for the field level officers of MAF.

(b) Rural household production and income improvements

        There were significant shortcomings in production activities such that project impacts on
production and income have been limited. This is analyzed below by component/sub-component.

         Natural Resource Management (Component 1). The review conducted by MAF on
the ARP II villages in December 2005 indicated that the livelihood activities undertaken through
the small grants included few technological interventions to improve productivity and gave
insufficient priority to food security issues. At MTR, the component was changed to upland
farming to address these issues but was not really implemented as the agreed upland farm models
were not developed. Instead, since February 2007, the main focus was on nurseries and planting
of high value trees. According to Component I 's independent technical review in 2008 based on a
sample of 30 percent of Small Farmers Groups (SFGs) none of the demonstration plots were
located in farming systems with the required slopes of greater than 40 percent (a third of the
sampled plots was in coastal areas). Since the models were never fully developed, the targets in
terms of farmer-households implementing conservation techniques (5,000 households) and area
of land farmed sustainably by contact farmers (500ha) were not reached. However, as mentioned
in the independent review undertaken for this component, a substantial number of tree seedlings
was produced in the period January 2007 to January 2008 with improving survival rates (see
Annex 2 for details). Of course, these do not address directly the performance indicator for
Component 1 included in the PAD, but have a significant commercial value. Their contribution is
only to be expected on the long term and there are significant doubts about their sustainability
given the type and amount of support given to farmer groups (among others, farmers lacked
training (such as in pruning, etc.) for long term maintenance of these trees and value
maximization. Finally, the investments included in the PAD economic analysis as examples of
the use of small village-based activities such as post harvest storage and fish ponds have not taken
place.

        Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management (Component 2).                  There is some
contribution of irrigation rehabilitation and management in terms of increased production and
incomes but initial targets were not fully achieved and sustainability is uncertain. Information
from the independent technical review of irrigation schemes, field discussions and other indicate
that the total number of additional hectares irrigated in the main season as a consequence of




                                                13 

project investments will not have exceeded 550 ha for Caraulun 5 and 880 ha for the other
community irrigation schemes (see Annex 2 and 3 for details on differences) 6. This is far below
PAD targets of \,030 ha and 3,000 ha respectively. Moreover, according to the irrigation survey
data collected in 2008, average yields in both Caraulun and the other schemes are below targets
of 2.0 Mtfha if weighted by production. Cropping intensity targets have been achieved for
small/medium community schemes but not for Caraulun according to the data available. Farmers
also report continuing production in upland areas and since this has not been monitored (as well
as other sources of income) it is difficult to assess impact on household income.

         Services for Farmers. Information services for improving farmers' activities seem to
have made little contribution to production and income. The pilot community based information
services were planned for operation in four districts, for which work commenced, but could not
be completed mainly because of high cost of connectivity. Although a number of printed
materials and flip charts, poster and announcements have been prepared they have not really
reached farmers. In addition there is inadequate availability of community radio facilities to the
rural farming community. However, following the recent deployment of extension staff in the
districts by MAF, the materials may now have some value. In addition, extension staff is now
providing on-farm demonstrations and direct information to farmers, namely on ICM techniques
and other. These should lead to greater knowledge of agriculture by farmers but cannot be linked
to activities under the project,

         Animal Health. Animal health services have contributed to increased production. A
total of 600,000 vaccines for cattle, 1,050,000 vaccines for pig and 4,500,000 vaccines for poultry
were procured and supplied to the farmers through 421 VLWs (386 men and 35 women) in
almost all Sucos. There are some uncertainties in terms of the quality of implementation of
vaccination campaigns given the limited reach of the cold chains (25 percent are out of order at
present and repair services have not been secured), timing and regularity of campaigns (for
example it was reported that the full complement of ND vaccines in poultry had only rarely been
provided). Unfortunately, there is no available livestock population or production data in Timor
Leste to measure accurately the achievement of the initial target. Moreover, proper causality
between vaccination and animal production can also not be established given inadequate baseline
and EOP data with proper treatment and control groups. However, the independent review
conducted in 2008 indicates that farmers report reduced disease incidence following vaccinations
although it is also reported that nutrition can also be a major explanatory factor behind animal
mortality. The VL W system adopted under the project appears not to be sustainable at present
since they are fully dependent on the project funds and farmers were not willing to pay for
services. It was mentioned in the review report that presently, VL Ws earn less than 10 percent of
their cash income from farmers. Some training was given to the VL Ws but it appeared that it was
insufficient.

        Agri-business. The establishment of the agri-business services directorate has been
successful but given the limited number of activities has, for the moment, only a marginal
contribution towards increasing production and incomes. This component was revised with better


5The 1,030 ha assumed at project appraisal for Caraulun are based on a SMEC feasibility and design study of2003. However, in 2005
when Caraulun's topographic survey was conducted, only 68Sha were identified (See Aide-Memoire for ARP Ill's Second Review
Mission dated March 2005)

6 The GoTL ICR for ARP III states 200 ha in the main season of2007 and not likely to exceed 450 ha in 2008. Discussions with
Caraulun WUA president indicate 600ha in main season and 300ha in second.



                                                               14 

focus on developing market information and assisting rural producer organizations. The Agri
business Division is now operational and carrying out a number of activities such as promotion of
Mung beans and Soya beans as second season crops and developing processes for manufacturing
including improving quality of coconut oil produced by farmers.

3.3 Efficiency


         The re-estimated ERR for the whole project is 11.7 percent, i.e., substantially bellow the
PAD estimate of 17.7 percent. The Net Present Value (NPV) using the same discount rate as the
PAD (12 percent) is negative US$269,000, compared to the positive value estimated at appraisal
(US$2.3 million). The results indicate an overall lower ERR for each of the components for
which a cost benefit analysis was conducted at ICR with the exception of livestock. The
economic returns from the project are mainly driven by the sustainable animal health services
activities of the project and to a lesser degree the community schemes rehabilitation (combined
they represent 89% of present value of project economic benefits). Although the ERR is still quite
acceptable at 11.7 percent, it is highly dependent on the estimates of benefits from livestock
(represent almost all the NPV) and therefore very sensitive to changes in assumptions for
vaccination campaign benefits. Moreover, the single largest investment of the project, the
rehabilitation of the Caraulun irrigation scheme, presents a very low ERR of 1.7 percent.

        The final ERR is lower than the PAD for the following main reasons:

       additional irrigated areas for both Community Schemes and the larger irrigation system,
        Caraulun, were far below expectations. For Community Schemes a total of 880 ha of
        additional irrigated areas were estimated at ICR versus 3,000 ha in the PAD (a 61
        percent shortfall), and for Caraulun 550 ha versus 1,030 ha included at appraisal (a 47
        percent shortfall); and
       cropping intensities and yields are also below PAD estimates based on information from
        irrigation surveys conducted in 2008 and field observations. In Caraulun, for example,
        the PAD estimated yields for the first season reaching 2.5 Mtlha after five years, while at
        ICR they are estimated at 1.9Mt. Even if the PAD estimated yields would be used from
        the first year of operation ofCaraulun, the ERR of the investments in rehabilitation
        would still be only 10.6 percent given the higher than initially expected investment costs
        per hectare (resulting from less area being irrigated vis-a.-vis initial targets).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

        The project's achievement of the development outcome needs to be put in the context of
a post-conflict situation which has negatively impacted performance, in particular through the
2006 riots and the instability up until the new Government took office. In such a situation, the
project overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory as there were significant shortcomings
towards achieving its stated objectives. Although some capacity has been improved at MAF
through training and technical assistance, most of the project activities can still not be carried out
effectively by MAF staff without further external support. Moreover, although the project still
achieved an 11.7 percent ERR, it is almost entirely dependent on estimates for benefits of
vaccination campaigns and showed very poor economic returns on its single largest infrastructure
investment. Finally, despite the relevance of the project objective, several elements of its design

                                                 15 

and implementation modalities do not seem to be fully appropriate to Timor-Leste's current
development context.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

         The estimated number of beneficiaries for the project (see Annex 10) indicate that the
project benefited only around 66,000 households (including overlap), i.e. 30 percent of the project
target. This is due to implementation problems for some components as already discussed, but
also because the original design expected the project to reach a vast number of rural households,
which was over-ambitious given local resources and constraints. The main project achievement
has been through the vaccination campaigns and their impact on reduced mortality of animals.
However, the main short term benefits in terms of poverty reduction for a single household would
result from the rehabilitation of irrigated infrastructure, which, as discussed previously, achieved
much less than initially expected. Assuming an average land size of 1 ha per household in
irrigated areas, it is estimated that only 1,430 households benefited of the 4,000 originally
targeted (a shortfall of 64 percent). In addition, a further 880 households are estimated to benefit
from improved water delivery for irrigation purposes. The project also did not have any explicit
poverty targeting approach, while household surveys indicate that the poorest and more food
insecure are located in the uplands, where ARP III only had modest interventions (in particular,
because of the implementation issues with Component 1). Finally, ARP III generated some local
temporary employment through labor for the irrigation rehabilitation works.

         Gender targets under natural resource management were supposed to be achieved through
quotas for village facilitators (at least 50 percent) and criteria for farmer group beneficiaries (at
least half of the grants were supposed to be directed to groups of only by women or to mixed
groups). Under irrigation activities 20 percent of members ofWUAs were supposed to be women.
Overall, despite the lack of information on gender from the project M&E system, it is probable
that none of these targets were achieved. In NRM activities women were expected to be 30
percent of beneficiaries, while the NRM . technical review found that 33 percent of members
were female indicating that target was achieved. On WUA activities field discussions suggest the
target of 20 percent female membership was not achieved. Shortfalls on gender impact are
attributable in part to lack of a carefully designed strategy to achieve such ambitious targets.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

        Discussed above in Section 3.2

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

        The project support to MAP's procurement and financial management capacity has
allowed MAF to execute a much larger budget. However, thi~ was not necessarily complemented
by sufficient technical knowledge transfer to deliver quality outputs resulting in potentially poor
spending quality. Also, the project may have indirectly supported the recent policy focus of MAF
on irrigation system rehabilitation. There are significant concerns on the suitability of such
investments given their difficult maintenance linked to the type of systems available, lack of
technical capacity at MAF for design and monitoring of construction works and early
development stage of WUAs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

        None were conducted although methodologies had been discussed during the initial
supervision missions of the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

        Three main risks to outcome have been identified that justifY a significant risk rating: (a)
technical design and construction quality of irrigation schemes rehabilitated, under-development
of WUA and consequent poor Operation and maintenance (O&M) of schemes; (b) potential for
further political and civil disruptions in a post-conflict situation; and (c) technical and funding
capacity ofMAF to continue activities started under ARP III.

         Several of the irrigation schemes rehabilitated by the project are based on an open water
intake, which due to the characteristics ofTimorese rivers makes them particularly vulnerable to
significant and regular sedimentation of canals and eventual major destruction of infrastructure.
In addition, the lack of experienced staff at MAF for supervision of works has led to poor
construction quality as indicated above. Finally, WUAs are mostly conducting minor
maintenance and generally there are major expectations of Government support on maintenance
work. The latter is sometimes difficult given limited human and equipment resources. As an
example, in Caraulun, for the removal of sedimentation of the main canal MAF had to request
heavy equipment from the Ministry of Public Works7.

         Despite the positive Government ownership of project activities, the present transition
from conflict to development still poses significant risks to most of the project's development
outcomes. As an example, during the riots in 2006 several project records were lost and
infrastructure and equipment destroyed. Moreover, the country's very young population and
pervasive unemployment and poverty are important risk factors. Finally, uncertainties on
Government budget given the dependence on oil revenues also raise questions as to the ability of
MAF to continue supporting some of the activities of ARP III such as livestock vaccination
campaigns.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

         The overall project objectives were well identified as they were relevant at design and are
still today. However, as noted in Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 3.1, the project showed several areas of
weakness already at entry, in particular for a country with weak institutional capacity: (a) weakly
specified and missing performance indicators; (b) lack of dedicated resources for M&E; (c)
overly ambitious targets and complexity of project activities; (d) not providing adequately for



7 As a further example, during field observations, the ICR team noticed several bolts missing from the control gate for the main canal
in Caraulun, which if not substituted can lead to the system being non-operational in the short term,



                                                                  17
knowledge transfer especially at district level; (e) lack of focus on rainfed agriculture, where the
poorest are found, and which constitutes an important part of farmers' livelihoods (as
acknowledged in the lessons learnt section of the PAD but not reflected in the project's design);
(t) absence of specific activities to maximize agricultural production in combination with
irrigation scheme rehabilitation; (g) highly ambitious focus on technology (namely the Internet)
for supplying information to farmers; and (h) absence of proper governance structure and
accountability mechanism for international consultants to ensure coordination and efficient
service delivery. Possibly the project was prepared too rapidly as demonstrated by the fact that
the ICR for ARP II was only finalized when ARP III was already being implemented. In
particular, the ICR for ARP II indicated some of the problems with efficiency of investments in
irrigation rehabilitation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

         Project implementation suffered from several complications as discussed above (Section
2.2) and the situation was particularly challenging just after the MTR when civil disruptions
caused several international consultants to leave, project documentation to be lost and activities to
stop. Just following that, a new government in 2007 took some time to start effective project
implementation once more. All these events naturally made supervision more demanding since
MTR adjustments took time to be implemented and also information from the project was not
readily available to inform decisions.

         The supervision work could have been more proactive in addressing some of the key
design weaknesses of the project and lack of performance of individual activities. Given the
important investments in irrigation there was lack of supervision by a specialist irrigation
engineer during project implementation to properly assess quality of works, operation and
benefits of the schemes. Moreover, at MTR, the main changes introduced to the project were
mainly to component one while there were signs that the other components would require more
restructuring. For example more funds could have been allocated to M&E and to activities
seeking to raise agricultural productivity in the irrigation schemes. There could also have been a
more thorough revision of targets at MTR given that some were difficult to achieve to begin with.
For example, according to the second supervision mission aide-memoire in 2005, the potential
irrigated area for Caraulun was of only 685 ha (the project target of 1,030 ha remained unchanged
until EOP). Finally, steps could have been taken to address the issue of accountability of
international consultants and improve their performance. Overall it was very challenging to
provide sufficient supervision support in such a difficult situation without a local or international
Bank staff being physically present in the country.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

         Despite a relevant objective in the country context, the Bank did not tailor the project
appropriately to Timor-Leste's situation through a complex design with significant shortcomings.
Moreover, supervision without a local presence was not able to proactively address the
implementation problems and provide extra monitoring of key technical assistance services to the
project team. Hence, a moderately unsatisfactory rating is justified.




                                                 18 

5.2 Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

         The implementing agency was Government through MAF and the project did not follow
a project implementation unit approach. MAF was committed to the project throughout
preparation and implementation even with a change in Government. However, despite
considerable efforts MAF's performance during implementation had significant shortcomings.
There was lack of attention to following up on studies and reports produced through project
activities; the M&E unit's staffing issue was never properly addressed; as identified during the
last project supervision mission, there were significant problems with the data presented in
progress reports (such as on areas irrigated), which despite independent technical reviews were
never corrected; cooperation between directorates was often ineffective. An example of the last
point is the lack of involvement of the crops division in project activities. Finally, in Component
1 activities, the constant changes to the implementation approach led to most activities agreed at
MTR not being implemented.


6. Lessons Learned


    1.  M&E system needs to receive proper resources and be adequately designed. For
        proper monitoring of project progress and to take corrective measures during
        implementation, a proper M&E system should be designed and instituted at the earliest,
        especially for less-than-ideal conditions for implementation. In particular, more technical
        assistance and regular independent technical reviews are required from the start, given
        difficulties in systematically gathering and analyzing data.

    2.  Project output and impact targets should be made clear, simple and realistic. For
        such conditions as Timor-Leste, it is necessary to pilot-test new initiatives before
        implementing them nationwide in order to strike a balance between achievement of
        outputs and knowledge transfer. Although output targets are important instruments to
        produce more effective capacity building they should be limited, not to undermine the
        main objective of investments. In addition, indicators need to be simple and consistent to
        facilitate M&E implementation. It is important to use indicators that are simple and easy
        collectable, not requiring expensive, time consuming and large surveys. The use of
        qualitative data collection methods needs to be considered (e.g., case studies, focus group
        discussions; participatory tools, etc.).

    3.  Further major investments in irrigation system rehabilitation should be based on
        careful analysis of alternative options for improving rural household income levels.
        The economic analysis of ARP III for this ICRR (in line with results from the ARP II
        ICR) highlights that irrigation rehabilitation of large schemes may be too costly given the
        number of beneficiaries and potential income increases. This is compounded by the
        technical and resource constraints at MAF (to design, supervise construction and help
        support WUAs to adequately manage the systems) and the specificities of Timorese river
        systems. Other alternatives, such as seeking to improve productivity of rainfed systems
        may yield higher returns and poverty impact-given the structure of rural poverty in
        Timor-Leste and the key constraints to the country's rural development (this was one of
        the lessons that ARP III highlighted at appraisal, but which was not properly incorporated
        in the project design).

                                                19
    4.  Greater linkage between crop production activities and irrigation investments is
        required. When one ofthe major impacts of the project is to increase rice yields in
        irrigated areas, activities related to crop production should have been included under
        ARP III. Along with water, other inputs such as improved seeds, as well as introduction
        of an improved package of practices for irrigated agriculture, are necessary for increasing
        crop yields.

    5.  It is desirable to consolidate investments in irrigation before new construction takes
        place, in particular of larger schemes. It is important at this stage to focus on irrigation
        system maintenance and management rather than new construction given current capacity
        constraints. For accruing optimal benefits from rehabilitated irrigation schemes, attention
        should be given to the irrigation canal network designs including establishing equity in
        water service delivery over the entire command area with the help of topographical
        surveys and ensuring timely maintenance ofthe scheme. Given the current situation of
        dependence from GoTL support and lack of knowledge such a process will take time and
        require substantial capacity building efforts and work with WUAs and DIOs.

    6.  A fully integrated implementation arrangement has advantages in terms of
        Government commitment, but a new approach is necessary to capacity building and
        technical assistance supervision (accountability, coordination and field presence).
        More stress should be given to capacity building of field level officers whose capacity is
        very low. For future investments, it would be appropriate, both technically and from a
        cost-efficiency point of view, to appoint middle level consultants at the district level (to
        ensure on the job training ofthe field level officers) along with the high level consultants
        at the MAF HQ. Given the low technical capacity at MAF to supervise consultants, an
        appropriate accountability mechanism for consultants should be developed to ensure
        good performance. There are several options for improving accountability such as
        changing the content of consultancy contracts to make them performance dependent
        (performance may be measured by periodic independent technical reviews - to
        complement supervision work) and considering implementation partners (such as aid
        agencies with implementation capability) for some technical assistance investments (the
        advantage being that they already have an internal accountability structure).

    7.  Supervision by donors in such post-conflict situations may require more regular
        visits and optimaJly a field presence. The difficulties in obtaining reliable information
        and the constantly changing environment make it difficult to conduct supervision in a
        traditional way. A closer monitoring of project activities and impact with constant
        dialogue with Government through a field presence should be considered. Sufficient
        supervision resources for providing this level of support will be paramount.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Implementing Agency/Partner

(a) Implementing Agency

         Capacity of MAF. While the ICRR focuses on reflecting the aspects regarding design
and supervision, it also tries to highlight the aspects that went well and merit continuation. It is
very clear that the capacity of MAF since the start of the ARP has improved and the capacity and
staffing number has grown significantly. However, as the ICRR tries to highlight, now that MAF
is focusing on addressing core issues identified in the ICRR and by other means, it is important


                                                20 

not to repeat mistakes undertaken in the past. Careful planning and adequate training at all levels
will be important to continue building the capacity within MAF in order to be able to deliver the
required services.

         Upgrading of Rating and Perceived Criticism. The objective of the ICRR is to
improve the quality and effectiveness of Bank financed operations and enhancing the recipient's
ability to design, implement and operate projects. The report clearly outlines the complete project
cycle of ARP III and highlights its shortcomings at design stage and during implementation, both
from the recipient's side and the Bank's side. The findings are well grounded and there is no
substantial evidence contrary to the conclusion that the project was Moderately Unsatisfactory,
these ratings will not be able to be changed. The fact that MAF is already addressing some of the
main concerns raised in the last supervisions and in the ICRR are a clear and very positive sign
that the findings are taken seriously. It is very important that this takes place and that the lessons
learned are incorporated into future operations in Timor-Leste and in other similar environments.
The fact that the project is rated as being Moderately Unsatisfactory should not be taken as a
criticism, but a vehicle for learning and improving future activities.

        Integration of ARP flI Activities. It was a requirement under ARP III that activities
being implemented under the project would, to the extent possible, be integrated into the daily
operations ofMAF after the closure of the project. It is welcomed to receive reassurance that this
has been done and that it will be pursued in future.

(b) Cofinanciers

        Lack of Information in the ICRR. The guidelines for the preparation of the ICRR are
specific in outlining the content and detail of the reports. More technical and financial detail
about specific aspects of the project should have been covered in the component completion
reports and in the recipient's completion report. The Annexes to the ICRR try to highlight as
much specific data as possible and available to the ICRR team. Particularly Annex 2 and 3
(outputs and economic analysis) provide several details that are mentioned in the comments
raised. There is full agreement with the provided comments regarding the need for collecting the
required information during project implementation for being able to adequately assess the
impacts of the project. This aspect is highlighted in the ICRR and is one of the factors for the
overall Moderately Unsatisfactory rating. There is need in the design and implementation of
future operations for correcting issues in accountability of technical assistance and also on
supervision, given specific problems of fragile states.

        Caraulun Irrigation Scheme. As the ICRR highlights in several sections, the comments
and concerns raised on the Caraulun irrigation scheme are recognized and therefore highlighted
as such in the report. The discussion on the actual design of the irrigation scheme was agreed
upon during the preparation phase of the project and the Bank's ICRRs do not specifically review
technical design specifications or suitability. This would be a completely different task requiring
a set of studies that cannot be included in the normal ICRR. However, regardless of whether
there were design problems or not, the crucial aspects of maintenance and operation have not
been adequately addressed during project implementation (see Annex 2 and 3 for some additional
information on this aspect), this being probably the major problem in Caraulun, as the ICRR
concludes. Annex 3 provides some detailed information regarding cropping intensity in irrigation
schemes, all based on the scarce information that was available at the time of the ICRR mission in
March/April 2009. Converting the figures in the Annexes, production for Caraulun was around
1,100 Mt of paddy in first season and almost 300Mt in second. Regarding the mechanisms of land
preparation most is non mechanized, but this aspect was never directly linked to the project 

                                                 21 

which could have been considered. MAF is currently heavily subsidizing mechanization
including fuel costs, at least for the first year.

        Training Modalities and Animal Health Services. The adaptation of training
modalities and training material, as well as the support provided to WUAs was one of the weakest
aspects in the project and it is something that needs to be addressed to avoid perpetuation of
mistakes (see Lessons Learnt). This is another factor contributing towards the overall Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating. The findings of the IeRR are that vaccination campaigns seem to have
been implemented satisfactorily, although a visit to the enclave of Oecussi was not possible. It is
in general understood that the situation in Oecussi is different from the rest of the country and
therefore findings from there are likely not representative for the rest of Timor-Leste. It is also
not possible to provide more concrete feedback as the question is not clear on what specific
animal services the reports from Oecussi refer to, when the studies were carried out, who and how
they were carried out and how representative these results are even in Oecussi itself. Overall,
given overall lack of technical capacity of current public veterinary services, the quality of animal
heals services are not very good in the country and particularly if compared to other countries.

         General Remarks. It is important to highlight that the World Bank does not implement
and design projects. This is the responsibility of the respective recipients. The responsibility of
the Bank lies in supervising the use of resources and to: (a) monitor progress in all substantive
aspects of the project against the targets, development objectives, and performance monitoring
indicators; (b) monitor procurement implementation and disbursement; (c) review the interim and
annual audited statements and other project progress reports submitted by the recipient; (d)
ascertain the extent of compliance with loan covenants; (e) assess risks to successful
implementation, operation, and sustainability of the project; and (f) review the continued
relevance of the project to borrower and Bank priorities.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1. Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management (US$l.l
million)

        Objectives. To promote improved self-reliance and natural resources management and
strengthen upland and coastal communities' resilience and make them less vulnerable to external
shocks (such as periodic droughts and chronic food insecurity).

        Activities. The project financed small group grants, services, training for farmer groups,
MAF staff, facilitators, and partner NGOs, workshops and cross visits, vehicles, office equipment,
and incremental operating costs in support of the following activities:

      continuing technical and facilitation support to 30 pilot villages initiated during ARP II;
       and
      expansion to about 20 new villages, including provision of grants to small groups of
       farmers.

        Outputs. The following are the output indicators identified in the PAD:

      30 pilot villages and 20 new upland and coastal villages fully assisted; at least 50 percent
       of community proposals involving women;
      at least 200 community groups assisted by end of project; 30 percent women's groups;
       and
      at least 3,000 farmers directly trained in NRM activities.

        At Mid-term Review (MTR), 29 out of the 50 villages were reported to have received
assistance and around 3,000 farmers were reportedly implementing conservation techniques
(MTR report). However, given issues linked to improved productivity, priority to food security
and natural resource management, the component was substantially revised to focus on:

     better alignment with the vision for the agricultural sector as set down in the National
      Development Plan;
     more consistency with MAF's own strategy of addressing food security and improving
      the productivity of upland and dry farming system; and
     better integration of management of the program into MAF's institutional structure.

        Accordingly, the following revised output indicators were determined at the MTR:

 (i)  No. of villages assisted: 29 ARP II villages and 17 villages for upland farming program
        (UFP);
 (ii)  No. of upland farming models developed: 6;
 (iii)  No. ofMAF staff trained in upland farming techniques: 22;
 (iv)  No. of facilitators trained in upland farming techniques: 12;
 (v)  No. of farmer-households implementing conservation techniques: 5,000;
 (vi)  Area of land farmed sustainably by contact farmers by EOP: 500 ha; and
 (vii)  National conference on upland farming: I.

                                                24
              Achievement of outputs:

            According to the upland fanning review conducted in late 2008, most revised output
    targets were not achieved. This is mainly because the upland fanning models were never
    developed and therefore demonstrations could not take place as planned. The lack of achievement
    was linked to frequent changes of the main advisor to the component which led to different
    methodologies being followed, which were not in line with the upland fanning program agreed at
    MTR. Other issues were:

       (i)  grant money to villages changed from US$I ,000 per SFG to US$200 per SFG without
              any recorded basis for the decision; 

       (ji) implementation manual never followed; 

       (iii)  although called upland fanning program after MTR, a study of 32 SFGs showed that out
              ofthis 10 were coastal villages and 22 were villages with slopes varying between 20-40
              percent and none were in the desired range of 40-60 percent.

             Since February 2007, the main focus was on nurseries and planting of high value trees
    (which was not part of the MTR design as indicated above and rather followed the new
    international advisor's own ideas). According to Component 1's independent technical review in
    2008, the number of seedlings produced in January 2007, November 2007 and January 2008 were
    substantial respectively around 168,000; 79,000; and 87,000 and survival rates of these plants
    improved with time (respectively 55 percent; 85 percent; and 94 percent).

Component 2. Irrieation Rehabilitation and Management (US$3.9 million)

        Objectives. To support MAFF's main assistance program to farmers                 III   lowland
irrigated areas, based on procedures developed during ARP I and ARP II.

        Activities. The project financed civil works, construction supervision, services, training,
cross visits, farming inputs, office equipment, vehicles, and incremental operating costs in
support of:

          community rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes and rural access roads;
          rehabilitation of the Caraulun irrigation scheme in Manufahi district;
          support to Water User Associations (WUAs) and capacity building of MAFF staff; and
          survey and mapping of selected irrigation schemes.

           Outputs. The following are the output indicators identified in the PAD:

  (i)      3,000 ha of irrigated area rehabilitated by communities;
  (ii)     150 km of existing farm-to-market roads rehabilitated by communities;
  (iii)    1,030 ha of major-damaged irrigation scheme rehabilitated; and
  (iv)     14 new Water User Associations (WUAs) established (including a network of WUAs in
           major-damaged scheme), and 10 existing WUAs provided with advisory services and
           further training (inclusive women).

       During the MTR, the following changes were made in the outputs (no changes were
made to the first three outputs):

  (i)  No. WUAs assisted established and functioning: 23; and
  (ii)  area surveyed and mapped: 8,500 ha.

Achievement of Outputs:

         3,000 ha of irrigated area rehabilitated by communities. Estimation of benefits from
irrigation rehabilitation is difficult as there was no baseline data for the area was irrigated before
rehabilitation or after rehabilitation of the schemes under ARP III. Data collection, monitoring
and evaluation of the program was very weak in the Irrigation National Directorate. Though
topographic surveys have been reported to have been completed for many schemes, no effort has
been made to use these maps for assessing actual irrigated areas and/or for better system designs
to ensure equitable distribution of water over entire command areas. The actual achievements
from this sub-component will be much lower than the 3,570 ha reported in the GoTL last six
monthly report (July-Dec. 2008). The impact and sustainability of this sub-component is also
well illustrated by the comments made in the ICR submitted by GoTL (page 27, 29), which state
that total land use and cropping intensities in the community irrigation schemes are well below
the values that were expected according to the originally provided information (about the
respective irrigable areas of these schemes). At the end of November 2008, information on 20 of
the 24 community irrigation schemes rehabilitated by ARP III indicated that seven of the 20
schemes were presently not functioning or only partially functioning. Overall just around 1,800
ha of irrigated area can be judged as having benefited from rehabilitation of Community schemes.
This is a much lower figure than the figure quoted in the six monthly report of GoTL for the
period July-Dec. 2008. In addition, of the 1,800 ha a large share of land is not newly irrigated but
will benefit from better water delivery. By analyzing the data from M&E (including the type of


                                                 26 

works conducted), the report from the technical review of irrigation schemes and using field
observations, the ICR team estimates that around half or 880ha will be newly irrigated land.
Further, although some benefits have been accrued by the farmers from rehabilitated schemes, as
maintenance of the systems by the farmers is inadequate, clear signs of deferred maintenance are
already visible, and since there is no O&M fund being provided by the GoTL sustainability of the
investment under this sub-component is also unlikely.

        ISO km of existing farm-to-market roads rebabilitated by communities. There is no
data available on actual length of the roads rehabilitated, expected number of beneficiaries and
how they have benefited. Although it has been claimed that 150 km of roads have been completed
(according to the six monthly report for the period of July to December 2008 produced by GoTL),
the ICR document prepared by GoTL suggests that information is available for only 16 of the 24
roads built under the project, and these 16 roads have a total length of 87 km (page 28).
Sustainability of these roads is unlikely as these roads were built by hand compaction and there is
already considerable erosion of road surface noticed during field visits. There is also no
provision ofO&M for these roads.

         1,030 ba of major-damaged irrigation scbeme rebabilitated. The actual achievement
reported in the six monthly report of GoTL (July-December 2008) is 550 ha against a target of
 1,030 ha, or 53 percent. The GoTL ICR for ARP III mentions 450ha [part II, p. 27] and at the
time of the topographical survey in 2005 around 685ha were identified (see Aide-Memoire of the
second supervision mission of ARP III in 2005). From discussions with farmers, WUA members,
the mo, the irrigated area during the second season would at best reach 200 ha. The data
collected by the household survey of Caraulun (in the second half of 2008) also suggests a similar
figure. In this scheme there are also clear signs of deferred maintenance. Although in a
Ministerial order dated August 1, 2005, MAF has committed to be responsible for the O&M of all
the structures as well as the main canal for a maximum length of 2.3 km (from the intake) for a
maximum period of 5 years, nothing appears to have been in this respect. During the field visits
by the ICR team at the intake, a number of bolts from a vital structure were missing and this for
quite some time (and are yet to be replaced). Similarly, on completion of the rehabilitation works,
even though the WUA is to operate and maintain the entire irrigation network beyond 2.3 km of
the main canal, the WUA is mainly involved in the maintenance works on the river bed to direct
water to the intake structure and even silt clearance from the tertiary canals is not being done by
them. The sustainability of investment for this sub-component is also uncertain.

        23 WUAs assisted establisbed and functioning. It has been reported that all 23 WUAs
have been assisted established and functioning. However, in reality, these are only a group of
farmers and are yet to be formed as institutions. Sustainability of WUAs requires includes
several dimensions of their operations namely, institutionally, technically and financially.
Presently, these WUAs are not having any legal entity and even though the WUA constitution
and By-Laws were to be finalized under ARP III, this did not take place. The draft prepared was
never finalized and approved by GoTL. It was reported, that all the activities of the WUAs are
being carried out verbally and the mission could not see any records in any of the schemes visited
(including Caraulun scheme) where the decisions taken by the management committee of the
WUAs are being properly recorded. The basic purpose of involving communities in sharing
O&M costs (in order to ensure sustainability ofthe investment) did not materialize. Finally, since
many of the WUAs were formed after the rehabilitation works were completed, they had no
incentive to abide by the O&M agreement expected from them.

       Area Surveyed and Mapped-8,SOO ba. It has been reported that topographical surveys
and mapping were completed for the targeted area in 2007. It was envisaged that these surveys

                                               27 

and maps produced for different schemes to be rehabilitated under ARP III would provide
detailed and accurate plans to facilitate the utilization and effective operation by WUAs of the
systems. These would also help in determining the command area of the schemes and their actual
irrigated areas in different seasons. Unfortunately, these maps were never utilized for any of the
practical uses as stated above.

Component 3. Services to Farmers (US$4.0 million)

        Overall Objective. The component would "help institutionalize three basic MAFF
services to farmers: Information, Animal Health, and Agri-Business support".

Sub-Component 3.1: Information to Farmers

         This sub-component would increase MAF's capacity to provide information to farmers
(targeting most of the 450,000 people with radio access), and foster two-way communication with
rural areas. The following were the outputs identified in the PAD:

      about 40 pre-tested information materials provided to communities through different
       media;
      at least 10 cross-visits between CGIAR scientists and MAF to provide advisory services
       and information support;
      at least 3 regional centers connected electronically and functional up to EOP; and
      At least 10 meteorological stations, 20 rain gauges and 4 hydro-stations established and
       functional by EOP.

        At MTR, MAF's decided (as part of its reorganization) to decentralize extension
responsibilities to individual Directorates and rename the Directorate of Research and Extension,
the Directorate of Research. Pursuant to this decision, the information team implementing the
Sub-Component was named the Extension Support Team. Information Services is now a
department of the National Directorate for Support to the Development of Agricultural
Communities (NDSDAC). Overall at MTR very little had been achieved on the activities
envisaged and no progress was made on the planned community based information network. The
PIP was revised and also the expected outputs. The revised outputs at MTR were:

      40 sets information materials pre-tested and provided to communities;
      15 regional centers connected electronically and functional; and
      11 additional agro-meteorological stations established (4 stations established at MTR).

Achievement of Outputs:

     36 information materials were prepared out of the target of 40. However, information
      materials thus produced did not reach the target group due to non availability of radio
      accessibility to many of the rural farmers. According to field visits materials seem to
      have been mostly "supply driven" rather than focusing on farmer demands. However,
      these materials may now be useful to the extension staff located in the District
      Agricultural Offices for onward communication to the rural farming community;
     proposal for electronic connectivity of regional centers with MAF HQ did not materialize
      reportedly because of the high costs involved; and




                                               28
      altogether 17 agro-meteorological stations have been established against a target of 15.
       However, data collection has not been timely from these stations and is not being
       processed and made useful for decision making by MAF.

Sub-Component 3.2: Sustainable Animal Health Services

        The activities would target the estimated 567,000 rural people living in households which
own livestock, a major determinant of rural incomes. This component was implemented under
the Livestock Division, now being called the National Directorate for Livestock and Veterinary
Services (NDL VS). The following were the outputs identified in the PAD:

      at least 80 percent of the adult cattle, buffaloes and pigs vaccinated on a timely manner;
      265 Village Livestock Workers trained (including women) and 70 percent actively
       providing services to villages; and
      National VLW Association established and organizationally functional up to EOP.

        During the MTR, only the following output indicators were identified:

      proportion of cattle, buffaloes and pigs vaccinated: 80 percent;
      285 VLWs trained.

Achievement of Outputs:

      as reported in the review conducted in October 2008, the numbers of vaccine purchased
       under ARP III for cattle (including buffaloes) and pigs was respectively 600,000 and
       1,050,000. However, because oflack of national data on animal populations it is not
       possible to confirm directly the number of animals actually covered. As there is no
       baseline data, and the 2004 national census was not successful in collecting reliable
       numbers for livestock (as reported by the consultant) it is not possible to indicate the
       proportions of cattle, buffaloes and pigs vaccinated against the total population; and
      against the target of 285 VLWs to be trained, a total number of 421 VL Ws were trained
       including 35 women, almost 1 VLW for every Suko. However, the numbers are being
       reduced severely without any replacement (about 30 percent leaving for Government
       salaried posts and about another 15 percent are only partially active as they live in other
       Sukos).

Sub-Component 3.3: Support to Agri-business

        It was expected to strengthen MAF's advisory services to rural producer organizations, as
well as help promote key niche markets targeting some 1,200 to 1,500 grain seed growers (mostly
rice and maize), and about 210 farming families involved in niche market commodities (such as
candlenut and coconut oil production). This component was implemented by the newly created
agri-business directorate. The following were the output targets of this sub-component under the
PAD:

       seed grower's Association organized and functional up to EOP;
       30 ha. of seed farm established;
       12 village processing facilities established and functional by EOP; and
       MAFF agri-business unit established and operational by EOP.


                                                29
        At MTR this component was split into two sUb-components namely:

       Component 3.3: Agri-business services; and
       Component 3.4: Seed Services.

        The following were the revised Outputs identified for Components 3.3 and 3.4 at MTR:

Component 3.3: Agri-business services:

       MAF Agribusiness unit established and operational

Achievement of Output:

        MAF agri-business unit is established and operational.

Sub-Component 3.4: Seed Services:

       30 ha seed farm established; and
       seed multiplication groups established.

Achievement of Output:

        It has been reported in the six monthly report of the GoTL (July-December 2008) that 15
ha of seed farms were established against a target of 30ha. It has been further reported in the ICR
by GoTL of a decision to make Seeds of Life project (SOL) take the leadership in this activity
and further support for seed producers from ARP III was cancelled.

Component 4: Program Management (US$4.0 million)

Overall Objectives. The overall objective was to help MAF manage the project, continue to
develop key national policies, and strengthen the Ministry's managerial and technical capacity.

Sub-Component 4.1. Policy and strate~ development

         This would fund high level advisors and consultative workshops to help MAF develop
priority sector and institutional policies and strategies. These were expected to include an exit
strategy for the ARP program. The output targets included in the PAD were that four agriculture
policy studies/advisory services completed, discussed with key stakeholders, and accepted by
MAF. During MTR this was revised to 7 studies to be completed, discussed and accepted by
MAF.

Achievement of Output:

         As per the last Bank Supervision mission the target with regard to the preparation of 7
agriculture policy/ advisory studies was duly completed. However, discussions with MAF staff
and donors seem to indicate that the studies were little used.




                                                  30 

Sub-Component 4.2: Project Management and Capacity Building

        This component financed technical assistance, office, computer equipment and
furnishings, workshops training, study tours, and incremental operating costs. The following were
the output targets included in the PAD.

       advisory support to project management, finance, and procurement provided; and
       100 person-days of training provided to MAFF staff and partners (including women).

        During MTR the first output target was deleted. At MTR it was reported that 1,976
person-days of training had already been provided to MAF staff and partners. It was clarified in
the MTR report that the MTR target related to the Long Term Capacity Building Program.

Achievement of Output:

        It was reported that by end December 2006 this target was greatly exceeded to almost
2,000 person-days. It was reported in the GoTL ICR that they faced practical difficulties with
using this output indicator as no distinction was made between group and individual training and
no quality assessment could be made.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


A.       Project benefits and expected returns in the PAD

        The PAD economic analysis focused on quantifying benefits from the different project
components using separate methodologies and then aggregating the different streams of benefits
and costs to estimate an overall economic rate of return for the project. Thus benefits were
calculated for NRM, irrigation rehabilitation, information to farmers, livestock and agribusiness.
The PAD assumed there was little evidence to suggest that economic prices should be different
from financial ones. In particular, a wage rate of US$I per day was used for labor costs and no
financial analysis was conducted. Finally, the project economic costs in the PAD were assumed to
total US$9.6 million (89 percent of total base costs before price contingencies).

        The main economic benefits from the project were expected in irrigation and livestock,
which represented respectively 42 percent and 46 percent of the total present value of project
economic benefits8 For irrigation, benefits resulted from additional irrigated areas: (a) 1,030 ha
from one large irrigation scheme (Caraulun); and (b) 3,000 ha from smaller community irrigation
schemes. The main assumptions as per the PAD are summarized in Table I below and resulted in
an ERR of 20.3 percent for Caraulun (sensitivity indicated the ERR would drop to 8.1 percent if
only one crop was achieved and yields would stay at 1.9Mtlha9 ) and an ERR of 47 percent for
community schemes. The calculation of economic costs and benefits for community schemes also
includes the impact of road rehabilitation (as they were combined in the same project sub
component). However, the PAD assumes an annual O&M cost for each road equal to the annual
economic benefits lO resulting in a highly negative contribution of roads to the economic returns of
community irrigation. Separating the roads from the community irrigation, the ERR for
community schemes as per the PAD jumps from 47 percent to 176 percent.

        Regarding livestock, economic benefits were calculated from savings on the economic
value of animals (weight and breeding potential) from reduced mortality through project financed
vaccination campaigns. In addition, benefits were calculated based on parameters from Indonesia
on the probability of outbreaks of the main diseases for which vaccination was to be provided,
technical data on effectiveness of vaccines and number of animals vaccinated. The main
assumptions for benefit calculations in the PAD are summarized in Table 2 below. In the base
case scenario, an ERR of234 percent was calculated over twenty years.

         The PAD also included economic benefits from NRM, which were based on the small
village grants yielding an ERR of 15 percent over ten years (US$200,OOO of grants in total). The
ERR of 15 percent was assumed based on the experience of other projects financed in Timor
Leste conducting similar support to villages (reported ERRs ranged between -250 percent and
+151 percent). The economic analysis of information to farmers was conducted through a cost
efficiency approach based on the difference in costs from using radio and other media to reach
farmers versus the operating costs of extension staff working directly with farmers. In addition,
cost efficiency was also applied to the savings from using community based information services
(with links with the CGIAR network) to supply information to extension staff versus extension
staff obtaining information through travelling to headquarters. ERRs estimated over a ten year
period were 17 percent for the mass media campaigns and 22 percent for the information network.
Agri-business economic benefits were estimated assuming a 20 percent ERR over ten years
through the support of the existing Agriculture Service Centers (ASC). The component economic
benefits indicated in this paragraph only accounted for 12 percent of the present value of the
project's total.

B.       ICR Estimation Methodology

         Estimation of costs and benefits for the ICR followed a similar approach to that of the
PAD to the extent possible. The main problems with re-assessing the economic impact of the
project resulted from the unsatisfactory performance of the M&E activities as explained in
Sections 2.3 and 3.2. There is a lack of reliable project records and details on amounts disbursed
by component and activity. Moreover, the project's impact evaluation did not include benchmarks
against which to measure achievements. The baseline survey for ARP III was conducted
simultaneously with the impact assessment of ARP IIll and data gathered were not appropriate
for evaluating impact. During the last year of implementation, technical reviews by independent
specialists were conducted on the main components of the project and valuable information was

gathered upon which most of the ICR economic analysis is based. Also, irrigation surveys for
Caraulun and six other community irrigation schemes were conducted in 2008, which provided
valuable information for the ICR cost benefit analysis. The ICR also takes into consideration the
actual implementation of some of the components, which was markedly different from what was
assumed in the PAD (see Sections 2.2 and 3.2 for details). The lack of meaningful outcomes from
project activities led to the exclusion of economic benefits from Information to Farmers and
Agribusiness Support. Moreover, the economic analysis for Participatory Development and NRM
focused on the economic value of forest trees planted instead of using the PAD indicative models
for community activities.

Irrigation Rehabilitation

        Expected benefits from irrigation were calculated based on yields, cropping pattern,
cropping intensity and O&M costs details obtained from the irrigation surveys for Caraulun and
six community schemes. For Caraulun, a random sample of households proportional to the
different main sections of the system was taken totaling 144 farmer households or around 25
percent of the total. The six community schemes were chosen in different districts of the country
and covered almost all the households in each system for a total combined sample of 209 farmer
households. In addition, information was triangulated with field observations and interviews with
farmers in four districts including five irrigation community irrigation schemes and Caraulun.

        Historical (since 2004) and future economic prices (based on WB commodity price
projections) for paddy, maize and major inputs were derived from international prices and
analysis was conducted in constant 2009 prices using the MUV index as deflator. The economic
prices were annual average derived prices weighted by the number of hectares estimated to
benefit each year. Financial prices were collected locally. For wages, a financial rate of US$L5
per person-day was used for family labor and of US$2.7 for hired labor (in line with field
observations). The shadow wage rate was set at US$L5 per person-day for both hired and family
labor. The latter was based on field discussions and is also supported by information of the latest
TLSLSI2, which estimates the average value of monthly consumption in rural areas at around 30
US$, indicating roughly US$I.5 per day if one considers 20 days worked.

         Total additional area irrigated was calculated based on the technical review of irrigation
schemes conducted in late 2008, discussions with irrigation officers and field visits. According to
project records (from the surveys of the different irrigation schemes conducted prior to
rehabilitation) the total design area of the community irrigation schemes was of around 6,200 ha
of which 2,000 ha were functioning. The expected total additional area would therefore be of
around 4,200 ha. It is estimated that at present around 1,760 ha are being irrigated in the project's
community schemes, i.e. below the functional area at the time of rehabilitation l3  Moreover, an
analysis was made of the type of works conducted in the community schemes and it was
estimated that due to most works being lining of existing canals, the additional irrigated area
would be limited and the benefits would result from greater quality of water delivery. The details
on assumptions can be seen in Table 3 below (also see discussion on Annex 2 and Section 3.2).


12 The Timor-Leste Survey of Living Standards is a nationally representative survey of more than 4,000 households interviewed
conducted in 2007 with World Bank financing,

13 This may result from inadequate measurement at the time of implementation, Also, according to the report by the consultancy firm
who conducted the 2008 community irrigation scheme survey there was substantial over-reporting by farmers on the number of
potential hectares and households benefiting from rehabilitation in order to increase their possibility of being included in the project
rehabilitation efforts.


                                                                   34 

                 Table 3: Comparison of Irrigated Areas between PAD and ICR

                                                                    Area benefiting from improved
            Systems




         The one hectare models for the ICR use information from the irrigation surveys, which
indicate that farmers only grow paddy in these areas and that there is little trade-off with maize
production. This may be a slightly optimistic assumption as in a limited number of project areas
(for example in Maliana district) field interviews indicated that given the rainfall patterns, farmers
cannot produce both crops in one season and therefore the net economic margin would be lower.
The main differences to the PAD estimates resu It from lower additional irrigated areas and higher
economic investment costs (implying higher investment and O&M costs per hectare) and lower
than expected yields, mainly in the case of Caraulun. The actual timing of investment costs also
differs substantially from the PAD, namely in Caraulun where around 80 percent of economic
costs were incurred before the system first started operating (in the PAD all economic costs are
attributed to one year). For community schemes, it was considered that for 50 percent of irrigated
area which is not incremental as a result of the project (I.e. 880 ha), improvements in water
delivery would result in savings of 20 percent of yield (this was not applied to the incremental
irrigated areas to avoid double counting). The remaining key assumptions for the ICR estimates
of irrigation benefits are shown in Table 4 below. The annual net economic margin per ha
presented for Community Schemes is the average of the margin for additional irrigated area
(US$179) and for quality of water delivery (US$124).

Road Rehabilitation

         There is no reliable infonnation available from the project M&E on actual length of roads
rehabilitated, beneficiaries and types of benefits. The infonnation is also often contradictory as
the six monthly report of GoTL (July-Dec. 2008) indicates that 150 km of roads have been
completed, while the ICR prepared by the GoTL suggests that infonnation is available for only 16
of the 24 roads built under the project, and these roads with a total length of 87 km. Anecdotal
evidence during field visits indicated roads resulted, for some villages, in improved overall access,
but this was not always the case as suggested also by the technical review of the component. Also
these roads will be limited because of poor construction quality and lack of O&M. Details on
assumptions are presented in Table 5 below.

Animal Health Services

        Expected benefits from vaccination campaigns are based on the same technical data on
mortality rates and probability of outbreaks used in the PAD. The main differences are on value
of the animals, which was estimated higher at ICR (based on field data), costs of vaccination
(personnel and vaccine purchase and distribution) and the number of animals covered, which
were higher than initially estimated in the PAD. The figures for vaccinations and costs of
campaigns were derived from the technical review conducted by a specialist in 2008. The
economic costs for the component include additional overhead and transportation costs estimated
at US$200,000 per year, which were provided by MAF over the duration of the project. As of
2009 the economic costs include all the incremental costs of continuing with vaccination
campaigns.

Participatory Development and NRM

         Expected benefits from this sub-component were derived from the estimates on number
of forest trees planted during the project and survival rates. At end 2008, the data gathered during
the independent review conducted indicated that around 65 percent of trees planted in 2007 had
survived and 94 percent of those planted in 2008. A 50 percent survival rate was assumed at ICR
to obtain the number of trees to be harvested after 30 years based on field discussions. An average
quantity of 1.5 cubic meters estimate per tree of wood was considered and a financial price of
US$200 per cubic meter (based on discussions with beneficiaries and the types of forest species
planted). The economic price used was US$280 per cubic meter.

C.     Economic Returns

         The re-estimated ERR at ICR for the whole project is of 11.7 percent, i.e. a substantial
reduction on the PAD estimate of 17.7 percent. The Net Present Value (NPV) using the same
discount rate as at appraisal (12 percent) is of US$- 269,000, compared to the positive value
estimated at appraisal (US$2.3 million). The ERRs by component are shown in Table 6
comparing PAD and ICR estimates. The results indicate overall lower ERR for each of the
components for which a cost benefit analysis was conducted at ICR with the exception of
livestock. At ICR economic returns from the project are mainly driven by the sustainable animal
health services activities of the project and to a lesser degree the community schemes
rehabilitation. The single largest investment of the project, the rehabilitation of the Caraulun
irrigation scheme has a re-estimated ERR of 1.7 percent.

D.   Main Reasons for Lower Economic Returns

         The main reasons for the lower project economic return is mainly due to the lower than
expected additional irrigated area from rehabilitation of large and small schemes (just 550 ha for
Caraulun versus the PAD estimate of 1,030 ha and 880 ha for Community schemes versus a PAD
estimate of 3,000 ha). This resulted in much higher rehabilitation costs per hectare: US$3,600 for
Caraulun and almost US$700 for Community schemes versus US$I,500 and US$160
respectively at appraisal. The higher economic price used for paddy in the ICR estimates
(US$0.31/kg versus US$O.13 at appraisal) is compensated by lower yields and cropping
intensities but sti II economic revenues per hectare of additional irrigated area are above the PAD
estimates. For Caraulun, ICR estimates of economic revenues for one hectare of paddy in two
seasons are around 62 percent higher than the PAD estimate. However, net margin per hectare in
Caraulun is lower at ICR relative to the PAD because of re-estimated operating costs per hectare.
The PAD assumed very limited production costs per hectare, which seem unrealistic given
agricultural practices in Timor-Leste. For example, in Caraulun, production costs (including
labor) are set at US$62 per hectare for the first season and for Community schemes at US$112
per hectare. Both are extremely low given the costs of land preparation and others involved in
rice production. This is specially important in Timor-Leste as labor usage in rice production is
quite significant relative to other countries in the region.

E.   Financial Returns

The PAD did not include a financial analysis. The analysis of crop budgets for one hectare farms
produced with financial prices, indicates that with low input usage and the reported yields the
second season crop yields only a return of US$l.l per day (on total labor - family and hired)
implying that for many farmers it may not be justified. The main assumption here is the financial
price of paddy for which we apply the current maximum retail price on subsidized GoTL rice
(US$0.21 per kg). For the first season crops given the higher yields, returns to labor stand at
US$1.8 (on total labor) which is above the estimated financial daily wage rates ofUS$1.4.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Comments received from MAF on June 17,2009

Thank you for providing the opportunity to comment on the draft Implementation Completion
and Results Report for the Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project and for your ongoing support
in the delivery of this vital project.

This is a comprehensive report that has required significant analysis by the Ministry in order to
provide comment and, importantly, to ensure the findings have been or will be acted upon to
address areas of concern in the future.

Whilst I accept the overall findings of the report and the criticisms, it is important for me to stress
that the journey through the agriculture rehabilitation projects, stages I to 3, has been an
important learning opportunity for the Ministry. The lessons learned have been invaluable for
building and strengthening capacity of the staff and to assist in developing the structural and
corporate foundations for the Ministry.

For example, the report highlights the failure to adequately monitor the project which I accept
made it difficult to conclude whether goals had been met. It also acknowledges that targets were
overly optimistic and some indicators poorly designed or difficult to monitor. As a result of these
issues the Ministry has established a directorate that is responsible for policy development,
planning, monitoring and evaluation. The National Director was formally appointed on 17 April
this year, although his team has been in place for much longer. Already this new focus has
enabled the Ministry to finalize a strategic plan and to monitor and evaluate existing projects to a
standard never achieved before.

The recent confirmation of the entire team of National Directors and Chiefs of Departments has
coincided with a renewed emphasis on improved coordination between directorates and weekly
reporting of progress in achieving annual goals by each directorate. This includes district based
staff and programs in the field. With staffing numbers now reaching in excess of 1,800 it has
required the appointment of a Chief of Human Resources and the building of a team to ensure
skills development can be addressed. A strategy to train all administration staff in core
administration functions and managers in core management skills is about to commence, further
strengthening the capacity of the Ministry in the future.

These are just a few of the key initiatives undertaken recently and the learning offered by projects
such as the ARP I - III have provided an important contribution to realizing these priorities.

Let me also comment on some specific issues that may require modification of the draft report:

    1.  The Ministry is committed to the integration of the agriculture rehabilitation project goals
        into mainstream activities of the directorates. In relation to the policies developed under
        the project, these are in the process of being translated into Portuguese and are scheduled
        to be considered by the Council of Minister in the near future.

    2.  The period of civil unrest from 2006 - 2008 was a "once-off crisis situation that had a
        significant and obvious impact on the project outcomes. This has been weB documented



                                                 41
        in the report but should not be interpreted as all impediment to tile ability of the Ministry
        to deliver similar projects in the future.

    3.  A far greater level of consultation and involvement by the Government of Timor Leste in
        future projects will be possible than was the case when the agriculture rehabilitation
        project was conceived in 2002. This will ensure that future targets and projections are
        well focused and realistic.

    4.  Many of the ' criticisms justifiably mentioned in the report and been acted upon and
        improvements put in place to prevent a recurrence. This has not been mentioned in the
        report.

    5.  The overall lack of national infrastructure, much still destroyed from past conflict, and
        the failure of infrastructure since the period of civil unrest had a major impact on the
        agriculture rehabilitation project and is still proving a huge challenge for the Government
        of Timor Leste.

    6.  In terms of ratings for overall project implementation, I request this be upgraded. This is
        in recognition of the positive effect the project has made to the capacity of the ministry
        and, importantly, in recognition of the delivery of many of the project goals despite the
        challenges created by the civil unrest experienced throughout Timor Leste during the
        project duration. The ministry successfully managed its limited resources to achieve
        many of the project objectives of which the outcomes are apparent to the ministry and to
        the country. The draft unsatisfactory rating implies that there was negligible impact and
        nothing was necessarily done in the field throughout ARP III funds.

In conclusion, the agriculture rehabilitation project has been a vital long term project providing
substantial benefits to regional communities throughout Timor Leste. In addition, it has provided
an opportunity to build the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and, importantly,
it has acted as a catalyst for the strengthening of the corporate and management foundations
providing a clear focus for the way forward.

Annex 6. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments received from the EC delegation in DiH (June 13,2009):

      I appreciate all the information and assessments about the comprehensive irrigation
       component which are then translated into a moderately unsatisfactory score. Once more it
       has been proved that without collecting adequate information on results, we could go on
       dreaming of meeting more than the set targets.

      As discussed during the ICR mission, I would have expected more details technical and
       financial about the Caraulun irrigation scheme. The scheme cost 1.8 Million US$ (a big
       percentage of the 6.2M Euros EC project) and its use is very much inadequate till now.
       For this reason the ICR mission included also an engineer. I think it would be useful to
       present in details the justification for adopting the current irrigation design, the details
       about the need for maintenance, and the details in terms of cost and equipment which the
       Government has to budget every year until it can demand them from the users. I think
       that the cost and the visibility of the scheme will raise more and more questions in the
       future including during the implementation ofthe EC financed RDPIII in the same area.
       For this reasons all possible details on the scheme even in the form of annexes would be
       very useful. More information would be expected also regarding the cropping intensity in
       the irrigated area in 2008. When we carried out the Mid Term Review of RDPI, only the
       2007 cultivation could be assessed, but the consultants recommended monitoring the
       following agricultural season. The report provides information only in term of cultivated
       area but not in term of production. It would be good to know also which are the
       mechanisms of land preparation now and how these mechanisms could be envisaged to
       be sustainable in the future.

      According to the recommendation of the Mid Term Review, it could be good to know if
       adequate adaptation of training modalities and training material has been made in order to
       more effectively train Water User Association in small, medium and large irrigation
       schemes.

      More information would be appreciated also on the Animal Health Services. Recent
       monitoring carried out for Food security projects implemented by NGOs in Oecussi
       showed that these services are not evident and are being requested by the population from
       NGOs.
