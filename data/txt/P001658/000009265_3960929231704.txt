MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO MALAWI
FOR A FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit
to Malawi for SDR 6.2 million (US$8.8 million) are submitted for your
approval. The proposed credit would be repayable over 40 years including a
grace period of ten years, at the standard IDA terms. It would help
finance a program to improve the efficiency and management of Malawi's
fishery resources. The Project would be co-financed by Nordic Development
Fund (NDF) for US$3.5 million equivalent and Icelandic International
Development Agency (ICEIDA) for US$1.0 million equivalent.
2.        Back2round:  Malawi is land-locked and resource-poor with a
narrow economic base and high vulnerability to external shocks. During the
1960s and 1970s, the economy experienced an annual growth rate of over 5Z.
However, such strong growth came to a halt in the late 1970s when the
country faced a combination of trade, high interest rates and weather-
related shocks. In the mid-1980s, the economy experienced another shock
from the civil war in neighboring Mozambique which increased freight costs
and resulted in about 800,000 refugees streaming into Malawi. To address
the deterioration in the macroeconomic balance caused by this chain of
events, the Government undertook broad-based structural adjustment reforms
throughout the 1980s. These reforms as well as improvements in short-term
economic management helped to create a stable macroeconomic environment.
After negative growth in 1986 and 1987, GDP (at market prices) grew at 3.3?
in 1988 and 4.3? in 1989, restoring per capita GDP growth to a positive
level. Inflation decelerated sharply from an average of about 30? in 1987-
88 to 162 in 1989 and the fiscal deficit has been brought under control,
resulting in net negative domestic credit financing since 1988-89. In
spite of the breadth of policy reforms and the restoration of macroeconomic
stability, significant structural weaknesses that impede development of
sustainable supply response remain. The productivity of the economy is low
while poverty and malnutrition are pervasive, particularly among the rural
population. A substantial proportion of the population lives below the
poverty line. The GDP per capita is about US$160 (1989) which makes Malawi
one of the world's poorest countries.
3.       Agriculture continues to be the backbone of Malawi's economy.  It
accounts for about 35% of GDP, 90X of export earnings and 852 of employment
generation, and provides inputs for about two-thirds of the manufacturing
sector. However, agricultural productivity remains low as a result of
limited adoption of improved technologies, reduction of farm size because
of rapid population growth, and deterioration of land fertility. This has
led to domestic food security concerns. Fisheries, which is an important
sub-sector of agriculture, makes a significant contribution to the
country's food security and supplies about 75? of the total animal protein
intake of the population. The fisheries sub-sector provides direct
employment to more than 30,000 artisanal fishermen and about 2,000 workers
in semi-commercial and commercial fisheries activities. In addition, more
than 200,000 people derive their livelihood from related activities such as
fish processing, marketing, boat building and repair, engine repair and
fishing gear supply. Malawi has a potential for sustainable fish



production of 150,000 ton/year, while the recent production levels have
been around 80,000 ton/year.
4.        The Government's objectives for the agricultural sector, of
which fisheries would continue to be a very important sub-sector, are to
promote economic growth, raise rural incomes, ensure food security, and
increase export earnings while conserving natural resources. The
development of the fisheries sub-sector is an essential part of
Government's strategy for achieving these objectives. Specifically, as
indicated in the Statement of Development Policies (1987-96), the fisheries
sub-sector objectives are to maximize sustainable yield from fish resources
that can be economically exploited from national water bodies without
environmental degiadation; improve the efficiency of fish exploitation,
processing and marketing; create additional off-farm employment; promote
investment in viable rural fish farming units to improve nutrition and
increase protein intake in rural areas; develop new aquatic resources for
fish farming; and protect endemic fish fauna. These objectives are being
pursued through government programs undertaken with support from several
donor agencies (FAO, UNDP, GTZ, ODA, and EEC) aimed at: a) promoting
private sector involvement in fish production (almost all aspects of fish
production are being privatized with the exception of boat building and ice
making); and b) assisting Government activities in monitoring and
regulating the exploitation of fish fauna from all national waters on a
continuing basis, promoting aquaculture development as a means of raising
rural off-farm incomes and increasing the supply of fish in rural areas;
undertaking a program of research to identify and assess underutilized fish
resources; disseminating research results to improve fishing, fish handling
and processing techniques; and developing the institutional capacity of the
Fisheries Department (FD) to focus on its regulatory mandate.
5.        In spite of Government's programs, the development of the
fisheries sub-sector has been impeded by some major constraints identified
by the Government and IDA in collaborative studies of the sub-sector.
Firstly, FD, which is responsible for implementing government programs and
policies, and regulating the fisheries sub-sector, is under-funded and
lacks the capacity, skilled manpower and infrastructure to carry out
effective research, provide extension services, undertake resource
management and monitoring and evaluation, and enforce fisheries
regulations. FD is currently involved in such activities as boat building
and ice making for which it lacks adequate managerial or technical
capacity. These activities should be streamlined and commercialized or
privatized. Secondly, about 90? of all fish landings in Malawi come from
the traditional/artisanal sector which uses dug-out canoes or small plank
boats. These require replacement with improved boats using plank wood
and/or other materials, thereby minimizing environmental damage caused by
cutting indigenous wood for dug-out canoes. The performance of semi-
commercial and commercial fisheries is also sub-optimal because of poor
maintenance of boats, inadequate landing jetties and boat moorings, and the
poor condition of pair-trawler units fishing on Lake Malawi which are in
need of rehabilitation or replacement. The sole commercial fishing company
(MALDECO) is run-down and requires substantial reinvestment in vessels and
shore installations.   Finally, Malawi's lakes risk degradation from
pollution caused by soil erosion and agricultural chemicals such as



fertilizers unless an appropriate lake resource management program is
undertaken.
6.        Lessons Learned from Fisheries Protects:  IDA has financed many
fisheries projects. The lessons learned from these projects indicate that
inadequate project design, weak institutional capacity and unrealistic
project scope adversely affect project performance. These factors were
taken into consideration in the design of the proposed Project. The
Project design is simple, the institutional capacity would be strengthened
and the project scope is focused on a few essential activities. In
addition, up-front actions were carried out before project approval and a
mid-term project review is included to handle issues arising during project
implementation.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  Support for the fisheries sub-
sector development is an important element of IDA's assistance strategy in
Malawi, which is aimed at fostering economic growth, food security, poverty
reduction, and protecting the natural resource base. Under the proposed
Project, IDA would assist Government in marshalling international support
to address Malawi's broader environmental concerns and complement
Government efforts designed to establish an effective fisheries resource
management program, including monitoring, control and surveillance systems.
IDA involvement in the proposed Project is necessary to strengthen the
institutional capacity for fisheries research and fish farming management
to ensure sustainable resource use, carry out regulatory functions to
protect water bodies, and provide support to the private sector for
economically viable and sustainable production activities. The IDA
initiative would also assist Government in the coordination of ongoing
programs and those likely to be funded by other donors. The proposed
Project complements ongoing IDA projects in the Agricultural Sector.
8.        Proiect Obiectives:  The Project's main objectives are: (a) to
increase fish production as a means of improving nutrition and protein
supply for the population; (b) to generate additional off-farm employment
and income to help reduce poverty among women and the rural population;
(c) to conserve the natural resource base of Malawi's water bodies and
prevent environmental degradation; and (d) to improve the institutional
capacity for fisheries sub-sector policy formulation, research, planning,
monitoring and control.
9.        Proiect Description:  The Project, which would be implemented
over seven years with a total estimated cost of US$15.5 million, comprises:
(i) an Institution Building Component (US$7.3 million) for strengthening
the Fisheries Department to enable it concentrate on regulatory functions,
staff training (particularly in policy formulation, research, extension,
monitoring and evaluation), and technical assistance; (ii) a Research
Component (US$1.9 million) for strengthening FD's research capacity and
focusing on demersal stock assessment, lake conservation and resource
management program, and establishing fish farming models that would help
integrate aquaculture and crop farming systems in different ecological
zones using appropriate technologies; (iii) a Production Component (US$5.3
million) for rehabilitation and development of existing capture fisheries
by supporting the traditional/artisanal fishermen, semi-commercial and



-4-
commercial fishing activities, and establishing a pilot program to increase
the involvement of women in fish processing and marketing; and (iv) an
Infrastructure Component (US$1.0 million) for rehabilitation, upgrading
and construction of access roads, jetties for fish landing, and shore-based
facilities. Credit arrangements envisaged under the Project are consistent
with Malawi's Financial Sector Strategy, and the Financial Sector
operations envisaged by IDA. The Project beneficiaries would obtain credit
from the financial institutions of their choice. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Malawi are in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map and Staff Appraisal Report No. 9086-MAI dated February 25, 1991 are
attached.
10.       Actions ARreed:  During negotiations, agreements were reached on
the following issues: (a) a timetable for privatizing FD's commercial
activities; (b) an action plan to involve women in the implementation of
the fish processing and marketing pilot program; and (c) a mid-term review
of the Project would be carried out by FD not later than June 30, 1995.
The following up-front actions acceptable to IDA were taken by Government
before Board presentation: (i) preparation of FD's manpower development
plan; (ii) preparation of an action plan for reorganizing FD; (iii)
recruitment of a financial and management expert; and (iv) development of a
research program by FD. The condition of effectiveness is that Government
would finalize a restructuring plan for the Mpwepwe boatyard and appoint
its manager whose qualifications are acceptable to IDA.
11.       Justification and Risks:  The Project would help Malawi to
increase food production from its lakes, reservoirs and river systems. The
incremental fish production would enhance the contribution of the fisheries
sub-sector to food security and improved nutrition, and to poverty
alleviation. It would provide additional employment and income generation,
particularly to rural population including women. It would promote private
sector participation in the fisheries sub-sector by rehabilitating semi-
commercial and commercial fisheries enterprises while reducing government
involvement in fisheries operations. Furthermore, it would strengthen the
capacity of FD to establish an effective resources management program,
carry out regulatory functions to protect and conserve the natural resource
base and prevent environmental degradation. The major risk to the Project
would be FD's weak institutional capacity which, if not rectified, could
slow down the implementation of the Project and the ability of FD to
efficiently manage and regulate the fisheries sub-sector. This is
particularly important for the protection of fish resources from over-
fishing and prevention of the pollution and degradation of Malawi's water
bodies. Such risk would be minimized by the planned strengthening of FD
through reorganization, staff training and technical assistance.
12.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit
complies with. the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
