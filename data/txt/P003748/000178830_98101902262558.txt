REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRES:[DENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A SEVENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$33 million to
help finance a Seventh Irrigation Project. The loan would have a term of
25 years including six years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:  Development
Prospects and Needs" of April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structures of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the
Indonesian economy. Country data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan, the
per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher than
half a century ago. A majority of the population lived below a minimum
welfare standard, especially on Java. Most were dependent exclusively or
primarily on agriculture, and farms were generally very small. Under-
employment was widespread. While the inflation of the mid-1960s had been
overcome, infrastructure was still in a very poor condition.
4.        The Government's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy
on the development path. Most physical objectives were achieved or nearly
so, and there was substantial rehabilitation of run-down infrastructure
and Government enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing. Foodgrain
production increased by 4 million tons during the Plan period at an average
rate of 5 percent per annum. Investments increased at a very fast rate,
rising from 9 to 19 percent of GNP. The reliance on foreign financing of
Government development expenditures was much smaller (57 percent) than the
rate of nearly 80 percent foreseen in the Plan. GDP increased at an annual
rate of over 7 percent. GNP per capita, in current prices, reached about
$130 1/ in 1973. The Government instituted programs for the labor intensive

rehabilitation of infrastructure and other programs which created substantial
incomes and employment. In all, however, given the annual increase in the
labor force of about one million, one cannot be confident that the employment
situation improved during the First Plan period, and it is difficult to judge
from available information the extent to which the poorest sections of the
population shared in the gains of development.
5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979) builds
on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan dealt mainly
with the urgent needs for stabilization and rehabilitation under conditions
of great scarcity of resources, progress had been such that the Second
Plan could give much more attention to such problems as employment, equitable
distribution, regional growth, health and education. The Plan identifies a
number of specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an employ-
ment oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth in invest-
ments, needed both because capital intensity will tend to increase as the
rehabilitation phase draws to an end, and because more socially-oriented
investments will be made. Overall, the Plan expects GDP to grow at 7.5
percent per annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1 percent
a year. However, as a result of changes in the age distribution and declining
mortality, the current annual growth rate is estimated at 2.5 percent. Even
under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to fertility decline, the
growth rate would only come down gradually, and the population would nearly
double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has substantial
unutilized land reserves in the Outer Islands, these are limited in relation
to the expected population increase, and a further large increase in popula-
tion pressure - already severe on the Inner Islands - must be expected.
Since 1969, the Government has been operating and gradually extending a
family planning program. The number of acceptors has been increasing rapidly.
The Second Five-Year Plan foresees a progressively more vigorous and compre-
hensive attack on the population problem.
7.        During the years 1976-79, average annual additions to the labor force
are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4 million in the years
1980-85. In addition, substantial underemployment exists, and there is the
risk that even relatively simple technological improvements may adversely
affect existing employment. The Second Plan's projections show that employment
growth would almost keep up with the growth in the labor force but even this
may prove optimistic. Thus, the employment thrust of the Plan needs to be
further strengthened if an appreciable increase in real labor earnings - and a
wider spread of the benefits of development - is to be attained.
8.        Towards the end of 1973, when the Second Plan was being finalized,
prospects for resource availability improved dramatically. In line with other
OPEC countries, the Government raised the export price of oil in successive
stages from $3.70 per barrel in April 1973 to $12.60 per barrel in July 1974.
Early in 1974 (and again in 1975) the Government successfully renegotiated the
contracts with foreign oil companies, enabling it to retain a greater share of



the oil income. As a result, the net contribution cf the oil sector to the
balance of payments and Government revenues was expected to increase very
considerably; a large increase in foreign exchange reserves and a budget
surplus were also anticipated for 1974/75 1/.
9.        By October 1974, foreign exchange reserves; had risen by $650 mil-
lion from about $1 billion at the beginning of 1974/75 and Government reve-
nues exceeded the levels originally estimated. The Government authorized
much higher levels of expenditures, mainly for development, which reflected
the improved revenue prospects. However, the recessionary conditions in the
industrial countries began to affect the volume of oil exports and production
by the middle of the year. Indonesia's low-sulphur oil tended to become over-
priced 2/ as world oil demand slackened and output declined from an average
of 1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 1974 to 1.31 mil-
lion bpd in the second half. Proceeds from non-oil exports also started to
decline as prices, and in some cases export quantities, fell.
10.       In October 1974 also, the first signs appeared of what turned out
to be a substantial financial overextension by PERTAMINA, the national oil
company. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment program
financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing. In the third quar-
ter of 1974/75 it started withholding part of the corporate oil tax it had
collected on behalf of Government from the foreign oil companies; by the end
of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 billion ($830 million) had been so with-
held and used to meet PERTAMINA's financial obligations. Early in 1975,
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due to some foreign banks, and the Govern-
ment stepped in and took decisive action. It banned all independent foreign
borrowing by PERTAMINA and other Government enterprises and gave Bank Indonesia
the sole authority to contract foreign obligations, instructed Bank Indonesia
to provide the funds needed to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, under-
took a comprehensive review of the oil company's investment projects and be-
gan the process of reducing and re-planning the company's investment program
and of cancelling and renegotiating many of the related procurement contracts.
11.       The combination, in the latter half of 1974/75, of slackening
receipts from exports of oil and other products, and of the need to meet
PERTAMINA's short term obligations resulted in a loss of the foreign ex-
change reserves gained in the first half of the fiscal year; by March 31,
1975, these reserves were at the same level as at the beginning of April 1974.
12.       In the first half of 1975/76, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves
declined by a further $480 million, despite substantial capital inflows,
1/   Indonesian fiscal year April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1975.
2/   The premium on Indonesian oil has recently been reduced by the Govern-
ment's decision to raise the price of its main crude by 1.5 percent (to
$12.80) as compared with the 10 percent increase in the price of Saudi
Arabian light crude agreed at the meeting of OPEC in September 1975.



-4-
which included two syndicated public cash borrowings (totalling $575 million)
from the international capital market. With continuing recessionary con-
ditions in Indonesia's principal markets, exports failed to increase while
imports rose again (about 30% on an annual basis). Debt service payments on
behalf of PERTAMINA were also very large (about $1.0 billion). In the second
half of 1975/76, there was no appreciable change in export earnings, but
imports and debt service payments were lower and there was only a small re-
duction in capital inflows (two more cash loans, amounting to $475 million,
were raised). The country's foreign exchange reserve position was therefore
relatively stable in this period and the decline in the reserves for the
year as a whole amounted to nearly $500 million.
13.       Balance of payments prospects for 1976/77 are on the whole good.
Recovery from the recession appears to be underway in most industrialized
countries, commodity prices seem to have bottomed out and oil exports from
Indonesia have been rising in recent months. The Government is in the pro-
cess of negotiating an increase in its share of the oil income. Rice imports
are expected to remain at the average level of recent years (Government es-
timate is 1.4 million tons) but prices are likely to be considerably lower.
The country has sizeable stocks of fertilizer and only small amounts are
expected to be imported. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the
exact magnitude of payments due on account of PERTAMINA's financial obliga-
tions, and the outcome for foreign exchange reserves during 1976/77 at this
point is difficult to predict.
14.       Budgetary revenues in 1974/75 were much lower than had been anti-
cipated at the middle of the year, partly due to the withholding of oil tax
revenues by PERTAMINA and partly to the shortfall in oil exports in the
second half of the year. The budget was however, still in balance by year's
end as the Government reduced or deferred expenditures. The Government re-
venue in 1975/76 also fell substantially short of the budget estimates, main-
ly as a result of lower oil tax revenue. To keep the budget balanced, both
current and deveiopment expenditures were reduced. Revenues, as well as
current and domestically financed development expenditures, are now esti-
mated to have been roughly 15 percent lower than originally budgeted.
15.       In spite of the shortfall in budgetary revenues, and the adminis-
trative difficulties involved in the implementation of some projects, total
development expenditures in 1974/75 were Rp 770 billion ($1.9 billion), about
60 percent higher than the level in the previous year. In 1975/76 they are
estimated at Rp 1.27 trillion ($3.1 billion), including foreign project
financing totalling about $925 million and fertilizer subsidies amounting
to $320 million. This is more than two and one-half times the actual ex-
penditure in 1973/74; when adjusted for price changes it represents an
increase of about 60 percent.
16.       Preliminary figures indicate that the high growth rate achieved
during 1969-1973 was maintained in 1974. In constant 1973 prices, gross
domestic product rose by 7.5 percent in 1974. Partial indicators seem to
point to slower growth of output in 1975. The inflation rate was very high
in the first part of 1974 as, among other factors, world inflation was trans-
mitted through both export and import channels, but abated somewhat later in



- 5 -
the year, partly as a result of the Government's stabilization measures in
April 1974. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole it reached 40 percent.
While still considerable, the average inflation rate for 1975 was reduced
to 20 percent.
17.       In the aftermath of the PERTAMINA development, the Government is
faced with problems which, although serious, are surmountable. The review
of PERTAMINA's projects has resulted in the cancellation or renegotiation of
many contracts and reductions in project scope and size. 1/ The Government
has more recently undertaken a broader review of projects initiated by various
Government departments and other State entities in an effort to bring future
expenditures in line with available resources and the priorities set out in
the Second Plan. It is screening very carefully any major new programs or
projects, since considerable resources will be needed in the next year or
two for the completion of projects already initiated.
18.       The recent financial difficulties will have a longer-term effect
on the country's external public debt service obligations during the rest
of the decade. Debt service payments over the next several years will be
much larger than previously envisaged as a result of the large borrowings
by the Government in the last fiscal year. Debt service in 1976/77 is now
estimated at $700 million, which would be about 12 percent of the value
of officially projected net oil and other exports. Debt service payments
on all loans contracted up to December 31, 1975 maLy reach about one billion
dollars by 1978, before declining as shorter-term maturities are paid off.
This is about $500 million more per year than the payments projected on the
basis of debt outstanding at the end of 1974. With debt service obligations
from these borrowings substantially higher than expected earlier (about
13 percent of exports in 1978), the margin for further borrowing on other
than semi-concessional terms has now become much more limited. The amounts,
terms and purposes of future borrowing therefore need to be kept under con-
tinuous and careful review.
19.       While the recent balance of payments and budgetary difficulties
have upset some of the Government's plans, the long-term prospects for
Indonesia's development remain good.  The country has a substantial potential
for further productive investment, employment and income growth. In agri-
culture a vigorous pursuit of on-going programs in irrigation, development
of new plant varieties and technical services, provision of credit and cur-
rent inputs, etc., promises to yield high returns. In addition, there are
opportunities for the development of new areas, of food and plantation crops
- partly in conjunction with a rapidly growing transmigration program. The
industrial potential is good, both for modern capital intensive natural
resource-based activities and for more labor-intensive, partly export-
oriented industries.
1/   The planned capacity of the Krakatau Steel plant for example was re-
duced from 2,000,000 to 500,000 tons per year and the existing supply
contracts were reduced by $750 million.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
20.       Part I of this Report emphasized Indonesia's plans for and need
to undertake a large investment and development program designed to provide
productive work opportunities (with resultant increased incomes) for its
presently underemployed and growing labor force. Substantial external
financing, the larger part on concessional and semi-concessional terms, as
well as a considerable volume of technical assistance, is also required. The
Bank is planning to maintain its lending to Indonesia at present levels and
in particular to support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit,
research and extension; rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems; improve
nutritional levels; assist transmigration and other land development in the
Outer Islands for and by smallholders; increase non-agricultural employment
in the rural areas and small towns, through the establishment of small-scale
industries; rehabilitate and expand urgently needed transportation and other
infrastructure; assist urban development and the national family planning
program.
21.       As of May 15, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits total-
ling $561.8 million and 13 Bank loans amounting to $682 million. At that
date, IFC investments totalled $58.4 million.. At the end of 1974 the Bank
Group accounted for about 4 percent of Indonesia's total (disbursed) outstand-
ing public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent of total
outstanding debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations. The Bank
has in the past financed some of the local costs of projects in Indonesia.
A limited amount of such financing will continue to be necessary in connec-
tion with Bank assistance to the agriculture and social sectors where proj-
ects frequently have a low foreign exchange component. A summary statement
of IDA Credits and Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of March 31, 1976, as
well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects are contained in Annex II.
This loan and the proposed National Food Crops Extension project are the
eight and ninth loans proposed for Indonesia this year and, if approved,
would bring total IBRD commitments since June 30, 1975 to $517 million.
22.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all Bank
Group lending to. Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabili-
tation, six for the rehabilitation and expansion of the irrigation systems,
two for fisheries, and one each for seeds, beef cattle, sugar and smallholder
tea and rubber. In the industrial sector, the Bank Group has assisted in
three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production and distribution
capacity, three for development finance companies (Government-owned and pri-
vate) which play a major role in fostering the growth of industrial enter-
prises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and credits
have also been extended to the transportation, education, telecommunications,
tourism, power, population, urbanization and water supply sectors; one loan
for a national resource survey and mapping project; and four credits for
technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and formulating its
development programs and projects.



23.       Bank Group lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in
1968 for irrigation rehabilitation; almost half of all loans and credits
have been made since mid-1972, with lending on Bank terms commencing in
June 1974. Disbursements on loans and credits are prevailing at satisfactory
levels. The Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the
delays in project execution caused by cumbersome procedures and the need
to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS (the National Develop-
ment Planning Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank has arranged
for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to
help set up a monitoring and control system which it is hoped will lead to
better project administration.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
24.       The mainstay of the Indonesia economy is agriculture, accounting
for nearly 40 percent of GDP, close to two-thirds of total employment, and
almost 80 percent of non-oil exports. About 85 percent of the total caloric
and 80 percent of the total protein intake of the population are provided by
the major food crops: rice, maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, soybeans and
groundnuts, with rice accounting for nearly one-third of the total value of
agricultural production.
25.       A priority of the First Five Year Plan (which ended March 31, 1974)
was increased agricultural production, particularly rice, and steps taken to
achieve this goal included rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems,
price supports, and promotion of inputs. Agriculture grew at nearly 4 per-
cent per annum during this Plan period, with the production of milled rice
rising from 12.3 million tons in 1969 to 15.5 million tons in 1974. On a
per capita basis, due to population.growth during the Plan period, this pro-
duction only represented a 2.1 percent increase and it was necessary for the
Government to import between 0.5 and 1.2 million toas of rice annually over
the past five years.
26.       If it is to attain its objective of achieving self-sufficiency in
rice production -- the goal for the Second Five Year Plan (1974-1979) -- the
Government will have to intensify its irrigation development program includ-
ing completion of on-going rehabilitation, new rehabilitation, groundwater
development, and construction of storage dams to serve new areas as well as
to increase cropping intensity in areas already irrigated. The Second Plan
includes about 25 such projects which, when completed in 1981, will provide
irrigation to about 240,000 ha. Also included in the Second Plan is a small-
scale irrigation program aimed at upgrading and extending village irrigation
systems to cover 550,000 ha by 1982 (primarily in the Outer Islands).
27.       The Bank has financed six irrigation projects in Indonesia (Credits
127, 195, 220, 289, 514-IND and Loan 1100-IND), which will provide irrigation
to about 988,000 ha. In October/November 1975 a Bank mission visited Indonesia
to review the progress of these projects and concluded that, despite delays in



- 8 -
completion of civil works (due in part to slow starts, unusually heavy rains
in the 1973 dry season, and cost overruns due to inflation), progress was
generally satisfactory. The mission recommended that the responsible Govern-
ment departments intensify their efforts to expand the BIMAS/INMAS (farm
input-credit) programs, and expressed concern at the continuing problem of
timely and adequate provision of operation and maintenance (O&M) funds for
the Government-operated irrigation projects in Indonesia. Despite consider-
able increases in costs, production increases on all projects were generally
in accordance with appraisal estimates and the economic rates of return were
satisfactory.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.       Rehabilitation work, consisting mainly of reconstructing diversion
weirs, dredging main and secondary canals and replacing broken-down struc-
tures, was started on about one million ha of Government-maintained irriga-
tion systems under the First Plan, with financial assistance from four IDA
Credits (127, 195, 220 and 289-IND). It was fully realized at the time that
once the most urgent rehabilitation works were carried out further upgrad-
ing and improvement of the systems would be required. Having now overcome
much of the initial rehabilitation backlog, the Government is turning to
the next most urgent task, namely construction of tertiary canals.
29.       When the Bank appraised the first four irrigation rehabilitation
projects in Indonesia, it was generally accepted that construction of the
system by the Government would extend down to units serving about 1,000-
1,500 ha each. Tertiary canals feeding from outlets provided in these sys-
tems were to deliver water to units of about 150-200 ha each. Quaternary
canals taking off from the tertiaries were supposed to deliver water to
units of about 10-15 ha; below that level, irrigation was to be from field
to field. With the exception of the first 50 m of tertiary canals, which
were constructed by the Government, the cost of tertiary and quaternary
systems was not incorporated in the rehabilitation projects financed by the
Bank since it was assumed, in accordance with traditional practice in
Indonesia. that farmers would carry out these works using volunteer labor.
Drains below the secondary level were similarly excluded, from the works to
be carried out by the Government. It soon became apparent, however, that
the farmers were incapable of executing the works for several reasons. First,
the farmers had neither the technical knowledge to set out canal systems to
correct lines and grades, nor design experience to locate and build tertiary
control structures. Second, construction of control structures required
volunteer labor as well as cash outlays, which were often beyond the farmers'
means. Third, although the total amount of land lost due to construction of
the tertiary system was small, it meant a substantial loss to some individual
owners. Without at least some minimal arrangements for right-of-way com-
pensation, farmers were unwilling to construct the systems. Finally, the



- 9 -
recruitment of all farmers in the village to go out and construct the system
required at least some organizational support from the Government, which was,
however, not forthcoming.
30.       In an effort to demonstrate to farmers the benefits from tertiary
systems, pilot tertiary units serving about 150 ha each were introduced
throughout the systems being rehabilitated under the first four Bank-
assisted projects. Design imperfections in the earlier systems have been
corrected in later schemes as more accurate maps became available and de-
signers' techniques improved. The tertiary systems have, on the whole,
operated satisfactorily and have effectively servecd as demonstration units.
Although farmers were quick to realize the benefits from the tertiary sys-
tems they are still unable to construct them for reasons explained in para
29 above. The Government has therefore agreed to assume responsibility for
tertiary development in the irrigation systems being rehabilitated under the
first four Bank-assisted projects.
31.       The area covered by these four irrigation projects is 840,000 ha,
and practically all of it requires tertiary systems. Tertiary construction
on 92,000 ha of this area is being carried out under the sixth irrigation
project (Loan 1100-IND); the area included in the proposed project would be
limited to 100,000 ha. Subject to the capability of the involved agencies to
construct and provide agricultural services to the completed systems, ter-
tiary construction on the rest of the area could be carried out under possible
future projects.
32.       PROSIDA, a unit in the Directorate General of Water Resources Devel-
opment (DGWRD) in the Ministry of Public Works and Power, prepared the feasi-
bility studies for tertiary development and the North Sadang system, assisted
in the latter by Binnie and Partners (UK). Feasibility studies for the Kedun-
gombo Dam were carried out by NEDECO. The project was appraised in October/
November 1975 and negotiated in Washington from April 5 to 13, 1976. The
Government delegation was led by Mr. E. Roekasah Adiratma of BAPPENAS. The
Appraisal Report No. 1035b-IND dated April 28, 1976 is being circulated to
the Executive Directors separately; a project and loan summary is contained
in Annex III.
Project Areas
33.       Seven irrigation systems, covering about 720,000 ha, are included
in the tertiary development project area -- six along the north coast of Java
and one (Sadang) in South Sulawesi (see attached NAp 3627R3). Tertiary
distribution systems (spread through all seven systems) would be provided
for some 100,000 ha. At present, only about 5-10 percent of these areas
have proper water distribution and internal drainage systems down to the
quaternary level of 10-15 ha. Although data on farm size and land tenure
is sketchy, recent samplings indicate that farm sizes in the tertiary devel-
opment areas of Java range from 0.15 to over 5.0 ha, with few farms above
2.0 ha; on Sulawesi farms are slightly larger, with the average farmer hold-
ing 1.5 ha of paddy and one-half ha of upland. The major wet-season crop



- 10 -
in the areas where tertiary and quaternary development would occur is paddy.
High yielding varieties are planted during the dry season, together with a
number of secondary (palawija) crops, the most popular of which include
groundnuts, maize, cassava, soybeans, and red onions.
Project Description
34.       Tertiary development, to be undertaken on 25,000 ha of the Jatiluhur
system (Cr. 195-IND) and 75,000 ha on the systems being rehabilitated by
PROSIDA (Crs. 127,220 and 289-IND), would include about 550 km of tertiary
canals, 1,000 km of sub-tertiary and 5,500 km of quaternary canals, 4,000 km
of tertiary and quaternary drains, 1,500 km of inspection roads, and some
9,000 canal structures. In addition, provision would be made for: (a) up-
grading primary and secondary supply systems to the tertiary development
areas by providing additional measuring devices near canal intakes and major
bifurcations; (b) modifying existing gates and gate structures to facilitate
the operation of the gates with motor-driven devices; (c) procuring and
installing additional telephone equipment to upgrade communications; and
(d) producing maps covering the Jatiluhur and PROSIDA systems.
35.       On the North Sadang System, about 12 km of primary canals and 25
canal structures of the existing intake at Benteng barrage would be rehabili-
tated and upgraded to permit double cropping of the 6,000 ha service area.
To enable all-weather use, about 54 km of existing access roads would be
upgraded by raising stretches presently subject to flooding, widening where
needed, and providing a gravel or crushed-stone base course. New works,
comprising 7 km of primary canals and 6 canal structures, 46 km of second-
ary canals and 25 canal structures, and 74 km of primary and secondary
drains and 25 drainage structures, would be undertaken. In addition,
through construction of about 420 km of distribution canals, 540 canal
structures, 240 km of drains and 90 km of inspection roads, the entire
service area would be upgraded to the standards of the tertiary develop-
ment areas.
36.       Included in the proposed project are preliminary works for the
Kedungombo Dam, a sand and gravel-filled structure spanning the Serang River.
In addition to offices and living quarters for GOI personnel, access roads to
the dam site and quarry areas, detailed investigations and design of project
features, the works would include detailed studies on the Serang River flood-
way and alternative flood control and drainage schemes downstream. Feasibil-
ity studies carried out by NEDECO (consultants) and reviewed by the Bank have
shown that construction of the proposed dam would be both technically and
economically feasible. Detailed designs and associated works to be carried
out under the project would prepare the dam for construction under a subse-
quent project and provide a good basis for estimating project costs. Detailed
engineering and construction of the dam are estimated to take about six
years.
37.       The proposed project also provides for the engagement of consult-
ants to prepare: (i) a drainage project for about 40,000 ha of low-lying



- 11 -
coastal lands in Ciudjung, Cisedane, Pemali-Comal, and Sadang; and (ii) a
feasibility study for development of tidal lands for smallholder settlers in
Jambi and South Sumatera.
Organization and Management
38.       Implementation of the tertiary development project component would
be the responsibility of the two agencies currently in charge of works under
previous Bank-assisted irrigation projects: PROSIDA (Credits 127, 220
and 289-IND and Loan 1100-IND), and the Jatiluhur Authority (Credits 195 and
514-IND) . a semi-autoromous public agency established by the Government to
administer the multi-purpose development of the JaLtiluhur region. Responsi-
bility for the execution of the North Sadang systems would rest with PROSIDA
and direction at the field level would be given from the staff of the existing
Sadang sub-project office. P3SA, the unit programming and studying water
resources development nationwide, would implement the preliminary studies and
detailed engineering for the Kedungombo dam and the flood control and drainage
schemes downstream. Direction of field level would be handled through its
sub-project office which supervised NEDECO's feasibility studies on the
Kedungombo dam, other dams in Central Java, as well as flood control and
drainage schemes for coastal areas downstream of these dams; this assignment
would, therefore, be a continuation of P3SA's earlier work. Supervision of
the feasibility study for tidal lands development would be undertaken by P4S,
the unit responsible for tidal reclamation projects. All the organizations
involved in project implementation have had previous experience in dealing
with Bank-assisted irrigation projects but, in ordLer to help overcome the
shortages they still face of trained and experienced irrigation and agri-
cultural personnel, the proposed project makes substantial provision for
local and overseas training in the fields of irrigation, planning and design,
rodent control, operation and maintenance, construction, and modern agricul-
tural practice. Within 14 months of the signing of the proposed loan, the
Government would submit a detailed plan of the training program to the Bank
for consultation prior to commencement thereof.
39.       The design and construction of the tertiaries would require a
large number of engineers, whom PROSIDA and the Jatiluhur Authority would not
be able to supply from their present staff. Instead of hiring new engineers
and training them for the job, the agencies would engage consultants to
design the systems and assist in construction supervision. Since the services
involved would require technical skill as well as contact with the farmers at
various stages of the work, the engineers would be drawn from a number of
local consulting firms experienced in tertiary design and familiar with the
tertiary areas.  PROSIDA would also engage consultants to:  (a) design and
supervise construction of the North Sadang irrigation system; and (b) under-
take detailed engineering on the drainage and inspection road requirements in
the Ciudjung-Cisedane, Pemali-Comal, and Sadang irrigation systems. Consult-
ants for the Kedungombo dam and the tidal reclamation project would be em-
ployed by special units of the DGWRD. To upgrade the capability of local
consultants, foreign firms would be encouraged to associate with local firms
approved by the Government and the Bank. A total of about 3,500 man-months
of consulting services would be required, of which 2,900 would be provided
by Indonesian consultants.



- 12 -
Agricultural Support Program
40.       Implementation of the agricultural support program would rest with
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), who currently has the responsibility for
implementing a similar support program under Loan 1100-IND. Services under
the program would consist of credit, extension, research, supply of quality
seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and storage and processing facilities and
would be provided by MOA and Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Further extension ser-
vices would be provided by the proposed National Food Crops Extension Proj-
ect through construction of one Rural Extension Center for about every
10 village units (10,000-12,000 farmers) in nine provinces.
41.       There would be intensive involvement by MOA in the tertiary area,
where officers and extension workers would: (a) assist irrigation engineers
from the various implementing agencies in determining development priorities;
(b) help village chiefs form water-user associations and organize farmers to
construct the tertiaries; (c) co-ordinate extension; (d) improve rat and pest-
control programs; and (e) ensure that inputs would be readily available (see
paragraph 42 below).
42.       Seed requirements, which are expected to excced 4,000 tons per year
at full development, would be met from production at Government seed farms
and sold to growers through village unit cooperatives (BUUDS) and local
kiosks. The demand for fertilizer is also expected to rise considerably;
production would continue to grow with Bank assistance (Credit 193-IND and
Loan 1089-IND) and distribution would be handled through a project financed
under Loan 1139-IND (Fertilizer Distribution Project). It is anticipated that
all farmers in the tertiary areas, and about 90 percent in North Sadang, will
become eligible to receive BIMAS/INMAS packages which would provide them with
production credit requirements.
43.       Monitoring of project benefits and of the social aspects of tertiary
development would be the responsibility of MOA, in accordance with the moni-
toring system for all rehabilitation projects already established under the
Sixth Irrigation Project (Loan 1100-IND).
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The estimated total cost of the project is $60.0 million, of which
$27.9 million, or about 47 percent, would be in foreign exchange. Cost esti-
mates include allowances for physical contingencies of 10 to 20 percent, de-
pendent on the status of preparation and complexity of work. Provisions
against projected price increases due to inflation amount to $12.6 million,
or 21 percent of the total project cost. For civil works, the assumed annual
rates of inflation are 13 percent in 1976, 12 percent in 1977-1979, and 11
percent in 1980. For equipment and services they are 9 percent in 1976,
8 percent in 1977-1979, and 7 percent in 1980. Costs for consulting ser-
vices are based on billing rates of $6,000-$7,000/man-month for expatriates,
$1,200-$1,500/man-month for local engineers, and $450/man-month for local
draftsmen; these services include consultants' specialized equipment as
well as miscellaneous expenses.



- 13 -
45.       The proposed loan of $33 million would finance 55 percent of
total project costs, including the foreign exchange component of project
works ($20.2 million) and 80 percent of the total costs of consulting
services, whether foreign or local. The latter would entail the financing
of an estimated $5.1 million of local costs of Indonesian consultants.  The
loan would have a repayment term of 25 years, including six years of grace.
The Government would provide to the various participating agencies and units
the remaining $27 million out of annual budget appropriations.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Vehicles and equipment for construction, operation, and for agri-
cultural services (estimated cost - $2.1 million) would be procured after
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank guidelines.
For purposes of bid evaluation, a preference equal to 15 percent of the cif
price of imported goods, or the level of actual customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be extended to qualified local manufactures of these goods.
Small items of less than $10,000 each and limited to an aggregate total of
$100,000, which are not suitable for international tendering, would be pur-
chased through normal Government procurement procedures which are satis-
factory to the Bank. There are sufficient suppliers of these goods to ensure
adequate competition.
47.       It would be impractical to let works for North Sadang (estimated
cost - $6.2 million) as one contract since: (a) about 15 percent of the cost
of works would be for tertiary construction; (b) the! remaining work would be
spread over a wide area and would not be big enough to attract international
bidders, but it would be too big for most local contractors who would other-
wise qualify if the works were broken down into a number of smaller contracts;
and (c) construction would be delayed since complete designs and tender
documents for the whole system would be needed prior to the advertisement of
the works. These works would, therefore, be divided into a number of suit-
ably sized contracts which would be let to prequalified contractors following
usual Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Construction of small structures for the tertiary systems would not be of
interest to international contractors due to their being scattered over a
wide area and time span. They would, therefore, be carried out either by
force account or small contracts using labor-intensive methods. The excava-
tion of tertiary and quaternary canals and drains, as well as the filling and
compaction of canal embankments, would be done by farmers under the supervi-
sion of the provincial district heads and local village chiefs. Consistent
with prevailing self-help practices in the community, the Government would
pay the farmers a wage averaging Rp 150 per day, which is below the current
rate of Rp 200-Rp 300 per day in the construction in,dustry.
48.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed at the rate
of 100 percent against the foreign exchange cost of training and of directly
imported vehicles and equipment; 95 percent of the ex-factory cost of equip-
ment manufactured locally; 65 percent for imported equipment procured locally
(excluding vehicles); 40 percent of total expenditures for locally procured



- 14 -
vehicles; and 80 percent of total expenditures for mapping. Disbursements
for both foreign and local consultants would be at 100 percent of foreign
expenditures or 80 percent of total costs, which is roughly equal to the
foreign exchange cost of typical foreign consultants. Disbursements for
civil works would be at the rate of 60 percent of total costs. In the case
of the tertiary systems, disbursement will be made only if each withdrawal
application is accompanied by a certificate from the site engineer stating
that the quarternary canals and drains in the tertiary block had also been
constructed. A condition of disbursement for these tertiary systems would be
the engagement of local consultants for the preparation of design and con-
struction drawings in the first year of construction.
Operation and Maintenance and Cost and Rent Recovery
49.       During construction, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the tertiary
systems would be the responsibility of PROSIDA and the Jatiluhur Authority in
their respective project areas. The systems would be turned over to the Pro-
vincial Governments once construction is completed, and the responsibility
for O&M on tertiary systems of about 150 ha each would shift to the water-
user associations previously organized for each system. O&M of the primary
and secondary supply systems would remain the responsibility of the Provin-
cial Governments. O&M of the North Sadang system during construction would
be PROSIDA's responsibility. After completion of the works, O&M of the main
supply and drainage works would revert to the Provincial Government, while
O&M for the tertiary systems would shift to the water-user associations.
50.       The insufficiency of allocated O&M funds has been under discussion
with the Government for the past several years. Following recent consulta-
tions with the Bank, the Government has allocated in its 1976/77 budget about
Rp 2,810 million for O&M of all Bank-assisted irrigation systems. Although
the level of allocated O&M funds is slightly below that required to operate
and maintain all systems efficiently, it is a substantial improvement over
the previous year's fundings and is consistent with the Government's present
budgetary capability. Assurances have now been obtained that: (a) adequate
and timely O&M funds would be allocated in future years for all Bank-assisted
irrigation systems; (b) the Central Government will take the necessary steps
to ensure that adequate and timely O&M funds are at all times made available
to the Provincial Government; and (c) the Government would submit the pro-
posed staffing requirements and annual per hectare O&M budget for each
sub-project to the Bank for review by November 30 of each year and, by June 1
of each following year, the approved O&M budget and staffing requirements
(Section 4.03(c) of the Loan Agreement).
51.       Landowners in Indonesia pay a land tax (IPEDA) based on 5 percent
of the net value of the production of the farmer's land. A Government inter-
ministerial committee, set up to study methods of collecting a portion of the
increase in farm income from irrigation development areas, has recommended
that, through IPEDA, farmers should pay part of this increased income to
cover annual O&M costs and a portion of the capital costs. The current aver-
age annual IPEDA rate in the tertiary areas is between Rp 4,000 and



- 15 -
Rp 5,000/ha. On completion of the project this is expected to rise to an
average of Rp 7,000/ha. In North Sadang, IPEDA averages around Rp 4,000/ha
annually and is expected to increase to an average of Rp 10,500/ ha on proj-
ect completion. Over the estimated project life of 30 years it is anticipated
that 49 percent of the capital and O&M costs of the tertiary development
component would be recovered.  If past, investments in rehwibilitating the main
irrigation systems and the farmers' contributions are taien into account, the
proportion of total cost that would be recovered woulld be about 31 percent.
In North Sadang, which involves the construction ot d new system, i-3 perccit
of these costs would be recovered. In addition, the farmers would be con-
tributing to the costs of the system by donating land for the canals and
drains and supplying low-cost labor for construction.
Benefits and Justification
52.       The proposed project would increase paddy yields on about 100,000
ha in Java and Sulawesi, through better water control and distribution, as
well as providing irrigation to 6,000 ha in the North Sadang area. It would
benefit about 220,000 farm families and about 40 percent of the landless labor
in the tertiary development area and 5,400 farm families in North Sadang. On
project completion, the increase in paddy production, is expected to total
130,000 tons annually. After deducting the incremental cost of imported fer-
tilizers and chemicals, the annual net foreign exchaLnge savings as a result
of the project would be about $19 million at full development.
53.       Benefits can be quantified for the two major components of the
project: the tertiary development component and the North Sadang component.
Assuming a 30-year project life, and prices for rice and fertilizer based
on the Bank's commodity price projections through 1985 as well as seasonably
adjusted prices for labor, the economic rate of return would be 33 percent
of the tertiary development component, which represents 60 percent of the
project cost. Under the same assumptions, the rate of return for North
Sadang, which represents 21 percent of the project cost, is 20 percent.
Sensitivity analyses indicate that, even taking into account a range of
possible adverse circumstances, including delays in construction, increases
in costs, and failure of yields to reach projected levels, the rates of
return would not fall below 17 percent for the tertiary development compo-
nent and 12 percent for North Sadang. The economic rate of return for the
combined investment is 30 percent. Preliminary wor]ks for the Kedungombo
dam represent 9 percent of the project cost. Feasiblity studies reviewed
by the mission during appraisal indicate that the economic rate of return
from the development of the damsite for irrigated paddy production would
be satisfactory. Benefits for the tidal reclamation and training components
of the project, which constitute 8 percent and 1 percent of the project cost
respectively, have not been quantified. The tidal reclamation feasibility
study is essential to prepare a possible £uture Bank project which would
benefit smallholders, and the in-service -:raining of irrigation supervisors
and construction personnel would facilitate iiplementatf on of both the
tertiary d--velopns  and Yorth Sadang compenents.



- 16 -
54.       A substantial majority of the beneficiaries of the project would
be small farmers and sharecroppers whose average income, even at full proj-
ect development, would still be considerably less than the national average.
The project would also benefit the landless labor force through increased
yields as harvest wages are paid as a percentage of the crop. Since many
landlords are also small operators farming their own fields, the project
would also be beneficial to them.
55.       Permanent labor opportunities equivalent to 12,000 man-years would
be created in the tertiary development area. Although the labor force pro-
jected to be in the area at full development would not be entirely utilized,
these labor opportunities would provide an additional source of income to
small farmers and sharecroppers. In the North Sadang area, permanent labor
opportunities equivalent to nearly 3,000 man-years would be created and would
give employment to the entire local labor force during much of the year.
56.       The service areas of the existing irrigation systems and North
Sadang have been cultivated for many years and no adverse ecological effects
are anticipated from the project works. The use of fertilizers and pesticides
is already widespread in the project areas. People are constantly reminded
of the toxic effect of pesticides on humans and domestic animals and no
adverse effects are envisaged provided care is exercised in their application.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and th^
Bank, the recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
58.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 38, 43, 47 and 50 of this report. The draft Loan Agreement
follows the general pattern of loan agreements for irrigation projects.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. No. 127:       Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
All civil works were completed on March 31, 1976. Additional
drainage work will be carried out under Loan 1100-IND. The closing date has
been postponed by one year to allow for payment of late accounts.
Cr. No. 154:       Highways:  US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Effective Date: October 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
Rehabilitation work, of acceptable quality, has been
completed. The work accomplished exceeded the project's original target.
The program for improved highway maintenance included in the project has
been completed. A project completion report is being prepared for issuance
before June 30, 1976.
Cr. No. 155:       Agricultural Estates:  US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
With improvements in management and much higher inter-
national prices, particularly for palm oil, prevailing in 1974, the
financial position of the estate groups has improved. The field and
factory standards have now been raised to a good technical level and
the managements have been advised to concentrate on cost control in order
to prepare for the time when produce prices may become less attractive.
The combined efforts of the management, consultants and IDA missions
to review project implementation are yielding good results. The closing
date has been postponed to December 31, 1976 to enable payment to con-
sultants for services for other rubber estates.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165:       Electricity Distribution:  US$15 million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Effective Date: June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The closing date was postponed to December 31, 1975, to
allow for payment of small amounts outstanding. The project completion re-
port will be prepared in conjunction with that for Credit No. 334.
Cr. No. 193:       PUSRI Fertilizer:  US$35 Million Credit of June 15,
1970 (as amended May 21, 1973); Effective Date:
January 15, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance
test and is operating at close to 90 percent of rated capacity. The gas
gathering and transmission system is also completed and sufficient gas is
being delivered to the plant. The closing date has been postponed to Decembe~r
31, 1976 to allow for delivery and installation of remaining equipment.
Cr. No. 194:       Second Agricultural Estates:  US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After initial delays, there have been considerable
improvements in management and these, combined with high prices, particular-
ly for palm oil, have resulted in the two estate groups being put in a
much stronger financial position. On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort
is necessary to improve agricultural standards and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment of the palm oil group (PNP VI), there is
a need to employ expertise in financial planning, control and management,
which are now the main constraints to efficient development. This estate
group is undertaking action in this respect. The closing date has been
postponed by one year to allow payment for remaining equipment, civil
works and consultants' contracts.
Cr. No. 195:       Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
Problems of quality and progress of construction still
exist, but the project entity assisted by the consultants are tackling
these vigorously, and the situation is improving, although not sufficiently
to make up for earlier delays. Costs are likely to be double the overall
appraisal estimate, due to inflation, but the Government will provide any
additional funds required and, because of higher rice prices, the project
will continue to have a satisfactory rate of return. Completion of dis-
bursements will be about two years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 210:       Telecommunications Expansion:  IJS$12.8 Million Credit
of July 13, 1970; Effective Date: February 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project has been completed except for the installation
of the telex exchange at Medan, which is now expected to be in service by



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 14
June 1976. The delay in completion of the Medan telex exchange was due to
late completion of a building to house the exchange. The closing date of
the Credit has been extended up to June 30, 1976, which should be suffi-
cient to allow for payments of outstanding contracts. The audit of finan-
cial statements for FY1973 is expected to be completed in May 1976 and
efforts are being made to ensure timely audit in future.
Cr. No. 211:       Fisheries:  US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
The project is about two years behind the original schedule due
to delays in engaging consultants and in executing contracts for the shore
facilities. There has been a substantial project cost increase but the
project is still expected to be financially viable due to the greatly
increased skipjack prices. Government has recently appointed new project
management. The first stage of operation of project facilities is expected
to start shortly.
Cr. No. 219:       Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Project implementation in the Department of Education
is satisfactory. Civil works for the five Technical Training Centers
(TTCs) have been completed. About 90 percent of the equipment has been
purchased and about 60 percent delivered and installed. All TTCs began to
operate at full capacity in January 1976 when the new academic year started.
Over 500 technical teachers have completed or are about to complete their
training. Technical assistance financed by the U.K. for the project is
also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved considerably. Revised
total project cost is now about 40 percent above appraisal estimate. The
Government will finance the cost overrun. The project is expected to be
completed about three months ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220:       Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction remains about two to three years behind
schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties in preparation
of contract document, late financial allocations, heavy rains in the 1973 con-
struction season and, more recently, slow response by GOI to high inflation
rates and consequent civil works costs overruns - have been mainly overcome,
but time lost cannot be regained. Estimated project cost is 50 percent above
the appraisal estimate, but with higher rice prices on the world market, the
project's economic rate of return remains over 20 percent. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months as a result of project delay.

Cr. No. 246:       Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Significant progress has been made in the construction
of the irrigation infrastructure and in land development at the National
Seeds Corporation (NSC). Construction is proceeding satisfactorily and is
now 70 percent completed. The inadequacy of NSC management at the opera-
tional level is reflected in technical production problems, low yields of
seed and high costs of production. Increasing nation-wide production prob-
lems caused by prevalent disease, pests and insect Losses has resulted in
government authorities now giving certified seed production high priority.
Cr. No. 259:       Tea:  US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded
appraisal expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation
of three additional factories. Project completion, estimated for December
1977, can probably be advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating
pressure on available funds and the main challenge for the two PTPs will
be to reduce working capital requirements, as well as overhead and indirect
costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260:       Second Highway:  US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Construction work is about 80 percent finished and should
be completed by August 1976, about one and a half years behind schedule.
The delay was caused largely by slow progress in mobilizing contractors,
difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and landslides. The closing
date has therefore been postponed by 15 months to December 31, 1976. Design
standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and some savings
have been achieved, which, together with other savings have partly offset
construction cost increases of 12 percent.
Cr. No. 275:       Third Technical Assistance: US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Effective Date: February 25,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing
date has been postponed by another year to complete disbursements for
ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288:       Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This agricultural training project, being implemented
by the Department of Agriculture, is about 16 months delayed because of



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 14
late appointment of consultant architects, lack of counterpart funds, delays
in bid analysis and in awarding contracts. As a result, civil works,
which were to be completed already, have not commenced. Furniture and
equipment procurement have therefore been deferred. Unlike the physical
aspects of the project, the educational aspects are generally on schedule.
Total project costs are now estimated to be 90 percent higher than the
original estimate. Government has budgeted for the cost overrun. Disburse-
ment, which has been slow, should improve since civil works contracts have
now been awarded.
Cr. No. 289:       Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil Works and equipment purchases for the main project,
Pekalen-Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be
about two years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are
likely to be substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants
for the various studies are at work with their counterparts. Disbursements
are also on schedule.
Cr. No. 300:       Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress of this project is generally satisfactory.
Steps are being taken to improve preparation and implementation of project
components concerned with communications, research and evaluation. All
vehicles have been procured and good progress is being made with equipment
procurement. The civil works section of the Project Implementation Unit
functions well but is underutilized because of delays in making policy
decisions. Construction costs will exceed appraisal estimates by 135
percent. Population Education is now being introduced into school curricula
after a successful trial. Despite its limitations, the national family
planning program, of which the project is an integral part, is expanding
annually and showing good results.
Cr. No. 310:       Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):  US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 318:       Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:  US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Progress on this project is slow but funds are expected to
be fully committed by September 30, 1977. Due to substantial cost increases,
only about half of the anticipated tonnage will be rehabilitated.

Cr. No. 319:       Fourth Agricultural Estates:  US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The physical progress of the project is ahead of the
appraisal schedule. The financial position of the estate group is dif-
ficult due to an unsatisfactory debt/equity ratio. Measures to improve
the situation are under review.
Cr. No. 334:       Second Electricity Distribution:  US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits
165-IND and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays
due to procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result
the project is two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties
have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. No further delays
are therefore expected.
Cr. No 355:        Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project imple-
mentation.  Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and fi-
nancial management and coordination have been weak. The last supervision
mission undertook a thorough project review and its recommendations, which
include major changes in project scope and objectives, are presently under
discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358:       North Sumatera Smallholder DeveLopment:  US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project performance, which had suffered from severe fin-
nancial and organizational difficulties, has improved greatly. Physical
progress is encouraging; rubber planting and rice intercropping are now
on schedule. There is some room for improvement in financial management,
in which consultants are assisting. Total project costs are now estimated
at about three times the original estimate of US$10 million. Disbursements
are expected to be completed ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 387:       Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is about 10 months behind schedule, mainly due
to insufficient top management staff and paper shortages last year. The paper



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 14
shortage has been overcome and about 18 million text books were printed by
January 1976, about four months behind schedule. Steps are being taken to
strengthen project management and to improve arrangements for expert services.
Measures to improve project implementation have been discussed and agreed with
the Government. The book testing and teacher training programs are on schedule,
but their results have not yet been evaluated. Procurement of instructional
equipment will be completed by early 1976.
Cr. No. 388:       Third Highways:  US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections
in the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts and is now 60
percent completed. Construction has been delayed mainly because of long
mobilization periods and heavy rains. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates (including contingencies) by 57 percent mainly due to
sharply escalated prices. The training program has been completed success-
fully.
Cr. No. 399:       West Java Thermal Power:  US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara
Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase
in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Government will provide
the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets
in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit
Agreement.
Cr. No. 400:       Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:  US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Planting is presently slightly behind schedule but
it is expected that targets will be achieved or even exceeded by the end
of the 1975/76 planting season. Project nurseries are well organized
and field work is proceeding well. Also non-participating farmers have
benefitted from the project. Total project costs are estimated to be
double the amount originally envisaged and project management is attempting
to achieve cost reductions. Due to the high prices for tea (about twice
the level expected at the time of appraisal), the economic rate of return
is still satisfactory.

Cr. No. 405:       Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
In view of the rapid and continuing increase in the cost
of sugar factory machinery and the more recent shortage of budgetary funds,
the scope of the above-mentioned project has been reduced by the deletion of
six minor rehabilitations from the project descripition. The revised project
consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories and the construction
of a new factory. Credit funds have been reallocated from the minor to
the major rehabilitation and to the new construction.
Cr. No. 428:       Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:  US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Of 430 ha earmarked for the project, about 270 ha had been
acquired by end 1975, and 108 ha had been developed to readiness for
occupation. 42 factories are operating on the estate and 35 more are in
various stages of construction or commissioning. The rate of new applica-
tions for land allotment has been slower in recent months than in the past,
and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts. Overall, operations
are profitable, despite an increase in construction costs.
Cr. No. 436:       Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; 'Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding
and recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI has now reached the operating
stage. Commitments have started and are expected to increase rapidly
as PDFCI's own operational capability improves.
Cr. No. 451:       Fourth Technical Assistance:  US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479:       Bali Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial diffi-
culties. Tender documents for all major infrastructure works were issued
in January 1976. The earliest possible completion date has shifted from
February 1979 to October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the
Bali Tourism Development Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Negotia-
tions with one group of investors are in progress but otherwise investor in-
terest appears to be low. Promotional efforts to attract additional investors
have been intensified in 1976.

Cr. No. 480:       Fisheries Credit:  US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Lending for fishponds is now on schedule, and the contract for
construction of shore facilities at Ambon has been awarded. There may how-
ever be some delays in skipjack vessel construction due to procurement pro-
blems. Although significant cost increases are envisaged, the project is
still expected to be financially viable because of increases in fish prices.
Cr. No. 514:         Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:  US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The consultants are now making good progress in designing
works and preparing contract documents. The first civil works contract is
expected to be let in August 1976, about one year behind the original schedule,
due in part to delays in loan signing.
Loan No. 1005:       Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been
slow due to poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now
improved. Bids have been received for most items and the bulk of the con-
tracts should be signed soon. Passenger traffic in 1975 was slightly lower
than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued
to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and freight revenues
by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further, as
operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
