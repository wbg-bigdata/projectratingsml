PREFACE
1.     This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements of
the Al Mukalla Water Supply Rehabilitation Project for which an IDA Credit
(1159-YDR) of SDR 2.9 million was made on June 2, 1981 to the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The Credit was signed on July 27, 1981
and became effective on December 23, 1981. The closing date was December 31,
1986 and final disbursements were made in August 1987.
2.     The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Region on the basis of the findings of missions which visited
PDRY in May and August 1987 and of a review of the Staff Appraisal and
President's Reports, Credit documents and progress and other reports relating
to project implementation.
3.     In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff. OED sent copies
of the draft report to the Borrower for comments, however, none were received.

PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
Al. MJKALLA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(Credit 1159-YDR)
HIGHLIGHTS
Credit 1159-YDR for SDR 2.9 million was the third IDA credit in the
water supply sector in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.  The funds
were onlent to the Public Water Corporation (PWC) to help finance the Al
Mukal.a Water Supply Rehabilitation Project, which included remedial and
extension work to the existing water supply distribution system, field
investigation and design work in preparation of a major new project of
augmentation of Al Mukalla's water supply, and assistance in public health
education Lo help ensure that the limited available water is used with naximum
benefit to the community.   IDA subsequently  provided  two other  credits  to
assist in financing water supply projects in the Seiyun and G'reater Aden
regions. A follow-on development project for Al Mukalla water supply has now
been  appraised  and  a  new  Credit  will  be  presented  to  the  Board  fox
consideration by late July 1988.
The objectives of the project were to: (i) increase the water production
of  the  existing  borefield;   (ii)  prepare  detailed  designs  of  new  water
production facilities; and (iii) carry out a health education program.   The
second  and  third  of  these  have  bte>n  achieved.   The  increase  in  water
production from the existing borefield did not materialize to the expected
extent. Nevertheless, the exiscing system has been sufficiently improved to
survive the critical years until a new system is completed in 1993.
Total project expenditures did not change significantly from estimates
at appraisal.   Howevcr, a number of changes had to be made to the scope of
work. Considerably more field investigation and exploratory borehole drilling
than anticipated had to be completed in order to satisfactorily prove an
adequate water resource for the proposed follow-on project.  As a ccnsequence,
the proposed expansion of the distribution system and the health education
program had to be scaled down.
PWC's financial performance was satisfactory.   It substantially met the
Association's financial covenants (paras. 5.03 and 5.05), and earned a rate of
return on average net fixed assets of 12% in 1986 well in excess of the 4%
projected (para. 5.04). PWC's favorable financial performance was due to good
control over operating expenses, regular tariff increases, and sizeable
Government equity contributions.
Experience gained during project implementation shows that, in an arid
country such as PDRY, a very thorough investigation is essential to locate
groundwater resources prior to project appraisal (para. 8.02).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PEOPLE ' S DEMOCRATIC URrULIC OF YEME
AL MUKALLA WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1159-YDR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01   Overall,  the climate in PDRY is very hot and dry, though it is milder
in the interior plateaux.   In general, temperatures in the coastal areas are
more uniform and "umid throughout the year than in the interior. The hottest
months  are May  through September:  temperatures  higher than 43-C have been
recorded  in  June.   Rainfall  in  the  coastal  areas  is  irregular  but  more
frequent during the winter months; the mean annual rainfall :n the coastal
plain  is about 50 umn.  In the mountainous part  )f the country,  it is more
regular and occurs in the summer months with an average annual rainfall of
about 500 mm. The rate of evaporation is high and runoff is limited.
1.02   With  the  exception  of  Wadi  Hadramaut,  where  sufficient  groundwater
resources  are  still  available,  adequate   water  supply  sources  are  scarce
throughout the country.  Several of the aquifers along the coast have for some
time been overexploited.   As a result, seawater has starced to intrude into
these aquifers, causinb in some cases permanent deterioration of thf quality
of the waters.  Water demands for urban and agricultural uses in the Greater
Aden area have already exceeded the available groundwater resources of Wadi
Tuban. Consequently, water must be brought in from the adjacent Wadi Bana.
1.03   Collection and uisposal of  solid and  liquid wastes  in PDRY are  the
responsibility of local councils.  Most of Greater Aden is sewered and a sewer
system is under construction in Al Mukalla, the second largest city, to serve
about  two-thirds  of  the population.   The  remainder of  the population uses
individual sy;cems for waste disposal such as cesspools, dry pits -nd septic
tanks.   As water  consumption  increases,  cesspits  and septic  tanks  in some
densely populated areas have saturated the surrounding areas resulting in
unsanitary conditions and serious structural problems with existing buildings.
1.04   A sector  study undertaken  by  the Association in 1972 concluded that
sewerage development had a lower priority than water supply projects in the
country.  Accordingly, the Association's emphasis has been in the water sector
commencing '.ith an engineering credit in FY79  (Credit  R-"'-YDR)  to develop
water supply projects in the two main cities, Aden and Ai Mukalla.  To date,
five credits have been made by the Association providing about US$20.0 million
to finance water supply projects in Aden, Al Mukalla and Seiyun.  A total of
about US$56.0 million was contributed to the financing of these projects by
five co-financiers:   The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development,  the
Islamic Bank, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the OPEC Special
Fund and the Danish International Development Agency.
1.05   The beneficiary of  Credit  1159-YDR was  the  Public Water Corporation
(PWC) created by public law in 1970 to replace the Aden Water Authority.  PWC
is owned by the Government and is presently responsible to the Minister of
Energy and Minerals.  Under its statute it is an autonomous public enterprise
which funictions as a commercial undertaking. PWC has been gradually extending



- 2 -
its services outside the city of Aden and presently provides services to six
other areas.  In addition it provides technical assistance in the development,
operation and expansion of water supply systems ir. rural areas.  PWC has been
the beneficiary of the five IDA credits.
1.06   Under  Credit  1159-YDR,  the  Association  provided  US$3.93  million
equivalent towards the financing of the Al Mukalla Water Supply Rehabilitation
Pro4ect which included the construction and equipping of new boreholes,
improvement and expansion of the water di.stribution inetwork, ansd studies
required for the preparation of a new project of water sup;ly augmentation for
the town. The Credit Agreement was signed in July 1981.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL
0
2.01   A sector study undertaken by the Association  in  1972  identified  the
areas of PDRY where the water supply was most critical.  These were in order
of priority:  Greater Aden, Al Mukalla, and villages of the high plateau along
the border with the Yemen Arab Republic.   In 1978, a Water Supply Engineering
Credit (S-21-YDR) financed the preparation of master plans for Aden, Al
Mukalla, and Laboos.
2.02   The master plan study for Al Mukalla showed that only minor changes and
improvements were necessary to the then existing water transmission and
distribution systems, but that the amount of water available was totally
insufficient to meet demand up to the year 1990.  It proposed  increasing the
production of water from the existing boreholes at Wadi Buwaysh (about 12 km
east of the town) and from Wadi  Khirba  (12 km west  of  the  town).   A new
borefield at Wadi Huwairah further to the east would subsequently be developed
to meet water requirerrnts beyund 1990.  Works were proposed to be constructed
in the wadis to increase infiltration and thus raise available production from
the aquifers.
2.03   The project was first discussed with the Ministry of Planning and PWC
during a preparation mission in June 1980.  Initially it was intended to l;.-,it
the project scope to engineering studies and final design of water production
facilities and a sanitation system in Al Muka.la.  Subsequently, the project
evolved to include a program of immediate improvements to the existing water
production and supply systems and a public health education component *is it
was felt that these two elements would lead to more effective implementation
of long-term water supply and sanitation projects. The project was appraised
in December  1980.   The appraisal  mission was assisted  by a  public  health
specialist who reviewed hygiene practices related to water in the town and
formulated  a health education  component.   Negotiations  were  held  in  April
1981,  the Credit was approved in June 1981, and became effective in December
1981.
Objectives
2.04   The objectives of the project, as stated in the appraisal report were
to:   (i)  improve and increase the production of the Wadi Buwaysh borefield
production  to about  90  1/sec  in order  to meet  demands  up to  1985;   (ii)



prepare detailed designs of new water production facilities to meet demands up
to 1990; and (iii) carry out a health education program aimed at improving the
hygiene practices of the population and at stimulating a more rational and
teneficial use of water supply and sanitatio'  services.  The proposed studies
were expected to result in the formulation of & water supply project to meet
the long-term water demands of Al Mukalla and help alleviate poor sanitary
conditions in the town.

Revisions to the original project scope are discussed in paras. 3.02 to
3.06.
Major Covenants
2.07   A summary of the major covenants under the credit is shown below:
(i)   PWC to take all such measures required,  including adjustment
of tariffs, to provide revenue sufficient to cover operating
and maintenance costs, interest and other charges on debt, and
repayment of debt in excess of provision for depreciation.
The covenant was fully complied with (para. 5.03;
(ii)   PWC not to incur any debt without  IDA's agreement unless its
net revenue (after operation, maintenance and taxes, but
before depreciation and debt service) for the year prior to
incurrence is at least 1.2 times the maximum debt service for
any succeeding  year.   This  was  substantially  complied  with
(para. 5.05);
111. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Start-pp
3.01   The credit became effective in December  1981  following  authorization
and  ratification  of  the subsidiary  loan agreement.   The project  commenced
promptly thereafter.  Within three mcnths good progress had been achieved in
carrying out the urban growth studies and in preparing a detailed outline of
the health education program.  During the next six months, rapid progress was
also made with improvement work on the distribution system.
Revisions
3.02   A numDer of revisions were undertaken as the project progressed,  the
most significant being those related to the hydrogeological studies, including
field  investigations.   Initially  these  investigations were directed towards
proving the feasibility of constructing works to improve infiltration into the
wadi beds, and thus increase the available water resource.  This proved not to
be viable, and investigations moved further afield to locate an adequate water
resource.   The result was that whereas only four exploratory boreholes were
envisaged at appraisal, a total of twenty three were actua>ty constructed
under the project.  An additional six were financed entirely by PWC, giving a
total of twenty nine  exploratory  boreholes.   (See Annex  1D for details  of
boreholes completed).
3.03   Four  of  the  exploratory  boreholes  were  subsequently  converted  to
production, giving, with the two initially proposed production bores, a total
of six new production bores under the project.  Ten new borehole pumps were
purchased under the project instead of the two expected at appraisal. Four of
the additional pumps were utilized to equip the four additional bores, and
four are at present being retained in store to replace existing pumps during
cyclical maintenance. (See Annex ID for detaiis of use of pumps).



-5-
3.04   The  change  between  expectation  and  eventuality  in  water  resource
investigations induced significant changes in both the scope and nature of the
work required in consulting services for preparation of the follow on water
supply project.  This consultancy was also extended to include preparation of
detailed design for the proposed follow-on project.
3.05   The  proposed  2000m3  Sharj  reservoir  was  deleted  from  the  project,
partly because of the higher priority that developed for other work, such as
the  additional  water   resource   investigations,  and  partly  because   its
justification as a balancing reservoir in the final distribution system    the
town became doubtful.   Instead,  smaller  storage  reservoirs  at  Fuwwah  were
substituted to satisfy growing demand in that area.
3.06   Two warehouse buildings, one office building, and visitor accommodation
were constructed in lieu of the single war house proposed at appraisal, since
it became evident that inadequate office and storage space and the lack of
suitable  accommodation  in the  town  for visiting  management  were  seriously
hindering the operations of PWC.
3.07   The  length  of  pipeline  laid  for  expansion  and  upgrading  of  the
distribution system was more than double the 9.33 km proposed at anpraisal.
This was needed because of unforseen expansion of the town, particularly in
the Fuwwah area and was possible because estimates at appraisal proved to be
very conservative.   In addition a further 22.7 km of galvanized steel pipe was
purchased for minor distribution and house connection lines.
3.08   The  health  education  program  was  changed  to  concentrate  on  staff
training  and  supply  of  training  equipment.   This  was  due  to  the  Health
Department's  reluctance  to  appoint  a  consultant  and  its  preference  to
concentrate on the development of their own capabilities in health education.
3.09   Annexes  lA to lE provide details of actual works constructed or goods
procured  under  the  project,  compared  where  possible  with  proposals  at
appraisal.
Implementation
3.10   The  project  implementation was managed effectively by the Al Mukalla
branch manager  of PWC,  assisted by one of his  staff.   No  consultant  was
appointed to assist with project supervision since it was decided by PWC, and
agreed with the Association,  that  the nature,  size,  and complexity of  the
project  did not warrant  it.   The project management  was effective and the
project proceeded smoothly.
3.11   Actual  and  appraisal   implementation  schedules  are  presented   in
Annex 2.   The  major  delay  in  project  completion  has  b en  caused  by  the
continuing and extensive field work involved in the search for a satisfactory
water source for the proposed follow-on water supply project.  This delay and
uncertainty concerning its final outcome led to delays in initiating some
rehabilitation components of the project until availability of funds after
successful completion of borefield exploration could be precisely assessed.



- 5 -
3.12   Minor delay in project implemencation, estimated to be not more than a
month, was caused by evacuation of consultant personnel as a result of the
events of January 1986.
3.13   The commencement of the health education component was delayed about
two and a half years and was then stopped before training (para. 3.08) had
been completed. Training was subsequently resumed after another delay of more
than a year.   These delays appear to have been caused by the lack of clear
understanding  by  PWC  and  the  Health  Department  of   requirements   and
responsibility for this component.   In addition there was some reluctance on
the part of PWC to utilize project funds on something which was not seen to be
directly part of the water supply system, particularly since no mechanism
existed whereby the cost of the health education component could be excluded
from PWC's accounts.  There is a clear need to be able to exclude this type of
project component from PWC's accounts (para. 8.02).
Reporting
3.14   Preparation  by  PWC  of  quarterly  progress  reports  on  ali  of  its
activities  was a requirement of the credit.   Good reports were prepared in
1983 after IDA provided a detailed report format.   However,  the quality of
reporting deteriorated thereafter and oniy one annual report was provided in
1984 and 1985.   Upon the insistance  of  the supervision missions,  bi-annual
reports were provided in 1986.  These reports have provided only disbursement
information on the Al Mukalla project, but omitted detailed description of
implementation  activities.    This,   together  with  the  delays   in  report
presentation, reduced their effectiveness as an advisory and management tool
(para. 7.04).   Although the project was physically completed in August 1987,
PWC's quarterly reports for that year contained no mention of this project.
Clearly PWC conceived these reporting requirements more as an administrative
constraint from the Association than an integral part of its management
information system. The follow-on project will address that issue.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.15   Procurement  has  been   through  International  Competitive  Bidding,
international  shopping,  or  in  the  case  of  construction  of  boreholes,  a
negotiated contract with the Public Drilling Corporation, all in accordance
with the Project Agreement. Consultants were appointed in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers, with the
exception of consultants used to carry out the study of urban growth.  In that
case,  through  lack  of  experience  of  Bank  procedures,  the  Ministry  of
Construction appointed a consultant who had undertaken similar assignments and
had good working relationship with them without obtaining necessary prior
approvals. Following review of the circumstances of selection and appointment
of this Consultant, the Association subsequently agreed to PWC's selection.
3.16   Delays in project completion resulted in delays in disbursement of the
Association's Credit by almost two years as indicated in Annex 4.
Costs
3.17   Total project costs (Annex 3) amounted to US$4.57 million, compared to
US$4.40 million at appraisal (YD 1.58 million compared to YD 1.52 million), or



- 7 -
about a 41 cost overrun.  Total foreign costs increased from US$3.5 million to
US$3.9 million or an 11  cost overrun.  The foreign cost component increased
from 801 of the total project cost as estimated at appraisal to 86Z actual.
3.18   Details of the variations in cost of components are indicated in Annex
3. They are in general the result of changes in scope of the project as
described in paras. 3.02 to 3.08 and are summarized below:
(i)   the reduction in cost of the initial two production bores was more
than offset by the considerably greater cost of the larger number
of exploratory bores, (US$0.67 million extra);
(ii)   in the cost of repairs and improvements, and of expansion of the
system, including the deletion of the Sharj reservoir resulted in a
reduction of US$1.31 million;
(iii)   changes of scope of the health education component by deletion of
the consultancy for technical assistance in health education
resulted in a cost reduction of US$0.18 million;
(iv)   increased scope and cost of consultant studies due to the increased
amount of investigation required to locate adequate water resources
increased costs by US$0.32 million; and
(v)   cost of warehouses and related facilities was in reased by US$0.67
million.
Performance of Consultants' Contractors and Suppliers
3.19   There were no procurement problems associated with the project.  All
suppliers of goods and civil works contractors for the improvement of the
water distribution network performed satisfactorily.
3.20   Borehole  dri'ling was carried out by the Public Drilling Corporation
(PDC).  Its performance was very slow due to poor o:ganization and inadequate
equipment.  Equipment required for pump testing and other testing of boreholes
could often not be made available when required, leading to delays and
difficulty in interpreting the complex hydrogeological situation of the area.
Recently, PWC decided to procure drilling equipment directly and to hand it
over to PDC for use on PWC projects.
3.21   Consultant performance was generally creditable.   They demonstrated a
high degree of skill in interpreting hydrogeological information and provided
good service to PWC in preparation of the follow-on project.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01   The main project components were put into operation between 1983 and
1987, or up to three years later than foreseen at appraisal.   They have now
been in operation for up to four years and are working satisfactorily. Actual
water production and consumption in the city of Al Mukalla ir. the years up to



- 8 -
1986 were close to appraisal estimates.   The water shortage foreseen at the
time of appraisal  has  in fact  happened.   Because of  the  l1iger  time than
anticipated to locate an adequate water source, this deficit will continue
longer than expected and consequently become more serious.  At the same time,
population growth has exceeded expectations at appraisal, and this will
exacerbate  this water  shortage.   Water consumption per person was about 40
litres per day at the time of appraisal and remained at about that level until
1987 before increasing to almost 50 litres per day.  The estimated demand of
about 80 litres per person per day will not be met until the follow-on project
is completed in 1993.
4.02   Reduction of unaccounted-for water was not a stated objective of the
project.  However, for the city of Al Mukalla it has been reduced from about
402 at appraisal to 28.5S in 1986 as a result of improved management of the
branch and improvements to the distribution network carried out under the
project.   The  follow-on project  includes a component which  is expected  to
further reduce this figure, and improve PWC's op -rational efficiency.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01   PWC's  projected  and  actual  Income  Statements,  Balance  Sheets,  and
Sources and Applications of Funds for the six years 1981-1986 are presented in
Annex 5.
Financial Performance
5.02   In the period 1981-8', PWC's water sold increased at an average annual
rate of 6.72 as compared to 7.1% expected at appraisal.  Average revenue per
cubic meter increased by an average annual rate of 3.01 compared to 6.01
projected at appraisal.  Thus total actual revenues increased by an average of
12.0% per annum as compared with appraisal estimates of 13.11.   In the same
period, expenses before depreciation increased by 6.6% compared to 6.41
projected.
5.03   Throughout the 1981-86 period, net income before depreciation and after
taxes was sufficient to satisfy PWC's revenue covenant which called for
revenues to cover the sum of operating expenses before depreciation and debt
service.  It should be noted that beginning in 1982, PWC's income was taxed at
a rate of 85% as compared with 37.51 at the time of appraisal.  It must also
be noted that until  1983 PWC had no long-term debt.  Furthermore, the newly
incurred debt benefitted from a five-year grace period and  therefore  PWC's
debt service was negligible in the period under review.
5.04   In the same period, PWC installed about 16,000 connections, as compared
to 9,000 foreseen at appraisal.   It apppears that unaccounted for water had
been underestimated at the time of appraisal.  Actually, it was reduced from
36.81 in 1981 to 27.52 in 1986, as compared to 32.11 and 26.01 respectively
projected at appraisal.  The actual operating ratio improved from 80.3 to 72.0
as compared to 84.0 and 73.5 respectively at appraisal.  In all of the years
under review, the return on average unrevalued net fixed assets in operation
was over 101.  At the end of 1986, PWC had a current ratio of 2:3 and a debt
to equity ratio of 36:64.  This favorable financial performance was due to



- 9 -
good control over operating expenses, regular tariff increases, and sizeable
Government equity contributions.
5.05   The debt limitation covenant called for PWC not to incur debt without
prior agreement with the Association unless its net revenues would cover its
maximum future debt service at least 1.2 times.  Since 1978, the Association
has participated in practically all major expansions of PWC and reviewed and
given its assent to PWC's expansion and financing plans.  It should be pointed
out, however, that this covenant has always been a difficult test to meet
because it coinpares the level of revenues at the time debt is incurred with
the debt service after incurring the new debt, instead of the revenues which
will result from the assets for which the new debt is incurred.  In a recent
credit, this covenant was changed so that future revenues are compared with
Euture debt service requirements.
Financing of PWC's Investment Program
5.06   A comparison of PWC's projected and actual investment financing plan
during the six years 1981-86 is shown below.

PWC's investment program at YD23.4 million was marginally less than originally
projected.  PWC's internal cash generation was in line with projections.  The
Government's contribution increased from YD6.9 million to YD13.1 million or



- 10 -
90X mainly resulting from the transfer to PWC of Arab Fund and OPEC Special
Fund resources  in the form of equity contribution instead of  loans.   About
YD3.2 million or about 242 of this equity contribution, however, was financed
by income tax paid by PWC during the seven year period.  PWC debt equity ratio
of 36:64 at the end of 1986 was very satisfactory.
Audits
5.07   Under  the  then  existing  covenant,  PWC  was  to  have  its  financial
statements for each fiscal year audited and sent to the Association with the
auditors report within six months of the end of each fiscal year.  This was
subsequently changed (Credit 1739-YDR) to five months for forwarding of
financial statements and nine months for certified statements and auditors
report.  Recently there have been delays of about 6 months in submission of
auditors reports, and so far that for 1986 has not been received.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization
6.01   Consultants  engaged  under  the  engineering  project  (Credit  S-21-YDR)
prepared  proposals  for  improving  PWC  organization.   These  proposals  were
accepted by the Government and PWC and implementation was approved in 1981 by
Ministerial   Decision   No 16-1981.    The   current   organization   chart   is
presented in Annex 6.  PWC's Board consists of eight senior employees under
the Chairmanship of the General Manager.  The Board is responsible for taking
all major decisions but Government approval must be secured before certain
decisions are implemented, including inter alia the operational and investment
budgets, setting of tariffs and borrowing.  The new organization is operating
satisfactorily.   PWC accounting and administrative procedures have also been
substantially improved and a computer billing system successfully implemented
in Aden.
Staffing
6.02   In  1979,  PWC  had  a  staff  of  960 employees  which  gave a ratio of
16 employees per 1,000 connections.   This level was considered excessive and
PWC's management developed a program to reduce this level through attrition.
Progress was made in reducing the ratio to 14.5 per 1,000 connections by 1986
(Annex 7) but further staff reduction is still required.  The staffing issue
will be addressed during the implementation of the follow-on project.  PWC has
recruited a substantial number of graduates during the past five years and now
has  about   24  engineers   and  three   graduates   in  the  accounting   and
administration departments.  A substantial number of technicians has also been
recruited.  However, these recent recruits lack professional experience.   PWC
has continued to engage the two advisors employed as part of the previous
Greater Aden Water Supply Project (Credit 1038-YDR) to provide guidance to
their staff.



- 11 -
6.03   Training under this project applied to the health education component
only, and covered courses in health education for two staff members of the
local office of the Health Department.   These courses,  totaling about four
months in duration, were organized by WHO and held in Sudan and Jordan. Since
completion of these courses, the trainees have taken an active part in
community health education by working with several community groups.  During
the past five years training of PWC's staff has been supported with funds
provided under Credits 1038-YDR and 1418-YDR.  oaout 50S of PWC's staff or 550
have  participated  in  the  Corporation's  training  program.   About  50 staff
members have attended technical institutes abroad for engineering, planning
and admiaistrative courses in the water supply field.   PWC staff has also
participated in courses in administration and accounting organized by local
institutions.   In addition, PWC has organized training courses  in technical
disciplines  (plumbing,  pipe  laying)  for its own employees.   The follow-on
project   includes   further   training   and   technical   assistance   covering
particularly operation and maintenance procedures.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Objectives
7.01     The specific objective of increasing water production from the Wadi
Buwaysh borefield to 90 1/sec has not been achieved.  However production from
all existing sources has been optimized and the water supply system developed
to a stage where it can meet, although with some constraints, the coming
critical years before the follow-on production development project comes into
service,  i.e.  1993.   New water  sources have been identified and detailed
designs of new production facilities to meet the water demand up to year 2005
have  been  prepared.   Health  education  training has been carried out,  and
community health education both in Al Mukalla and in surrounding areas is
continuing,  apparently with good results.   All in all, the major project's
objectives have been met.
Least Cost Solution
7.02     The extensive investigations of water resources completed under the
project were carried out to enable the least cost solution to be determined
for the follow-on project. Such a least cost solution has now been adopted in
selection of An Naga'ah borefield for development. Rehabilitation of existing
water distribution networks also represented the least cost solution.
Economic Rate of Return
7.03     Using incremental water revenues  as a minimum measure of economic
benefits, the economic rate of return has been calculated at about 62 compared
to 102 at appraisal.   This reduction has been brought about mostly by  the
revenue shortfall resulting from the limited success in increasing water
production from Wadi Buwaysh and the additional cost incurred to extract water
from this Wadi and other sources.



-12 -
IDA Performance
7.04     IDA's supervision missions were adequately staffed and the frequency
of about two missions per annum was satisfactory.   With a view to improving
PWC's reporting performance, IDA provided a detailed format for the quarterly
reports.   However,  IDA failed to convince PWC of the value of well conceived
quarterly reports as a monitoring and management tool and PWC has not
continued to prod-_e adequate quarterly reports.  IDA also failed to cause any
action to be taken early in the project to have the Health Department initiate
the health education program, which was consequently delayed by about three
years (para. 3.08). On the other hand, IDA's flexible approach to the project
allowed for the necessary changes to be made to satisfy the evolving water
resource investigations.
7.05     During the seven years this project has been under construction, the
Assaciation developed and financed with PWC two additional projects, which
reflects the mutual confidence developed between the two institutions during
the period, and a follow-on water production development project for Al
Mukalla prepared during the project has been recently presented to the Board
for consideration.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01     This project has been effective in preparing a new project which will
meet the long-term water needs of the city of Al Mukalla.  Al Mukalla is in an
extremely water-short area and the follow-on project could represent the last
chaice of being able to supply water by conventional means, rather than with
very expensive  desalinated water.   Thorough and wide ranging invastigationr
over a period of almost seven years were necessary to identify a satisfactory
source which will now be exploited by the follow-on project.  For the period
up to completion cf the new project, the rehabilitation work undertaken during
this project has helped to develop the town's water supply to a stage where
conditions will be tolerable, if not as good as may be desired.   The health
education component has been effective in developing the ability of health
educators in the city, and they in turn have helped raise the awareness of
health issues amongst the population.
Lessons Learned
8.02     The project  confirms  the importance  of  the practice now generally
used to appraise only on the basis of detailed engineering studies (para.
3.04).  Thorough investigations should be undertaken prior to appraisal where
it is proposed to utilize groundwater  in such arid areas as PDRY.   To have
proceeded with major works for improving infiltration in the wadis, prior to
the investigations carried out under this project, may have caused serious
loss and embarrassment for PWC and the Association. Problems experienced with
the implementation of the health educatioun component demonstrate the need to
ensure that coordination of actions among all relevant ministries is fully
accepted (para. 3.08) and that the cost of such actions is properly allocated
(para.  3.13).   An implementation period of only three and a half years, as
