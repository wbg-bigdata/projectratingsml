MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENIt OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS TO
THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS AND MAURITFUS MARINE AUTHORITY
FOR A PORT DEVELOPMENT & ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION PROJECT
1.  I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed US$23.4 million Single Currency Loan to the Mauritius Marine Authority
(MMA), with a maturity of 15 years, including a 5-year grace period, at the Bank's
LIBOR-based variable lending rate; and on a proposed US$7.1 million Single Currency
Loan to the Republic of Mauritius with a maturity of 15 years, including a 5-year grace
period, at the Bank's LIBOR-based variable rate, for (i) onlending (US$6.6 million) to the
Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA) and (ii) a grant (US$0.5 million) to MMA and the
Directorate of Shipping (DS) of the Ministry of Trade and Shipping, to help enhance
Mauritian  transport and  trade competitiveness in the maritime  sector, in  an
environmentally sound manner.
2.    Country Economic and Sector Background. Mauritius is one of the third
world's success stories.  Over a period of just under a quarter-century, the country
transformed itself from a sugar-dependent economy with a per-capita income of US$300
(1970), to a middle-income country with a per capita income of about US$3,000 (1993),
led by a vibrant export-based industrial sector. However, Mauritius now faces some
constraints to further rapid growth as a result of structural changes in the domestic
economy and trends in international markets. On the home front, low-priced labor has
been fully absorbed into the economy, and enterprises face full employment-induced wage
pressures; current environmental stresses reflect the rapid growth of the last two decades
and require an appropriate regulatory framework, as well as investment, for improved
pollution control. On the international front, Mauritius' sugar exports are facing increased
uncertainty regarding continued access to EU markets at preferential prices, while stiffer
competition is arising in the textile industry from new low-cost producers. In order to
ensure continued rapid, sustainable and equitable growth, the country is now addressing
these constraints through a new strategic agenda including diversification of production
and exports, improvement of efficiency, and protection of the environment.
3.    The island's only international port is in Port-Louis, the capital. It plays a key role
in the national economy as it carries over 95% of the country's imports and exports. The
port's through-put increased to 3.4 million tons in 1994, while container freight reached
96,000 TEUs, doubling over the last seven years. This performance is facilitated by the
port's swift customs clearing procedures which are now being further improved by the
acquisition of the latest Electronic Trade Facilitation System (ETFS), to allow advance
processing of ship manifests and custom declarations. MMA, which manages the port
facilities has operated profitably and invested in the upgrading of facilities and dredging
works that permitted reclamation from the sea of a large stretch of land now available for
port use. In addition, the Mauritius Government created the Mauritius Freeport Authority
(MFA) in 1992, to help transform Mauritius into a regional entrep6t trade center
I



providing tax- and red tape-free zones for import, light processing, and re-export of
goods.
4.    The port's capacity is now inadequate for handling its growing container traffic due
to insufficient mechanization of operations. In addition, port services are not as efficient
or competitive as required by the business community. MMA functions unsatisfactorily as
a port operator through the Cargo Handling Corporation (CHC) and lacks authority for
the management and use of land within port limits. CHC, owned by MMvIA and the
Government, is the sole port stevedoring operator. CHC is inefficient due mainly to: (i)
overlapping functions between MMA and CHC; and (ii) the under-utilization of the
capital-intensive port infrastructure and handling equipment as the port does not operate
around the clock, seven days a week. Further, port tariffs are not cost based and cargo
handling charges are high.  The present institutional framework does not allow for
transparent and efficient operations, and in particular, MMA and CHC combined are about
30% overstaffed, with no formal performance criteria set for CHC, while the newly
created MFA has still to develop its role. At the same time, environmental concerns
arising from the unsafe location of hazardous goods, haphazard enforcement of
regulations and operational procedures, and pollution by ship waste of coastal and
international waters need to be addressed to permit an environmentally safe utilization of
the port's potential.
5.    To address the above constraints, the Government is seeking to reform the port
subsector. Studies have been completed, with proposals for the revision of the Corporate
Acts governing the institutional framework of MMA, CHC and MFA. New standards for
port operators are also being defined to address, in particular, efficiency in handling
operations, environmental and safety issues. In addition, an expansion of the container
handling capacity is planned to about 250,000 TEU by the year 2015, through a new
mechanized container terminal.
6.    Project Objectives.  The key objective of the project is to support GOM's
strategy for sustainable long-term growth through improvements in the efficiency and
competitiveness of port services, in an environmentally sound manner. To this end, the
project would: (i) increase port productivity, efficiency and capacity to meet the demand
of port users at competitive rates through extension of facilities, mechanization and
improved management of MMA, CHC, and MFA; (ii) re-define the institutional role of
MLMA as a landlord port authority responsible for regulating and controlling port and
maritime activities, port land management and development in line with the Port Master
Plan, working through a system of competitive concession contracts with performance
indicators for port operations; (iii) support the development of MFA to promote Mauritius
as an attractive tax-free base for regional entrep6t trade and transshipment; and (iv)
accompany port development with sound environmental protection, including pollution
control and safety enhancement.
2



7.    Project Description.  The proposed project, with a total estimated cost of
US$100.2 million equivalent, would include the following three parts:
Part A. Port Development (MMAI) for US$89.3 million. This would include:
(i) strengthening MMvA's mandate as a commercially-oriented landlord port authority,
fostering streamlined cargo handling operations through concession contracts with port
operators, including CHC; CHC would henceforth buy or lease the cargo handling
equipment currently put at its disposal by MMA and would open its capital to private
investors; (ii) improvement in the management and operations of MMA and CHC through
the implementation of their corporate plans, including organizational restructuring to
achieve inter-alia, cost containment and rational marketing and pricing; (iii) construction
of a new container and oil terminal and procurement of related equipment, including two
gantry cranes for container handling; a passenger terminal building and an internal road
network for new port areas; civil works to relocate oil and gas storage; and (iv)
supervision contracts for civil works, and specialized short-term assistance to develop and
implement actions needed to strengthen MMA.
Part B. Freeport Development (MFA) for US$8.9 million. This would include:
(i) a study on the modalities for liberalization of the national regime governing air
transport licensing, (such liberalization would allow for chartering of cargo planes to
facilitate sea-air transshipment activities and take into account reciprocity in international
air traffic agreements); (ii) implementation of a targeted trade development strategy
through the execution of MFA's corporate plan to strengthen its organization and
operations as well as rationalize its marketing and pricing; (iii) site preparation of 15
hectares of land at Mer Rouge, including the construction of roads and an office building;
and (iv) supervision contracts for civil works, and specialized short-term assistance to
strengthen management, operations and training at MFA.
Part C. Environment Protection for US$2. 0 million. This would include:
(i) a study to define the requirements and to design facilities for collection and disposal of
land and ship-based oily waste, and to draft regulations required to enforce safety in port
operation and control vessels' sea-worthiness; (ii) construction of facilities and acquisition
of equipment for collection and pre-treatment of oily wastes, and (iii) supervision
contracts for civil works and equipment and training to fight oil spills and control vessels'
sea-worthiness..
8.    Project Financing and Implementation. The financing plan for the project was
firmed up with cofinanciers during appraisal (schedule A, page 3). The Bank would
finance US$23.4 million for MMA's civil works, equipment, supervision contracts and
specialized short term assistance, with a Single Currency Loan (SCL), jointly and in equal
amount with the Accelerated Cofinancing Facility of the Export-Import Bank of Japan
(JExIm). The eligibility of MMA for a SCL under the Pilot Program was confirmed
during appraisal. The Government of Luxembourg has provided a grant in the amount of
3



US$1.0 million for technical assistance to MFA. Financing by the European Investment
Bank (EIB) in the amount of US$19.7 million for the new container gantry cranes and
heavy yard handling equipment, and by the private sector in the amount of US$9.7 million
for light yard handling equipment, oil and gas pipeline relocation, as well as facilities for
the collection and pre-treatment of oily waste, would be confirmed, or a suitable
alternative plan would be presented to the Bank by the Borrowers, by December 31, 1996.
In addition, the Bank would finance US$7.1 million for MFA's initial phase of site
preparation (US$6.6 million), and a grant to MMA (US$0.3 million) and the Directorate
of Shipping (US$0.2 million) for the environment protection component, with a Single
Currency Loan to the Republic of Mauritius. The project would be implemented over a
six-year period by MMA, MFA, and the Directorate of Shipping.  Works and/or
equipment procured under IBRD and ACF financing would be in accordance with IBRD
Procurement Guidelines. The project will be completed by June 30, 2001, and the loans
will be closed by December 31, 2001.
9.    The single-currency, US dollar-based loan offers significant value to MMA, which
earns most of its revenue in US dollars; the SCL's long-term, 15-year maturity spreads
better the annual financing costs for MMA, compared to its short-term and higher-cost
alternative option. The same terms or better were secured for the project's cofinancing
arrangements (JExIm and EIB).  The anticipated private sector equity financing of
equipment would reduce reliance on debt financing.  Such financing sources include
Mauritius' emerging stock market, thus furthering capital market-strengthening, consistent
with an ongoing IFC project (Ln. 3699).
10.   Lessons From  Previous Bank Involvement.  The Bank has financed three
projects in Mauritius' transport sector: a port extension and modernization project at Port-
Louis in 1974, (Ln. 976-MAS) and two highway projects in 1983 (Ln. 2337-MAS) and
1989 (Ln. 3132-MAS).  The projects' implementation was satisfactory, as stated in
completion reports. This success stemmed mainly from: (i) good institutional capacity; (ii)
strong ownership as a result of involving institutions from the outset; and (iii) strong
follow-through on the part of the authorities, once decisions were made.
11.   The Bank is financing an Environmental Monitoring and Development project (Ln.
3277-MAS) which is seeking, inter alia, to develop a comprehensive framework of
environmental policy and an evolving legislation to provide Mauritius with a sustainable
program of continued development with adequate and appropriate environmental
protection. The project also supports the establishment of a conservation program and
management plan for a maritime resource and monitoring program.  The project
implementation, initially delayed by the large number of institutions affected, is
satisfactory.
12.   Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  Thte Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) was reviewed by the Board on Mlay 24, 1994. It focuses on supporting
Mauritius' strategic agenda of sustained higher economic performance based on increased
competitiveness and diversification of production and exports, including the development
of skills-intensive and service-based activities. This requires, inter alia, improving the
4



efficiency and competitiveness of key infrastructure, such as the port in an environmentally
sound manner. The proposed project would contribute to this goal. The Bank is already
supporting Mauritius' drive to reach a higher level of performance, with economic and
sector work (Mauritius-Technology Strategy for Competitiveness, Report No. 12518-
MAU, September 1994) and lending (Technical Assistance to Enhance Competitiveness
Project, Ln. 37360-MU, approved in May 1994). A Services Sector Modernization
Project is in preparation. To broaden these efforts, the Government has requested the
Bank's assistance to support and guide the modernization and extension of the port, and
achieve institutional reform, capacity extension and financial engineering.
13.   The environment component of the proposed project builds on the enactment of
the Environment Protection Act (1991), which places Mauritius at the forefront of Indian
Ocean nations on matters of environmental protection. GOM developed the strategic
agenda for port development and protection of the marine environment in line with the
Environment Protection Act and the International Convention for the Prevention of Ship
Pollution (MARPOL), addressing the protection of its coastal as well as the region's
waters. This component is significant for its demonstration value for other countries in the
area of marine pollution and vessel safety control and has been developed in parallel with a
plan now being examined in other neighboring islands for possible GEF regional financing.
Finally, a biodiversity conservation program for the restoration of habitats of endemic
species was prepared as part of the proposed project and is being processed separately for
GEF financing.
14.   Issues and Agreements Reached.  The following institutional changes were
agreed upon to achieve the project's development objectives: (i) restructuring of MMA to
change it to a landlord port authority, with autonomy to set tariffs, salaries and operating
standards; such a restructuring would allow MMA to ensure the quality of cargo handling
operations by awarding such operations on a competitive basis to qualified operators
under concession contracts; (ii) development of a targeted trade and marketing strategy
for MFA; (iii) revision and adoption of the Port Master Plan to serve as a framework for
future port development and investment; and (iv) measures to adequately protect the
environment within the port area and in coastal zones.
15.   Agreements were reached  during  negotiations on  the  contents of the
Government's Statement of Port Sector Reform Policy, including timetables for
implementation of the following actions: (a) revision of the Ports Act governing the
institutional structure and operation of MMA; (b) adoption of corporate plans for MMA,
CHC and M:FA, including establishment of a cost accounting system for MMA and CHC;
(c) adoption by GOM of the new Port Master Plan and delegation to MMA of the
authority to enforce such a Master Plan; (d) establishment of specific regulations for port
environment and vessel safety control and delegation to MMA of the authority to enforce
such regulations; and (e) revision of CHC's Memorandum of Association.
16.   In addition, specific agreements were also reached on the following key
undertakings: (i) establishment by December 31, 1996, of a concession contract between
MMA and CHC with terms acceptable to the Bank; (ii) preparation by MMA, by February
5



28, 1997, of a concession contract acceptable to the Bank for the operations of the new
container terminal, and award by December 31, 1997, of such a contract to a qualified
port operator acceptable to the Bank; (iii) performance indicators for MMA to ensure
satisfactory cash flow generation and CHC for cargohandling rates, productivity and
equipment availability; and (iv) provision by MMA and MFA of annual audited statements
to the Bank.
17.   Conditions for Effectiveness are: (i) for the loan to MMA, all conditions precedent
to the initial disbursement of the JExIm Loan, and (ii) for the loan to GOM, execution of
the subsidiary Loan Agreement for MFA and all conditions precedent to the initial
disbursement of the MMA loan.
18.   Project Sustainability. The project would ensure adequate cost recovery from
users for maintenance and amortization of equipment. MMA and MFA would generate
satisfactory cash flow to sustain their operations. To this end, financial covenants would
ensure adequate tariffs and costs containment measures to maintain port profitability, and
competitiveness with comparable ports in the region.  To help ensure institutional
sustainability, the project would (i) eliminate duplications of functions between MMA and
CHC; (ii) improve management of MMA and MFA; and (iii) expand private sector
involvement for efficiency.
19.   Environmental and Social Impacts. The project is classified as Environment
Category B. A specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out for the
construction of the new container terminal, in accordance with guidelines of the Mauritius
Environment Protection Act (1991). It concluded that the facilities would pose no
significant threat to the land and marine environment. The report has been approved by
Mauritius and an EIA license has been granted to MMA. This report is now public and
has been received by the Bank and forwarded to the PIC. The civil works will be
executed in accordance with the provisions of the Mauritius Environment Protection Act,
and detailed design and contractual arrangements have been prepared to comply with such
provisions and the recommendations of the EIA on noise and other potential works-
related disturbances. In addition, a study is being finalized to recommend improvement
measures where needed, in the environmental safeguards of businesses currently operating
in the port. Further, the project will address the issue of the unsafe location and current
operations by private oil companies of hazardous goods--gasoline--by facilitating the
relocation of facilities for such goods. Finally, the environment component of the project
would bring the port of Port-Louis up-to-date with environmental standards for ports
(defined by international conventions such as MARPOL and OPRC), including the
establishment of the capacity for ship technical control for sea-worthiness and safe
disposal of oily waste to minimize pollution of coastal and international waters. MIMA
would be granted the authority to, and its staff trained to enforce port safety regulations
on existing and future port operations. Hence, the project would contribute to enhancing
the implementation of the Mauritius Environment Protection Act. The project would also
have a substantial and positive social impact by (i) providing more efficient and reliable
6



conditions for Mauritius' trade, and (ii) helping indirectly to generate new business in the
international trading sector, thus expanding employment.
20.   Project Objective Categories.  (a) Private Sector Development: the project
would help secure private investment and management at MFA while preparing the
ground for future competition in the port sector; (b) Environment: the project would
contribute to marine environmental protection and port and vessel safety enhancement;
and (c) Economic Management: the project would promote modernization of management
in the port institutions.
21.   Participatory Approach. The proposed project was prepared by the Government
of Mauritius, MMA, CHC and MFA, with the Bank helping to guide the process. All
interested parties, including port users and labor unions participated in the planning of the
institutional studies as well as in the review of conclusions prior to their adoption by the
Government. The full participation of the beneficiary entities has generated broad-based
support for the project, including its institutional and managerial objectives, as well as
investment components.
22.   Project Benefits. The economic rate of return for the new container and oil
terminal is estimated at around 19%. By improving the competitiveness of the country's
maritime transport and trade, the project would support the development of international
and regional entrep6t trade, both of which are important for continued rapid and
sustainable growth of the Mauritian economy. Transport costs would be lowered through
reduced ship and cargo waiting time. The port would benefit from better land use, in
particular for prime areas reclaimed from the sea. The regulatory roles and organization
of MMA and MFA would be strengthened to make both agencies more responsive to the
needs of private investors and operators. MMA and MEA are expected to generate
satisfactory cash flow under the project.
23.   Risks. The project is subject to three risks: (i) possible partial implementation of
the proposed institutional changes, especially addressing the labor redundancies at MNMA
and CHC; (ii) the effect of the annual cyclonic storms on the operations of the new
terminal; and (iii) for MMA and MFA, the interest rate risk associated with a LIBOR-
based SCL. The first risk has been minimized through the use of client consultation and
beneficiary participation. The second risk has been mitigated by analyzing the possibilities
of weather-related loss and building the appropriate level of precaution into the design of
the berth to enable it to withstand waves of even exceptional storms.  In addition,
provisions have been made to have gantry cranes secured to the ground, and yard
equipment moved to safe shelters during such storms. Also, a reasonable number of days
of operation have been deducted from benefits to take into account possible interruption
of the port's operations on such occasions. For the third risk, while the LIBOR-based
interest rate of the SCL is volatile and poses a risk, MMA and MFA estimate that the
benefits of reduced currency exposure that it affords outweigh the interest rate risk.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic rate of return for the new terminal could
fall to 16% in the event of a combination of the risks materializing.

24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loans will comply with the
Articles of Agreement, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve them.

PROJECT LIPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT STATUS
Mauritius' performance in the implementation of its Bank-associated projects has
traditionally matched the high quality of its economic management. As part of the
country's drive to reach a higher level of economic performance, the focus of new
operations has become directed towards more complex institutional goals, often requiring
for their achievement, the cooperation of various interest groups. This has led to slow
preparation of projects and delayed start-up of implementation and slow disbursement.
For example, the preparation of the Industrial and Vocational Training Project was slow,
as it required close cooperation between GOM and the private sector. Similarly, the
effectiveness of the Bagasse Energy Development Project was delayed by time-consuming
negotiations of contracts between GOM and the prospective private sector partner in the
project. Efforts made in FY94 to resolve start-up difficulties are beginning to yield
results. Staffing problems that delayed the inception of activities under the Agricultural
Management and Services Project (AMSP) have been overcome.   The contract
negotiations under the Sugar Energy Development Project (SEDP) have been concluded
and project implementation has begun. All projects have implementation manuals and a
project workshop was held in May 1995 to launch the newest addition to the portfolio--
Higher and Technical Education. Mauritius has no problem projects and no issues of
counterpart funding. Procurement problems also do not exist. The key implementation
problem of the Mauritian portfolio of recent years--slow pace of implementation of a new
range of projects--is being addressed by intensified supervision efforts aimed at facilitating
and speeding-up decision-making among the interested parties. With the addition of two
new projects in FY94-95, the disbursement ratio in FY95 may well be under 10%,
considerably below the 19.8% achieved in FY94. Consequently, sustained efforts are
needed to return Mauritius to its former superior rating.
