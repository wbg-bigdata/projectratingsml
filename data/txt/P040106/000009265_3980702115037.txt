Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The purpose of the Project is to promote increased socio-economic growth of the Ecuadorian economy
using as an instrument international trade development and integration with the global economy. Cross-country
research shows that local integration with the global economy tends to accelerate growth and can yield poverty
alleviating benefits, as international trade and investment act as conduits to best international practice knowledge,
skills and technologies (see Box 1). The Project uses strategic leverage to:
*  at the national Government level, modernize the State's institutional framework for international trade
management and increase international trade market access. In this respect, the Project embodies (a)
legislative and regulatory reforms, most of which has already been adopted by the Governmenl: under
Project preparation, (b) intensive training of staff in trade management and negotiations, (c)
upgrading of facilities and information technology, and (d) preparation of diagnostics and reform
proposals to remove public sector impediments to firm-level international competitiveness; and
*  at the firm level, catalyze entrepreneurial learning and innovation mainly among smaller firms. This
Project component will be implemented by a new public-private sector partnership institution, The
Export and Investment Promotion Corporation in order to (a) undertake public campaigns,
information technology and distance learning which build a broader awareness of the unique benefits
of outward-oriented growth; (b) cofinance demand-driven, firm-specific international competitiveness
programs aimed to generate new export market linkages with potential business partners; (c)
cofinance a pilot effort to support those qualified NGO programs providing extension services aimed
to build indirect and direct export links of low-income microbusinesses; and (d) develop a national
infrastructure to encourage sound product quality management systems and ISO 14000 environrnental
management practices, as well as to provide internationally recognized product quality certification
services.
The development outcome indicators for the Project are the incremental direct and indirect value added,
employment and household income derived from outward-oriented growth. The main output indicators
associated with its development objectives are (a) qualitatively, the trade policy adjustments adopted consistent
with Ecuador's World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments, and new trade agreements concluded which
substantially expand international market access, and (b) quantitatively, the incremental gains in international
business partnerships, export producers, products and destinations, and associated capital investment. Such
measurements would be made by income segment against a baseline control group established during Project
identification.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: R97-38   Date of latest CAS discussion: March 25, 1997
The Bank Group country assistance strategy (CAS), an interim strategy for FY98, focuses on (a)
increased emphasis on implementation of existing projects, (b) limited new lending which, while not being policy
intensive, is strategically targeted and has a good chance of successfully advancing poverty alleviation objectives,
and (c) non-lending services to improve the policy dialogue on poverty alleviation and reform objectives.
The Bank's 1995 Ecuador Poverty Report, reflected in the CAS, notes that a successful poverty reduction

Country: Ecuador                                                                   Project Title: International Trade and Integration
strategy should include an effort to develop sustained labor-intensive growth which generates employment
opportunities and higher incomes for the poor, including via increased participation of women in the market
labor force.
The CAS also seeks to ensure close collaboration with other parts of the Bank Group and IDB to pursue,
among other things, an integrated approach to private sector development issues. In this regard, IFC is
currently pursuing investments to expand fixed assets of a large existing exporter and a concession to
rehabilitate a main road link in Ecuador's export corridor. MIGA currently has four contracts in Ecuador,
all in the financial sector, for a total of US$42 million of coverage. Nine additional preliminary
applications have been received for projects in power generation, telecom, tourism, oil and gas, and
finance. In addition, the proposed project is mutually supporting of other Bank projects which are vital to

increased international competitiveness, in particular, the Modernization of the State (MOSTA Project)---which
has been a very important springboard for the Project's public sector component, better efficiency and service of
telecommunications and electricity utilities (PERTAL Project), and the IDB's Transport Sector Loan, which is
coordinated with the Customs' duty drawback system of the proposed Project (see Section D2 for details).

domestic consumption---6. 1 % per year on
average over 1991-95, or more than 4 percentage points higher than the growth of world output.
One of the expectations of Ecuador's government in the first half of the 1990s was that the country
would derive substantial development advantages from this outward-oriented growth dynamic through a wide
variety of "first generation" reforms---in the trade regime, foreign investment regulations, taxation, the financial
sector, privatization of key enterprises and modemization of government administration. Most quantitative
import restrictions were eliminated, tariff levels reduced from an unweighted average of 30% to 9.3% (and a
weighted average of 6.8%) and 30 tariff categories cut to 5 in accordance with the common extemal tariff of the
Andean Pact. Foreign exchange markets were unified and a customs law passed to simplify proceclures.
Ecuador also joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 21, 1996, under which many second-
generation trade barriers have been or are scheduled to be eliminated. l
While these steps have and will continue to encourage Ecuadorian firmns to increase their internalional
competitiveness, Ecuador remains far from achieving the expected boost in integration with intemational markets
and economic growth:
long-term GDP growth (1985-95) averaged a slim 1.2% per capita, a trend which only deteriorated over
1996-97 and tumed per capita growth negative;
These include: (a) exemptions of import duties to less than 5% of total imports for items permitted by law (primarily public sector
entities, non-commercial private entities and educational institutions); (b) the system of agricultural price bands, now operating
within the duty binding commitments of Ecuador and will be eliminated within 7 years of accession (2003); (c) domestic content
requirements of 40% in the automotive assembly sector will be eliminated prior to the year 2000 under the Agreement on TF'IMs,
and (d) under the Project, technical barriers to trade involving testing, inspection, certification, labeling, etc. have been redluced
from 80% to 25% of the nation's total technical standards as part of Project preparation and full compliance with the Agreement on
TBTs will be accomplished during implementation.

employment creation and income diversification, particularly where rural off-farm employment and women's
labor force participation are involved. This effect is amply demonstrated by cross-country analyses suggesting
that, the faster a country grows, the more the poor benefit (see Box 5). The Bank's Poverty Report posl'ulates
from modeling work that a per capita growth rate of 3%/year over a five-year period combined with inc:reased
productivity from increased worker skills could reduce poverty from 35% to 26%, provided it was not offset by
a deterioration in income distribution from other factors.
Sector stratezy to help accelerate outward-oriented growth. Building on reforms of the early 1990s, and
supported by a strategic planning exercise during Project preparation2 the Government in collaboration with the
private sector is utilizing strategic leverage at two levels aimed to help accelerate outward-oriented economic
growth: (a) at the national level, modernizing the State's institutional framework for intemational trade
management and increasing Ecuador's international market access, and (b) at the firm level, catalyzing
entrepreneurial learning and innovation through two new public-private partnership institutions, which will
provide services especially to smaller firms through decentralized accreditation, outsourcing and other demand-
oriented services.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Outdated institutional structure for international trade management. The substantial liberalization of
Ecuador's trade regime in the early 1990s and it entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) have made
urgent the need to modernize the country's trade management institutions. Notwithstanding the Modernization
of the State Law initiative passed in 1993, Ecuador's institutional structure for trade has been highly fragmented
among various ministries, impairing good cooperation within the Government and with the private sector in trade
policy formulation and execution. The internal organization, staffing, information, analytical systems and
facilities of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Integration and Fishing (MICIP, recently renamed the Ministry
of Trade, Industry and Fishing) remain to be renovated to meet the challenges of a modern open trading system.
MICIP staff, along with those in other ministries, need detailed knowledge of WTO rules and their implications
for domestic policies, especially in areas of increasing importance like rules of origin, technical barriers to trade
(TBTs), services, intellectual property, and unfair trade remedies. They further need substantial help to improve
skills in negotiating trade agreements in order to advance Ecuador's international market access objectives---
currently, to sign free trade agreements with Mercosur, APEC and the G-3, as well as work within the Andean
Pact to improve its regional integration system in areas such as harmonization of technical standards,
accreditation of laboratories, customs procedures, rules of origin, and liberalization of services. MICIP also
lacks the information technology infrastructure to research and analyze trade policy issues on a daily basis. This
range of needs was confirmed in a survey of MICIP's own trade staff, of which 76% said that structure, budget,
staff skills and the informatics system of the Ministry are not adequately prepared to administer Ecuador's
obligations under its WTO agreement.
Another important area for institutional reform is the duty drawback system of the Custom's
Administration---when indirect taxes are embedded in the cost of exported products, competitiveness is
substantially reduced. The objective of the system is to assure speedy and cost-efficient access to production
inputs at world market prices for all firms that generate export value added (including indirect exporters, which
are domestic producers supplying intermediate goods to exporters), transparency consistent with the VITO
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and an absence of abuse. Currently, less than 10 percent
of the total number of direct exporters---and no indirect exporters---can access this system. For existing use:rs,

procedures involve a complex 12-step process, the turnaround time from application to payment was found from
user surveys to be 6-12 months and inefficiencies were high, especially for smaller firms, costing an estimated 10-
20% of the amount of the request for tax rebate.3 The current system suffers mainly from (i) widespread
misunderstanding of the drawback concept---it is a commonly viewed as a bonus for large-scale exporters rather
than to provide an equal footing in international markets; (ii) regulations that lack certain fundamental and best
practice provisions needed in a modern, transparent and effective drawback program; (iii) poor workflow,
cumbersome and unnecessary procedures and complicated forms, all of which lend themselves to delays and
abuse; (iv) high staff rotation, a lack of full-time trained staff and staff incentives, and (v) inadequate facilities and
equipment.
A further area constraining the international competitiveness of Ecuadorian firms is the metrology,
product and process standards, testing and quality system---a series of services needed to help firms achieve
requisite international product quality. Most standards are obligatory, which in most cases are unjustified,
constitute unnecessary obstacles for commerce and encourage smuggling. In contrast, there are insufficient
voluntary industry-oriented standards which reflect international best practices. Metrology, standard reference
material, calibration and laboratory services are inadequate and often not in accordance with established
international standards. There is a limited supply of certification services for quality systems and a limited
amount of quality and environmental auditors, especially those certified by international organizations. 'While
there is an increasing entrepreneurial culture, the country does not have a real consciousness of the need to use
the quality system for competitive advantage. Mechanisms are inadequate to enable firms to access information
regarding standards and regulations of the country itself and of other countries. In contrast, there is a
considerable demand for standards, testing and quality services from the private sector, including training and
certifications in ISO 9000 quality systems and ISO 14000 for environmental management systems, as reflected in
a supply-demand study conducted under Project preparation. There is also a growing interest in responding to
specialized market opportunities, such as ecologically sustainable products, which require "eco-export"
certification to reflect to consumers production techniques which protect the environment.
Broad knowledge gaps at the firm level and narrow international market linkages. Small and medium
scale enterprises (SMEs), having up to 100 employees and US$500,000 in fixed assets and producing tradable
goods, number a total of about 20,000 firms, while microbusinesses (employing fewer than 12 people) producing
tradable goods number an estimated 60-85,000.4 Together, they employ a large segment of Ecuador's
economically active population and tend to predominate in the areas of food, textiles and clothing, leather goods,
wood products, metalworking, and artisany---which generally have a relatively higher employment and income
generation effect than in services. Women entrepreneurs comprise about one-half of all microbusiness people in
Ecuador and, in some sectors, represent the majority (nearly 80% in textiles) or a significant share of producers
within an industry (food, shoes and leather, etc.).
There are some excellent examples in Ecuador of successful export entrepreneurship---most prominently
in bananas, shrimp and flowers. However, solid knowledge and experience with international markets is very
narrowly focused---nearly 70% of Ecuador's main primary exports are generated by a very limited number of
firms; some prominent industrial exports, such as assembled vehicles and pharmaceuticals, are generally exported
3 While it may appear that this low utilization is due to an export structure dominated by the agricultural and fishery goods, for
which imported input contents are negligible, exporter interviews show that the average import content even of primary export goods
are much higher than expected---for example, chemical fertilizer costs for banana growers who are indirect exporters are on average
about 30 percent of export value, and the packaging material costs for agricultural products (such as mashed banana, fresh
vegetables, shrimps, etc.) and fishery products are about 30 to 50 percent of the export value.

The narrowness of the export supply structure is mirrored in the importing structure for Ecuadorian
exports. The survey reflects that about 72% of transactions take place directly with first line importers rather
than via distribution agents, trading companies, joint venture relationships and other channels which often have
broader, more stable and sustainable buyer-seller market relationships. Very frequently, a high share of a firm's
export sales are sold to only one buyer---56%  of exporters surveyed sold more than one-half of total exports to a
single buyer.
A broad strategic assessment was done on Ecuador's export potential during project preparation
according to a number of parameters, such as overseas market growth rates of product groups, market access
(preferential tariffs), domestic production trends, and benchmarking of labor and infrastructure costs and trade
procedures against several other Latin American countries. It concluded that Ecuador has good potential,
among other things, in a number of agro-business products going beyond the bananas--shrimp--flowers lines (eg.,
various fresh and frozen fruits, juices and vegetables), in wood (eg., treated and pressed, cardboard), clol:hing,
shoes and leather goods, graphic arts and office products, ceramics and glass products, and various metal-
mechanical goods. The initial export response of the industrial sector in the past few years, albeit still a very
small portion of the export structure, seems to validate this assessment.
5The survey included 17 large, mainly traditional product exporters mainly from the coastal area, while 147 were SMEs, niainly
non-traditional product exporters about evenly distributed between the coastal and sierra regions which employed 67% of the 11,600
workers covered by the survey.

In addition, among small low-income firms, the increasing availability of low-cost information and
international market links, and the increasing capacity of many NGOs to provide assistance at grassroots
levels, makes especially indirect exporting a real business alternative for poorer communities and a motor for
growth to help alleviate poverty. For example, Grameen Uddog, an enterprise set up by Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh, markets oversees high quality handloom fabrics of low  -income village weavers.  An
International Trade Center (ITC)-sponsored Toquilla-Knitting Industry project set up cooperative
organizations which have provided access to better raw materials, improve production and promotion
methods, and train over 1,600 people, mostly women, in quality management and exporting. It yielded the
first hat and handicraft direct exports from weaving communities and increased income from direct foreign
sales totaling US400,000. Also, PEOPLink, a relatively new US-based NGO, acts as a direct on-line
marketing service for grassroots producers in Ecuador and other countries by displaying their products
digitally on its web site. To strengthen the competitiveness of these producers, PEOPLink also conveys the
knowledge through 1-2 week training courses and the technology to help producer groups prepare high
quality promotion images for their internet campaigns. The proposed Project would include a pilot initiative
to build upon these programs through successful NGOs in Ecuador, such as the Camara Nacional de
Microempresas (CANAMIEC), the Centro de Promocion y Empleo para El Sector Informal Urbano
(CEPESLU), the Fundacion Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo (FED), and the Corporacion Femenina Ecuatoriana
(CORFEC).
C: Project Description Summary
The Project is designed to help implement the 1997 Foreign Trade and Investment Law, related
regulatory adjustments and organizational changes which were developed consistent with MOSTA Guidelines for
the Modernization of the State Program. This framework was designed and completed as part of the Project's
preparation phase and is summarized in Section C2 below.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
*  Framework legislation - the 1997 Foreign Trade and Investment Law (LEXI) adopted by Congress on
June 9, 1997 with the assistance of the Project's preparation phase reinforces Ecuador's WTO
commitments and defines a new three-tier institutional structure which broadens participation and long-
term legislative stability in trade policy-making, and creates two new majority private-public partnership
institutions to help accelerate outward-oriented growth:
e  Trade policy decision-making: creates the Foreign Trade and Investment Council (COMEXI) as
a mechanism for economy-wide focus, continuity and inter-institutional coordination, and
independent assessment in trade policy decision-making. It issues trade policies and regulations
on tariff, taxes and non-tariff measures, establishes guidelines for negotiation of international
trade agreements, and defines policies and programs for outward-oriented growth. Membership
consists of the President of the Republic or his representative, five members of the Government's
Cabinet (Ministers of MICIP, Finance, Foreign Relations, Agriculture, and Tourism) and the
Presidents of the nation's five federations of chambers of exporters (2), industry, agriculture and
commerce (one each);
+  Trade policy formulation and execution - the law, along with a reorganization plan of IviCIP
approved by SENDA via Ministerial Agreement No. 0416 of December 24, 1997, consolidates
the public authority in MICIP for trade policy-making and execution and designates it as the
secretariat for COMEXI, all aimed to reduce inter-institutional conflicts, better focus scarce
talent and resources, and improve service and cost effectiveness of core regulatory functions,; and
*  Entrepreneurial learning and innovation support services - decentralizes and partially privatizes
support services promoting outward-oriented growth by creating the Export and Investment
Promotion Corporation (CORPEI and known under the trade name of "Ecuador Exporta") to
enable majority private sector-management and shared financing.

*  Technical barriers to trade - the Project would incorporate amendments to regulations to reduce second-
generation trade barriers by (a) eliminating technical barriers to trade not justified by safety, security and
environmental protection via adoption of the Code of Good Practices for Preparation, Adoption and
Application of Standards of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and (b)
demonopolizing product testing and certification services of public agencies.
*  Internationally recognized product quality accreditation system and mutual recognition agreements -
the Project would finance preparation of legislation to establish a National Quality Council, which would
provide an institutional framework to develop the national product quality management system, establish
an internationally recognized accreditation system, and conclude mutual recognition agreements. The
Project will also assist in the privatization of the commercial services of the national standards body, the
Ecuador National Institute of Standards (INEN);

domestic consumers interests in safeguards, antidumping and countervailing duty mechanisms.
3. Benefits and target population:
*  Both smaller and larger firms will benefit from  the institutional development of MICIP,  insofar as it
demonstrates increased capacity in trade policy-making and execution, in implementing WTO-consistent
unfair trade safeguards, negotiating international market-expanding trade agreements, and helping to resolve
public policy constraints to international competitiveness and outward-oriented growth. Increased firm
coverage and efficiency of the duty drawback system will also increase the international competitiveness of
exporting firms and expand indirect exporters linkages between domestic and overseas markets.

*  At least 500 mainly smaller private firms in the formal sector and 3,000 microbusinesses in the informal
sector, or about 5-10% of firms producing tradable goods across the country, are expected to benefit from
Project investments in entrepreneurial learning and innovation. Most beneficiaries are expected to be firms
with no prior international market sales, and tiie remainder exporters interested in diversifying their
product/market mix. They are expected to accrue international market awareness and know-how, forming
the basis for a change in business behavior, which in many cases will lead to increase their inte.rnational
competitiveness and outward-oriented growth. In immediate terms, this change will be reflected in new
international business market partners---market and product information sources, suppliers, private
associations, potential buyers, potential foreign investors, etc. Later, where decisions are made to adapt and
promote products overseas, it should be measurably reflected in changes at the firm level in (i) value added
(mainly wages and profits) in export products and new employment, (ii) export orientation (exports share in
total sales), (iii) export market linkages (number of products exported, number and type of overseas buyer
relationships), and/or (iv) linkages to domestic producers as indirect exporters (share of local raw materials,
intermediate & finished goods in product cost).
*  These direct benefits should be the basis in many cases for new capital investment for export production and
also be accompanied by indirect spillover effects on the domestic economy, as the international know-how
and experience gained is acquired through indirect exporters, the mobility of trained personnel, new
entrepreneurship, and the demonstration effects of new product designs, technologies embedded in new
imported equipment, etc.
* The Project should also provide a demonstration effect to policy-makers and other domestic-market firms of
the opportunities for growth provided by increased integration with the global economy.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Management. MICIP will have overall responsibility   InternationiTrade And -ntegrationprojet
for execution of the Project, while COMEXI will evaluate              nip -   S  Ui .
Project progress  and  impact against agreed  targets.               Project Director
Execution of the Project would be carried out by two                 ocurerhent Manage .
managing agencies: (1) MICIP would implement Component --            Ficia Manager
1 (modernizing international trade management and increasing  2 Sta i AdAdminist a tve Asistants:-0 :
market access, and customs), utilizing one full-time training
specialist in MICIP to coordinate the training program and one duty drawback specialist in the Customs
Administration. It would also administer the Product Quality Program under the day-to-day guidance of a
full-time coordinator and a twinning contract with INEN and a qualified standards organization; and (ii)
CORPEI would be responsible for the Ecuador Exporta Program, supported by a management contract to
operate both the Learning and Innovation Fund and the Grassroots Growth Fund. The Bank loan for these
purposes would be passed on as a grant from the Government to CORPEI under a subsidiary agreement,
excepting that $1.0 of the estimated total $1.5 million management contract would be lent as a loan to
CORPEI mirroring the Bank's interest rate and commitment fee with a 10 year repayment period. The
management contract would ensure that these two financing instruments are operated on a fully demand-
driven basis and in accordance with the agreed Operating Manuals designed to minimize the risk of misuse.
Core support services needed for such execution will be provided by the Project's Technical Services Unit
(TSU) in MICIP. The TSU has already been setup, having been established in mid-1996 to manage Project
preparation. The Unit gained considerable experience in program management, procurement and financial



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 15
Country: Ecuador                                           Project Title: International Trade and Integration
management, including via a number of Bank-sponsored seminars in Ecuador on Bank norms and procedures
for financial management, procurement and disbursements.  TSU continuity will be maintained from the
design phase and two-year contracts concluded to cover the 1998-99 delivery phase and provide for renewal
with satisfactory performance.
The TSU's specific responsibilities will be as follows:
* Carry out the Project Launch Plan for 1998;
+ Perform all Project procurement functions according to the Bank's Guidelines in coordination with
the managing agencies;
* Perform all Project financial management functions, including management of Bank loan
disbursements;
* Prepare annually by November 30 with inputs from the managing agencies and in agreement with the
Bank an Annual Action Plan for the years 1999-2002;
* Prepare Quarterly Project Monitoring and Evaluation Reports on execution and impact against agreed
performance targets. Quarterly reports would include financial management reporting used to
monitor progress and future disbursements;
* Hold a Project Midterm Review by December 31, 1999;
* Prepare the borrower's portion of the Project Implementation Completion Report in coordination
with the managing agencies; and
v Ensure general Project coordination between COMEXI and the managing agencies.
Project Financial management. The TSU will manage Project funds under a Project-specific financial
management system for accounting, reporting, and auditing. This system is defined in the TSU's Manual of
Administrative-Financial Procedures, which includes eight separate chapters on: financial management
responsibilities, procedures, documentary formats for use of the Special Account, procurement of goods and
services, the Integrated Accounting System, internal documentary controls and inventory controls over office
equipment and supplies. The Integrated Accounting System, covering essentially budgets, commitments,
contracting, and disbursements under the Project, has been expanded from the one used by the Unit during
project preparation. It utilizes the same chart of accounts for all Project components, is activities- rather than
input-based, and has expenditure categories consistent with those of the Project. The latter system was
audited during Project preparation by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and was found to be
satisfactory. The new system also incorporates the auditor's suggestions to improve the Project preparation
system. The accounting and auditing practices, standards and controls, and reporting format and content
defined in the Manual will meet those defined in International Accounting Standards of the International
Accounting Standards Committee and be consistent with the Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting and
Auditing Handbook (FARAH).
Auditing of the project accounts will be carried out by an independent private sector firm acceptable to the
Bank. A specific shortlist of such firms for the Project has been prepared by the Government's Contraloria
del Estado, reviewed by the Bank, and a no objection has been issued. A long-term contract for the life of
the project, subject to annual performance acceptable to the Bank, will be concluded for Project auditing
services with the firm selected. Terms of reference for such audits have been prepared and agreed upon in
accordance with Bank model TORs, covering statements of income and expenses, all sources and uses of
project funds and comparisons with the Bank's Project Appraisal Document, assets and liabilities, SOEs,
Special Account, internal control system, conformity with the Bank's Loan Agreement, and pertinent national

Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
laws and regulations. Audit work will begin at the Project's startup to confirm the auditability of the financial
management system. Audit reports will be submitted within 4 months following the end of the fiscal year.
The costs of such annual audits are incremental costs and are therefore included in project costs and Bank
financing.
This financial management system conforms to the Bank's requirements under BP10.02. Prior lto loan
effectiveness, the Government will ensure as a condition of loan effectiveness that such a system has been put
into operation satisfactory to the Bank.
* ProjectMonitoring and Evaluation. The TSU would be responsible for Project monitoring and evaluation of
progress toward project development objectives and use the Project Design Summary in Annex 1 as a basis
to track the key Project inputs, processes, outputs and outcome/impact. A data collection system has been
prepared for this purpose, which would utilize a baseline data set from the firm-level survey done at Project
identification as a control group. The TSU would utilize the system to (a) prepare quarterly Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Reports on execution and impact against agreed performance targets, (b) prepare
annually by November 30 of 1999-2000 an Annual Action Operating Plan for the following year with inputs
from the Managing Agencies, and (c) hold a Project Midterm Review by July 31, 2000. While the TSlU itself
would be responsible for monitoring implementation activities and outputs, a qualified and independent local
firm would be responsible for preparing within this reporting system a regular evaluation of Project outcome
and impact.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
a     Public sector trade management alternatives - project preparation considered various models in use
across countries for public sector trade management, which varied mainly according to how decentralized
or unified a system is between government ministries and the degree and mode of coordination with the
private sector. Those configurations which are more fragmented and depend only upon informal
consultations with the private sector were not adopted, primarily because of past experience in Ecuador
in which intra-governmental coordination has been substantially inadequate and expertise relatively
scarce, as well as the need to much improve medium-term policy continuity and better structure the
public-private sector dialogue for the country working to increase outward-oriented growth;
Outward-oriented entrepreneurship support options - Project preparation also considered different
institutional models used across countries to facilitate entrepreneurial learning and innovation. The model
emphasizing strong in-house and highly centralized service provision was rejected due to strong evidence
that it tends to not be adequately client- and result-oriented nor the most cost-effective approach when
compared with the use of outsourcing to the private sector and more decentralized administration; and
*     Export finance facilities - project preparation assessed the viability of developing two export finance
mitigation tools---preshipment export credit guarantees and postshipment export credit insurance
mechanisms. These are being pursued separately under the leadership of the Corporacion Financiera
Nacional in order not to generate excessive project complexity.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
*  The Project's basic rationale and design focus is derived from  cross-country experience showing that
outward-oriented growth strategies frequently produce strong growth and development benefits for the
whole economy and that, as employment status is one of the key correlates of poverty, sustained labor-
intensive growth which generates strong and stable demand for labor is an important tool for poverty
reduction.
*  Past SME project experience in Ecuador, as reflected in an OED impact evaluation report of November
1997 (draft) on the four Bank-financed small scale enterprise credit line projects over the 1980s and early
1990s, shows that the first three did not have a beneficial impact on development given (a) a highly distorted
economic environment of highly negative real interest rates, regulated wages and heavily protected industrial
sector, (b) that the institution created to intermediate the credit (FOPINAR) had little or no ability to
mobilize domestic resources, and (c) project success hinged on politically controversial reforms (reversing
interest rate subsidies). The proposed Project has been initiated with the proper sequencing, in which the



Project Appraisal Document                                                                Page 1t
Country: Ecuador                                            Project Title: International Trade and Integration
trade policy environment in particular has been substantially liberalized and has adequate political support.
As importantly, rather than credit, Project design emphasizes the acquisition of knowledge, market access
and sustainable institutional development to catalyze growth.
* Consistent private sector inputs into trade and inter-sectoral policy formulation are essential to develop
effective policies for outward-oriented growth and to understand the impact of such policies. Singapore's
Economic Development Board and the joint public-private sector commissions used in Chile on intemnational
trade matters are examples of such mechanisms. Mounting catalytic program for entrepreneurial learning and
innovation are best delivered with the active operational involvement of the private sector;
* Upgrading product standards and testing services is most effective when complemented by outreach,
training and quality initiatives in industry and twinning with an experienced export-oriented standarcls body,
as demonstrated in a recent World Bank-financed project in which the Trinidad and Tobago Bureau of
Standards was twinned with its Singapore counterpart.
*  Project implementation experience in Ecuador, in the recent past and among 14 project loan portfolio
currently under implementation in Ecuador, has shown a significant number of cases of low levels of
disbursement and a high share of problem projects (3 currently) or at risk projects (4 currently). I'he past
two Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR) and a Country Procurement Assessment Review in,
Ecuador provide a good picture of the kind of generic implementation issues the project might face. Bank
preparation missions and Project TCU staff have tried to anticipate from this likely impediments:
* Public sector institutional reform - has drawn lessons from the MOSTA reform program, which focuses
mainly on core ministries. The MOSTA has provided a very useful framework for MICIP to undertake its
own reform program, with explicit use made of its Guidelines and professional performance benchmarks.
At the same time, the MICIP reform is set apart by the fact that its private producer and trade association
constituency has been the continuous and very active driving force to improve MICIP performance;
* Staff in project implementation units - regarding the commonly high turnover of staff due to low public
sector salary structure and short tenure of political appointments,  TSU  staff maintained continuity
under three government administrations over June 1996- April 1997 via a combination of competitive
remuneration, a strong focus on client needs and interests, and continuity of private sector involvement.
This combination will continue during delivery and be backed by long-term contracts of TSU staff.
* Financial Management and auditing - to deal with weak project accounting and financial management
capacity, limited capacity of the Contraloria General (CG) to prepare audits and their lengthy selection
process when external auditors are used, the TSU already has sound audit-testing systems which have
been expanded for Project delivery and staff have benefited from a number of Bank-sponsored seminars
in Ecuador on Bank norms and procedures for financial management, procurement and disbursements.
Regarding auditing, the CG was undertaken early prequalification of private auditors; and
* Counterpart funding - to address severe inadequacy of such funds given fiscal pressures and thevir use
among the Government's instruments of fiscal management, the Project's financing plan relies heavily on
private sector funding to ensure that overall local cost requirements are met, while enabling Bank funds
to be disbursed on 100% of expenditures for activities under the MICIP Program and Customs Proglram.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
* Heavy participation in the project design phase - public and private sector stakeholders, structured often as
mixed project preparation working groups, heavily participated in the Project's design phase along with local
and international consultants, practitioners and Bank staff. Such participation took the form primarily of (a)
a firm-level survey of 150 exporters and non-exporters to determine key constraints, and various structured
interviews with firms and associations on technical barriers to international trade, the political economy of
second stage trade reform, existing product quality support services, and the needs for export credit
insurance; (b) information dissemination, four workshops and exchange visits/study tours on cross-country
experience and international good practice in the organization of government foreign trade management,
successful techniques in increasing export market penetration and export finance; (c) focus groups with 53
firms to identify key service support needs for entrepreneurial learning and innovation; and (d) introduction
of experience and new opportunities in such areas as eco-labeling and microbusiness outward-oriented
development programs.
* Operational accomplishments during the design phase, - design work produced a well-defined readiness and
quality at entry for delivery. These include, in particular, (a) development and passage by Congress of the
1997 Foreign Trade Law and related regulations, and initial operation of COMEXI, (b) design and approval
by SENDA of a restructuring and development plan based on MOSTA Guidelines for MICIP, (c) completion
of a draft Business Plan for and establishment of Ecuador Exporta, and agreement on financing arrangements
to cover its core operating cost by the private sector, and (d) demonopolization by the Government of INEN
and IPNHI public certification services, and an initial design driven by INEN itself for its partial privatization.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
* Under Project's design phase, to channel to Ecuador Bank and other research results on outward-oriented
growth policies, knowledge on specific international trade-related subjects, cross-country experience on the
design and results of related development programs, and qualified practitioners and consulting services
needed to help adapt them to Ecuador's own business environment. It has also facilitated public-private
collaboration and agreement on regulatory changes and programs under the Project.
* Under the delivery phase, the Bank would provide financial resources otherwise not available in a highly
fiscal constrained situation to implement the agreed programs, and encourage through its support and
supervision work sound implementation, monitoring of progress and evaluation of results.

Country: Ecuador                                                 Project Title: International Trade and Integration
opening new trade markets and catalyzing firm-level learning and investment which lead to new international
business market partners, and to do so indirectly by demonstrating to policy-makers and domestic market
firms the opportunities for increased growth, employment and household income through increased
integration.
* The modernization of the State's institutional framework for international trade management is expected to
improve the business environment for trade by Ecuadorian firms, insofar as it yields increased capacity in
trade policy-making and execution under WTO-consistent standards, in negotiating international market-
expanding trade agreements, and in helping to resolve public policy constraints to international
competitiveness and outward-oriented growth.
* The State's support of firm-level learning and innovation through two new private-public sector partnership
institutions, Ecuador Exporta and the National Quality Council, also has a strong public goods justification
insofar as it aims to help redress those market failures following trade policy liberalization which constrain a
robust investment and output response. This support essentially provides a one-time stimulus to firms to
lower the very high initial information cost required to penetrate overseas markets 6, which Bank research
shows often otherwise does not result from policy change alone. The other important economic advantages
to such support are that it helps accelerate the growth, employment and skills externalities which spillover
from international trade and investment, and it increases the number of stakeholders favoring outward-
oriented growth so as to help insure against trade policy reversals.
*  The approach supported by the Project is commonly found in both industrialized and economically
developing regions of the world. Its p-ublic-private sector partnership is a preferred approach, rather than
through a purely public and centralized mechanism, insofar as resource allocation and service contracting are
made at the market level on a demand-driven basis without targeting, and results in high impact at modest
administrative cost. This approach is also superior to financial sector subsidies, since they are transparent and
do not distort financial markets.  Most importantly, it has well-defined exit policies---the Funds are
deliberately a temporary one-time effort to reduce market failures and support to each firm's program (which
typically runs 6-12 months) is similarly a one-time event. The self-selecting and maximum 50% financing of
total cost features of the Funds strongly encourage a firm's commitment to good implementation and prompt
firms to invest their own resources in entrepreneurial learning. They firther recognizes that the public sector
has a role to play, which has been shown to be effective, in the development of a local market of
entrepreneurial learning services rather than to provide them itself
2. Financial and Fiscal
* The Project's Component 1 for modernization of the Government's international trade management does not
involve appreciable incremental recurrent costs. The most significant financial benefit from this component
entails the increased export sales revenues and profits to be derived from increased access to international
markets and increased competitiveness resulting from the elimination of indirect taxes embedded in the cost
of product exports.

* The Project's support for learning and innovation through the CORPEI and National Quality programs is
essentially technical assistance for which sound causality and quantification is difficult to establish and for
which such analyses tend to raise more questions than they answer. Nevertheless, experience elsewhere
suggests that the identifiable qualitative benefits from learning and entreprenurial behavioral change promoted
by matching programs similar to that proposed under the Project do translate into quantifiable benefits with
high multiples of incremental exports (usually averaging in excess of 30 times the matching value). First-
order ex ante estimates of the impact of this Project component suggest that the net present value of
incremental exports from the 3-year implementation period could well exceed $400 million, which would
increase Ecuador's current total non-traditional processed goods export levels by about 50%, and generate
additional direct employment of some 15,000 jobs. Sensitivity analysis assuming a lower success rate and
some substitution effects still yields benefits with an order of magnitude exceeding one-half of these levels.
* Such incremental exports would also generate additional tax revenues from (i) payroll taxes paid by exporting
firms and by employees, (ii) corporate income taxes, and (iii) value added taxes generated by incremental
employee consumption.. Estimates suggest that, even using far more conservative assumptions under
sensitivity analysis, the Government would readily fully recover its investment in learning and innovation
since either of the first two sources alone (payroll or corporate profit taxes) would cover the cost to the
Government of the program and, combined, should yield substantial net positive income.
3. Technical and Institutional
* Substantial efforts have been made under MICIP's leadership to prepare regulatory and institutional change
with a high level of quality and commitment. International experience has been examined and incorporated
or adapted to Project design work and care has been taken to ensure WTO-consistency. The Project is
founded on a sound set of legislative and regulatory changes which are already in place at entry. With
persistent encouragement and support of private sector interest groups, the reform of MICIP has moved
forward and, with good technical support during Project preparation, has produced a comprehensive and
detailed blueprint for organizational change, skills upgrading, information technology development, and
increased operational efficiency. Effective implementation will depend largely on the continued commitment
of the private sector, which can be expected in view of its strong dependency on MICIP to forge increased
access to international market, formulate and execute trade policy in a way consistent with WTO
commitments and help resolve policy and institutional bottlenecks across the public sector which impair the
business environment.
4. Social:
* The Grassroots Growth Fund of CORPEI is expected to support some 3,000 small low-income firms and
their families through NGO-managed community programs to build international market linkages. Through
workshops and other technical assistance to business skills, communications and information access, product
designs and quality production methods, such firms are expected to acquire the knowledge and business
relationships needed to become indirect or sometimes direct exporters. This should provide the opportunities
to diversify markets, create new urban and off-farm employment and, especially as some 50% of firms are
operated by women, to generate additional income of direct benefit to family needs.
5. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category [ I A   [ I B   [XI C
* The Project supports technical assistance inputs for institutional development and entrepreneurial learning
and does not finance capital investment for which environmental assessments and screening are required.
However, one of the programs to be offered by CORPEI under its Export Culture Fund is an "Eco-Exports"

module to encourage firms to develop international market opportunities for ecologically sustainable
products (see Annex 2D). This module would include an outreach program, in the form of workshops,
information bulletins and other events, to explain the special characteristics of such products and the eco-
export certification process. The Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund would also finance partially
the cost of firms' acquisition of information on specific eco-export products and market trends, do
prefeasibility studies to define changes needed in production to meet requirements for certification, and
identify mechanisms to acquire such certification.
* In response to requests from the private sector, training will be provided in the application of ISO 9000
quality systems and ISO 14,000 environmental management practices, a system will be established t:o certiiFy
quality to ISO 9000 and environmental conformity to ISO 14000, and qualified assessors will be trained.
6. Participatory approach:
* The project has been design with the leadership and involvement of both public and private sector
stakeholders at each stage. Participation was structured often as mixed project preparation workingr groups,
as well as (a) a firm-level survey of 150 exporters and non-exporters to determine key constraints, and
various structured interviews with firms and associations on technical barriers to international trade, the
political economy of second stage trade reform, existing product quality support services, and the needs for
export credit insurance; (b) information dissemination, four workshops and exchange visits/study tours on
cross country experience and international good practice in the organization of government foreign trade
management, successful techniques in increasing export market penetration and export finance; and (c) focus
groups with 53 firms to identify key service support needs for entrepreneurial learning and innovation.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
e MICIP Program - MICIP reform is set apart from other Government institutional reforms by the fact that its
private producer and trade association constituency has been the continuous and very active driving force to
improve MICIP performance This is because MICIP produces, or should produce, a number of "products"
which are important to their interests, such as competently negotiated new international trade agreernents to
open market access, policies managed within WTO accession commitments, redtape cutting and other public
sector reforms of critical interest to trade expansion.  The design of the MICIP reform  has been
comprehensive and its regulatory basis already established. Given this demonstration of commitment and the
undoubted continued pressure of the private sector, there is a high probability of sustained momentun under
the implementation phase of the Project and of meeting its institutional development goals.
*  Customs Program - while this Program is also strongly supported by the private sector, there is a risk that the
strong pressure of the Government's fiscal deficit will eventually undermine the current commitment of the
Government to substantially increase the coverage and efficiency of the drawback system. However, the
Program has clear targeted performance objectives which should ensure transparency in its implementation
progress and help supporting interests to ensure that implementation is completed as defined. Once
implemented, the simplicity and automaticity of the system should provide good chances that it will be
sustainable.

Ecuador Exporta Program - The Funds themselves under this program are not intended to be sustained. They
have well-defined exit policies, deliberately making them temporary one-time efforts to reduce market failures.
However, experience elsewhere with mechanisms of this kind show that they are likely to create three sustainable
effects: (i) having helped firms to meet the usually high initial export market entry costs, they encourage a
durable commitment to export markets as long as operating costs are covered; (ii) having introduced firms to the
benefits of using international business services, firms tend to recognize their full value and no longer need
subsidies to motivate their use; and (iii) they encourage development of a local market of entrepreneurial learning
and international businesses support services to complement and compete with those from overseas.

International Trade and Integration Project
Project Description
Project Component 1 - Modernizing international trade management and increasing markets]
|access (total cost - US$5.6 million ) 
Objectives. The Government has decided to modernize its key international trade management
institutions and strive to expand market access as two key measures needed to achieve higher outward-
oriented growth, employment and household income. Changes in the legal and regulatory framework
were substantially completed under the Project's preparation phase and mainly involve the passage by
Congress of the 1997 Foreign Trade and Investment Law (LEXI), which creates the Foreign Trade
Council (COMEXI), consolidates trade management authority in MICIP, and creates the Trade and
Investment Development Corporation (CORPEI); the approval by SENDA of changes in M[ICIP's
organization and functions; the formation of a statutory standing public-private sector negotiating group
to conduct international trade negotiations; and passage of a WTO-consistent unfair trade practices
safeguards regulatory reform (see Section C2 for more).
The main objectives of Component 1, which has been designed in line with the Government's overall
Modernization of the State Program and MOSTA Guidelines, are to implement these changes so as to:
1.1 MICIP Program
* increase basic trade policy-making and execution capacity, with greater cost efficiency and in
conformity with Ecuador's WTO commitments, as the technical secretariat of COMEXT;
-  strengthen Ecuador's trade negotiating and representation capacity in order to conclude new
market-expanding trade agreements on the subregional, regional and inter-regional level;
* develop MICIP's capacity to prepare with the private sector international competitiveness
diagnostic and development programs at a sectoralVcluster level which address the pubic
policy and firm-level constraints outward-oriented; and
* build management capacity in the specialized trade policy areas of unfair trade practices
safeguards.
1.2 Customs Administration Program
* upgrade the Customs Administration duty drawback system so as to eliminate the export of
indirect taxes and duties; and
Through the related Component 2, described later, the Project devolves the Government's role in
facilitating entrepreneurial learning and innovation to two new partnership structures with majority
private sector management and financing.
1.1   MICIP Program. ($5.2 million). The Project would meet the above-mentioned objectives
through the provision of human resource training, diagnostic and programming studies, advisory service,
information technology, workstations upgrading and facilities renovation as follows:

Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
* Human resource training and complementary information technology program ($1.3
million). The Training Plan is based upon a skills assessment carried out during Project
preparation of Government professional staff, private sector representatives and universities. Its
strategy is to (1) rapidly developing the skills of existing staff to meet immediate trade
management needs, and (2) develop a corps of local expertise on trade management issues in the
academic community. Its implementation would be managed by a training coordinator assigned
to MICIP and would consists of the following (see also Annex 2A):
*  WTO issue-specific intensive training on-site, overseas and via exchanges for government
officials in MICIP and related agencies focused upon Ecuador-specific trade matters---courses
would include a basic WTO orientation module, a series of specialized courses on WTO
regulations on, for example, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, Technical Barriers
to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, unfair trade remedies, rules of origin,
WTO agreements on agricultural goods and on textiles and clothing, and intellectual property,
as well as negotiations training and simulation, and English language training;
*  international trade negotiations training and simulation workshops for MICIP's Department
of International Negotiations to support trade negotiations in such form as the Andean Pact,
MERCOSUR and the working groups discussing various dimensions of the FTAA initiative;
* a formal university training twinning program to develop a domestic training capacity in
WTO and other trade policy issues over two years for students to follow Masters programs,
and for visiting fellowships for Ecuadorian academics to collaborate with and team from
international university faculties; and
*  complementary information technology provided via dedicated equipment, technical advice
and training to establish (a) a MICIP Trade Policy Web Site linking MICIP with Ecuador's
trade associations and universities, (b) access to selected overseas on-line sources
international trade-related organizations, subscriptions to key trade journals and other
information resources to improve access to and knowledge of current trade policy issues; and
(c) systems and research capabilities to facilitate bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.
* Upgrade MICIPs internal operating efficiency ($1. 7 million) The Project will help implement a
new internal administrative and financial management system and upgrade of office facilities,
supported by a financial plan and service performance standards to guide the implementation of
the restructuring plan. In particular, it will install SIFIAD (Integrated System of Financial and
Administrative Information), a system established under the Bank-financed MOSTA project
(Modernization of the State TA) providing integrated planning, budgeting, accounting and
treasury information and analyses for decision-making, monitoring and evaluation, as well as
human resource information and materials controls systems and internal regulations and
procedures. The system provides for electronic exchanges with other key Government entities,
namely the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the national Secretariat of Development
(SENDA), the Controller General and the National Development Council (CONADE). The
installation of SIFIAD will be undertaken with the inclusion of replacement of obsolete equipment
and computer operating systems and software, and training of staff and informatics support
personnel.

*  International competitiveness diagnostic assessments ($2.0 million).  The Project would
provide the training, information systems and consulting services to enable MICIP, in partnership
with the private sector and local universities, to assess the level of international competitiveness
and recommend program strategies in a number of Ecuador's productive clusters. These analyses
would (i) pinpoint reasons for any competitiveness gaps within firms surveyed (capital, labor,
technology, etc.), (ii) examine the market's structure and constraints posed by public policies and
institutions (labor, finance, training, infrastructure, etc.), and (iii) prepare strategic options to
address what measures are needed at both public and private sector levels to produce
competitiveness levels which are likely to generate higher outward-oriented growth. The initial
program is expected to consist of assessments in areas such as textiles and clothing, non-
traditional fruits and vegetables, chemicals, and metal-mechanical and electrical products. See
Annex 2B for model terms of reference.
*  Unfair trade practices safeguards administration ($0.2 million). The newly established Unfair
Trade Practices Division of MICIP has responsibilities for investigation, execution of provisional
measures, ensuring public notice and other communication of the process and its results, and
preparing recommendations to the COMEXI, which make final decisions on measures. To enable
MICIP to properly execute the system, the Project would finance implementation of an 18-month
plan, consisting of (a) technical assistance to prepare organizational and functional descriptions,
individual job descriptions and qualifications, and working procedures, (b) internal and external
training, (c) investments in facilities and equipment (software, communications system and office
equipment,, (d) an information data base containing information and calculations relaiting to
investigations and injury analyses; monitoring of specific cases, their stages and the interested
parties; monitoring of cases involving Ecuadorian firms overseas; and legislation and case work
trends overseas on products of interest to Ecuador; and subscription to relevant publications
overseas.
This technical assistance would be provided under Government regulations consistent with
WTO Agreements on Safeguards, Antidumping, and Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. In
November 1997, a regulation was adopted by the Government for safeguards, anti-dumping and
countervailing procedures for imports originating from non-members of the Andean Pact and
from Andean Pact members, as well as establishes supporting assistance of the Government for
Ecuadorian exporters which are investigated by other countries for unfair practices.  The
regulations cover in particular the determination of margins, injury, procedures for application,
their publication and comment by interested parties, evaluation, provisional measures, time
benchmarks for review and decision-making (a total of 185-200 days from initial investigation)
and final measures. Under Project implementation, these regulations would be amended to ensure
that (a) domestic consumers or their representative bodies are recognized as interested parties to
the procedure and that investigations of impact include impact on such parties as well as the
impact on local producers, and (b) that access to information and the opportunity to provide
information relevant to the investigation be afforded domestic consumers and adequate public
notice and explanation.
1.2    Customs Administration Program ($0.4 million). The Project would support implementation
of a program to expand eligibility, transparency and efficiency of the duty drawback system for direct and
indirect exporters, expected to lead to much expanded coverage of firms and reduction of applicalion to

Country: Ecuador                                            Project Title: International Trade and Integration
payment turnaround time from 6-12 months to no more than 15 days. A Drawback Task Force of
Customs and MICIP staff, with the support short-term international specialist in drawback systems, will
implement the following program based upon new framework drawback regulations adopted in April
1998:
* Regulations. As part of this preparation of this component. amendments to Executive Decree
1822 of 1994 and 3281 of 1995 have been made so as to (i) change the calculation basis for
penalties from the value of imports CIF value the amount to be rebated under the drawback
system, (ii) extend the minimum time for imported goods to remain in the country for
drawback eligibility from one to two years; (iii) empower Customs to conduct post-export
audits, and (iv) permit use of product coefficients. Under the Project, the Government would
present to Congress by March 1 ,1999 amendments required to the governing law which also
include in the definition of merchandise qualifying for drawback merchandise re-exported
without processing and materials inputs for export purchased locally by indirect exporters, the
latter to enable much strong links between domestic producers and the international market.
* Reorganization and staff training ($0.1 million). Teams of drawback specialists will be
trained in each Customs district and a national coordinator named. Training would focus on
the new regulatory regime, new procedures defined in a new manual and distributed to each
district, followed by training in software and the new computerized drawback system.
* Simplification of procedures and work flow and systems automation (0.2 million). An
intensive effort will consist of advisory services, software redesign necessary to automate the
drawback system, procurement of PC computer systems and installation in all Customs
districts, and revision of drawback forms, processing system; manual and guidelines ($0.45
million).
3 Nationwide public information campaign ($0.1 million). The new regulations and
operating system will be supported by a publicity campaign to encourage existing and
potential users to take advantage of the system and its benefits.. The campaign will include
distribution of descriptive pamphlets, the press, etc. Such changes can be expected to have a
strong positive impact on the level of international trade, expand links with the domestic
market, and increased access of small firms to the system.
Project Component 2 - Catalyzing entrepreneurial learning and innovation in smaller flrms
through private-public partnership institutions (total cost - US$35.9 million)
Objective. The Government and the private sector, recognizing that entrepreneurial learning and
innovation is a pre-requisite for increased international competitiveness and outward-oriented growth,
have developed one partnership institution with majority private management and financing---Ecuador
Exporta and as in the process of developing a second such partnership institution, a National Quality
Council. These organizations will act primarily as learning and innovation facilitators to promote,
through broad campaigns and accreditation programs, and finance, through demand-driven mechanisms
the acquisition of services from the domestic and international market place.

2.1    Ecuador Exporta Program  ($33.1 million). LEXI established the Export and Investment
Promotion Corporation (or CORPEI), a joint venture corporation of private and public interests
headquartered in Guayaquil. Overall, it aims to increase outward-oriented growth and integrat,ion witlh
the global economy, particularly among smaller firms and low-income business groups. Its strategy for
this purpose is to:
* motivate the interest of domestic producers in overseas markets,
* provide access to those international business support services which help increase the
international competitiveness and international market linkages, and
* promote development of competitive markets for those support services..
Its organization has been shaped by international best practice through a working group of private
producer/exporter associations and MICIP staff, drawing on cross-country expertise primarily from other
parts of Latin America and East Asia. Its design emphasizes strong client focus on those market
segments most affected by market failures, facilitating information and training with strong externalities
and economies of scale, autonomy of operation through private sector statute and majority private sector
management, competent staffing with competitive remuneration. It is viewed as an organization of
greatest use during Ecuador's transition to a more outward-oriented economy. Thus, its financial
strategy envisions (a) a ten-year life span (b) a progressive increase in cost recovery of core services
through user fees, and (c) the use of temporary matching programs over the first three years, afte.r which
it is expected that firms will be willing to pay the full market price of support services.
As such, CORPEI will operate as a non-profit entity in the private domain with a 13-rnember
Board of Directors, of whom 9 represent Ecuador's producer associations of larger- and small-scale
enterprises and 4 represent the Government (Ministries of Trade, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and the
National Finance Corporation). It will be financed mainly by a combination of reimbursable contrilbutions
from the private sector itself, user fees covering a portion of Ecuador Exporta's core services, and Bank
financing channeled through its Government shareholder. It will act mainly as a demand-oriented co-
financier of pre-competitive investments in entrepreneurial learning and innovation at the producer/trade
organization and firm levels. Service delivery will be mainly selected by clients and outsourced, with only
a small core program (see below) delivered by Ecuador Exporta itself where benefits have externalities or
it is otherwise uneconomic to do so on a more decentralized basis. The decentralized programs would be
formulated by individual or clusters of firms themselves, delivered by qualified existing specialized
services in the local and international markets and administered partly by a management contract to
administer them.
Export Culture Program (total cost $1.5 million). In this 3-year startup phase, Ecuador Exporta
will give a very high priority to substantially broadening Ecuador's export culture, that is, the
number of firms aware of and interested in overseas markets. As the organization becomes better
established and the export community matures, greater emphasis is expected to be given to
deepening existing international business relationships via development of an overseas
representation network, organizing country image and reputation programs, and launching strong
foreign direct investment promotion. campaigns. The Export Culture Program to be financed
under the Project by this Fund will consist of the following three elements and be implemented by
Ecuador Exporta with the assistance of outside service providers:
* sponsor, organize and finance dialogues, roundtables, speakers and expositions,
competitions, publications, publicity and other campaign instruments, which focus on



Project Appraisal Document                                                                  Page 33
Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
analyze trends and issues in international trade relations within and outside of Ecuador,
public policy issues "showcase success stories", demonstrate exemplary product designs
and techniques (eg., quality control, use of brand name market strategies, etc.);
+  promote trade information technology for electronic international business data and
communications exchanges through the Internet and private subscription networks.
Focusing on smaller domestic firms and emerging exporters, Ecuador Exporta would
encourage linkages with international information markets through (i) distribution of PC
software already developed which aims to explain and motivate involvement in basic
international commerce processes, (ii) installation of an Ecuador Exporta internet web site
providing an information directory and assistance center for those interested in trade
development; and (iii) installation of a subscription service which facilitates access to other
international trade service providers, such as Singapore's TradeLink or SACE of the
OAS, which provide information on market profiles and competitors, trade agreements,
taxation, import regulations, buyer inquiries, and international trade events and
promotions.
* local and distance learning seminars through an international business partnership network,
which will link overseas institutions with local partner universities (the Universidad Andina
Simon Bolivar, Universidad Espiritu Santo, Universidad Tecnologica Internacional, and
the Universidad del Azuay have all expressed interest in participating) and the nation's
four producer federations to deliver a series of (i) seminars to help raise general
consciousness and address specific practical matters related to WTO rules, and (ii) courses
for smaller private businesses wishing to develop international trade in the areas (a)
international trade regulations and practices, (b) international market strategies, (c)
product quality standards and certification, and (d) foreign language.
*  promotion of eco-exporting, particularly smaller firms, community producer organizations and
smaller cooperatives to take advantage simultaneously of growing niche export markets and
improve environmental protection in Ecuador (see Annex 2D). The program would address
research, production and promotion phases of the cycle through sensitization outreach
programs, acquisition of market information and studies on existing eco-export products &
market trends, identification of mechanisms for acquiring certification and establish credibility
of third party certifiers, and facilitating direct market access links between exporters in Ecuador
and importers and distributors of sustainable products.
Learning and Innovation Fund (total cost $24.1 million, of which $17.1 million
cumulative co-financing by participating private sector firms). The Fund would co-finance
the costs of pre-competitive development activities contracted with providers by domestic-
market or export-market firms interested in investigating overseas market potential for their
businesses.
The Fund (see Operating Manual in Annex 2C) would be administered under a management
contract with an independent and experienced private firm, to be financed by the Bank loan
within the allocation for the Fund, to help guarantee is transparency, independence and
impartiality in approval and management of the Fund. It would utilize a multi-disciplinary
team of specialists in SME development and outward-oriented growth, which would
administer the SPOP. Its functions would primarily involve (a) checking applications of firms

Country: Ecuador                                               Project Title: International Trade and Integration
to ensure their conformity with objective eligibility criteria---mainly, (i) that activil:ies are
limited to precompetitive research and development activities, (ii) there is no economic sector
or geographical targeting, and (iii) there are no export performance or use of domestic inputs
requirements; (b) monitoring of progress and results, (c) quarterly personal visits and
monitoring reports of plan implementation; and (d) reimbursement (not upfront disbursement)
of 30% of total qualified expenses under the Plan. Certification of all expenditures would be
carried out by qualified independent auditors. Management would ensure automaticity of
procedures and allocate funds on a demand-driven first-come, first-serve basis. Given that
successful such programs elsewhere often provide up to 50% reimbursement, this parameter
will be reviewed within 6 months of startup to ensure the adequacy of progress and
commitment of beneficiaries against expectations.
The Fund would have the following key characteristics:
+  temporary support and exit policy - the Fund is deliberately a temporary one-time
effort to reduce market failures. Consequently, (a) funding is provided only once to a
firm to help overcome such failures and facilitate market development of international
business support services, and (b) the Fund itself would terminate after its 3-year
implementation period. Experience elsewhere shows that, once the Fund has
introduced firms to the benefits of the activities being supported, they will recognize
their full value and the asymmetry of information and undervaluation of the benefits of
international business support services will be substantially alleviated;
i  basic firm eligibility and co-investment requirement - a firm willing to invest 70% of
the firm's own resources to cover the costs of a well-defined and time-bound agreed
International Competitiveness Plan designed to increase the international
competitiveness of existing products, or develop new products or new markets.
Participation in the Fund is self-selecting, ensuring a firm's commitment to good
implementation and prompting invest of its own resources in entrepreneurial learning;
+ firm  size and income level. - firms accessing the Fund would, as elsewhere, be
primarily small and medium-scale, necessitated by virtue of the requirement that a total
of US$50,000 would be the maximum available to any single firm for all activities---
experience shows, however, that the average co-investment amount per firm is not
likely to exceed an average of about $14,000 and be implemented over 6-12 months;
+  eligible pre-competitive development activities - professional service fees under
contracts providing advisory and information services mainly for local and overseas
research, product and production process adaptation to redesign for overseas markets,
study tours, product quality and environmental certification, and training. Salaries,
other recurrent costs (such as office rental or advertising) and capital goods, among
others, are not eligible. The Fund would also facilitate the ability of local firms to
penetrate niche markets of eco-export products, which are basically products which
have been certified as those produced in an environmentally protective manner (see
Annex 2D). Support services would be freely chosen by the client;
* typical outputs - trained human resources in strategic planning, product developrment,
market standards and regulations, and quality certification; new information access

Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
about overseas product demand & import regulations, product design, quality and
safety standards; packaging & labeling requirements; competitors and competitive
position; distribution & promotion strategy options, etc; specialist advice on
production restructuring measures needed to meet international design, cost and
quality control requirements, secure patents, trademarks, licenses as needed and
royalty agreements; and new overseas business partnerships with potential buyers,
foreign investors, suppliers, private associations, and other business partners in more
advanced markets.
* monitoring and evaluation - MICIP, CORPEI, and World Bank staff, with the help of
qualified independent evaluators, will make a quarterly progress and an impact
assessment of the Fund. A full review will take place within one year of initial
operation. If the Fund is not substantially meeting its objectives for any reason, the
Government may terminate the program and cancel that portion of the Bank's loan
remaining to be committed for the Fund.
* Grassroots Growth Fund (total cost $6 million, of which $3 million cumulative co-
financing by participating private sector firms). The Grassroots Growth Fund (see
Operating Manual in Annex 2C), a pilot initiative, would operate largely like the
Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund, but focus on low-income microbusinesses to
support development of direct or, more likely, indirect exporter links ("indirect" exporters
provide intermediate production inputs to local direct exporters or provider final goods to
local trading companies). In conjunction with the Department of Microbusinesses and
Artisans in MICIP, and in support of the Plan of Action of "The Challenge for Year 2000",
the Project will help promote access to non-financial services using a network of existing
NGOs to provide technical extension services at the community level which focus on
increasing capacity in basic export market training, product design and quality assurance,
financial management, and generating export market linkages. It would provide up to 50% of
the cost of such services, with the remainder coming from a combination of contributions
from microbusinesses themselves and the NGO. The Federacion Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo,
the Camara de Pequena Industrias de Pichincha, the Camara Nacional de Microempresa,
Fundacion Esquel, and the Camara Artisanal de Pichincha, FENACA and the Camara de
Pequena Industria Imbabura have all already expressed strong interest in participating in it.
The same management of the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund
would be responsible to (i) qualify the technical and implementation capacity of NGOs seeking
to participate, (ii) qualify outward-oriented growth programs to be prepared and managed by
such NGOs against the same objective eligibility criteria, (iii) oversee program
implementation, and (iv) provide reimbursements against qualified expenditures. The Fund
would finance contracts with qualified NGOs to provide information, training, demonstration
equipment, and technical advisory services to implement this process. The eligibility criteria
for NGO participation would be the capacity to: (a) carry out broad-based campaigns to
inform and educate urban and rural low -income communities on the benefits and processes
involved in outward-oriented growth, (b) identify microbusiness groups in communities, foster
group cooperation among them to, and help them to prepare precompetitive plans to enhance
their export prospects, (c) through effective extension services to low-income urban or rural
areas, provide access to information on international market needs, product specifications and
upgrading, training, quality assurance, packaging and transport services; (d) foster group

cooperation among microbusinesses so as to take advantage of economies of scale in
production and support services; and (e) link community producer groups with an established
exporters and importers to help carry out their precompetitive plans.
2.2   Product Oualitv Program ($2.8 million). Improvements in the quality of products mlade in
Ecuador are fundamental to increasing outward-oriented growth, as the quality level of the products is
often not adequate to successfully compete in national and international markets. The metrology,
standards, testing and quality system (MSTQ) in Ecuador, which represents the series of services needed
to help firms achieve product quality, has a number of shortcomings which place producers at a
competitive disadvantage in relation to other countries which maintain more modern MSTQ systems.
Most standards are in most cases obligatory, which in many cases are not justified and constitute
unnecessary obstacles for commerce and encourage smuggling. There are insufficient voluntary industry-
oriented standards which reflect international best practices. Metrology, standard reference mateial and
calibration services are inadequate to meet industrial requirements. Laboratory reports are based on test
methods and analyses that are often not in accordance with established international standard methods.
There is a limited supply of certification services for quality systems and a limited amount of quality and
environmental auditors, especially those certified by international organizations.   While there is an
increasing entrepreneurial culture, the country does not have a real consciousness of the need to use the
quality system for competitive advantage. There is a lack of an efficient mechanism to enable films to
access information regarding standards and regulations of the country itself and of other countries. Few
professional organizations encourage quality practices, metrology, standardization, and analytic work in
laboratories. In contrast, there is a considerable demand for MSTQ services from the private sector,
including training and certifications in ISO 9000 quality systems and ISO 14000 for environrnental
management systems, as reflected in a supply-demand study conducted under project preparation.
The aims of the MSTQ subcomponent, which is prescribed in the new Foreign Trade Law (Article
1 6j), are to (i) increase local private sector recognition that quality and sound MSTQ systems are critical
factors in international competitiveness, (ii) reduce existing technical barriers to trade, (iii) increase the
Ecuadorian client service orientation of the current largely public MSTQ services of the national
standards organizations (INEN and INIPHI); and (iv) develop a system of certification of products,
testing laboratories, personnel and quality and environmental management systems by qualified third-
parties which is internationally recognized by Ecuador's trading partners and necessary for successful
international business. The project would involve the following:
*  Regulations. INEN, the national standards body, has produced about 2000 standards since
its creation in 1970, of which more than 80% were, prior to Project preparation, compulsory--
-contrasting with usually 5-10% in other Latin American countries and elsewhere in North
America and Western Europe where most standards are voluntary. Under the Techmical
Barriers to Trade Agreement of the WTO, in order to not become unnecessary obstacles to
trade, the Agreement establishes that such measures (standards, technical regulations,
conformity assessment) should only be taken for objectives such as protection of health,
safety, security, environmental protection or the prevention of deceptive practices, and be
applied in a non-discriminatory way. From Ecuador's perspective, there are concerns arrnong
exporters about unjustified technical barriers being imposed by other countries, and strong
concerns among local importers and domestic producers about cumbersome, lengthy and
costly procedures of public agencies, the Ecuadorian Standards Institute (INEN) and the
Izquieta Perez National Hygiene Institute (IPNHI), involved in obtaining certification of
conformity to Ecuadorian standards. Under the Project preparation phase, the Government

Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
moved 1,047 mandatory standards of INEN, to optional status and reducing drastically the
share of mandatory standards to 25% of total standards. Under Project implementation, the
Government would as a condition of disbursement formally adopt the Code of Good Practice
or the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards of the WTO Agreement on
Technical Barriers to Trade, which INEN already practices internally.
*  Establish the National Quality Council and its quality promotion program ($1.4 million) -
technical assistance would be provided to complete preparation of legislation to establish the
National MSTQ Council. The Government would present to Congress by March 1, 1999 a
draft law establishing the National Quality Coucil.  The National Council, formed by
representatives of the Government, the private sector and the accredited organizations, and
operate through its Technical Secretariat. It will coordinate the definition of policies and
oversee operation of the MSTQ system, promote transparency and increased capacity of the
system through an accreditation system, promote firm-level awareness of and improvements in
product quality, and support negotiation of bilateral and multilateral mutual recognition
agreements.
To help accelerate the ability of Ecuadorian SME enterprises to meet performance, quality,
and certification requirements in international markets, the Project would finance through
execution of MICIP in coordination with INEN, the Izquieta Perez Institute and other
agencies to implement a product quality awareness program. The program would aim to
broadly educate industry and responsible government agencies on the critical role of quality in
the global economy, sponsor through at least 5 regional technical schools quality training
programs for trainers, for middle managers, and to develop qualified assessors for ISO 9000
quality systems and ISO 14000 environmental management systems certifications. The
program would also sponsor a professional society for quality practitioners, expert advice,
technical papers and news items for a monthly journal, and hold seminars, and other events
which will broaden the quality base.
*  Establish an internationally recognized accreditation system  ($0.3 million). To assure
international recognition and acceptance of product test reports and certificates extended by
Ecuadorian testing and calibration laboratories and ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 auditors, and to
enlarge such service supply beyond existing government laboratories, the Project establishes
the Ecuadorian Accreditation Council. The regulatory framework for the Council was adopted
on September 19, 1997 (Decree 651) and accreditation procedures were adopted on October
31, 1997 (Decree 331). The Council will implement an internationally recognized one-stop
accreditation system for national laboratory and certification services accreditation under
internationally recognized criteria (ISO/IEC Guide 25 of the International Laboratory
Accreditation Conference (ILAC). This will lead to a substantial expansion in the supply of
private services from qualified universities, polytechnic institutions and private firms, and will
help ensure that MSTQ institutions are recognized and accepted by Ecuador's international
trading partners.
To support implementation of the accreditation system and foster professional development
among testing and calibration laboratories, the project will finance technical assistance to
organize a professional society of laboratory managers, tentatively identified as the Society of
Laboratory Professionals.  The Society will provide intensive training in all aspects of
laboratory practices leading to accreditation. To receive the planned technical assistance,

Country: Ecuador                                              Project Title: International Trade and Integration
these laboratories will be required subsequently to provide assistance and training to other
Ecuadorian laboratories seeking accreditation.  A  world-class laboratory accreditation
organization will be engaged to perform preliminary assessments and final formal assessments.
A reputed laboratory organization (s) would be financed by the Project to assist the Society to
establish appropriate inter-laboratory comparison proficiency programs conforming to ISO/
IEC Guide 43, provide test artifacts, and serve as comparison test manager and evaluator for
approximately 20 proficiency tests during a 24 month period. Should individual laboratories
desire to upgrade equipment or facilities, or assessment identifies deficiencies which warrant
improvement, they could access the Project's Learning and Innovation Fund. Since one of the
more requested services from the private sector deals with certificates for IS0900)0 and
IS014000, duly qualified quality systems auditors and advisors would be trained under
Project financing. Firms that need assistance for consultation, assessment or certification of
IS09000 quality or ISO 14000 environmental systems can access the Entrepreneurial Learning
and Innovation Fund.
Upgrade public standards and certification services ($0.6 million). The above-mentioned
accreditation system and deregulation will eliminate the current state monopoly of services of
INEN and IPNHI for mandated registration or certification in order to import (or produce
locally) processed foods, pharmaceuticals and similar goods. In response to requests for
assistance to help upgrade remaining functions, the Project would finance a technical
assistance program with INEN and IPNHI through twinning arrangements to help update its
staffing skills and salary structure, management, planning and marketing capabilities.
Assistance would also enable IPNHI to learn about alternative enforcement and assessment
practices by visiting well accepted systems in Europe and the Americas and relevant policy
councils and technical meetings of ISO and regional trade associations. The staff of Instituto
Izquieta Perez will be trained in all aspects of laboratory quality management and good
laboratory practices as required for accreditation by an internationally recognized accreditor
of food and drug laboratories. A specialist will identify any deficiencies in equipment or
facilities, help correct them, and recommend cost-effective solutions and provide guidance in
establishing and documenting an appropriate level of quality. When the laboratories are
considered ready for assessment, an internationally recognized accredited body will be
engaged to accredit Izquieta Perez.
The Project would finance the upgrading of the information centers of both
institutions by acquiring primary references, databases of abstracts, journals, standards, and
related information in paper and on CD-ROMS, and technical assistance and equipment to
enable the information center to serve as a node on the planned OAS information network and
to expand its own distribution channels as the WTO Inquiry Point. Financing for the Inquiry
Point would cover initial staffing, office space, information, handling and processing
equipment, communications facilities and training, to provide adequate information access to
interested parties in WTO member countries on standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures in Ecuador. In cooperation with Ecuador Exporta., the
Inquiry Point will access similar information through the world Inquiry Point network to help
assess potential export markets.
Partially privatize the national standards body, INEN. ($0. 5 million). An analysis of a
proposal for the partial privatization of INEN was prepared and approved by CONAM duaring
project preparation at the initiative of INEN itself and with the help of CESMEC of Chile, a

world-recognized quality testing and inspection organization which itself underwent
privatization in the late 1970s. Under the Project, a partial privatization plan would be
completed and a portion of INEN brought to the point of sale by June 30, 1999, under which
INEN will be divided into two entities: one retaining and upgrading its regulatory functions of
preparing mandatory standards, legal metrology and consumer protection---to be implemented
through twinning with an advanced standards organization---and the other consisting of
privatized assets which are typically employed to deliver commercial, fee-based services to
producers---calibration, testing, quality promotion, and setting voluntary standards.  To
facilitate the privatization, in which current INEN staff will have the opportunity to purchase
shares, the plan would include a detailed inventory of assets, a business plan for the new firm,
and a methodology to bring the assets to the point of sale.  The effectiveness of the
privatization will be measured by the degree to which it expands services to clientele in a
financially self-sustaining way.

Project Description
Intemational Competitiveness Assessments
Model Outline Tenns of Reference (draft)
The Government of Ecuador, industrial producers' associations and chambers of commerce, supported
by the World Bank as part of a Project seeking to increase outward-oriented growth, are seeking ways and
means to increase the factor productivity and international competitiveness of Ecuadorian firms. ]For this
purpose, a series of sector and cluster diagnostics and restructuring plans are being financed under the Project to
increase the knowledge of private sector performance and prospects, assist the Government in the development
of policies which can enhance such competitiveness and public policy, and help the private sector to devise
restructuring and development programs' .
Structure
Phase 1 - Sector/Cluster Diagnostic and Preliminary Program. Analyses should be prepared
on a representative enterprise sample and in collaboration with major interest groups to determine:
(a) the international competitiveness of local production;
(b) the principal reasons for any gap stemming from factors within enterprises, the
market's structure, or public policies;
(c) the costs of improving performance and its estimated effects;
(d) policy options and costs for the sector/cluster to attain international competitiveness;
(e) a preliminary restructuring plan, to include:
(i) comparative advantage in major product lines,
(ii) apparent real and financial restructuring costs of enterprises,
(iii) identification of the policy, institutional, and
infrastructural changes to facilitate restructuring. and
(iv) estimated capital requirements to implement the plan;
(f) preparation of terms of reference for Phase 2.
'Restructuring in this context excludes investments aimed only at expanding capacity to manufacture existing
product lines. Restructuring includes modernization and rehabilitation of plants; changes in technology; changes
and diversification of product lines; reorganization of production, marketing and distribution; changes in human
resource skills, levels and uses; and changes in the capital and financial structure as well as in sources and terms
of investment and working capital.



Project Appraisal Docunent                                                                   Page 43
Country: Ecuador                                              Project Title: International Trade and Integration
A thorough knowledge of the international market for each competitiveness study and of efficient
comparator firms is a prerequisite for these studies. Resources are to be focused on Ecuadorian firms and their
business environment. Particular emphasis is to be placed on the influence of public policies on performance.
both in the recent past as well as under any possible program. Phase 1 should be completed within four months.
Phase 2 - Restructuring and Development Program. This phase should entail preparation and support
of the implementation of a medium-term restructuring and development plan for the cluster in question. It
should include:
(a) detailed design of and support to reach agreement on public policy changes identified in Phase 1;
(b) detailed proposals for programs. infrastructure, and institutions support at the sector
or cluster level identified in Phase 1 to facilitate restructuring;
(c) further domestic or international market studies on the viability of any significant
change in product mix; and
(d) where only a few enterprises constitute most of sector or cluster output,
preinvestment work to prepare for other aspects of restructuring.
Firms submitting proposals should include a description and a detailed work program for the tasks they
would carry out for Phase 2, based on their understanding of the sector or cluster in Ecuador and similar work
elsewhere. Phase 2 is anticipated to require about three months. A full proposal is to be included in the Phase 1
draft report of each firm.
Management and Supervision
The program will be managed by a Sector or Cluster Committee, chaired by the Minister of Trade,
Industry and Fishing, and including other representatives of the Ecuadorian Government, producers,
associations. and bankers, associations. It will assure establish the final TORs for each diagnostic and program,
oversee and select the consulting firms, assess intermediate progress and evaluate their results with a view to
establishing an action agenda. Two reports are to be prepared in Spanish for Phase 1: An interim report
summarizing findings on subsector competitiveness and the principal reasons for any gaps (sections (a) and (b) of
para. 3), and a final report. They will be submitted to the Committee and to the World Bank for review,
discussion, and approval.

Annex 2C
CORPEI
Onerating Manual
L Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund
Objective
1.    The objective of the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund (ELIF) is to help l:o speed
entrepreneurial learning and innovation leading to increased international competitiveness and increased
outward-oriented growth at the enterprise level.
Essential Concepts
2.    The Fund will extend matching support to assist in stimulating dynamic market activity in two
specific areas:
(a) advisory support services for firms, so as to inject quickly into individual firms the
specific skills, experience and information that will, in turn, help to generate international'
competitiveness and outward-oriented growth; and
(b) international market contacts by Ecuadorian firms, by encouraging travel t:o such
markets within a defined international competitiveness plan (see paras. 4-8 below). More
personal on-the-spot contacts with business partners---buyers, suppliers, private associations,
potential foreign investors and joint venture partners, at the right stage, are likely to lead to more
understanding of market preferences and to more international market links.
3.    Support will be provided to individual private firms and formally organized group activities
through an association as long as matching co-financing is provided.
International Competitiveness Business Plan
4.    An International Competitiveness Business Plan should be prepared by the firm, or group
association and propose a set of activities focused on increasing the competitiveness of an exist.ing, or
development of new products or new markets which will lead to an increased level of international
competitiveness.
5.    By way only of example, a plan might involve one or more of the following:
* firm level - training in strategic planning, product development, market standards and regulations,
quality certification;



Project Appraisal Document                                                                  Page 45
Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
*  market level - industrial research and development of new products, starting with information and
analysis based on desk research, of promising potential markets, followed by market research
fieldwork, or market exploration visits by staff, then strategic planning, securing of patents,
trademarks, licenses as needed and royalty agreements, forming strategic alliances, subcontracting
arrangements, etc.;
* product level - on the basis of information collected on market preferences, assistance within the
factory to advise on restructuring measures in order to meet market preferences---for example,
through changes influencing product design, cost, quality control and/or delivery, design of packaging
and labeling materials, pre-production modeling and samples, product concept and design testing,
design of brand new and trademarks; and
6.    In the Plan, a firm applying for support should demonstrate that it has given serious consideration
to the main planning issues involved, such as: (a) identification of the sequence of steps required to meet
the competitiveness objective; (b) information and advice required; (c) activities required; (d) best
estimate of the likely benefits to the firm from the plan; and (e) given the likely benefits, costs and risks to
the firm, resources of money, time and people needed to commit to implementation of this plan.
7.    In evaluating a firm's plan, the management contractor for the Fund will mainly seek to satisfy
themselves that serious consideration has been given by the firm to the main planning issues involved and
that (a) that activities are limited to precompetitive research and development activities, (b) there is no
economic sector or geographical targeting, and (c) there are no export performance or use of domestic
inputs requirements.
8.    A firm will be eligible for up to 30% of the plan cost for all eligible expenditures under the plan.
With the implementation of the plan completed, the firm would not be eligible for further support. The
expectation and experience elsewhere shows that, once the Fund has introduced firms to the benefits of
the activities being supported, they will recognize their full value and the asymmetry of information or
undervaluation of the benefits for business support services will be substantially alleviated.
Firm Eligibilty
9.    Ecuadorian firms with well-defined and time-bound agreed International Competitiveness Plans
designed to increase the international competitiveness of existing products, or develop new products or
new markets would participate on a self-selection basis against objective criteria provided for in this
Manual. The maximum of US$50,000 would be available from the Fund to any single firm for all
activities.
Basic Procedures
10.   The following represents the basic sequence to apply for and execute a plan under the Fund: (1)
information promotion on program; (2) presentation of a draft plan, (3) account executive assigned to
assist client and/or review applications, (4) funding approval, (5) execution of plan, with the firm paying
100% of costs, (6) request for reimbursement and review of documentation evidencing that plan was
implemented as agreed, (7) payments of up to 50% of qualifying expenditures to suppliers of client.

Country: Ecuador                                             Project Title: International Trade and Integration
Eligible Expenditures
11.   Support will only provided for expenditures on fees for advisory and information services,
training, travel, quality or environmental testing and certifications insofar as they contribute directly to the
plan. Salaries, other recurrent costs (such as office rental or advertising) and capital goods, among
others, are not eligible.
Management and Supervision
12.   The Fund will be implemented under management contract with Ecuador Exporta by a firm with
substantial prior experience in this field, for which Terms of Reference will be agreed. It will adopt,
subject to Bank approval, annual work programs. The cost of the contract will be borne by the Bank 's
loan. The management contract will carry out the day-to-day management of the Fund, including one
Manager and several administrators. The Manager will report directly to the Ecuador Exporta, which
will primarily ensure adherence by the Fund Manager to the Statement of Policies and Ciperating
Procedures and will review the operations of the Fund through quarterly progress reports to be received
no later than two weeks thereafter and an annual report submitted by the Manager. If as a consequence
of the report, the Bank concludes that Fund's operations do not conform with this Statement, the Bank
will so notify the Borrower and agreement will be sought on action to be taken to remedy the problem.
In the absence of such agreement, the Bank shall have the right to suspend further commitments and
disbursements under the program.
Approval of Individual Applications
13.   The Manager will review and have the authority to approve any support without limit to the
amount that conforms to the eligibility criteria defined in this. No prior review by Ecuador Exporta or
the World Bank will be required, subject to satisfactory implementation performance and abidance by this
Statement and thus also to the provisions of the Loan Agreement.
14.   The Board of Ecuador Exporta will then review these approvals quarterly to ensure that they are
within the policies and procedures of the statement. Only in the event that fraudulent information is
determined to have been provided on support application can the Board cancel an already approved
support. In the event that approvals do not otherwise conform to policies and procedures, corrective
guidance or sanctions will be provided by the Board to the Manager as appropriate. World Bank
supervision missions will also regularly review the Fund.
Monitoring Compliance by Recipients
15.   Each support application is to include a definition of the specific outputs that are to be achievecd
by each activity supported. Examples of acceptable deliverables include a set of market exploration visit
reports; a product prototype; or a market participation strategy. The sight of the specified outputs will
allow a Fund administrator to verify that the support was indeed used for the purpose approved. The
administrator has the right to view these outputs at the client firm's premises, but not the right tc,
photocopy or photograph them, or remove them. All outputs remain the exclusive property of the client:
firm.



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 47
Country: Ecuador                                           Project Title: International Trade and Integration
16.  In accepting support assistance, a firm will be obliged to keep records, the sight of which will
allow the administrator to verify that the firm had made its matching contribution to the cost supported.
Within three months of the end of each year of operating of the Fund, the Fund will submit to Ecuador
Exporta and the Bank independent financial audits of the use of funds under the program, to be carried
out by independent certified auditing, approved in advance by the Bank.
Payment of Support
17.   The payment of each support amount is on a reimbursement basis of payments already made by
the enterprise. Payments are also conditional upon verification of outputs, and records of actual
expenditures made in line with the approved support application.
Monitoring Support Impact
18.   The support recipient is obliged to supply the Fund's management with data permitting an impact
assessment on international competitiveness and/or outward-oriented growth. Bank supervision missions
have the same rights to view outputs and records, on a sampling basis, for supervision purposes. Actual
assessment will be made by qualified independent consultants contracted by the Project's Technical
Support Unit. This information will be reported to Ecuador Exporta, the Government and to the Bank
annually.
19.   Within two years after the final disbursement from the Fund, Ecuador Exporta will supply to the
Bank an impact study, which will assess the overall impact of the Fund, report on specific successes and
failures; and on lessons learned.
Review of Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures
20.   The SPOP will be reviewed both by Ecuador Exporta and the World Bank on a regular basis and
may be modified as deemed necessary to achieve the objective of the Program. The SPOP should
maintain a balance between, on the one hand, preserving automaticity and transparency in the approvals
process and, on the other, minimizing abuse and unproductive use of funds. All amendments to the
SPOP must be approved first by the entity, and then by the Bank, before becoming effective.
WTO Compatibility
21.   The proposed Funds are comparable with those of many national, provincial and state
governments in the world which facilitate the provision of information about overseas markets to firms
within their jurisdictions. They are also consistent with the new framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The grants are non-actionable subsidies as defined in Article 8 of the Agreement
on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. They are non-actionable because they are not specific, as

would fall under the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 8, principally the exception fo:r
research activities carried out on a contract basis for industrial research and for pre-cornpetitive
development activity. In appropriate cases, the exception for adaptation of existing facilities to new
environmental requirements could also be applicable.
22.   In accordance with Article 8.3, the program will be notified to the WTO by the Governmnent. The
Manual also provides for a quarterly review of performance of the Funds by Ecuador Exporta and the
Bank to ensure that the rules are strictly adhered to in practice.
II. Grassroots Growth Fund Pilot Program
Objective
1.    The objective of the Grassroots Growth Fund (GGF) is to help to speed entrepreneurial learning
and innovation on the part of low-income microbusinesses for the development of direct or, more likely,
indirect exporter links 8, The Fund would provide integral support to the efforts of the Departnnent of
Microbusinesses and Artisans in MICIP and the Plan of Action of "The Challenge for Year 2000"
developed by a consortium of NGOs and other interested groups in Ecuador.
Expected Results
2.    The Fund will extend up to 50% matching support to assist microbusinesses under agreed
outward growth programs to access non-financial services provided by qualified non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). The remaining 50% will come from a combination of contributions from the
microbusiness itself and the NGO. Such NGOs will provide technical extension services at the
community level in the form of information, training, demonstration equipment, and technical advisory
services. Such services are expected to result in increased capacity of microbusinesses to perform basic
business management and financial management fumctions, understand international market product
preferences and requirements, adapt product designs and upgrade product quality, improve packaging,
labeling and product delivery services, and generate export market linkages with potential business
partners---such as Ecuadorian firms operating as direct exporters, overseas buyers, suppliers, private
associations and joint venture partners.
Qualification of NGOs
3.    The management of the GGF would be carried out under the same management contract as that
for the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund. The contractor would be responsible for the
following:
* qualify the technical and implementation capacity of NGOs seeking to participate,
*  qualify outward growth programs to be prepared jointly between NGOs and individual or
groups of microbusinesses,
8"Indirect" exporters provide intermediate production inputs to local direct exporters or provider final goods to
local trading companies.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                Page 49
Country: Ecuador                                            Project Title: International Trade and Integration
* oversee implementation of such programs for which NGOs would have lead responsibility,
* provide reimbursements of up to 50% of qualified expenditures.
Eligibility criteria for NGO participation would entail an adequate capacity to perform the following: (i)
carry out broad-based campaigns to inform and educate urban and rural low -income communities on the
benefits and processes involved in outward-oriented growth, (b) identify microbusiness groups in such
communities, foster group cooperation among them in planning outward growth programs, and help them
to prepare such programs to enhance their export, (c) provide effective extension services to such groups
to help them implement these programs, including by fostering group cooperation among microbusinesses
so as to take advantage of economies of scale in production and support services; and (d) link community
producer groups with an established exporters and importers to help carry out them convert these
precompetitive programs into direct or indirect commercial export sales.
Outward Growth Programs
4.    An outward growth program is the basis for determining and providing NGO support services to
one or a group association of microbusinesses and should include a detailed description of the objectives,
outputs, activities, resources and workplan needed to help develop direct or indirect international
competitiveness of existing products, or development of new products or new markets. For such a
program, an NGO applying for support should demonstrate (a) the appropriateness of the program to the
microbusiness' needs and its commitment to implement the program; (b) an ability to provide the specific
extension services called for in the program; (c) estimates of the likely benefits of the program to the
entrepreneur and community. In evaluating the program, the management contractor for the Fund will
satisfy themselves that these considerations are met and that (a) that activities are limited to
precompetitive research and development work, (b) there is no economic sector or geographical
targeting, and (c) there are no export performance or use of domestic inputs requirements.
5.    The basic sequence to apply for and execute a program under the Fund would be: (1) information
promotion on the Fund; (2) presentation of a draft program by an NGO, (3) a Fund administrator is
assigned to assist the NGO and review an application, (4) funding approval, (5) execution of program,
with the NGO paying 100% of costs, (6) request for reimbursement and review of documentation
evidencing that program was implemented as agreed, (7) payments of up to 50% of qualifying
expenditures to the NGO or its suppliers. With the implementation of the program completed, the
beneficiary microbusinesses would not be eligible for further support.
Firm Eligibilty
6.    Ecuadorian firms with fewer than 12 employees and collaborating with qualified NGOs providing
acceptable outward-oriented growth programs would participate on a self-selection.
Eligible Expenditures
7.    Support will only provided for expenditures on extension services in the form of information
services, training, travel, demonstration equipment, technical advisory services fees, quality or
environmental testing and certifications insofar as they contribute directly to the approved program.

Country: Ecuador                                           Project Title: Intemational Trade and ][ntegration
Salaries, other recurrent costs (such as office rental or advertising) and capital goods, among others, are
not eligible.
Management and Supervision
8.    The Fund will be implemented as part of the management contract with Ecuador Exporta for the
Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund by a firm with substantial prior experience in this field, for
which Terms of Reference will be agreed. It will adopt, subject to Bank approval, annual work programs
for the GGF and the cost of the contract will be bome by the Bank's loan. The management contract
will carry out the day-to-day management of the GGF. The Manager will report directly to the Ecuador
Exporta, which will primarily ensure adherence by the Fund Manager to the Statement of Policies and
Operating Procedures and will review the operations of the Fund through quarterly progress reports to be
received no later than two weeks thereafter and an annual report submitted by the Manager. If as a
consequence of the report, Ecuador Exporta and the Bank conclude that Fund's operations do not
conform with this Statement, the Bank will so notify the Borrower and agreement will be sought on
action to be taken to remedy the problem. In the absence of such agreement, the Bank shall have the
right to suspend further commitments and disbursements under the Fund.
Approval of Individual Applications
9.    The Manager will review and have the authority to approve any support without limil: to the
amount that conforms to the eligibility criteria defined in this Statement. No prior review by Ecuador
Exporta or the World Bank will be required, subject to satisfactory implementation performanice and
abidance by this Statement and thus also to the provisions of the Loan Agreement.
10.   The Board of Ecuador Exporta will then review these approvals quarterly to ensure that they are
within the policies and procedures of the statement. Only in the event that fraudulent -information is
determined to have been provided on support application can the Board cancel an already approved
support. In the event that approvals do not otherwise conform to policies and procedures, corrective
guidance or sanctions will be provided by the Board to the Manager as appropriate. World Bank
supervision missions will also regularly review the Fund.
Monitoring Compliance by Recipients
11.   Each support application is to include a definition of the specific outputs that are to be achieved
by each activity supported. The sight of the specified outputs will allow a Fund administrator to verify
that the support was indeed used for the purpose approved. The administrator has the right to view these
outputs, but not the right to photocopy or photograph them, or remove them. In accepting support
assistance, an NGO will be obliged to keep records, the sight of which will allow the administraitor to
verify that the firm had made its matching contribution to the cost supported. Within three months of the
end of each year of operating of the Fund, the Fund will submit to Ecuador Exporta and the Bank
independent financial audits of the use of funds under the program, to be carried out by independent
certified auditing, approved in advance by the Bank.

Payment of Support
12.   The payment of each support amount is on a reimbursement basis of payments already made by
the NGO. Payments are also conditional upon verification of outputs, and records of actual expenditures
made in line with the approved support application.
Monitoring Support Impact
13.   The NGO is obliged to supply the Fund's management with data permitting an impact assessment
on outward growth. Bank supervision missions have the same rights to view outputs and records, on a
sampling basis, for supervision purposes. Actual assessment will be made by qualified independent
consultants contracted by the Project's Technical Support Unit. This information will be reported to
Ecuador Exporta, the Government and to the Bank annually.
14.   Within two years after the final disbursement from the Fund, Ecuador Exporta will supply to the
Bank an impact study, which will assess the overall impact of the Fund, report on specific successes and
failures; and on lessons learned.
Review of Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures
15.   The SPOP will be reviewed both by Ecuador Exporta and the World Bank on a regular basis and
may be modified as deemed necessary to achieve the objective of the Fund. The SPOP should maintain a
balance between, on the one hand, preserving automaticity and transparency in the approvals process and,
on the other, minimizing abuse and unproductive use of funds. All amendments to the SPOP must be
approved first by the entity, and then by the Bank, before becoming effective.

Annex 2D
Ecuador
International Trade and Inte2ration Project
"Eco-Exports" Program
Developing International Market Opportunities for
Ecologically Sustainable Products
1.     "Ecologically sustainable products" are defined for the purposes of environmental protection particularly
as those which respect good land stewardship, help maintain bio-diversity and assist in reducing global warming.
The public goods benefits derived from such products have also been demonstrated to have substantial benefits in
"niche" markets to their producers and intermediaries, often commanding "green" price premia. For example,
market studies in the US & UK have shown that in 19% of the market, there is a willingness to pay for a 13%
green premium for wood products originating from a well-managed forest. In the specialty coffee industry in the
US, a premium price for an organic and sustainable product has sold for 10 -15% more.
2.    Development of eco-export products has been supported by a variety of world wide initiatives, including
ISO 14000, the Fair Trade Federation, the International Federation for Alternative Trade, the Forest Stewardship
Council, Certified Eco-Friendly, and the European Union's Eco-label Award Scheme. The purpose of this
Project sub-component is to foster and support initiatives which simultaneously expand Ecuador's outward-
oriented growth and promote ecologically sustainable products in both producer and international consumer
markets.
3.    Types of Environmental Labels. The most common type of environmental labels are for regulatory purposes
to provide hazard warnings for notification. There are mandatory labels in many countries for items such as hazardous
pesticides and chemicals. In addition, voluntary "eco-labels" are used for export products to communicate information
about their products to the consumer. There are various kinds of such labels.
4     Seals of approval are marks or labels that identify products and services as less harmful to the environment
than similar products or services. The award of this seal is based on life cycle analysis (LCA). LCA attempts to identify
and measure the environmental effects of a product from cradle-to- grave. Special attention is warranted for the LCA,
because it represents a major attempt to measure the impact of a product on the environment from its extraction of raw
materials, production, waste, transportation and distribution, through to its use and disposal. These labels constitute an
endorsement of some kind and attempt to ensure the consumer of his/her purchasing decision. Examples include
organic certified products, which are based on legal criteria from the USA and Europe and on certification b,y
inspection and testing.
5.    Single attribute certificates are eco-labels that focus on the stage of a product's lifecycle assumed to be most
important to the consumer. However, the scope of single attribute or issue certificates varies from program to
program. Often, this eco-label doesn't necessarily say anything about the product per se. With tropical forest products,
these labels are used to highlight a particular attribute ("we plant two trees for every one we harvest") or the use of
proceeds from the sale of the product ("a portion of the profits are used to support the local indigenous people").
Examples may refer to recycled material, energy reduction, resalable, refillable, recyclable, degradable/bio-degradable.
6.    Report cards provide consumers information about the environmental consequences of a product or service..
Report cards, in contrast to seals of approval, provide summary statistics on LCA performance scores and the different

Country: Ecuador                                              Project Title: International Trade and Integration
variables considered. The consumer can then decide which aspects of the product are most important (e.g., energy
consumption, contamination, bio-diversity, etc.).
7.    Product Quality Certification: Standards, Criteria and Regulations. Two dominant approaches are used.
The product or practices approach measures or ranks specific characteristics attributed to the origins of a natural or
agricultural product according to ecological, social and economic performance indicators. This method is dependent on
measuring performance indicators in several categories and is principally dependent on rigorous field audits. These are
used, for example, by the rainforest alliance (Eco Ok), Organic Produce (Organic Crop Improvement Association),
Forest Stewardship Council - Wood Products, Tropical timbers.  The systems approach or environmental
management systems (EMS) approach attempts to evaluate an operation's ability to manage in an environmentally
sound and sustainable manner. It focuses on the overall approach of the operational entity to managing the natural
resource base and the checks balances and feedback mechanisms put in place to ensure adaptive and sound
management as new information becomes available in technological advances.
8.    As an example, the Rainforest Alliance provides ECO-OK certification to farms (e.g., in Costa Rica) that
meet strict code of environmental standards. These standards cover areas such as the conservation of vegetative
cover, agrochemical management, forest conservation, waste management, environmental education and training,
environmental research, and the safeguard the health of workers. ECO-OK staff work with media, consumers,
distributors, and retailers to educate them about the environmental costs of tropical agriculture and the ECO-OK
alternative. Consequently, aware consumers are willing to pay a slightly higher price with reassurance that they
are helping rainforest conservation efforts
9.    Key Issues for Producers. Eco-exports have become in recently years more popular and marketable, and,
while not for everyone, provide a potential niche market opportunities for specific producers. There are at least two
important issues for a business considering whether it can become successfully involved in an eco-export market: (a)
the cost of the certification process itself, which not only requires an initial field analysis, but additional checks during
subsequent years. Associated with certification is resource management improvements which are often required as new
practices at the management unit level to meet certification needs. (b) the need for overall "policing" of the
accreditation process. Stamps of approval need to be verified through criteria and standards thresholds and checked by
authorities or approved accreditation operations.
10.   Project Support. During Project preparation, individual discussions were held on this subject with many
Government agencies and private associations, a formal presentation made at the FEDEXPOR Conference in
Guayaquil, and two seminars held with 95 participants in Quito and Guayaquil representing the private sector, public
sector, research and conservation organizations. A number of initiatives in this area were identified, including
programs in Esmeralda for certified tropical woods with USAID and ODA support, organic coffee from a certified
organic farm in the Galapagos, plans to produce green seal flowers by tropical flower growers, and a promotion
campaign for organic cacao by several producers and exporters.
11.   However, preparation work also determined that, for most producers, it is extremely difficult to readily find
sufficient information or contacts, and to have adequate resources to undertake any detailed exploration regarding eco-
exporting. Producers also expressed frustration in their attempt to gather useful information on wholesalers, market
opportunities, and to find ways to gain access to the green market. Thus, in the context of the Project's component to
help increase outward-oriented growth, Ecuador Exporta would assist particularly smaller firms, community producer
organizations and smaller cooperatives to take advantage of eco-exporting. It would administer the following to
address research, production and promotion phases of the cycle, whose execution would in general be outsourced:

* Sensitization outreach programs - workshops, information bulletins, to explain the special characteristics of
ecologically sustainable products and eco-exporting
* Under the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund, partially cover the cost of assistance for
*  acquisition of market information and studies on existing eco-export products & market trends to help
understand consumer desires and define a specific eco-market niche and existing competitors
*  pre-feasibility studies to help define technical production changes (e.g., no pesticides, more manual
labor), determine costs to make such changes, market prices and the expected returns on investment
and risks of eco-export products
*  identify mechanisms for acquiring certification and establish credibility of third party certifiers
* establishing direct market access links through trade fairs, market visits and the like between
exporters in Ecuador and importers and distributors of sustainable products, and
*  pilot programs for products to demonstrate concretely eco-export market penetration strategies.

Annex 5
Ecuador
International Trade and Integration Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
1.     The Project's Technical Support Unit will be responsible for ensuring that procurement is carried out in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised
September 1997) and the Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January
1997, revised September 1997). The TSU will carry out two basic tasks: (1) support and oversight of the process for
selection of consultants and procurement of goods performed by the managing agencies (MICIP and CORPEI) and (2)
contracting of all procurement actions for Component 1 (modernizing international trade management & increasing market
access) and the Product Quality Program. For these components, the basic procurement tasks of the MICIP and the Product
Quality Program will be to provide the TSU with the technical inputs for the procurement process - e.g.: preparation of
detailed TOR for consultants and specifications for bidding documents for goods/works, short lists, evaluation of proposals
and bids (in accordance with criteria set-out in standard RFPs and bidding documents) and selection/award
recommendations.
2.     Given the large number of small contracts (maximum sub-project size: $50,000) expected under Component 2 for
the Ecuador Exporta Program, contracting responsibility will be given to CORPEI for this Component. The bulk of the
contracts financed by the two grant Funds under this Component are expected to be for training and advisory services
provided by individual consultants, training institutes and NGOs to the beneficiaries of the grants.    Since most
beneficiaries (grant recipients) will be from the private sector and beneficiaries will cofinance the services themselves,
procurement of these services from finns and NGOs may follow commercial practices acceptable to the Bank. To assist
beneficiaries in identifying service providers, CORPEI will maintain a roster of individuals, firms and NGOs which are able
to provide advisory and other services under the Program. This roster will be internationally, locally and periodically
advertised, continuously open for registration, and will include all service providers which meet the criteria established for
the roster and agreed with the Bank. These criteria will include adequate experience in supporting outward-oriented firm-
level growth and will be specified, along with the procedures for awarding grants to beneficiaries, in the Operating Manual
for each of the Funds (Annex 2C).
3.     Other procurement methods are detailed in Table A and prior review thresholds in Table B.
Disbursement
4.     The closing date for loan disbursements would be June 30, 2002. The loan proceeds would be disbursed against
the categories shown in Annex 6 Table C. Given the interest of Project clients to avoid a hiatus between the design and
delivery stages, retroactive financing of up to 10% of the loan amount ($2.1 million) is proposed for expenditures incurred
not earlier than February 24, 1998. Disbursement requests will be based on certified Statement of Expenditures (SOEs),
except for payments under LIB goods and contracts above $100,000 equivalent for consultant firms and $50,000 for
individual consultants. Documentation for SOEs would be retained at the TSU and available for review of the Bank and
external auditors.
5.     The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) for goods, 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local
expenditures, (b) for works, 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures, (c) 100% of consulting services
exclusive of those financed under the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund and the Grassroots Growth Fund, and
(d) 30% of expenditures under the Entrepreneurial Learning and Innovation Fund and 50% of expenditures under the
Grassroots Growth Fund. A special account would be opened in the central bank or a commercial bank acceptable to the
Bank in an amount equivalent initially to $0.7 million and can subsequently be increased to $2.0 million after
disbursements have reached $2.5 million.

surveys, 2 diagnostics studies to identify specific issues and institutional problems, and 3 cross-country
experience seminars and study tours.
2/ The period of about I year between identification and actual preparation was due to survey work and
