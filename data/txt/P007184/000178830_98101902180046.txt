INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO TIIE ENPRESA GUATEMALTECA DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
FOR A FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF GUATEMALA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Empresa Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL) with the guarantee of
the Republic of Guatemala for the equivalent of $16.0 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of a project to expand telecommunications facilities
in Guatemala during 1971-75. The loan would have a term of 20 years, includ-
ing 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Guatemala has received five Bank loans for a total of $50.5
million, two for power, amounting to $22 million and one loan each for
highways, education and livestock development. After an initial loan
for highways, made in 1955, the Bank suspended operations in Guatemala
because of the failure of successive Guatemalan Governments to settle a
dispute regarding three outstanding sterling bond issues. Following settle-
ment of the sterling debt, the Bank resumed lending to Guatemala in 1967.
The last loan, for livestock development, was signed in February 1971. In
addition to the proposed loan, the lending program for FY1972 includes a
loan for power, which has just been appraised. No operations are scheduled
at present for FY1973.
3.        On October 31, 1971, a total of $15.1 million remained to be dis-
bursed on four loans, two for power, one for education and one for livestock
development. Execution of the two power loans has on the whole been satis-
factory, but disbursements on the education loan have been delayed by a com-
bination of factors, including the change of government and unsatisfactory
performance of consultants. Improvements, however, have taken place in re-
cent months and construction is about to start. Disbursement of the livestock
development loan, which was made effective in July 1971, should begin shortly.
A summary statement of Bank loans to Guatemala as of October 31, 1971, is at
Annex I.
4.        An IFC loan of $0.2 million in 1958 for a flour mill has been
fully repaid. In 1969, IFC approved an investment of up to $0.9 million
to finance construction and operation of a hotel in Guatemala City.   This
project has however recently been cancelled, since the sponsors no longer



-2-
considered it justified in view of the disappointing tourism market devel-
opment during the past year and uncertain prospects. IFC is discussing
with the Government and private sponsors (the International Nickel Corpora-
tion) the possibility of participating in the financing of a large nickel
project, which has been under consideration for several years.
5.        Other external financing is principally provided by USAID, the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI). AID is financing mainly rural development
and primary education, but has also during the last year granted loans for
rural electrification, housing and health services, and has provided tech-
nical assistance in the field of tax administration. IDB is mainly active
in agriculture (general credit lines, irrigation and fisheries), housing,
transportation (feeder roads and maintenance) and water supply. CABEI is
financing regional projedts, principally in roads and telecommunications.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        A "Memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects"
(CA-15), dated November 12, 1971, Is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
7.        The new Government has made substantial progress in creating sev-
eral key institutions through which a more dynamic public investment program
can be launched to overcome the serious socio-economic structural imbalances
which exist in Guatemala. The fiscal situation has improved. Following an
increase in tax rates in 1967-70, Central Government revenue in 1970 record-
ed a satisfactory 10 percent rate of growth. Similar revenue growth is ex-
pected in 1971-72, which should generate a current surplus sufficient to fi-
nance a substantial part of the investment program. However, a financing
gap is likely to appear in 1973 and increase in succeeding years unless ad-
ditional sources of revenue can be developed in time. The Bank is, therefore,
impressing upon the Government the need for further revenue measures.
8.        Over the next few years, the rate of growth of real GDP may decline
from the 6 percent experienced in 1968-70 to the 4-5 percent of the 1965-67
period because of poor prospects of the external sector, resulting from lower
coffee prices and the crisis in the Central American Common Market. In the
longer run, if financing problems surrounding the nickel project can be re-
solved and the project gets underway, export and growth prospects would be
enhanced considerably.

PART III - THE PROJECT
Sector Background
9.        Development of telecommunications has in the past been neglected
and as a result existing local and long-distance facilities are inadequate
to meet Guatemala's current needs. As of the end of 1970 there were 38,000
lines in operation and 35,500 applications for telephone connections, 77 per-
cent of them in Guatemala City. The long-distance domestic service, which
is still based on the use of open wire and HF radio, is limited in size and
spread, of poor quality and congested. International facilities, based on
open wire and HF radio, were unsatisfactory, but have improved considerably
with the opening in November 1971 of the Central American Microwave Network.
10.       Progress in the past was hampered by unsatisfactory sector organi-
zation. Prior to April 1971, the responsibility for providing telecommuni-
cations services was divided between two entities, of which one, Direccion
General de Telecomunicaciones (DGT), was responsible for national telephone
and telegraph operations, and the other, Empresa Guatemalteca de Telecomuni-
caciones Internacionales (GUATEL INT), was responsible for international
services. DGT was a Government department with its budget and accounts form-
ing part of the Government budget and accounts, and its role was largely li-
mited to technical supervision and operation, whereas planning, development
and contracting activities took place in other committees and departments of
the Government. GUATEL INT was an efficient autonomous entity organized on
a commercial basis.
11.       The 1971-75 Development Plan recommended a five-year expansion pro-
gram to improve and expand local and long-distance telecommunications facil-
ities and appropriately reorganize the telecommunications sector. Following
recommendations of consultants financed by USAID and in close consultation
with the Bank, the new Government set about reorganizing the sector and, in
April 1971, carried out the merger of the existing entities into one autono-
mous entity (GUATEL) to be responsible for all public telecommunications ser-
vices in Guatemala, except for existing domestic telegraph service, which
was incorporated in the national postal system.
Project Entity
12.       GUATEL is a public autonomous entity.   Overall control of the sec-
tor continues to be the responsibility of the Minister of Communications and
Public Works, who is also the Chairman of GUATEL's Board. In the Bank's view,
the Board and the Management are vested with the necessary powers to operate
the entity efficiently.
13.       GUATEL has been satisfactorily organized and, by merging the staff
from the former entities, should be in a position to build a good team, capa-
ble of developing the telecommunications sector to meet the country's needs.



-4-
At present, GUATEL is assisted by technical experts from the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Bundespost, Federal Republic of Germany,
and it has agreed to continue employing some of these experts in the work re-
lated to local exchange systems. In addition, GUATEL is arranging to obtain
experts in management and organization from Canada. With this assistance
GUATEL should have the necessary planning, engineering and supervisory capa-
bility to execute and operate the Project.
Project Description and Financing Plan
14.       The proposed Project includes most of GUATEL's expansion program
for 1971-1975. The main features of the Project and the Loan are summarized
in Annex III. The principal components of the Project are:
(i) installation of about 35,000 lines of local exchange
equipment;
(ii)  expansion of cable distribution and subscriber facilities
to provide approximately 35,000 additional direct exchange
connections;
(iii) installation of long-distance facilities including microwave
systems between Guatemala City and three major provincial
cities.
Besides the Project, the expansion program for 1971-75 includes ongoing
works, of which the main items are facilities for the regional Central
American network and the new telecommunications center building of GUATEL.
The Project, which ranks very high in the Government's priorities, would
meet part of the projected demand for telephone connections and would
alleviate congestion and delays in the national long-distance traffic. The
long-distance facilities included in the Project, together with those being
financed by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) as
part of a regional project, will for the first time provide adequate long-
distance and international service.
15.       The estimated cost of the Project is $21.2 million, or almost
90 percent of the cost of the 1971-75 expansion program., which is estimated
at $23.9 million. The proposed loan of $16.0 million would cover the for-
eign cost of the Project. GUATEL's financing requirements over the five
years, including increased working capital and advance expenditures on in-
vestments to be completed after 1975, total $31.2 million. The proposed
loan would provide 51 percent of the total funds required, 32 percent would
be generated within the enterprise, 9 percent would come from future borrow-
ing and 8 percent from the CABEI loans already contracted.



-5-
Financial Position of Borrower
16.       The merger of DGT and GUATEL TNT into the new entity will be com-
pleted by December 31, 1971. By that time GUATEL will have taken over all
assets and liabilities of the previous entities and the new entity will
have full financial autonomy. In the past, DGT's financial performance
had been weak, with low rates of return, almost no growth of gross fixed
assets and a reliance on funds from the national budget. GUATEL INT, on
the other hand, had shown a strong financial performance, with high rates
of return and a rapid growth of gross assets. Over the period 1968 to 1970
it had contributed about $1.8 million to the national budget. The disparity
in the operating results of the two entities had been largely due to the fact
that GUATEL INT operated the most profitable part of the services without
sharing its revenues with DGT, whose own revenues were prejudiced by tariff
concessions granted to Government users.
17.       The future financial position of GUATEL is projected to be sound
and the financial forecasts show an adequate profit level over the project
period. A decision lhas already been taken, in response to a recommendation
by the Bank, to eliminate the concessions to Government subscribers and to
restructure tariffs, which will bring substantial additional earnings.
GUATEL does not pay taxes but is required instead to distribute to the Gov-
ernment 45 percent of annual net profits, estimated to be about $5.8 million
over the project period. Even after this distribution, GUATEL will be able
to finance a substantial part of the expansion program. To ensure adequate
cash generation for future investment, GUATEL has agreed to maintain tariffs,
beginning in 1973, at a level which will result in a minimum annual rate of
return on average net fixed assets in service of 10 percent, after deducting
the statutory distribution to the Government.
18.       GUATEL's debt service coverage is projected to be satisfactory.
GUATEL hias agreed not to undertake any long-term debt without the Bank's
prior approval, unless net revenues would cover its debt service at least
1.5 times. GUATEL has also agreed not to undertake any major investment
outside the Project during the disbursement period of the proposed loan,
unless the financing plan has been agreed upon with the Bank.
Procurement
19.       All goods financed by the Bank would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding, with the exception of additions of switching
equipment to the existing exchanges, for which prices would be negotiated.
These additions, which GUATEL would procure from the original supplier for
reasons of compatibility, are estimated to cost $1 million.
20.       The provisions for international competitive bidding give
recognition to existing arrangements in the Central American Common
Market by allowing a margin of preference in bid valuation for bids sub-
mitted by suppliers in all the Central American countries. These countries
have entered into an Agreement on Fiscal Incentives in which they each agree



-6-
to give preferential treatment (limited to 50 percent of existing import
duties) to products of Central American origin in all public procurement,
even though the procuring agencies (such as GUATEL) may be entitled to ex-
emption from import duties. Provision is made in the Loan Agreement that
the preference so allowed shall not exceed 15 percent. It is not expected
that any orders will be placed in Guatemala under the proposed arrangement
and orders likely to be placed in other Central American Common Market
countries are unlikely to exceed 5 percent of the loan amount.
Economic Justification
21.       The expansion program, including the Project, is technically sound
and economically justified. The internal financial rate of return, defined
as the discount rate which equates the present worth of Project costs to
attributable revenues, is conservatively estimated at 17 percent. The
economic return would be higher.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and GUATEL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Guatemala and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for telecommunica-
tions projects.
23.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
