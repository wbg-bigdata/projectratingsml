                         Bangladesh Reaching Out of School Children (ROSC) project has provided “second chance? primary education to more than 798,000 out-of-school children in 23,600 learning
                         centers. Beneficiary students, more than half of them girls, came from the 90 poorest sub-districts (upazilas) of the country. The project, backed by funds and technical assistance

                         ROSC funding consisted of IDA's original Grant Financing of US$51 million in 2004, along with US$6 million Trust Fund Co-financing from the Swiss Development Cooperation and
                         the Bangladesh Government funding of US$5 million. IDA approved an additional US$35 million credit for this project in 2010 to broaden the project’s impact to additional 30 upazilas.

                         The project provides grants to learning centers (LCs) and allowances to students. LCs are established and operated by communities through Center Management Committees, with
                         support from government (upazila education offices) and Education service and resource providers (NGOs).

                         The project is on track to achieve its development objective with the following achievements in KPIs: (a) 798,000 out-of-school children reached (against an endline target of 750,000
                         for 2013); (b) 2.7 million student-years (against a target of 2.9 mil target); and (c) teacher assessment of student competency in Bangla and Mathematics around 80% (against target
                         of 65%); (d) average student attendance rate of 90% (against target of 75%); (e) average grade completion rate of 90% (against target of 85%); (f) average teacher attendance rate of
                         90% (against target of 90%); and (f) availability textbooks (of the National Curriculum and Textbooks Board) for 99% of eligible students. Total IDA disbursements reached US$85.1
                         million equivalent (the disbursement ratio of 95%, when both the original Grant and AF Credit are taken together). The implementation progress is commendable in view of
                         satisfactory completion of planned activities on school level service delivery.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         October 2, 2012, the World Bank approved an IDA credit of US$130 million for a follow-on operation ROSC II to be implemented in 148 upazilas of the country. ROSC II will finance
                         activities to: (i) continue supporting students in currently operational ROSC LCs (established in 2010 and 2011 from additional financing) to enable them to complete grade 5; (ii)
                         scale up ROSC approach in 100 new upazilas; and (iii) pilot ROSC intervention in selected urban slums and a pre-vocational skills training scheme for older ROSC students.
