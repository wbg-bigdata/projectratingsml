MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR_A FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$375 million to help finance a fourth telecommunications
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
a maturity of 20 years including 5 years of grace. Out of the proceeds of the
loan, $373 million would be relent to PT. Telekomunikasi, Indonesia (TELROM)
for 20 years including 5 years of grace, at a variable interest-rate pegged to
Bank Indonesia's three month domestic money market certificate (Sertifikat
Bank Indonesia - SBI), plus one percent. The Government would bear the
foreign exchange risk. The project is expected to be co-financed by Federal
Republic of Germany (KfW) for $71 million equivalent, France for $52 million
equivalent (Government $34.5 million and Credit Lyonnais $17.5 million), Japan
for $100 million equivalent (OECF $28.5 million and Sumitomo Corporation $71.5
million), Netherlands (ABN-AMRO Bank) for $84 million equivalent, Spain for
$50 million and USA (Exim Bank) for $75 million.
2.        Background and Sectoral Issues.  Domestic public telecommunications
services in Indonesia are provided by TELKOM and international services by PT.
rIDOSAT.  The Ministry of Tourism, Posts and Telecommunications (MTPT) is
responsible for sector policy and regulation. The performance of the
Indonesian telecommunications sector, both in quantity and quality, is a
constraint to economic development in Indonesia. Access to telephone service
in Indonesia (0.68 lines per 100 population) is the lowest among the ASEAN
countries. Quality of service is poor as reflected in a low successful call
completion ratio (402 for local, 20X for long distance).
3.        TELKOM has significantly improved its performance with the
assistance of several donors, including the Bank, over the last three years.
When its ongoing program is completed by 1996 TELKOM expects to increase the
telephone density to 1.7 lines per 100 population and achieve a self financing
ratio of over 48X compared to its present 40X. Current registered unmet
telephone demand (520,000 or 421 of working lines) is high and growing.
Government's recent decision to raise telephone density to 3 lines per 100
population by 2000 poses an extraordinary challenge to TELKOM both in
financial and operational terms. To successfully meet these challenges the
following key sector issues need to be addressed: (i) mobilizing at least-
cost the large capital needed for enormous investments to accelerate network
expansion and modernization; (ii) developing TELKOM into a modern,
commercially oriented organization capable of efficiently meeting
telecommunication needs of Indonesia; (iii) promoting competition and
increased private sector participation in the sector; and (iv) establishing a
regulatory regime to promote competition.
4.        Government Strategy. As part of its evolving strategy, government
has already implemented a number of reforms by: (i) beginning the process of
privatization by allowing private sector provision of non-basic services,
paging and customer premises equipment; (ii) introducing revenue sharing
agreements between TELKON and private investors for cellular telephone



-2-
systems; (iii) initiating studies to strengthen NMTPs capabilities to
effectively manage the sector; and (iv) changing PERUNITEL's legal status from
PERUM (an enterprise wholly owned by Government) to a PERSERO (limited
liability company whose capital is divided in shares which are currently
wholly owned by Government) now called TELKOM which is an important milestone
in the commercialization of the sector. Government recognizes the need to
adopt further reforms to achieve its more ambitious development objectives for
the sector. These include: (i) developing a second carrier to provide modern
telecommunications services in competition with the existing domestic carrier;
(ii) removing remaining barriers to active private sector participation in all
non-basic services as provided under Telecommunications Law No. 3; and
(iii) gradually shifting Government responsibility from ownership and
management to policy and regulation.
5.        LessLons Learned.  The lessons learned through Bank operations in
Indoresia and other developing countries in the telecommunications sector are
that: (a) when underpinned by comprehensive sector surveys, project
interventions receive greater commitment by borrowers and donors and their
implementation proceeds smoothly; (b) financing plans should be firmed up
prior to negotiations; (c) objectives for institution building should be
pursued in a long-term horizon through repeater projects to achieve major
results; (d) an integrated systems approach should be adopted to ensure that
all project components are tightly coordinated; (e) advance actions prior to
Board presentation should be initiated by the implementing agency in respect
of selecting consultants, prequalifying bidders, finalizing bid evaluation;
and (f) project implementation units with adequate authority and competent
staff should be established prior to project appraisal. These lessons have
been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government recognizes the
challenges to harness fully the benefits of advanced technology and modern
operating practices to improve sector performance. Based on the success of
past cooperation, GOI has requested the Bank to: (i) assist in the design of
its sector optimization program and in implementing it; (ii) make available to
Indonesia the benefit of similar experience and best practices from other
countries; and (iii) take the lead role in coordinating cofinancing from
donors to ensure that future sector development proceeds in an integrated and
cost-effective manner. In particular, the Bank assistance will help the
Government identify and analyze the legal, regulatory and institutional
constraints to improved sector performance, implement required changes and
support modernization and expansion of telecommunications facilities.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project has two main objectives:  (a) to
improve sector performance by promoting a regulatory regime conducive to
competition in the provision of telecommunication services; and (b) to meet
the growing demand for telecommunications services by enhancing the quality of
TELKON's service, effective utilization of existing facilities, increasing
system efficiency and modernizing and expanding the networks.

8.        Project Descrigtion.  The proposed pro4-:t, an integral part of
TELKON's 1992-1996 investment program, would comprise the following
components: (a) developing strategic options designed to promote competition
and increase private sector participation in the sector; (b) preparing and
implementing a time-bound action plan to restructure and decentralize TELKOM's
organization and improve quality and efficiency of its management, services
and operations; (c) rehabilitation of existing network facilities; (d)
installation of switching equipment and local cable network to connect about
600,000 new customer lines and about 20,000 pay phones; (e) installation and
upgrading of fiber optic and microwave transmission facilities to improve long
distance direct dialing service quality; and (f) computerization of selected
operational activities to improve efficiency and productivity. A breakdown of
the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations in
Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10345-IND, dated May 1, 1992, is
being distributed separately.
9.        ProJect Iplementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by TELKOM. To ensure effective project management, track emerging issues and
address them in a timely way, TELKOM has established a project implementation
unit (PIU) for the proposed project headed by a Project Director, with overall
responsibility for, project implementation, reporting to the Board of
Directors. The unit head and key staff members have already been appointed.
The PIU will be given adequate financial and administrative autonomy to enable
it to discharge its responsibilities effectively, have its own accounting,
procurement, transport, land acquisition, administrative and technical
sections, and keep separate and distinct project accounts for the Bank project
as a whole as well as its individual components. The critical path method
will be used to coordinate implementation of the project in order to minimize
the level of non-performing investment.
10.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements were reached (a)
with the Government on: (i) a time-bound action plan to address the sector
policy issues for promoting competition and improving regulatory framework;
(ii) availability of funds, particularly in foreign exchange to cover TELKOM's
capital expenditures; (iii) on-lending Bank funds to TELKOM under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and (iv) taking actions, including tariff
adjustments to enabls TELKOM to achieve the agreed financial performance
objectives; and (b) with TELKOM on: (i) maintaining debt service coverage of
1.5 and generating net internal cash of a minimum of 40 percent of the cost of
its current and next year's planned investment program; (ii) furnishing to the
Bank annually its proposals for tariff revisions, if any, and after taking
into account the Bank's comments, furnish to GOI for its consideration, any
proposed tariff adjustment; (iii) furnishing to the Bank a set of performance
targets for the next two years; and (iv) implementing an action plan for
strengthening TELKOM's institutional capabilities. Signing of the subsidiary
loan agreement for on-lending Bank funds to TELKOM will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.

11.       Environment.  The proposed project will have no adverse
environmental effects except that, given the magnitude of civil works related
to the laying of underground cables in cities and towns, there may be some
disruption to vehicular traffic and pedestrians in some locations. Mitigating
measures have been incorporated in the design of the underground cable network
and in the draft contracts to contain the disruptions within acceptable
limits.
12.       Benefits.  Institutional support provided under the project will
assist the government to strengthen its regulatory capability, which is
critical to the success of liberalization efforts. It will also assist TELKOM
to improve its performance as an effective and efficient entity operating on a
sound commercial basis. TELKON's institutional development will be pursued in
a number of ways, including on-the-job and overseas training and technical
assist&nce to improve managerial, financial and technical capabilities. The
investment component will satisfy part of the unmet demand for telecommuni-
cations services. Increased availability of telephone service and improved
quality of service will make an important contribution to increased busine3s
efficiency and productivity. The project will also continue to further
develop the local consultancy and outside plant contracting industries through
collaboration with international firms.
13.       Risks.  The principal risk relates to TELKOM's capability to imple-
ment the project. However, this risk is minimized by up front actions by
government and TELKOM wherever appropriate. In this regard, TELKOM has
already shown its commitment to the project by establishing a project imple-
mentation unit to oversee all aspects of the project on a full tire basis and
initiating advance procurement actions for major goods and services under the
proiect. In addition, adequate technical assistance is provided under the
project to assist TELKOM in the implementation and supervision of construction
works. Residual risks will be minimized by agreed measures to monitor project
implementation through agreed performance indicators, with corrective actions
to be initiated as necessary.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
