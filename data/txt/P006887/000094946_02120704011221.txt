3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
1.1    Background
The objectives and design of the Power Market Development Project (PMDP) need to be assessed in light
of developments which culminated with a radical reform of the energy sector and the power subsector in
particular. The 1980s were characterized by periodical financial crises in the power subsector which led
the Government to embark on a sweeping overhaul of its institutional structure. With Bank support
through the Energy Sector Management Assitance Program (ESMAP), during 1991-92 the Government
drafted supporting legislation (Electricity Law, Public Services Law) and organized an Energy and Gas
Regulatory Commnission (CREG) for restructuring the power subsector. Government policy consisted of
introducing competition by creating a bidding-based wholesale market for electricity and an open-access
transmission network, disengaging itself from direct participation in electricity production and distribution
through divestment of power plants and utilities, undertaking the development of new power stations with
private sector participation, introducing regulation where market mechanisms could not be effective, and
introducing pricing reforms to reflect costs. In the gas subsector, the Government aimed at developing the
resource by promoting gas-based electricity generation in order to reduce the reliance on hydroelectricity,
attracting private sector participation in building an infrastructure of gas pipelines, stimulating exploration,
creating an efficient gas trading and transportation system with private sector participation, together with a
market similar to that of the power sector.
Although achieving these objectives presented considerable challenges given relatively little worldwide
experience with bidding markets, by 1995 most of the required mechanisms and institutions had been set
up: (a) the Electricity Law and the Public Services Law had been passed by Congress; (b) the
Interconexi6n Electrica S.A. "E.S.P." (ISA) which prior to the reform operated the interconnection network
and owned major power plants, had been separated into a transmission company (ISA) and a generation
company (ISAGEN), thereby removing sources of conflicts of interest; (c) the wholesale power market (
Mercado de Energia Mayorista -MEM-) had been designed and organized, together with the settlement
function (Liquidador ;y Administrador de Cuentas -LAC-); and (d) the dispatching procedures based on
bids tendered by producers had been designed and set up within the existing dispatching facilities of ISA
(Centro Nacional de Despacho -CND-). ISA was designated to manage the three functions (MEM, LAC
and CND), in addition to its transmission network. However, the remuneration of all these activities is
regulated and accounted for separately, with a view to eventually having them operate independently if
required.
Despite these major institutional advances, a number of weak points remained to be addressed: (a) dispatch
and network monitoring were being executed with equipment and software dating back to the early 80s; (b)
the settlement function required monitoring of energy supplied to unregulated users (initially limited to
loads in excess of 2MW) as well as the skills to manage the contracts market between generators,
distributors, and suppliers; and (c) the transmission network required reinforcements in order to avoid
creating bottlenecks and constraints, thereby increasing prices. Lifting transmission network constraints
was expected to be addressed through ISA's Third Transmission Plan which included new 500 kV links to
the energy-poor southwest area of the country as well as a new link to the Atlantic Coast.
The PMDP was conceived as a further complement to Bank support for sector reform which was initiated
in 1991 with the ESMAP grant indicated above, and which continued with the Energy Sector Technical
Assistance Loan (ESTAL) -Loan 38270-. The latter's objective consisted of providing support for CREG
and the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) in the development of regulations and indicative planning
functions. The PMDP can be seen as providing both required infrastructure support and assistance in the
organization of the new dispatch and settlement centers. It was also the first major lending operation for
the power subsector since 1987.
-2-



1.2    Original Objectives:
The project's objective was to support power sector reform by facilitating the operation of a competitive
bulk supply market for electricity. Successful implementation of the project would remove barriers to
competition among generators, pushing bulk electricity prices towards their economic costs. Specifically,
the project would lift transmission constraints that hinder an open access to the grid and support ISA in its
role as transmission network operator, system generation dispatcher and commercial transactions
coordinator.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project was designed around three components:
(a) Enhancing the facilities of the Energy Dispatch Center and creating a Financial Settlement
Center in ISA in order to achieve a smooth operation of system dispatch under market
conditions at the bulk supply level. This component would adapt ISA's existing facilities to the
requirements of the new regulatory and commercial environment and would consist of: (a)
expanding the Energy Dispatch Center's supervisory system, including new metering and
telecommunications; (b) technological updating of the Dispatch Center's data processing
equipment and software; and (c) putting in place a Financial Settlement Center for keeping
track of energy transactions, payments to generators, invoicing of large consumers, and billing
of transmission costs through network charges.
(b) Expanding the interconnected transmission system through: (a) the reinforcement of
transmission facilities between the main generation center of San Carlos and the Southwest
region with a 380 km, 500 kV line and a 30 km, 230 kV line; (b) reinforcements in the Atlantic
Coast and Northeastern regions which consist of 240 km of 230 kV lines, together with
substation equipment; and (c) other transmission projects comprising line extensions and
substation expansion. This component would eliminate transmission bottlenecks and would
facilitate entry to the electricity market. Additionally, it would improve the economic
performance of the system by reducing system losses, increasing system reliability, and
lowering generation costs.
(c) Provision of consulting services and training programs to assist ISA in the strengthening of its
capabilities to assume its roles of: (i) transmission network operator; (ii) power dispatch
coordinator; and (iii) bulk electricity transaction clearing house. These activities would be
agreed upon between ISA and the Bank subject to an annual plan to be approved by the Bank.
Assessment. The objective was appropriate, and it reflected priorities forfurthering energy sector
reform: (O) by supporting ISA as the central operative institution under the new sector organization; and
(ii) by seeking to achieve a minimum cost operation by lifting transmission constraints and allowing the
competitive market to operate. It was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
The CAS was contained in the MOP of 19 November 1993 for a Secondary Education Project (Report
P-6070-CO) at the time, which, while emphasizing policy reform, institutional development, as well as a
shiftfrom resource transfers to technical assistance, also providedfor sector investment loans
conditional on progress of sector reforms, which clearlyfitted the project's concept. Project components
were well-conceived and realistic, and they reflected the project's objectives.
- 3-



3.4 Revised Components:
One of the proposed transmission links in the Atlantic Coast region (La Loma-Copey) was not built. It was
associated with the La Loma power station whose construction was postponed. Due to tefrorist activity,
ISA faced the problem of rebuilding transmission pylons, and an additional component to finance these
needs was included in the project. The transmission pylon recovery component fitted well with the
project's objective, as it removed a barrier to network flows, thereby promoting the wholesale market's
operation.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
In addition to assessing the relevance of the objectives and the project's design as reflected in its
components, quality of preparation depends on an objective recognition of risks and the measures to
mitigate them. The project was neither particularly complex nor risky. ISA had a background of
successfil project implementation and its revenues as a regulated transmission company were -and continue
to be- assured. Project components consisted of technically tested elements (hardware and software for the
CND, transmission line and substation equipment for network reinforcement) whose associated risks could
be minimized by the use of experienced consultants, as provided in the technical assistance component.
The project's Internal Rate of Return (IRR) (27% in the base case) was tested against a number of
unfavorable situations such as increases in investment costs, decreases in operating benefits and lower
demand, which-yielded rates of return above the 12% benchmark. Environmental risks were identified
during project preparation, and no major risks were expected to materialize. ISA conducted a Sector
Environmental Assessment of the Colombian power sector which included the overall impact of new
transmission lines included in its Third Plan. The project was classified in Environmental Category B.
Assessment Quality at entry is rated as Highly Satisfactory (HS): objectives and components were
congruent and realistic, project economics were thoroughly studied, and environmental contingencies
were taken into account.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Operation of a competitive bulk supply market for electricity. The MEM has been operating since
mid-1995. Since then, it has grown considerably and it has gained in complexity due to the increase in the
number of participants. Initially, unregulated users who could access the market were limited to those with
a demand in excess of 2MW which represented around 100 commercial borders in 1997; by 2001 the limit
had been reduced gradually to 100 kW (or a consumption in excess of 55MWh/month) and over 3,000
commercial borders were being monitored.
Removal of barriers to competition among generators/ pushing prices towards their economic costs.
Prices in the MEM respond to a combination of signals, including expectations regarding critical factors,
which include such hydrological phenomena as "El Nifio"- provoked droughts; a consequence of this is a
high volatility of prices which may vary considerably from one day to another. However, in retrospect,
prices appear to have reflected essentially short run marginal costs, with average values around
2-3USO/kWh. These are significantly below the long run marginal cost levels predicted by expansion
models; the difference can be explained by the large reserve margin which the system has accumulated due
to the stagnation of demand since 1996: peak demand in 2002 has reached values on the order of
7,500-8,000MW, while installed capacity is on the order of 13,000MW. The fact that prices in the MEM
have reflected this situation of oversupply is evidence of strong competition between generators and,
indirectly, of the market's success.
-4-



Lifting of transmission constraints. The transmission investments in the project have increased the
transfer capacity to the southwestern area of the country which is now supplied by a 500 kV link which
was built as part of the project.
Support of ISA as transmission network operator, system generation dispatcher and commercial
transactions coordinator. ISA has successfully discharged itself of these functions which were initially
entrusted to it; however, its main role remains that of transmission network operator, as the dispatching and
commercial coordination roles are the responsibility of distinct entities, CND and MvEM, which could, if
required, be separated from ISA.
4.2 Outputs by components:
(a) Energy Dispatch Center/ Financial Settlement Center. The technically obsolete dispatch center was
replaced with state of the art equipment and new software was developed and installed to conform to the
new dispatch miles; the financial settlement center was put in place and equipped with hardware and
software to handle the task of managing contracts and billing agents according to dispatch results.
(b) Strengthening and expansion of the interconnected transmission system. The components
envisaged in the Project were all put in place with the exception, as noted, of the La Loma-El Copey line
(cancelled together with the La Loma power station with which it was associated). Lines commissioned
through the project include a 378 kIn, 500 kV line (San Carlos-San Marcos), two 230 kV lines totaling 182
kln (Sochagota-Guatiguari and La Virginia-La Hermosa), and the expansion of 13 substations at 230 kV
and 500 kV.
(c) Provision of consulting services and training programs to assist ISA in its roles of transmission
network operator, power dispatch coordinator, and bulk electricity transaction clearing house. ISA
executed a training program to support its transmission network operation, dispatching, and settlement
functions; these activities were coordinated with the Bank through an annual plan. ISA instituted a training
and studies program which covered these areas in addition to instruction and education in power systems
technology, telecommunications, management, finance, human resource development, information
technology, and social and enviromnental management.
(d) Transmission pylon recovery. ISA developed expertise to deal with the technical aspects of
recovering damage from terrorist attacks and has consistently reduced the time and cost required to put
lines back into service. As of early 2002, ISA had recovered over 500 pylons which had collapsed due to
sabotage.
Assessment. The project achieved its development objectives related to supporting power sector reforms
which have progressed and deepened with competition, which is now reaching the level of smaller
regulated users.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) esimated the economic rate of return (ERR) for ISA's overall
expansion plan, which yielded an ERR of 27%. For the ICR, an ex-post ERR was estimated for the two
main investment components in the project -the San Carlos-San Marcos 500 kV line and the
Sochagota-Guatiguara 230 kV line-. They yielded Net Present Values (NPVs) (1996) of US$326 million
and US$14.2 million, respectively, at a 12% discount rate. The corresponding ERRs were 39% for San
Carlos-San Marcos and 17% for Sochagota-Guatiguari; the overall ERR when considering both lines was
34%. The benefit/cost (B/C) ratios were 3.0 and 1.3 for the two projects and 2.6 overall. All these values
are indicative of highly worthwhile investments.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
- 5-



The financial rate of return of transmission assets built prior to 2001 is regulated by CREG. The project's
transmission components fall into this category; as part of ISA's overall assets, they earn a 9% real rate of
return. This is slightly higher than the rate of return on revalued assets expected in the SAR (6-8%). It
should be noted that transmission additions to the grid are now regulated through a competitive bidding
procedure, which can yield higher or lower returns on assets.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project addressed the key elements underlying the new market structure: (a) the dispatch center
component which was essential to assuring an economic power system operation; (b) the financial
settlement component which was necessary to ensure the credibility of the proposed market scheme and to
achieve the cooperation of all agents taking part in it; (c) the transmission reinforcement component
facilitated the creation of a "level playing field" which was essential for MEM to operate as a competitive
market. MEM's subsequent success indicates a major contribution by the Project towards institutional
consolidation. It should be stressed that supporting the wholesale market has resulted in a radical change
of attitude regarding agents' behavior: by setting rules according to which production costs are revealed by
the bidding process, remuneration of agents in the market has ceased to be subject to centrally-determined
estimates (e.g. regarding costs) and is now a direct consequence of their own strategy and decisions.
Assessment In this project, the measure of effective institutional development is given by the
acceptance, by agents in the wholesale market, of rules and procedures adopted to put the dispatch and
settlement-functions in place. The latter have operated to satisfaction since the inception of the
wholesale market in 1995. Agents' complaints have been rare and have been dealt with at the
operational level. The PMDP loan was instrumental in providing resources which allowed these
institutions(CND, MEM, LAC) to build up their reputation and the impact is consequently rated as high.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The major factors affecting the ultimate outcomes of the Government's strategy, and arguably outside its
control, are the related phenomena of economic recession and terrorism. Economic recession has led to a
stagnation of demand; terrorist activity has focused on felling transmission pylons. The latter's effect has
been to create transmission constraints and to increase production costs due to the dispatch of out of merit
plants. Paradoxically, the negative economic effects of terrorism have been attenuated by the economic
recession: the terrorist attacks to the transmission system did not induce major blackouts due to the
depressed power demand caused by the economic recession; if economic growth had not been stunted,
country-wide blackouts would have resulted from terrorist acts on the power transmission system. Lately,
terrorist activity has led CREG to have to regulate on matters which were originally conceived for very
unlikely circumstances (such as network separation due to natural causes) and which have become a part of
daily life. Originally, the costs of such events (due to out of merit dispatch) were passed on to consumers;
however, this in effect created local monopolies, raising prices, and leading CREG to deviate from its
market-based bidding approach and to impose price ceilings on such production. This has created doubts
regarding the stability of regulatory rules and has led some agents to seek redress in Court.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Despite an overall satisfactory operation of the wholesale market, the ultimate objective of a power system
operated by private investors has proved elusive, and the privatization momentum has been lost in the last
years. As of mid-2002, the main remaining Government interests in the sector include: ISA and its affiliate
Transelca, ISAGEN, the former generation division of ISA, and fourteen distribution companies where the
Government owns a controlling share. The privatization of these companies, including ISA, has not taken
place. ISAGEN's sale, although it had been prepared for 1998/99, did not take place due to a number of
-6-



legal issues concerning water rights, as well as a general slackening of interest on the part of investors due
to Colombia's recession. The privatization of the distribution companies was postponed partly for the
latter reason, as well as lack of political will on the Government's part; it was revived in March of 2002; it
is an urgent measure given the need for investment in the companies, as well as the need for avoiding
jeopardizing the wholesale market in the long term due to non-payment of supplies. As for ISA's
privatization, rather than selling the company, the Government adopted a strategy of attracting local private
investors; the "Acciones para Todos" (Shares for All) program designed by the Government and ISA
management consists of the issuance of shares placed in the domestic capital market; this took place in two
rounds which were both oversubscribed. Currently, 24% of the company is in the hands of local investors.
Finally, the Government is responsible for overseeing sector performance through the Superintendence of
Public Services, which has not performed adequately. Summarizing, although the specific project-related
elements were adequately supported by Government, a broader point of view shows that
Government-related actions during the last four years have slackened regarding the overall reform
objectives.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
ISA diligently put in place the project's physical components, together with the hardware and software
required for dispatch and account settlement. ISA, as manager of the wholesale market, was also active in
ensuring its financial viability iby promoting measures (codified by CREG) to assure that market-related
debts are under control. This has been largely successful.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total project costs amounted to US$427.8 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$410 million.
The Bank financed US$249.3 million through its loan, which was fully disbursed; the Bank's financing
amounted to 58% of project costs, including interest during construction of US$36.8 million. The balance
was financed by ISA through its own resources. Cost increases with respect to appraisal estimates for the
transmission components originated in design changes to take into account new regulatory criteria with
respect to reliability, security and availability of the transmission network (which accounted for an increase
of around US$50 million), as well as an increase of around US$30 million in transformation and
compensation equipment in substations. The Bank's financing was reprogrammed by channeling US$26.5
million from the Energy Control Center and Technical Assistance components to the Transmission
Expansion and Pylon Recovery components.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationaleforsustainability rating:
The changes that have taken place in the energy sector, as indicated in the background section,
revolutionized the trading mechanisms of electricity. In its current form, it would be practically impossible
to conceive of retaining these trading mechanisms without those components (MEM, CND) supported by
the Project. The interests involved include those of private power producers, suppliers and unregulated
consumers. Disbanding these institutions would only be likely if the market itself were to disappear, an
improbable event linked to radical political and constitutional changes which would reverse current
economic thinking in order to revert to a "command and control" economy. Sustainability of the project's
physical components is to be expected given ISA's permanence in the power subsector, its 30-year
experience in operating transmission networks, and its guaranteed regulated resources. Significant
destruction of project assets due to terrorism is also unlikely, although limited damage is expected to
continue to occur until a ceasefire has been agreed. This is not expected to happen within the next four
years.
Assessment. The project's achievements have consolidated during thefirstyears of implementation.
-7-



Barring highly unlikely extreme political shifts, the institutions associated with the wholesale market are
highly likely to continue to operate. This supports a Highly Likely ratingfor project sustainability.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The project's components have become operational upon commissioning and transition arrangements have
not been necessary.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank responded expeditiously to sector reform requirements which it had been supporting since 1988,
(a) through an incisive Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review of Bank lending and sector
performance which set the stage for the reforms; (b) through ESMAP support to prepare the ground for
reforms and draft legislation; (c) through the Public Sector Reform loan which supported the preparation of
final drafts of enabling legislation through 1994; and (d) through the Energy Sector Technical Assistance
Loan. As noted in the quality at entry section, the project concept was appropriate, it responded to the
1993 CAS, and it took advantage of experience gained in the initial years of the reform process. Project
preparation took place through eight missions between 1992 and 1994 which focused on identifying
alternatives for encouraging private sector participation; this extended preparation period allowed the Bank
to identify the project fully and carefully, which contributed to its success. Accordingly, lending
performance of the Bank can be rated as Highly Satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
The project responded to well-defined needs for achieving the development of a competitive power market.
The Bank contributed to implementation through staff advice, and helped ISA in adapting its procurement
procedures to Bank requirements. There was continuity of the Bank's team during lending as well as
supervision, which helped to maintain a fluid and constructive dialog with the borrower. The overall
satisfactory progress of the Project did not place an unusual burden on supervision, which benefited from
ISA's expertise; the Bank responded to the sector's requirements by financing pylon repair as an additional
component of the project. An official Mid-Term Review (MTR) was not recorded in the files; however, the
MTR was scheduled for July, 1998, and an in-depth supervision mission was conducted in May, 1998
which effectively served as such. All supervision missions rated the project as either Highly Satisfactory
(development objectives, counterpart funds, procurement) or Satisfactory (implementation progress, project
management). Based on these considerations, supervision can be rated as Satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's role in strengthening the energy sector through reforms, private sector participation and the
introduction of competition in an erstwhile totally command-controlled e.evironment can be considered as
an unqualified success. Problems with regulation and the wholesale market remain; this is to be expected,
particularly under the very trying circumstances of Colombia's current social unrest which has severely
tested the new institutions put in place since the early and mid-90s. The project was instrumental in
achieving the sector-level goals and the Bank's performance during both preparation and implementation
provided the required backing, as well as the necessary feedback during the early years of the project, to
ensure an economic use of its resources. Based on the project's success, overall Bank performance is
rated as Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation was actively supported by ISA by carefully defining the project and its components,
-8-



and by assisting in preparing the required groundwork (demand forecasts, sector financial forecasts), and
specifying the project which obtained clearance from CONPES (National Economic and Social Policy
Council). The Borrower's ratingfor preparation is Highly Satisfactory based on its demonstrated
ownership of the project and its foresight in setting up its management.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Responsibility for implementation was vested primarily in ISA, the Borrower and Implementing Agency.
The Govermment supported the project through its commitment to overall sector reform, which included
support for CREG and financial support for the wholesale market by backing and guaranteeing the debt of
a number of Government-owned distribution companies. Based on the Government's active supportfor the
project, Government implementation performance is rated as Satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
ISA put in place all required components on time and has been operating them to satisfaction. Within the
limits imposed by sabotage to the network, ISA has been able to honor its commitments regarding
supplying the different subsystems connected to the main grid. Overall, ISA established an excellent record
of compliance with the target performance indicators. ISA has also confirmed an outstanding track record
regarding environmental affairs, both by taking the lead in developing environmental standards and by
complying with best practice in project implementation. On the other hand, with regard to the use of
project funds, ISA abstained from making use of Bank financing for the Control Center and Transactions
Settlement Center (Component A) and for the Technical Assistance component (Component C). This was
due partly to the difficulty of complying with Bank procurement procedures in the case of the high-tech
equipment associated with Component A. As for the Technical Assistance component, although the studies
and training were executed, Bank funds were not used (despite Bank urging through its supervision
missions); one reason was that Bank funds were limited to financing foreign consulting, whereas ISA's
Technical Assistance needs were supplied mainly through local, low cost courses and consultancies. Based
on its accomplishment ofproject objectives, implementing agency performance has been rated as
Satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Government and ISA cooperated to implement the project according to plan. Project operational
performance has been satisfactory insofar as the wholesale market is concerned; regarding the transmission
component, within the constraints of sabotage actions, its operation has also been satisfactory. Overall
borrower performance has been rated Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Elements which contributed to the project's success include:
Consistency of objectives with development needs. Embedding the project within a sequence of
operations geared towards a common goal was a determining factor for project success. In this case, the
groundwork established by ESMAP and the Public Sector Reform Loan supported the Project's objective,
which was implemented largely in parallel with the Energy Sector TA loan.
Preparation. A relatively large number of missions may be justified for preparing a project of this
magnitude, in order to identify and target those elements of a reform process which require greatest
support, and whose outcome can be expected to have the most impact in furthering the overall objectives of
the process.
-9-



Ownership. ISA's needs regarding its responsibilities in managing the wholesale market, together with its
Third Transmission Plan had been carefully prepared beforehand and they were an integral component of
the company's development The Bank's loan assisted ISA in executing the plan, but the primary initiative
throughout implementation remained with the borrower/implementation agency.
Flexibility. The project's broad objective of supporting the wholesale market allowed the inclusion of
transmission pylon rehabilitation as a new project component. This flexibility provided needed support to
ISA at a difficult moment when the rehabilitation of assets damaged by terrorist action was at a critical
point.
In regard to the project's shortcomings the lessons include:
Risks. Although attacks to the transmission infrastructure did not acquire a high profile until around
1998-99, they had been going on sporadically since the mid 80s. This threat was not identified duning
project preparation, and it has had a major disruptive effect on the transmission system. Recognizing the
possibility of politically-induced terrorism on the infrastructure of projects to be financed by the Bank
should be introduced into the appraisal process.
Use of funds. Bank funds were not used at all for two of the project's three components. They accounted
for less than 10% of the total initial budget. Components with highly specialized characteristics may not
adapt easily to the Bank's procurement procedures and this should be recognized early on in the negotiation
process to avoid budgeting items which will be financed through other sources. The use of funds for minor
items such as technical assistance, which constitutes an important feature of Bank lending should be
insisted upon.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
A cost benefit analysis was performed for the two main elements financed in the transmission-expansion
component of the project, the San Carlos-San Marcos 500kV transmission line, and the
Sochagota-Guatiguara 230kV transmission line, together with the substation investments associated with
them. The cost and benefit streams (in US$ million) associated with the projects are:

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's Contribution
Executive Summary
Objectives and achievement. The overall objective consisted of supporting sector reforms by facilitating
the operation of a competitive market for electricity. Regarding specific components:
(a)    The energy control center was developed in two phases; the first one expanded the
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and System Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) functions, which were put into service in 1998; the second phase included the
Energy Management System (EMS), the backup control center and the simulation trainer.
Both phases of the project were financed through ISA's resources. The control center's
functions have been executed to the satisfaction of all market participants. Additionally,
ISA put in place the account settlement organization which have also operated to
satisfaction.
(b)    As of 30 June 2000 ISA had concluded all transmission works contemplated in the project
(except for cancelled components).
(c)    ISA executed a training program to support its transmission network operation,
dispatching, and settlement fimctions; these activities were coordinated with the Bank
through an annual plan. They were financed through ISA's own resources.
Implementation highlights
The Energy Control Center was procured using a two-step procedure: as a result of a first bid, two firms
were selected and were invited to install and demonstrate their equipment for a two month period. After
this period, the firms presented a new bid which incorporated comments from the trial period, and a final
selection was made under improved technical and economic conditions. The Bank's financing was not used
due to the perception that the procurement procedure could not have been accommodated by the Bank's
rules.
In the implementation of the transmission component there were cost increases (with respect to the SAR)
due to design modifications to take into account CREG regulations and to minimize adverse environmental
impacts, and to price increases of transformation and compensation equipment.
In the implementation of ISA's training plan, Bank resources were not used because they were limited to
courses paid in foreign currency, outside the country and endorsed by the Bank; and to Bank-approved
international consultants; furthermore, Bank resources could not be used to finance postgraduate studies
outside the country. As ISA's training program has been mainly oriented towards low cost, local currency,
short duration courses contracted locally, together with a perception that Bank procedures were not
responsive to ISA's needs, ISA abstained from financing its training program with loan proceeds.
Otherwise, ISA's training program covered the following areas: power systems, telecommunications,
management, finance, human resource development, information technology, and social and environmental
management.
SustainabDlity
The project is highly likely to be sustainable. Some of the reasons for this assessment include:
*      The dynamics of the wholesale market whose registered agents have grown from 50 in 1995, when
it started to operate, to 160 in 2001, 90 of which were active; additionally, unregulated users whose
demand now accounts for over 25% of the total market have increased from less than 200 in 1995 to over
-20-



3,000 in 2001;
*      The satisfactory operation of the Maneuvers and Supervision Center, as evidenced by its
compliance with operational indicators agreed with the Bank as well as those mandated by CREG;
*      ISA's solid financial situation, as evidenced by its financial indicators and its success in entering
the international market by building interconnection lines with Ecuador and winning two transmission
contracts in Peru.
The Bank's performance
During project implementation a number of difficulties came to light which merit mentioning:
*      The Bank's terms and formats required for international competitive bidding were found to be
excessively rigid and somewhat confusing; however, once this was overcome, an efficient and fluid dialog
and relationship was established with the Bank;
*      Some of the Bank's requirements were considered impractical, such as (a) requiring that the
environmental license be obtained prior to concluding the construction contract for the transmission lines,
and (b) requiring that rights of way be completely negotiated prior to initiating civil works.
The Bank provided effective guidance and assistance as to the best way of requesting resources. Obtaining
funds promptly was of great importance to ISA; on average, Bank staff took 8-10 days to clear ISA's
requests, which provided a satisfactory turnaround, thereby allowing ISA to make efficient and effective
use of the loan.
ISA's performance
ISA has managed to show acceptable performance indicators and to provide continuous service under
particularly harsh circumstances due to permanent terrorist attacks on the transmission infrastructure. It
should be noted that the performance indicators were measured using the "Comisi6n de Integraci6n
Electrica Regional" (CIER) methodology, which excludesforce majeure events from statistics related to
service quality measurements.
In relation with the project, all of its components were commissioned on time (although there were some
variations in the initial and final programmed dates); in relation with its transmission system, ISA had to
face a very substantial increase in sabotaged pylons starting in 1999. During 1995-98 it faced around 20
attacks per year; during 1999-2001 there was a tenfold increase, to 245 per year. Despite the sabotage,
service continuity indicators have shown satisfactory values.
ISA's corporate changes should also be underlined: in 1998 it acquired 65% of the share of TRANSELCA,
the transmission company which operates on the Atlantic Coast region. During the same year, ISA entered
the telecommunications business by installing optic fiber using its transmission lines and operating the
largest private telecom network in the country through carrier and value added services; in January 2000 it
created lNTERNEXA which is dedicated to transmitting very large amounts of information (e.g. long
distance operators, Internet access operators) and is now its bulk telecommunications business subsidiary.
In April 2000 ISA became a major shareholder (53.5% participation) in Firstmark Communication
Colombia, to develop telecommunications ventures and value added services using its Local Multipoint
Distribution System (LMDS) license. In 2000 it was awarded a bid for a concession in Peru to build and
operate a transmission network which is now known as Interconexi6n Electrica ISA Peru S.A. In 2001
ISA entered into an agreement with Transelectric, an Ecuadorian state company, to build and operate the
Colombia-Ecuador interconnection.
In addition to the above, ISA successfully placed 235 million shares thereby acquiring around over 100,000
small shareholders which now own 24% of the company, in a pioneering effort for a Government-owned
utility in Colombia.

Finally, ISA has maintained a leading position regarding environmental matters. In relation with the
project itself, all environmental and social indicators and objectives were complied with. The company has
developed over the years a high degree of environmental and social awareness and has implemented
procedures such as archaeological preservation and electrification of villages and households in the
proximity of its transmission projects.
