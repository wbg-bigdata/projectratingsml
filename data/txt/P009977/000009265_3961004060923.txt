MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
SECOND INTEGRATED CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit
to India is submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 141.6 million
(US$194.0 million equivalent) would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity. The credit would help finance a Second Integrated Child Development
Services Project. The proceeds of the credit would be passed by the
Government of India (GOI) to Madhya Pradesh and Bihar in accordance with
standard arrangements for development assistance to States and Union
Territories.
2.          Country/Sector Background.  Despite improvements in the rates of
child survival, an estimated one-third of India's pre-school children have
some form of serious growth deficiency from malnutrition. Children under 3
years are the most vulnerable. The consequences of malnutrition are lowered
potential for physical and mental capacity and greater susceptibility to
disease. The proposed project would be carried out in the states of Madhya
Pradesh and Bihar. Those states have among the lowest per capita incomes in
India and among the largest populations of scheduled tribes. The Infant
Mortality Rate in Madhya Pradesh and rural Bihar is 111 and 100 per thousand
live births, respectively, compared to 31 per thousand in Kerala. The
nutritional levels of children under 6 in both states are poor; fewer than
one-third of the children have normal nutrition status. About 10? of the
children under 6 are severely malnourished.
3.          The Government of India (GOI) has sought to address nutrition
issues in a variety of ways. The most important national child nutrition
intervent'on is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme. ICDS
delivers a package of services comprising supplementary nutrition,
immunization, health checkups, referral services, and health and nutrition
education to children under 6 years of age, and pregnant and nursing women.
It also provides pre-school education to children between 3 and 6 years of
age. ICDS is centrally sponsored but is implemented by the state governments.
The Anganvadi center (AW) is the focal point for delivering ICDS services at
the village level.
4.          Although ICDS is one of the largest and most innovative programs
of its kind in the world, its record of implementation and impact on health
and nutrition has been mixed. Problems have been encountered in terms of the
quality of training and supervision of field staff, a lack of clarity in the
work routines for field staff, the absence of a comprehensive communications
strategy, and weak linkages with the health system and communities,
particularly women's groups. Although the quality of ICDS service delivery in
Madhya Pradesh is about average for the country, it is much below the national
standard in Bihar.
5.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's country assistance strategy
involves accelerating the pace of India's human resource development and the
strengthening of anti-poverty programs, particularly those which comprise a



- 2 -
safety net for the poor during adjustment. An important aspect of IDA's human
resource strategy is to help reduce excess fertility, mortality and .orbidity,
increase school enrollment levels and the quality of educational ou.put, and
improve nutritional status. IDA's main nutrition objective is to assist the
Central and state governments in adopting policies, strategies and cost-
effective programs to deal with the nutrition problems of pre-school children
and pregnant and nursing women. The proposed project would provide targeted
assistance to poor women and children, many of whom are tribal. These are the
groups most at risk of falling through the social safety net during the
present period of economic adjustment and severe budgetary constraints. As
the principal nutrition donor in India today, as well as a financier of
structural adjustment, IDA has a comparative advantage in promoting improved
effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of Indian r4trition programs. Without
the project, the pace of expanding ICDS to beneficiaries would be slower, many
of those needing ICDS services would not have access to them, and the
program's nutritional impact would be less in both existing and new ICDS areas
covered by the project.
6.          Proiect ObJectives.  The project seeks to accelerate the pace of
improvement in the nutrition and health status of pre-school children,
particularly children under 3 years of age, and pregnant and nursing women.
The project has as specific impact objectives: (a) to reduce severe
malnutrition among children 6-36 months by 40-50Z; (b) to reduce moderate
malnutrition in the same age group by 20-252; and (c) to reduce the incidence
of low birth weight by 30Z.
7.          Proiect Stratey.  The proposed project would strengthen the
present ICDS model in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh by improving service delivery,
communications, worker and supervisor training, and monitoring and evaluation.
Numerous studies of ICDS and considerable background work done during
preparation of the proposed project suggest that these elements are key to
enhancing program impact. The project would expand ICDS, with its improved
program, in a number of geographic areas in which 'CDS is already active. It
would also expand an improved ICDS in the two states to some geographic areas
not now served. The project would also support the development of enhanced
approaches to several critical ICDS activities through studies, operations
research, and careful monitoring and evaluation. ICDS has shown it can have a
positive impact, even in tribal areas. The enhancements of the program and
the measures being taken to make the program more sensitive to tribal issues
should further enhance both the overall effectiveness of ICDS and its work in
tribal areas.
8.          Proiect Description.  The project would be implemented over 7
years and would cover 229 blocks in Madhya Pradesh, of which 98 are existing
and 131 are new blocks, and 207 blocks in Bihar, of which 72 are existing and
135 are new blocks.  The blocks were selected on the basis of the percentage
of population which was either tribal or scheduled caste. In a few cases,
blocks have been included which are in drought-prone areas.
9.          The project would strengthen growth monitoring, case management,
food supplementation, pre-school education, health and nutrition education,
immunization and health check-ups and referrals. It would also enhance the



3 -
capacity of ICDS in Bihar and Hadhya Pradesh to provide more effective and
efficient services in the future. The project would have four components:
service delivery, to strengthen training, work organization, supervision, and
the supply of materials and equipment; communications, through innovative
approaches and new messages to increase demand for project services and
provide health and nutrition education; community mobilization, to promote
greater community uownership" of ICDS services, involvement in meeting the
program objectives of better health and nutrition, and development of pilot
schemes for women's and adolescent girls' development activities; and project
management, monitoring and evaluation, to manage, monitor and evaluate the
project and conduct operations research to test innovative activities and
improve key aspects of project design. This project does not include an
indigenous people's development plan.  However, measures, including actions
set out in "Strategies For Strengthening ICDS Among Tribal Populations" (Annex
17 of the Staff Appraisal Report), were agreed on to ensure that the project
is implemented in a manner which is compatible with the social and cultural
values of tribal communities, and includes the informed participation of
tribal beneficiaries. These would include, among other things: a series of
measures at central, state and local levels to strengthen management and
evaluation of ICDS in tribal areas; the development and implementation of
strategies for community participation in remote tribal populations; tribal
representation on ICDS coordination committees; use of NGOs to enhance
training curriculum and methodology; and a special focus on tribal populations
as part of the annual and mid-term reviews.
10.         Project Cost. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$248.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$21.8 million (8.8?) and taxes estimated at about US$4.7 million equivalent.
IDA would finance US$194.0 million equivalent, or about 84? of the net of tax
cost of the project. GOI would finance the remaining US$50.1 million
equivalent and all taxes. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million would
be provided for eligible expenditures made after November 30, 1991. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 10572-IN, dated January 22, 1993, is being distributed separately.
11.         Project Sustainabilit .  The GOI presently allocates about 0.82 of
GDP to the social sectors. GOI spending on ICDS is about 7? of total 001
social sector spending. By 1997, the GOI would have to increase its budget on
ICDS by 92 over present levels to sustain its part of the proposed project.
Bihar and Madhya Pradesh now spend about 20 billion rupees per year each on
the social sectors, of which less than 1? goes for ICDS. Bihar would have to
triple its funding of ICDS to sustain its part of the proposed project.
Madhya Pradesh would have to increase by 502 its funding of ICDS to do the
same. On the face of it, the project would require quite significant
increases in the absolute amount of funding for ICDS which GOI and the states
are providing. Nonetheless, the proposed project should be sustainable for
several reasons. First, the proposed increases in funding of ICDS would still
be an extraordinarily small share of the total GOI and state budgets. Second,
the GOI is in the process of carrying out an adjustment process as a part of



- 4 -
which it plans to enhance the access to and the effectiveness and efficiency
of basic social services. Thus, between now and the full operation of the
project, it is anticipated that GOI and the states would have an opportunity
to shift resources from areas in which the government's role is declining
toward programs like ICDS. The GOI FY92193 budget, for example, includes an
increase in funding for ICDS. Third, related to the adjustment process, GOI
has developed a social safety net program which includes additional efforts to
enhance ICDS funding. Finally, IDA and GOI are now collaborating on a review
of he&lth financing and a review of nutrition financing is just getting
started. The outcomes of these reviews should point to additional measures
that can be taken to strengthen the funding of ICDS.
12.         Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, the state governments provided
assurances that they woulds (a) prepare and oromptly implement Plans for the
Introduction of Services (PIS) for each new block covered under the project;
(b) take necessary steps to make available adequate quantities of supplemental
food to the Anganwadi centers required to carry out the project; (c) fill all
vacancies under ICDS and health programs in accordance with a staffing plan,
including a time schedule, satisfactory to IDA; (d) by October 1, 1993,
prepare and furnish to IDA a report on a communications strategy which would
subsequently be agreed and implemented; (e) carry out annual and mid-term
reviews and a final evaluation and provide the final reports to IDA for
review; (f) implement the project in tribal areas in accordance with
Strategies For Strengthening ICDS Among Tribal Populations; establish or
reconstitute district and block level ICDS coordination committees so as to
provide adequate tribal representation and to provide for these committees to
advise on and monitor the implementation of ICDS; and (g) review with IDA
annually by December 31 each year the progress of project implementation over
the preceding twelve months and an annual work plan for the following twelve
months. The Government of India provided assurances that it would establish
by December 31, 1993 a panel of advisors of national repute in nutrition,
maternal and child health, and the social sciences related to tribal affairs
to annually review project implementation in tribal areas. There would be two
conditions of credit effectiveness: (i) the appointment of agencies in Madhya
Pradesh and Bihar to carry out the communications component and (ii) the
establishment, with adequate staff, of a Project Management Cell in each
state.
13.         Lessons of Experience.  The Bank Group has financed eight
population projects, one Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Project and two
nutrition projects in India. The Second Calcutta Urban Development Project
also had a major health component. Two of the population projects and the
Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project have been evaluated (PPAR No. 3748 and
PPAR No. 8896 for the First and Second Population Projects, respectively, and
PCR, November 26, 1989 for the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project). The
First and Second Population Project met most of their objectives, but did not
show sign.ficant improvement compared to non-project areas financed by the
regular government program. However, the Third Population Project showed very
good results in Kerala. The Fourth Population Project in West Bengal and the
Health component of the Third Calcutta Urban Development Project have led to
significant positive results on infant mortality and contraceptive prevalence.
Moreover, the Tamil Nadu Nutrition Project had a major impact on nutritional



- 5 -
status of its target group. The first ICDS project began in 1991; initial
implementation has been mixed. The Government has been eager to expand the
program as rapidly as possible to new AWe, and during the rapid expansion,
insufficient attention was paid to the activities necessary to ensure that the
project would meet its major objective of reducing malnutritlon in small
children. In particular, there have been problems with inadequate staffing,
staff training, supervision, and communications, and delays in carrying out
studies of work routines. The Government is now aware that expansion without
sufficient attention to these activities does not produce the desired results
and has therefore begun to focus on them.
14.         The design of the proposed project takes account of both the
technical and project implementation lessons learned from the implementation
of the first ICDS project and the other projects mentioned above. As noted
above, it also takes account of the numerous evaluations of ICDS and of
v        several background studies in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh that relate to the aims
of the proposed project. On the technical side, therefore, the project pays
particular attention tos developing a strong communications component to
promote health and nutrition education and greater community involvement;
enhanced training and supervision of workers; refining job descriptions so
that they focus on a select number of well focused tasks that the workers can
effectively carry out; and sharpening the targeting of food supplementation.
In terms of project implementation, the project would: support the creation of
empowered committees to speed implementation; make use of standard bidding
documents; use annual reviews to assess implementation progress; and build
upon an existing program with advanced preparation of many software
activities.
15.         Project Benefits.  The main benefit of the project would be to
speed up the currently very gradual pace of improvement in pre-school
nutrition status in project areas. The project also would contribute to a
faster reduction in infant and child mortality. In the last year of the
project, around 4.0 million pregnant and nursing women and about 12.0 million
children under 6 years of age would benefit directly from the project.
Technologies to counter low birth weight, acute respiratory infections and
micronutrient deficiencies, to manage diarrhea and for deworming would be made
widely available through the project. By increasing family competence to
avert and treat malnutrition, the project would contribute over the medium
term to a reduced need for ICDS food supplementation.
16.         Program Objective Categories.  Poverty Aspects.  The project would
target severely malnourished children and pregnant and nursing women,
particularly among tribal populations, to improve their health and nutrition
status. The majority of these women and children would be from the poorest
segments of the rural population. About 502 of the beneficiaries would be
tribal. WID Aspects. The project would contribute toward improving the
health and nutrition of pregnant and nursing women, would strengthen community
involvement through the formation of women's groups and would undertake pilot
schemes to promote women's income generating activities and adolescent girls'
schemes. Private Sector Aspects. The project would include the involvement of
NGOs in the training of AWs and in the development of pilot schemes for
women's activities and the formation of women's groups.



- 6 -
17.         Risks.  The project would be carried out in two of India's poorest
states and among some of its poorest people. Thus, it will not be easy to
implement. In addition, three particular risks face the project. The first
risk is that implementation would be delayed by training and institutional
shortfa.ls, especially in Bihar. The second risk is that additional
responsibilities would be imposed on A.Ws without regard to existing workloads
and would undermine efforts to focus workers more on case management of
malnourished children and improved household food behavior. The third risk is
that nutrition-health coordination arrangements would fail to take adequate
hold. To reduce these risks: (a) project management staff would be appointed
as a condition of effectiveness and empowered committees have been set up in
both states; (b) the findings of the mid-term review of the first ICDS project
to be carried out in 1993 regarding work routines would be incorporated into
the implementation of the proposed project; (c) improved health-nutrition
coordination would be facilitated; and (d) the project would be subject to
very careful and regular monitoring and evaluation, including special
monitoring of the impact of the project on tribal people.
18.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
