I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Alignment with Country Development Objectives
1.      Rwanda is a small, landlocked country in central Africa. With per capita GDP of
$287 in 2005 1, Rwanda was one of the poorest countries in the world where
approximately 60 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. In 2005, there
were about 9 million people living in 24,670 square kilometers (sq km) of land area. The
country’s population density of 340 inhabitants per sq km was high, and 83 percent of the
population lived in rural areas 2. It was difficult for Rwandans to access basic
infrastructure (e.g., electricity, water) and social services (e.g., primary health care,
education). Only 0.3 percent of the population has access to the phones.

2.      In 2000, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) issued its long-term development
strategy, called Vision 2020. Vision 2020 envisioned Rwanda transforming from a
largely agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, in an effort to
become a middle income country by 2020. The GoR believed that investment in ICT
would be a key driver for this transformation and a vehicle for improved public and
private service delivery, especially for rural areas.

3.      Aligned with Vision 2020, a 5-year implementation plan called National
Information and Communication Infrastructure (NICI) plans was established for ICT
development in Rwanda. NICI I, budgeted for $500 million, was implemented and
executed between 2000 and 2005. At the end of the NICI I, the GoR noted several
shortcomings, including a lack of infrastructure to support the envisioned activities, a
lack of human resources to lead and implement the activities, and a general lack of ICT
awareness and understanding.

4.      In June 2005, the World Bank received a request from the GoR to fund what
became known as the eRwanda project, a subset of the NICI II Plan. The eRwanda
project focused on the core activities in the NICI II Plan, which included developing
government networks, eGovernment platform and eGovernment applications,
strengthening public service delivery to the citizens, and increasing ICT skills and
awareness. At the time of the project appraisal, all ministries in Kigali (the nation’s
capital) had installed some degree of office automation, but there was no shared email
service or government centralized databases. A few ministries had Local Area Networks
(LANs). However, most personal computers (PCs) and related equipment were donated.
Maintenance and support of the equipment was difficult because many different
operating system models existed in the same workspace. Also, there were no standards
for system interoperability or application development.

5.        In alignment with Vision 2020 and NICI II, the eRwanda project supported the
World Bank’s Rwanda Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) themes. When the 2002 CAS 3
was prepared, the country was still in the transition from conflict and development. In
order to lay the foundations for growth and sustainable human development 4, the 2002
CAS set four themes for Bank support : (i) revitalization of the rural economy; (ii) private
sector development and employment creation; (iii) human and social development; and
(iv) improvement in governance and effectiveness of the public sector actions 5. The
eRwanda project supported broadly for the CAS four themes by (a) developing
eGovernment applications and connecting government institutions to one another
through a government wide network (theme iv), (b) providing ICT training for
government officials and citizens so that they could use the benefits from (a) (theme i, ii,
iii), (c) rolling out telecenters and ICT buses to strengthen public information service
delivery to rural people and raise awareness on the new ICT services made available in
(a) (theme i).

Sector background
6.      In 2001 and 2004, the GoR established two new government agencies responsible
for the ICT sector: in 2001, the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA), a multi-
sector regulator, was established to regulate the country’s electricity, gas, transport, water,
and telecommunication markets; and in 2004, the Rwanda Information Technology
Authority (RITA), which operated under the Ministry of Infrastructure (MINIFRA), was
established to coordinate ICT related investments and national ICT projects in Rwanda.

7.      At the time of the appraisal, the first phase of NICI plan (NICI I) was just
completed. During the NICI I period, access to ICT services did not progress as
expected 6. In 2005, only 0.3 % of the population had fixed telephone subscriptions, 2.5 %
of the population had mobile phone subscriptions, and 0.6 % of the population used the
Internet. The indicators demonstrated that Rwanda had very low ICT penetration rates
compared to Sub-Saharan African countries average and World average (Figure 1).

    The 2002 CAS covered the period 2002-2006.

  According to the 2002 CAS, GoR launched National Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2002, and identified six priority
areas: (i) rural development and agricultural transformation; (ii) human development; (iii)economic infrastructure; (iv)
good governance; (v) private sector development; and (vi) institutional capacity building.

  Rwanda had made progress in regulatory framework and environment during NICI I, such as establishment of RURA
and RITA, but UNCEA commented that further steps needed to strengthen ICT sector and industry development.

Rationale for the Bank involvement
8.      The eRwanda project was the first eGovernment project supported by the World
Bank in East African countries. The GoR recognized the World Bank as the top donor in
the area of eGovernment. At the time of the appraisal, demand for similar eGovernment
projects arose in other countries (Sri Lanka, Ghana, Vietnam, Armenia, etc.), and the
World Bank’s comparative advantage in implementing eGovernment projects to improve
public sector reforms and service delivery had already been demonstrated. Furthermore,
the Bank had recognized the use of ICT in public sector as a means to improve
government transparency, efficiency, operations effectiveness, and public service
delivery to citizens.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The key objective of the eRwanda project was to improve (1) the efficiency and
effectiveness of some internal process of the Government of Rwanda and (2) the delivery
of services in selected key sectors including better access to information through the use
of technology. In terms of the original PDO indicator, there was only one PDO indicator
mentioned in the PAD: Number of targeted government institutions which demonstrate
improved internal efficiency in the delivery of services and information to citizens.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.    There is no change in PDO through the project implementation. At the Mid-Term
Review, two new PDO indicators were added in addition to the original PDO indicator to
measure the progress more precisely, although the formal revision was not taken.
Following three PDO indicators were tracked after MTR.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     Consistent with the GoR’s NICI plan, the project appraisal document (PAD)
emphasized that the project should provide broad support to increase efficiency of
government services to all Rwandans, especially to those living in rural areas. Also, the
project aimed to ensure transparency and fair allocation of the project’s benefits to all
government agencies, and social groups, based on their needs.
    • Rural Population: At appraisal, over 80 percent of the population lived in rural
        areas where access to infrastructure and social services was limited. Thus the
        project aimed to leverage access to ICT so that rural citizens could obtain useful
        information to enhance their standards of living.
    • Gender: Following the GoR’s target to increase female representation in
        decision-making, and to foster gender equity in public service delivery as well as
        to actively include female in the new ICT culture, the project set specific targets
        for female participation in project activities. For instance, IT training in ICT buses
        (movable telecenters) mandated at least a 30% 7 female participation in every
        session.

1.5 Original Components
12.     Component 1: Strengthening government effectiveness and efficiency
(US$ 3.80 million) aimed to improve key internal government systems which are critical
for the overall implementation of the NICI. This component supported (1) the
harmonization of the basic technology for the Ministries, Departments, and Agencies
(MDAs) and District Offices; (2) the implementation of an Intranet which links central
ministries and local governments in district offices; and (3) a government portal that


7
  This 30 % female participation target is aligned with GOR’s policy that at least 30% women should participate in
each and every development initiative.




                                                          4
provides easy access to a variety of applications and information services. Specifically,
the project supported: (a) the development of standards for the deployment of the new
system, (b) purchase of all IT equipments, (c) technical specification of Wide Area
Networks (WANs) linking all national and sub-national relevant institutions, (d)
establishment of cyber-security system that ensures data accuracy, integrity, and
interoperability, (e) establishment of system maintenance and support framework for the
ICT applications, and (f) ICT training and capacity building.
13.     Component 2: Improving service delivery to citizens and the private sector
(US$ 3.51 million) assisted the Government in developing (1) service applications for
health, agriculture, environment and education; and (2) telecenters (public access points)
in urban and rural areas to expand public services, information delivery to vulnerable
groups (women, children, and farmers), and ICT training to all interested population.
14.     Component 3: Improving access to services through enhanced infrastructure
in energy and telecommunications (US$ 0.82 million) aimed to assist the GoR to
provide competitive and affordable telecommunications services in rural areas. The
activities included: (1) strengthening the operational efficiency of the regulatory agency
for the telecommunications sector (RURA), and (2) improving basic access to
infrastructure by financing connectivity to province and district offices, and linking
public access points in rural areas.

15.    Component 4: Project management (US$ 1.47 million) supported the GoR to
develop a project management system that monitors the implementation progress of
eGovernment reform and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data. The support initially
focused on the Ministry of Infrastructure, which was in charge of the eGovernment
reform, and its implementation agency (RITA). To strengthen the M&E capacity, a
course was designed and provided in the Kigali Institute for Science and Technology
(KIST).

1.6 Revised Components
After the Mid-Term Review (MTR) held in July 2009, the GoR requested to drop the
three remaining activities which had not yet been implemented (a market structure study,
a universal access study, and a spectrum allocation study) under component 3, and
replace it with (1) a Document Tracking and Workflow Management System (DTWMS),
and (2) additional Technical Assistance and consultancy activity for the government
(Table 1).
16.     This revision did not affect to achieve the PDOs. The dropped activities were
being funded and managed through another World Bank financed operation, “RCIP
Rwanda project? which was approved after the eRwanda project became effective. The
DTWMS activity was originally listed as a potential activity in eRwanda when the
project was prepared. This activity aims to digitalize the government filing system and
restructure the business workflow so that government officers could retrieve files and
emails through one stop portals. Expected outcomes include (a) improvement of
workflow and communication among government agencies, (b) increased accountability,



                                             5
and transparency of governance resulting from shared documents and disclosed
information as well as (c) a central location for file storage and archival for the public
sector.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.    Historical review of the project development. In 2001, Rwanda became a
founding member of the Development Gateway Foundation (DGF), nonprofit
organization with the mission to reduce poverty and enable change in developing nations
through information technology, and launched 3 ICT projects: an ICT training center, a
Geographic Information Systems center, and the Rwandan Development Gateway portal.
In 2002, after learning of the DGF projects and Rwanda’s strong commitment toward
ICT development through NICI I, the World Bank’s Management suggested that the
World Bank’s Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP), a separate and
independent project from the DGF project, include an ICT component (see detail in
paragraph 23). The experiences of ICT sub-component of PSCBP formed a rudimentary
eGovernment program which led to the development of the eRwanda project -- requested
by HE President Paul Kagame in 2005.

18.    Project preparation. The task team was formed upon the request from GoR.
According to Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) report, the team composition was well
balanced on ICT technical background, public administration knowledge, and country
experience. The project was prepared rapidly with 7 experts. It took 10 months from the
Concept Note Review to the Board.

19.     Project design. Given the complex cross-cutting nature of ICT, involving
physical infrastructure to software application development, it was challenging to define
the project’s components and activities in a country with limited local capacity. Thus the
PAD stated that the project should primarily focus on 1) basic eGovernment



                                               6
fundamentals and 2) overall government strategy. Ancillary activities were to be defined
based upon the implementation progress. This approach provided some flexibility for
continuous alignment with CAS and GoR’s priorities under NICI II (2006 – 2010).

Political commitment: The GoR’s commitment toward ICT development and
implementation of the NICI plan was strongly promoted by top leadership (HE President
Kagame). In addition, government officials were fully committed to the project. For
instance, GoR has a clear responsibility matrix for NICI II implementation. Each
Ministry assigned an ICT focal person (senior position) who was fully responsible for
NICI II implementation in her/his sector. The Ministry of ICT provided guidance for ICT
policy deployment into each activity. RITA (later RDB) provided technical expertise and
coordinated the implementation. This matrix was applied to the implementation of
eRwanda because it was a part of NICI II.

Stakeholder engagement and donor coordination: All activities that eRwanda supported
had been fully linked and integrated into larger government goals. During the project’s
preparation, the World Bank’s reviewed all NICI II activities with the stakeholders and
donors, and agreed upon the NICI II activities to be supported by the eRwanda project. A
clear agreement, among the donors and stakeholders regarding the World Bank’s role and
commitment to NICI II implementation through the eRwanda project was reflected
throughout the project appraisal.

Incorporated lessons learned from other eGovernment projects: The eRwanda project’s
design reflected lessons learned from the eGovernment projects in Sri Lanka and Ghana.
A key recommendation from the consultations was to develop a clear monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) mechanism to monitor implementation progress and the project results.

20.     Quality at entry assessment. A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) was
conducted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in March 2007. The QAG rated the
overall Quality at Entry of this project as Satisfactory. Most of the aspects including
World Bank’s inputs and processes were rated Satisfactory. The panel highlighted the
timely project preparation, alignment of the national ICT strategy, and unique Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E) arrangement and training program with a local university (KIST).
The only two areas rated as Marginally Satisfactory were Fiduciary Aspects and
Implementation Arrangements. The panel expressed concern for the ambitious goals of
the eRwanda project given the socioeconomic conditions of the country and Rwanda’s
implementation capacity (especially the procurement arrangements). The panel pointed
out that the technical and operational skill for ICT procurement should be strengthened
intensively during the first year of implementation as procurement of ICT is a well
documented complex area with high rate of failure in the World Bank projects 8

2.2 Implementation
21.      Disbursement overview. The grant (H2530-RW) was approved by the Board on
August 3, 2006 for the amount of SDR 6.9 million (US$10 million equivalent) and
became effective on June 19, 2007. During the first 2 years of implementation there were
disbursement delays, which were caused both by a delay in declaring the project effective
and slow procurement process in the beginning of the implementation. The slow
procurement process caused disbursement to remain low throughout the Mid-Term
Review (MTR). The introduction of a new World Bank procurement management system
(PROCSYS, see detail in paragraph 68) and continuous training for procurement
specialist improved the efficiency and productivity of the procurement process. As a
result, disbursement increased rapidly in late 2009. The project grant was fully committed
within 3.5 years of the project’s implementation period (from June 19, 2007 to December
31, 2010) and fully disbursed by December 31, 2010. The disbursement profile is
presented in the Data Sheet.

22.      Implementation overview.
Delays to become effective: After the Board’s approval, the project took 10 months to
become effective. According to the PAD, attaining effectiveness required three
conditions: (1) preparation of a project operations manual (including financial procedures
manual, procurement procedures manual); (2) recruitment of key project members
(appointment of Project Manager, a financial management specialist, and a procurement
specialist); and (3) the readiness of a Financial Management System satisfactorily
installed and capable of producing Financial Monitoring Reports acceptable to the World
Bank. Meeting the three conditions for effectiveness was achieved within 6 months after
the Board’s approval, however, the delay in ratification of the project and finalizing the
legal opinions in Rwandan’s parliament added 4 more months to become effective.

Initial Delays after the declaration of project effectiveness: Given the limited knowledge
and capacity in the World Bank procurement process and IT procurement, the project
implementation was slow in the beginning. Specifically, several large ICT procurement
packages (e.g., LAN equipment for government offices), which accounted for 15 percent
of the total project amount ($10 million equivalent), were planned for the first year, but
the execution of the package took longer than expected because it took a longer time to
finalize technical specifications in multiple locations 9. When a new IDA funded ICT
project (Regional Communications and Infrastructure Program, Rwanda) was prepared in
2007-2008, the same PMU under RITA worked on the eRwanda project implementation
as well as on the RCIP Rwanda preparation. As a result, the implementation delays were
compounded until MTR.




9
 In total 24 government institutions were clients of the eRwanda project for setting up office IT equipments, LAN,
websites, online services and of specific applications.


                                                          8
Institutional change from RITA to RDB/IT: There was a significant institutional change
from RITA to RDB/IT. As detailed in the PAD, eRwanda’s PMU was initially set up in
the Rwanda Information Technology Authority (RITA), an autonomous institution in
charge of coordinating national ICT projects. This arrangement readily enabled day-to-
day coordination, communication, and networking with the RITA management team and
Ministries. In 2009, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB), an overhead government
institution that focuses on Rwanda’s economic development, was established. The
transition and restructuring of RDB was done several times over three years (2009-2011).
In 2010, RITA was fully merged into RDB, and became a part of RDB/IT (see Annex 2.3
RDB organizational chart). Along with RITA, PMU also moved under RDB/IT. Since
RDB has a large mandate to improve business environment in Rwanda and promote both
public and private investments for the economic growth, RDB/IT ‘s mandate covered
national ICT projects, and adapting and utilizing ICT for business registry and
investment promotion in Rwanda. In terms of business process, the complexity of
procurement was addressed when PMU was moved to RDB/IT. The clearance process
for small procurements were simplified, however, two clearance layers were added for
large tenders. In terms of human resources, the transition and restructuring of RDB had
created significant anxiety and uncertainty among RITA staff, although all PMU staff and
most of former RITA staff involved in the eRwanda project persisted in the same
responsibilities after the transition.

Relationship with other World Bank projects: Two World Bank projects (PSCBP and
RCIP Rwanda) were closely linked to the project development objectives (PDO) of the
eRwanda project and affected eRwanda’s implementation progress (Figure 2).

     •   Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP): Component 5 of the PSCBP
         primarily focused on ICT capacity building with the goals of (1) preparing ICT
         strategies for each of the sectoral ministries; (2) training all government civil
         servants toward obtaining International Computer Driving License (ICDL); and
         (3) providing an ICT Internship program. Through those activities, the GoR
         convinced the importance of achieving more efficient, effective, transparent, and
         accountable public sector performance by eGovernement, and it led to eRwanda
         project.
     •   RCIP Rwanda 10: eRwanda initially aimed to support the telecom policy,
         regulatory framework, and nationwide ICT connectivity under component 3. In
         the beginning of the project implementation, several new submarine cable
         projects launched to connect East Africa. Corresponding to the urgent evolving
         connectivity issue in the region, three studies about national backbone
         development and international connectivity were conducted as part of eRwanda’s
         component 3. Eventually, the GoR requested the World Bank for a new project
         which solely focused on telecom policy and national and regional ICT
         connectivity. It became RCIP Rwanda. Given that both projects were overseen by

   The Regional Communication Infrastructure Program (RCIP) Rwanda, is a part of a series of regional APL focusing
on East and Southern Africa regional ICT connectivity. The countries include Burundi, Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania,
Mozambique, and Malawi. The first phase of APL was approved in March 2007.

RITA, the eRwanda PMU team was asked to provide help on the preparation of
the RCIP Rwanda project while implementing the eRwanda project. During the
eRwanda MTR, the GoR, the eRwanda and the RCIP Rwanda team discussed
their projects’ duplicative telecommunication efforts. It was agreed that the
remaining activity under eRwanda’s component 3, which was originally designed
to support RURA, would be implemented as a part of RCIP Rwanda, which is
more comprehensive and relevant to the telecom connectivity issues.
Consequently, eRwanda team agreed to focus on holistic eGovernment activities.

23.     Mid-term review (MTR). The mid-term review was conducted in July, 2009.
The project had disbursed approximately 35% of the total project budget, although it still
lagged behind in terms of the initial disbursement schedule. The project had made major
progress in the activities under Component 1 and Component 2. Under Component 1,
LANs were procured and installed in 3 ministries (out of 9 ministries in total) to improve
government internal systems. Telemedicine equipment was installed in 2 hospitals (out of
3 hospitals in total) to facilitate knowledge sharing among hospitals and provide more
timely care to the patients. Approximately 25 ministerial and district level websites were
launched to provide easy access to various public information services. A cyber-security
strategy had been developed. Under Component 2, ICT equipment for 18 telecenters were
being procured to expand public service and information delivery to rural population.
Two ICT buses were being procured and ordered. eSoko mobile application development
was under development. Digitalization of Kinyarwanda materials was completed. Under
Component 3, three studies on connectivity were conducted, and because RCIP
Rwanda’s focus was ICT connectivity the remaining activities under component 3 were
shifted to RCIP Rwanda project. GoR committed to complete the project by the original
project closing date (December 31, 2010). As a result of the MTR, the project underwent
level 2 restructuring (see the details section 1.6).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
24.     M&E design and implementation was discussed during the project preparation
stage. RDB/IT (former RITA) and RURA were in charge of monitoring relevant
indicators on an annual basis. In order to build local M&E capacity for ICT projects, the
eRwanda project collaborated with the Kigali Institute for Science and Technology
(KIST) to create M&E course work (funded under component 4, Project Management).
The students who completed the M&E course work participated in large-scale user
surveys to measure the progress of the eRwanda project in 2008 (Mid-Term) and 2010
(End-Term). The students also supported the eRwanda project team by analyzing the
data with SPSS statistical software (approximately 2800 sample size in 2008 survey, and
3400 sample size in 2010 survey).

25.     The implementation completion report (ICR) team concurred that the Project
Development Objective (PDO) indicators in the PAD were relevant. However, there were
several original intermediate indicators which were perceived to lack precise and


                                           11
objective metrics, for example, the percent adherence to fiduciary requirements of the
World Bank (by RITA) with respect to project management, and the demonstrated ability
of RITA to use M&E information for better project management (see PAD Annex 3). At
the MTR, revision of the Results Framework and indicators was discussed. Although the
PDOs were kept the same, new output and outcome indicators (both PDO and
intermediate indicators) were added in order to capture the outputs and outcomes more
precisely adapting a Results Chain method 11. The target value of some indicators was
based upon the high expectations of Rwandan officials (e.g. 100% of user satisfaction),
and thus may have been too ambitious to achieve (see Annex 2.2).

26.      In addition to the annual M&E indicator tracking, the eRwanda team was one of
the first team to internalize a unique and ground-breaking M&E process in the project.
Large-scale field surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2010 that collected user perception
and user satisfaction indicators, such as user perception of the telecenters, e-services, etc.
In each survey, 20-40 KIST students, who successfully accomplished the M&E course
work funded by eRwanda project (component 4), participated in data collection and
analysis. This provided the students with first-hand experience in the collection of M&E
data, as well as for the eRwanda project to collect large-scale baseline and follow-up
survey data, with a limited budget (see the details in section 3.6 as well as Annex 5).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
27.     Procurement. At the beginning no PMU member was versed in World Bank
procurement policy and guidelines. Through the day-to-day work (on-the job experience)
activities and several procurement training courses, the procurement officer and the team
members acquired practical knowledge and experience, especially in IT procurement.
However, a main challenge was the extensive bureaucracy for obtaining internal approval.
The eRwanda project manager was not fully delegated authority to approve procurement
contracts. Because most of the tender amounts were beyond the Rwandan public tender
threshold, the project manager needed to go through RITA’s senior management
clearance as well as Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA)’s clearance. In the
beginning of the implementation, it took five stages of internal approval to award a
contract. The approval process took 3-5 weeks. The complex approval process increased
the time it took to obtain signature approval and affected project implementation. When
RITA merged with RDB, the approval process was simplified. However, the primary
responsibility for the contract execution still remained with the RDB/IT head (former
RITA ED). Dual language requirement for tenders (English and French) also added an
extra administrative layer to precede the selection process. As technical specifications
were published and received in the two languages, it added more complexity.

28.    Financial Management (FM). The Financial Management system (Sage Pastel)
was reviewed several times by the WB team. A minor system flaw prevented the
production of accounting reports, but RITA did not have sufficient funding to change the
configuration. As a result, FM officer had to reformat the financial reports manually. The

                                                     12
issue was fixed later on when RITA was merged into RDB. Overall financial
management was generally adequate during the project implementation. The World Bank
FM specialist upgraded the performance of the project to satisfactory in March, 2010.

29.     Environment and Social Assessment. At the time of the project appraisal, this
project was categorized as category C. There were no major environmental issues
associated with the eRwanda project. A social assessment study was conducted in
December 2007. The study found that the project preparation was more focused on
technical aspects rather than promotion/dissemination/ capacity building aspects. The
study concluded that further emphasis on the local people’s awareness, acceptance, and
collaboration would be critical for the project’s success. This point was taken into
consideration in the project implementation. Communication officer in the eRwanda team
organized several activity launch events (eSoko, ICT buses), and put significant efforts
on promotion. For example, ICT bus official launch event was held by the Minister of
Commerce and Industry and RDB in October 2009 in Kamonyi 12, and eSoko launch
event was held by the Minister of Agriculture and RDB on February 2010 at Gitarama
Market 13.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

30.     Sustainable arrangement after the eRwanda project. Transition arrangements
after the eRwanda project had been discussed and put in place before the project ending.
Most of the staff from RDB/IT as well as other respective Ministries and District Offices
who was involved in the project implementation stays at the same role and
responsibilities to ensure continuous operations and quality of service delivery after the
project completion. RDB/IT remained as the overall IT technical support authority. The
management and maintenance of the sector applications (eSoko, telemedicine, e-cabinet,
etc) and MDA and district office LANs had transferred to their respective Ministries
(Agriculture, Health, Cabinet Affaires, etc), and each Ministry had allocated budgets for
the operation and staffing. RDB/IT remained in charge of managing the telecenters, and
ICT buses. For the scale-up, eSoko won the regional Technology-in-Government in
Africa (TIGA) awards by UNECA in June 2011 14, and well received international
recognition. Then UN agencies in Rwanda (including WFP, FAO and UNECA) showed
their interest to support eSoko for scaling up to take advantage of the regional market
with eSoko application, and provided intensive training to farmers in July-August 2011 15.

31.     Next phase of the ICT development in Rwanda. As mentioned, the eRwanda
project was linked to the GoR’s development policy (NICI II). The achievement of the
eRwanda project had been well accepted by the GoR. Currently, the GoR is undertaking
an evaluation of NICI II results and drafting the next NICI plan (i.e., NICI III: 2011-

2015) which will focus on the following five clusters 16: (1) Skill Development, (2)
Community Development, (3) Private Sector Development in ICT sector, (4) Cyber
Security, and (5) eGovernment. NICI III draft will be approved by the end of 2011. Once
NICI III is finalized, the GoR and the World Bank will discuss how the World Bank
could support the NICI III goals based upon the accomplishments of the eRwanda
project; the need to scale-up some of these activities; and the need to finance some of the
NICI III clusters. The World Bank will continue to provide policy advice, technical
assistance, and financial support at the request of GoR 17. Meanwhile the World Bank
team will sustain some of its policy advice through non-lending technical assistance (TA)
and economic and sector work (ESW) during FY12, going through the Private Sector
Development (PSD) anchor team.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
32.      The project development objectives were highly relevant to the global agenda
and regional development trend. At the same time of eRwanda, the ICT environment in
the East Africa region had changed dramatically. Several submarine cable construction
initiatives had launched connecting the East Africa countries where satellite had been the
only way to connect to international gateways. Along with the submarine cable
development, the World Bank launched regional connectivity programs, Regional
Communications and Infrastructure Program (RCIP), in East and Southern African
countries. As a part of RCIP, RCIP Rwanda operation ($24 million) was launched in
2007 to focus on telecom policy and national and regional connectivity. With the
progress of regulatory reform supported by RCIP Rwanda, the access to ICT services had
improved. For instance, the number of mobile phone subscriptions in Rwanda jumped to
36 percent of population from 3 percent in 2006. The need to use ICT in government and
the need to connect to the global supply had increased, because IT equipped offices
(LANs, WANs), and eGovernment applications were being installed, bringing
transparency and accountability to government services, and allowing citizens to
participate in government activities.

33.    The project development objectives were relevant to the GoR’s development
strategy (NICI II), and CAS. The objectives of GoR’s National Information and
Communication Infrastructure plan phase 2 (NICI II) were: to strengthen Rwanda’s
economic base and improve the economic environment to accelerate development
towards an information-rich knowledge-based economy. With strong political
commitment from the beginning of project preparation, the eRwanda’s project
development objectives and project activities were developed aligned with NICI II 18. In



16
    http://www.nici3.com/
17
   The World Bank has been designated as one of the preferred donors for Infrastructure (ICT, transport, energy, and
agriculture) under the GoR’s division of labor policy since 2010.
18
    Under NICI II, the eRwanda project supported eGovernment and strengthening public service delivery. On the other
hand, the RCIP Rwanda project supports telecom regulations agenda and national and regional connectivity. This


                                                        14
addition to that, eGovernment was recognized as an important tool to strengthen the
government internal management and information service delivery to citizens in the 2002
CAS 19 period 20.

34.     eRwanda was a relatively small, niche, project, but created a solid foundation
for a knowledge-based economy, and well synergized with other NICI II projects.
The eRwanda project ($10 million) was only 2 percent of the total ICT investments ($500
million) during NICI II 21, but the project contributed to many areas of NICI II pillars
(Figure 3). The project has built a solid ICT foundation that could be further adjusted to
improve the delivery of government socio-economic services and created an ICT
knowledge savvy population in Rwanda. Also, the activities implemented by the
eRwanda project complemented the other NICI II projects (Table 2). For example,
Internet connection in District Offices and Telecenters became much faster by connecting
to the national fiber optic backbone. Inter-government LAN network and eGovernment
applications implemented by the project will be strengthened by the National Data Center
Operation. Further, deployment of broadband Internet and access cost reductions are
expected results of the RCIP Rwanda project.




distinction was clarified during the MTR when the RCIP Rwanda project was prepared. (Further details, please see
paragraph 22).
19
   The 2002 CAS set four themes for Bank support: (i) revitalization of the rural economy; (ii) private sector
development and employment creation; (iii) human and social development; and (iv) improvement in governance and
effectiveness of the public sector actions.

   In order to overcome the shortcomings in NICI I, the GoR allocated a large budget and proactively asked for public
and private sector involvement during the beginning of NICI II preparation. As a result, the total amount of investments
from the public and private sector during NICI II period reached $500 million.

35.     The project design was relevant and flexible. The project’s components were
well-designed and aligned with the Government’s strategy, NICI II. Given the limited
local capacity, it is relevant that the project focused on the fundamentals of eGovernment,
such as developing government networks (LAN/WAN) and high profile eGovernment
applications, providing ICT training for civil servants and citizens. The project allowed
some flexibility during implementation to incorporate the rapid technological progress in
the ICT sector. For instance, the idea of ICT buses (innovative movable telecenters)


                                                                               16
materialized during the implementation and led to positive media attention and greater
outreach 22. Due to effective cost management, four ICT buses were purchased instead of
two initially planned.

36.     The project took innovative approaches to tackle development challenges.
The total project amount ($10 million) was small compared to other eGovernment
projects 23, but several new ideas were implemented in the eRwanda project that received
international recognitions (Table 3, also see details in Annex 2.1, and Annex 9).

Table 3. Innovative solutions implemented in eRwanda
eSoko
What is eSoko?
     • eSoko is an agriculture mobile application to provide commodity market prices through mobile phones
          (text messages(SMS) and interactive voice response ( IVR) as well as through its website
          (www.esoko.gov.rw).
     • The information is available both in English and Kinyarwanda. This application launched in June 2009,
          and currently covers 77 commodity prices in 50 markets across the country. The commodity market
          prices are regularly collected through smart phones by the eSoko information agents and the price
          information is updated on a weekly basis.
     • In order to take advantage of the regional market, eSoko plans to integrate market price information in
          EAC countries for regional comparison.
Who are the main beneficiaries?
Farmers and traders in Rwanda and EAC countries. Through eSoko system, farmers and traders can easily
monitor the price changes by mobile phones from anywhere anytime. Then, they can decide the right timing and
location (market) to sell their products. At the same time, eSoko enabled Ministry of Agriculture to collect and
track the market commodity prices more frequently and paperlessly. The price data collected through smart
phones is uploaded directly through mobile networks and processed within 24 hours.
Achievements
SMS is the major access channel for eSoko, and total traffic (inbound and outbound) reached 27,293 SMS since
the system launched. eSoko won the regional Technology-in-Government in Africa (TIGA) awards by UNECA
in June 2011 24, and UN agencies in Rwanda provided intensive training to farmers to take advantage of the
regional market with eSoko application in June-August, 2011 25.
ICT buses
What are ICT buses?
     • ICT buses are IT equipped movable telecenters. The eRwanda project implemented four ICT buses in
          order to reach the people in rural areas. Each bus is equipped with 20 laptop computers, Internet access,
          overhead projector, large TV monitor, and power generator.
     • These “movable? telecenters stop at the underserved areas (areas without electricity supply in
          households) and stay at one place (usually some place close to a local landmark) for 2-3 months to
          provide basic ICT skill training at ICT buses. The t raining course is intensive consisting of 8-hour
          training for 2 weeks. The training curriculum covers basic computer literacy and software (MS Word,



22
   The BBC wrote an article about the ICT buses as an innovative solution to bridge the digital divides in underserved
areas. (Source: BBC, September 22, 2009 “Connection Rwanda?).
23
   Total population is often regarded as target population for eGovernment projects, because total population could
gain the benefits from the improved government functions and service delivery as a result of eGovernment intervention.
The total amount of eRwanda project ($10million per 10 million target population, 4 years duration) seems small
compared to other WB’s eGovernment projects such as eGhana ($40 million project per 24 million target population, 8
years duration), e-Lanka ($53 million project per 20 million target population, 8 years duration), and Vietnam ICT
Development project ($95 million per 87 million target population, 7 years duration). Note: Project amount is as of the
Board Approval, Population data is as of 2010 (Source: WDI).

    •      Attendance and completion are strictly monitored by RDB. Successful participants who complete the
           training course receive the certificate issued by RDB.
      • ICT buses also serve as multimedia community stations that provided public information which
           allowed the government to effectively communicate news and useful information, such as health
           information and agricultural techniques, to the targeted local people.
Who are the main beneficiaries?
Mainly rural population who have never had a chance to touch or use computers, especially women and young
people.
Achievements
Since the launch in November 2009, ICT buses have covered 33 out of 49 sectors in 4 remote districts (Gisagara,
Kamonyi, Ngororero, and Kirehe), and a total 1,044 rural people have visited the ICT buses (see the project map
in Annex 2.1). For most of the participants, training was their first opportunity to touch computers in their life.
The training session started from the basic computer operation such as how to move the mouse, and how to type.
Participants obtain the basic computer operation skills (typing keyboard, writing emails, and browsing websites,
etc.) by the end of the training. The foundational computer skill can be just a starting point, but surely helps them
to shift toward a knowledge-based life style. More importantly, the training enhances ICT awareness at the grass-
root level. People after completion of introductory ICT training at ICT buses often visit their nearest district
telecenters (also funded by the eRwanda project) to take more advanced IT trainings. Some of them started
communication with friends who also took the training by email, and started using Excel for their business
accounting.

In addition to the IT training, people visited ICT buses obtained useful agriculture knowledge and skills (e.g.
how to grow cassava, how to prevent bird flu, etc.). Also ICT buses are used as media booths because of the
mobile Internet connectivity. The buses were showcased at international events such as national environmental
day.

The BBC wrote an article about the ICT buses as an innovative solution to bridge the digital divide in
underserved areas. (Source: BBC, September 22, 2009 “Connection Rwanda?).
M&E capacity building with KIST
What is it?
Before the project, the concept of M&E was not much known in Rwanda. eRwanda created a new win-win
mechanism to strengthen the project M&E as well as local M&E capacity building. With the partnership with
Kigali Institute of Science Technology (KIST), the project offered M&E training courses to the students. Top 20
students who successfully completed M&E methodology courses participated in the eRwanda field surveys.
Who are the main beneficiaries?
Young promising KIST students who will lead the future ICT sector in Rwanda learned M&E in ICT sector
methodology and first-hand experience on data collection and analysis. Also, the eRwanda project itself
benefitted from this activity because the eRwanda team could conduct two large-scale user surveys to monitor
the project progress.
Achievements
Two large-scale user surveys to measure the progress of eRwanda project were conducted in 2008 (Mid-Term,
2800 sample size) and 2010 (End-Term, 3400 sample size). The students also supported analyzing the survey
data with SPSS statistical software. In total 57 KIST students completed the whole course work (methodology
and field work) and were certified in M&E in ICT.

                                             institutions outreach to the citizens.
                                              The project developed 94 government institutions
                                                    websites from scratch, allowing people to search and
                                                    find the public information more easily online. People
                                                    who live in rural areas can get the information online at

37.       With regard to the first PDO, the project implemented a wide range of IT systems,
such as office automation, LANs, and key eGovernment applications. Indeed the internal
government process was improved. For example, Inter-governmental LAN stimulated
GoR’s decentralization process by connecting central and local government. Many
transactions and communications were integrated by email or online transactions. It
allowed GoR to save staff’s time and travel that were required before the project. In terms
of eGovernment applications, eCabinet and eParliament applications eliminated paper
trail, streamlined cabinet and parliament sessions and automated workflow, by sending
out the agenda, issuing of minutes, approvals, and accessing archives. Overall
coordination of the GoR MDAs was improved. Furthermore, it is appreciated as a model
system from neighboring countries, since Rwanda is one of the first countries that
introduced eCabinet system.

38.     With regard to the second PDO, the data was collected through a large-scale
survey (total sample: 3394) by the project team. The achieved targets were quite high
relative to global standards. The target setting was unrealistic because the satisfaction rate
is a subjective concept related to users’ readiness and expectations of the government
services as well as the relationship between citizens and the government. According to
the ACSI E-Government Satisfaction Index analysis 26, it is said that user satisfaction of
eGovernment services remains around 75% over time in the case of US which is one of
the most established eGovernment service providers with relatively IT mature users
(Figure 4). In Rwanda, the user satisfaction rates were kept high 27 by continuous service
delivery improvements implemented by the project. For example, District Websites
(available in Kinyarwandan in all 30 districts) provide local information and local
government activities. Also, Government Websites allowed citizen’s feedback, even to
the Prime Minister/President Offices and featured a president Blog. In parallel to the local
content development and dissemination in local language, the project supported the
increase in ICT awareness by rolling-out ICT training and awareness campaigns. In total,
2822 Rwandans were trained 28. eSoko system made it available to check the commodity
price information through mobile phones anywhere anytime. Through the project, the
Government reached out to citizens especially in remote areas, and the survey results
indicated that the above activities were highly supported by citizens. Thus, two user

3.3 Efficiency
39.     The project met high targets and closed on time. Through the detailed
flexibility of the project’s design and the changes developed during implementation this
eGovernment project fully disbursed its budget, achieved high targets, and completed on
time. When the project implementation started, ICT market was not mature in Rwanda.
Most of IT-equipments were purchased from outside of the country. The project team
needed to go through many small procurement packages. Nevertheless, the project
management’s high adaptability mitigated implementation delays and early low
disbursement allowing the project to close on time.

40.     Innovative idea maximized the project’s outreach to rural populations
efficiently. The concept of ICT buses (movable telecenters) was adopted in order to
provide basic ICT skill training for rural people. Outreach was maximized and operating
costs were minimized due to the buses’ mobility compared to the conventional telecenters
(located in fixed locations). Since the ICT buses were equipped with power generators,
the ICT training was operated even in the remote areas where stable electricity supply
was limited. More rural people could join the training on foot without major travel. Also,
the costs for hiring and training instructors were minimized because the same instructors
stayed with the ICT buses, and the quality of training was kept at the same level. Based
on the initial investment and operational costs, the unit cost for the entire training session
per participant is estimated at approximately $90 29. It is reasonable compared to other


29
   The unit cost was calculated based on the actual expenses for the initial investment and operational cost, and
assuming that the ICT buses will be amortized over 5 years. 5 years depreciation estimate is based on computer and
automobile depreciation period. (Source: http://taxguide.completetax.com/text/Q14_2960.asp )


                                                         21
similar ICT training 30. As a result, 1,044 rural people obtained basic ICT skills and
experienced the Internet for the first time. Four ICT buses, instead of the two originally
planned, were purchased because of efficient cost management and procurement.

41.     Economic analysis of the project. The implementation completion and results
report (ICR) analyzed the project survey data to measure the economic impact of the
project on end users (see Annex 3). The survey data was collected repeatedly during the
project implementation (2008 and 2010) in the project areas as well as in non-project
areas. The survey results demonstrated significant improvement on travel time to access
service centers in the eRwanda project areas. In 2008, there were approximately 30
percent people spent over 91 minutes to access service centers. It declined to 13 percent
in 2010. In terms of quality and speed of service in the project areas, approximately 70
percent of people visited service centers in the project areas resolved their inquiries
within two transaction compared, which is 20 percent higher than non-project areas in
2010. Thus this analysis concludes that the eRwanda project has made a significant
impact on improving efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery to citizens
through streamlined ICT platforms (see Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
42.      The project was relevant, achieved high targets and closed on time. The PDOs
were developed aligned with Rwanda’s Development Strategy (Vision 2020 and NICI II
plan). A broad range of activities were fully implemented on time. The project achieved
its PDOs. The efficacy of this project is worthy to note. In particular, the innovative
approaches to enhance the outreach to rural people (eSoko and ICT buses) were well
recognized by international media and development community. eSoko won the
Technology in Government in Africa (TIGA) Awards, the largest ICT Award by UNECA
in the category of 'public service delivery to citizens/communities'. Also, the
implementation of government network in district offices enabled communications and
direct transactions among government institutions in Kigali and district offices by email
and eGovernment applications. Civil servants in district offices acquired IT skills at local
telecenters. District Offices disseminate local news through their websites, at the same
time, they accept feedback from citizens. It stimulated the GoR’s decentralization process,
also made the government more accountable.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
43.    Gender. As mentioned in section 1.4 Main Beneficiary, the eRwanda project
promoted female participation for the project’s activities. For example, IT training in ICT
buses mandated 30% participation of women in every session, and the targets were

closely monitored. In addition, eRwanda provided IT training to the National Women’s
Council members, the nationwide women’s representative organization managed directly
under the Prime Minister’s Office. Approximately 700 women from the National
Women’s Council took basic computer literacy training to enhance their daily lives,
businesses and financial conditions. As a result, the Council began emailing its newsletter
to members and accepting newsletter contributions by email. Some members became
frequent users of the rural telecenters, funded by the eRwanda project to access the
Internet, obtain web-based health information, communicate with other council members
and friends, and use basic computer applications (such as MS Word, Excel) for their
business. The Ministry of Gender and Family Promotions was an active promoter of
telecenters for adolescent girls to acquire IT skills and knowledge for their better live.

44.     Social Development. The project supported several activities to enhance
community development and youth involvement. For example, district offices set up
websites and started posting local news and valuable information on their websites for
local residents. ICT buses visited remote rural communities and provided opportunities
for rural people and youth to acquire IT skills (see the project map in Annex 2.1).
Additionally, the ICT buses served as multimedia community stations that provided
public information which allowed the government to effectively communicate news and
beneficial information, such as health and agriculture information, to the local people.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
45.     The World Bank helped mobilize international expertise and knowhow during
eRwanda implementation. NICI II plan and the activities implemented by the eRwanda
project often received domestic and international media attention. For example, the
several documentary videos featured eRwanda project hit approximately 12,500 views on
YouTube 31. It helped place the country on the international radar screen regarding IT
advancement and policy making. The World Bank held several knowledge exchanges,
study tours 32 and virtual interactions about technical topics. For instance, an e-
procurement distance learning course 33 helped strengthen the skills and knowledge of
project leaders and other policy makers associated with the implementation of future e-
procurement policies. This course fostered collaboration between GoR and civil society
such as Transparency International Rwanda.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
46.     eRwanda project created positive spillover effects on Rwanda shifting to a
ICT hub. The project laid groundwork for further ICT development. Innovative and
successful implementation (eSoko, ICT buses, etc.) of eRwanda project received
international recognition 34. It attracted more donors and private sector investors
launching new projects and business in the ICT sector in Rwanda. For example, the one
laptop per child (OLPC) program is now headquartered in Kigali. The program increased
the project size from 100,000 to 160,000 by June 2012 35.African Development Bank will
be financing the creation of the Center of Excellence for ICT Skills in Kigali. Several
ICT companies such as mobile phone application and content developers opened offices
in Kigali 36.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
47.      Two large-scale groundbreaking user surveys were conducted during the
project implementation period. A baseline survey was conducted in the targeted14
districts and 17 ministries to benchmark all M&E indicators for the project. A follow-up
survey was conducted in October 2010 to measure the progress. The questionnaires
included: public service delivery performance, user perception, user usage, and user
satisfaction of telecenters, and user satisfaction of e-services implemented by the project.
The data was collected through: (i) exit surveys at public service offices, (ii) household
questionnaires, and (iii) interviews at work places. The follow up survey collected 3,394
responses. The survey results were used to generate part of the M&E indicators. The
project’s M&E indicators are in Annex 2.2 (For details and results of Beneficiary Surveys,
see Annex 5).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate Risk
48.     The risk to development outcomes rated moderate risk for the eRwanda
project. The GoR is committed to ICT development and continues phasing the 5-year
implementation plans (NICI plans) that will be completed by 2020. Mentioned in section
1.1, eRwanda was one of the main activities under NICI II. The following phase (NICI
III) will be designed based on the achievements of NICI II, including those financed
under eRwanda. Therefore, eRwanda’s achievements are likely to be sustained after the
project’s completion because of the continuous implementation and acceptance of the
NICI plans as central to Rwanda’s vision 2020.

49.      Before the end of the eRwanda project, the eRwanda team and beneficiary
institutions had agreed upon the continuation and potential scale-up of the Office LANs
and eGovernment applications. The beneficiary institutions became administratively and
financially responsible for the day-to-day management, maintenance, continuous
operations and potential scale-ups. RDB/IT agreed to remain in technical supervision.

50.      RDB/IT agreed to retain management of the telecenters and ICT buses. In terms
of the telecenters, RDB/IT has been motivating and nurturing entrepreneurship among the
telecenter managers. If these managers develop a financially independent and sustainable
business model, RDB/IT eventually could spin off the managerial and financial
responsibility of the telecenters under a PPP scheme. In terms of the ICT buses, RDB/IT
agreed to cover operational costs (salaries for driver, trainer, maintenance, gas). ICT
buses have significant potential to reach a large number of people, especially those who
live in rural areas. Because the ICT buses’ operational costs are relatively high in
Rwandan standard (calculated around $200/month/bus as of Oct 2010), self sustainable
business models are under consideration but have not been yet finalized. To become
financially self-sustaining, the ICT buses could expand their use as commercial
multimedia stations at national events or international conferences. The feasibility of the
telecenters to establish a financially self-sustaining business model and the uncertain
secondary commercial use of ICT buses makes the development outcome of this project a
moderate risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderate Satisfactory
51.    The project proposal was developed and obtained Board approval in 10 months,
and then took another 10 months to meet effectiveness conditions. The main cause of this
delay was the ratification of the project by the Rwandan government. However, given the
compounded initial implementation delays (delay to become effectiveness, and
procurement and disbursement delays in the first 2 years of implementation), there would
have been readiness issue. In retrospect, there would be 2 possible areas of improvement
during the project preparation:
    • Fiduciary arrangements: Procurement was a major challenge during the first half
       of the implementation, and the procurement process caused slow disbursement.
       Lack of technical, administrative, and operational expertise in ICT procurement
       should have been considered more seriously during project preparation and
       reflected to the procurement and disbursement plan. The initial financial summary
       (included page 46 in PAD, where planned to disburse 65 % in the first two years)
       was too ambitious to achieve given the limited local capacity.
    • Use of Project Preparation Advance (PPA): The team could utilize PPA to
       strengthen PMU staff capacity while waiting for the completion of the project
       ratification.




                                            25
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
52.     Good team support, but there were some minor continuity issues during the
TTL’s transition period. The Bank provided full support for supervision of the project
at headquarters (HQ) and in the Country Office. The Task Team Leader (TTL) changed
after the MTR, but both of the TTLs had strong knowledge and experience in IT system
and eGovernment projects. They demonstrated strong team building and communication
skills among the staff and with stakeholders. The Bank team organized several outreach
events, such as public consultations during the project preparation, official project launch
events, and new eGovernment application launch events. The outreach events encouraged
the project team to work with several beneficiary institutions and raised the awareness of
the eRwanda project among Rwandans.

53.     In terms of the Bank’s operations management, there were some minor oversights
during the transition period between TTLs. The former TTL was in charge of the project
until the MTR (held in July 2009), and the current TTL took over the project afterwards.
During the MTR, several items were discussed that needed follow-up actions, and
communications during the transition period remained incomplete. As a result, a minor
revision of the Results Framework and monitoring indicators (i.e., no change of PDOs)
was made that was included in the MTR Aide-Memoire, but did not occur until the
project closing. This oversight needs to be noted, but it happened when the Bank-wide
operational policy of project restructuring was changed and a new Country Lawyer came
on board. The guidance might not be well established. In fact, the PMU’s result tracking
was improved after the indicators were revised in MTR. Consequently, the team was able
to track the project progress more accurately.

54.     In terms of procurement, the Bank procurement specialist and procurement
assistant, who have been based in the Country Office, worked closely with the project
team. They are familiar with the procurement process of GoR and remained in their
positions during the project implementation period. They reviewed the procurement
activities and provided annual procurement review reports with recommendations and
action plans. Their technical advice and hands-on support and accessibility in the field
were utilized by the project team. They helped the project team catch-up with the original
procurement plan. Eventually, the procurement was fully committed by the project’s
closing.

55.     In terms of financial management, the Financial Management (FM) specialist
based in the Country Office provided technical support to the project team. The FM
specialist stayed during most of the project implementation period. He reviewed the
quarterly FM reports that the project team prepared and provided technical comments. He
also provided training to the PMU’s FM staff.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                            26
56.     The two TTLs were fully committed and led the project team to move forward.
Both TTLs were based in HQ, but they frequently visited Rwanda for supervision at least
twice in a year. Onsite support from the Procurement specialist and FM specialist based
in the Country Office was critical to the project’s completion. There were some
shortcomings during the project preparation and TTL’s transition era, but it was
addressed by the accelerated project implementation after the MTR led by new TTL and
on time completion of the project. Thus overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57.     Strong GoR’s commitments. The GoR, led by HE President Paul Kagame, is
strongly committed to ICT development. The political leadership nurtured citizens’
interest and understanding toward ICT and the collective aspiration to become to a
knowledge-based economy. Also, The GoR’s well structured matrix clearly indicates ICT
champions in every level of the government 37. Because the political leadership believed
in the goals of ICT development, the project team was able to obtain beneficiaries’
consensus and cooperation toward the eRwanda project. This combination of top down
and bottom up approach helped mobilize the stakeholders towards project
implementation.

58.     Continuous GoR’s endorsement made the project fully disbursed and
finished on time, despite initial delays and frequent turnover of senior management.
The project implementation was slow in the beginning due to the ratification process and
procurement delays. High turnover of senior management in charge of ICT was another
challenge for the eRwanda team. In fact, the Minister in charge of ICT and the head of
RITA, where the PMU was embedded, changed three times during the three and a half
year project implementation period. Each new management took certain time to
understand the scope of the project and activities agreed between the GoR and the World
Bank. However, those challenges were overcome by the continuous support from ICT
champions in the government and stakeholders in beneficiary agencies (MDAs, district
offices, etc.). For example, technical advisors to the Minister in charge of ICT fully
understood the project, and they provided strong support to the project. Most of the
government officials who were involved in the project stayed in the same position
throughout the project implementation. With their endorsements, stability at operational
level kept the project moving forward.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

59.    RITA. The agency carried out excellent coordination with all levels of
government, from the District offices to the highest levels of government offices (such as
President’s Office). The ICR team observed that RITA’s middle to senior management


37
     See details in paragraph 63.



                                            27
positions were staffed by relatively young but knowledgeable professionals, who handled
large and demanding ICT projects. Most of the RITA staff worked for the eRwanda
project stayed in their positions throughout the project implementation. It nurtured
stability and teamwork of the entire eRwanda team, and made it possible to accelerate the
project implementation after the MTR as well as cope with transitions (such as change of
the top management, institutional change to RDB).

60.      PMU. The recruitment of key PMU positions occurred efficiently, and ensured
promising Rwandan professionals joined the team. None of the PMU team members had
prior work experience with World Bank projects. Almost all team members (including
the Project Manager) stayed in their positions throughout the project implementation, and
they acquired and advanced their skills and knowledge through day-to-day work and
training. The ICR team observed that each team member was a highly knowledgeable and
competent professional. They demonstrated effective teamwork that accelerated the
implementation and completion of the complex project on time. After the project closed,
several of the PMU staff (Project Manager, Procurement Specialist) were hired for the
same functions under the Skill Development Project ($30 million IDA grant project, that
was Board approved in 2011).

61.     PMU managed a series of complicated ICT procurement without a glitch.
Given the structure that the PMU was created under the RITA management, the Project
Manager needed to follow the RITA management clearance process for the project
procurement. Since most of the tender amounts were beyond the Rwandan public tender
threshold, the project manager needed to go through complicated RITA’s senior
management clearance as well as Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA)’s
clearance. According to the procurement review prepared by the Bank procurement
specialist in 2009, there were five internal clearance processes required above the Project
Manager for most of the tenders 38. In addition to the several layers of the internal
clearance, ICT procurement was a new area for approvers and it would require technical
knowledge 39. However, it was addressed by the significant efforts by the PMU. The
Project Manager and Procurement Officer of the PMU devoted a significant amount of
time to obtain the ICT procurement by training, and closely followed up with the
clearance process. The PMU proactively communicated with the Bank team if they
needed specific technical guidance on ICT procurement. Eventually, the PMU managed
to get procurement back on track, and led to full disbursement on time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




38
   This issue was addressed when RITA was merged in to RDB. Consequently, internal clearance processes were
simplified for small procurements. However, two extra clearance layers were added for large tenders.
39
   ICT procurement, especially lack of specialist who has technical expertise, was identified as a major implementation
constraint in ICT projects (IEG 2011).


                                                         28
62.     There were some challenges to the Borrower’s performance during the
implementation such as (1) the high turnover rate of the Minister in charge of ICT and
RITA’s top management, and (2) a complex internal clearance process. However, these
shortcomings were overcome by the nation’s strong political leadership and commitment
from every level of the government toward ICT development, and the outstanding
competence of the PMU team members. The project achieved on time completion with
full disbursement. It should be highlighted given the recent findings of IEG report that
more than 70 percent of eGovernment projects have been significantly delayed or
cancelled in the middle of implementation 40.

6. Lessons Learned
63.     Top-level political leadership support and commitment from every level of
the government led to Rwanda’s ICT success. The involvement of key Ministries as
well as public and private stakeholders from the beginning of the project prompted strong
support for the eRwanda project and facilitated the implementation of activities in
different Ministries (e.g., eCabinet system under Prime Minister’s Office, Telemedicine
under Ministry of Health, and Agricultural Market Price System under Ministry of
Agriculture, etc.). One of the key success factors for the smooth implementation of
activities in different Ministries was GoR’s well-structured responsibility matrix for NICI
II project implementation. Each Ministry assigned an ICT focal person (senior position)
who was fully responsible for NICI II implementation. The Ministry of ICT provided
guidance for ICT policy deployment into each activity. RITA (later RDB), where
eRwanda PMU was located, provided technical expertise and coordinated the
implementation. This matrix was applied to the implementation of eRwanda because it
was a part of NICI II. The ICR team interviewed several ICT focal persons at different
Ministries. They were fully committed to lead the ICT agenda in their respective sectors.
Other developing countries can learn from Rwanda’s experience implementing
transformational ICT programs across government agencies.

64.     The eRwanda project is a “boutique? eGovernment project that is small,
innovative and unique at the World Bank. As mentioned on paragraph 36, the
eRwanda project had a relatively small grant amount and short project duration compared
to other World Bank eGovernment projects, but it complemented well other WB
operations in the country such as programmatic Poverty Reduction Support Grant
(PRSG) 41, and RCIP Rwanda 42. Given the limited local capacity and weak ICT
infrastructure at the time of preparation, the project focused on the fundamentals of
eGovernment such as development of government LAN and high-profile eGovernment
applications. ICT skill training was also rigorously rolled-out for the citizens to build a
solid foundation for a knowledge-based society. The project design was focused on
discernible foundational impacts that could be tracked long-term. The eRwanda project
played a key role in the Rwandan government’s Vision 2020 goal, the transition of the
country from an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy. The
eRwanda project assisted the GoR to show how ICT could play a catalytic role in
increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the Government (Government LAN/WAN
network, eGovernment applications, etc.) and at the same time, broadening the citizens’
ICT awareness in order to pursue Vision 2020. The ICT bus activity was a good example
because ICT skill training using ICT buses created ICT awareness within the population.




41
   The Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG: $50 million each year) was the main instrument to support policy
implementation in education, health, energy, and water sector, also PRSG supported service delivery in agriculture and
infrastructure. (Source: IDA, Interim Strategy Note for the Republic of Rwanda FY07-FY08).
42
   RCIP Rwanda operation supports regional and national backbone connectivity, Consequently, RCIP Rwanda brings
down the connectivity costs, which will help the operational costs for governmental LANs and telecenters implemented
by the eRwanda project, and push forward the eGovernment applications built by eRwanda.


                                                         30
The potential for ICT 43 created excitement among Rwanda’s younger population 44. The
project amount was small, but eRwanda indeed contributed to make a strong foundation
for a knowledge-based economy and created ICT awareness not only for the GoR but
also for all Rwandans.

65.     Knowledge/technology transfer and developing local IT system capacity.
Day-to-day maintenance and access to local expert technical support are critical for IT
systems to remain operational. In the case of the eRwanda project, many stakeholders
appreciated the availability of local on-site expert technical support after the
implementation of IT systems and applications, because those were not widely available
before the eRwanda project. Given the nature of the project, significant IT system
programming and technical support were required at the beginning of system
development. In order to build local IT capacity among the beneficiary institutions and
enhance the nation’s IT industry, the eRwanda project encouraged foreign companies to
develop business partnerships with local IT companies and to bid for IT systems. The
companies, which were awarded contracts, were required to conduct on-site system
programming and installation. As a result of the partnerships, cutting-edge programming
skills and knowledge were transferred to local Rwandans (not only the technicians in
local IT companies but also the technicians in beneficiary institutions and the
implementation agency), enough to manage day to day operations (updates and system
maintenance).

66.      ICT buses are an innovative solution to reach to people in rural areas. The
ICT buses have 20 laptop computer stations with an internet connection. In addition, the
bus has a large monitor and DVD player, a projector and projector screen, and its own
power generator. The ICT buses allowed youth and rural people, who do not have
household electricity, an opportunity to become familiar with ICT by touching computers
and using the internet. It provided opportunities to teach basic IT skills and promoted ICT
awareness at the grass-root level. The ICR team concurred that ICT buses have a high
potential to positively affect social development in Rwanda. In fact, this project aimed at
mitigating gender digital divide by mandating at least 30 percent female participation in
all training sessions in ICT buses (see the section 3.5).

67.     Building M&E capacity through the project. The eRwanda project took a
unique approach to building local M&E capacity. Under component 4 (Program
Management), the project supported M&E courses at KIST in order to build local M&E
capacity. Thanks to the participation of KIST students, the eRwanda team was able to
conduct two large-scale user surveys (in 2008 and in 2010) with a limited budget.
Equally important, the KIST students obtained first-hand survey experience. This
collaboration created a win-win situation for both parties, and is a scenario to be
replicated in other Bank projects.

   Whenever ICT buses (movable telecenters) stop at new places, the buses are welcomed and surrounded by many
local people who thirst for new, innovative technologies. The eRwanda project documentary well captured the scene:

68.     Introduction of new Procurement Cycle Tracking System (PROCSYS)
speeded up procurement process and increased efficiency. PROCYS launched in
Rwanda in November 2008 together with other pilot countries for the first phase in the
Africa Region. e-Rwanda was among the first projects to use the system. The first request
was sent through PROCSYS by eRwanda team in January 2009, 3 month after the system
launch. The system was found very useful in terms of monitoring and tracking the
procurement process, because all documents are saved in the same place in the system
automatically 45. There is no need for the client to send hard copies to the Bank, since
TTL and other team members including Procurement Staff can access the system directly
from anywhere. Also the system allows users to generate periodical monitoring reports. It
contributed tremendously to reduce the time required for review and response on both
sides (Bank and Client) as well as procurement monitoring and management.

Annex 2.1 Outputs by Component

       The project outputs are discussed and summarized by component below.

Component 1: Strengthening government effectiveness and efficiency

        Aligned with the Government development strategy (NICI II plan), the eRwanda
project provided support for: (i) the harmonization of basic technology for the MDAs and
District Offices; and (ii) the implementation of a government portal and Intranet which
link central ministries and district offices and provide easy access to a variety of
applications and information services. Specifically, the project supported: (1)
development of standards for the deployment of the new system, (2) purchase of all IT
equipment, (3) technical specification of WANs linking all national and sub-national
relevant institutions, (4) establishment of cyber-security system that ensured data
accuracy, integrity, and interoperability, (5) establishment of system maintenance and
support framework for the ICT applications, and (6) ICT training and capacity building.

Harmonization of the basic technology for the MDAs and District Offices: eRwanda has
implemented 12 MDAs and 12 district office LANs (Figure 6). The basic LAN
equipment includes computers (most of the staff has been assigned with an individual
computer), printers, and scanners. The average configuration of the LAN network in a
government office consists of 50 – 60 PC users. Each office is connected to the Internet
and National Backbone (broadband optic fiber) as of March, 2011.

eCabinet system: eCabinet is a one-stop online service site to provide Cabinet process
and all records electronically among the Ministries. eCabinet eliminates the need for
manual submission and circulation of memoranda, agenda, and decisions among the
Ministries. Also, eCabinet improves communication and knowledge sharing among the
Ministries. At the time of ICR mission, the eCabinet system has completed, but not yet
officially launched. Training for end users was underway. Key functions and features in
the eCabinet are as follows:

•   Administration Portal: It allows users with Administrator profile to modify user
    account, and system setting such as Email Format to be circulated to the registered
    members.
•   Collaboration Portal: It allows users to create and edit Cabinet Paper Templates in
    XML format. Intuitive step-by-step wizards navigate users. Cabinet Papers can be
    circulated within a Ministry or among the Ministries in various formats (Read-Only,
    Comment-mode, Edit) for further collaboration. Users can preview Cabinet Papers in
    the HTML format any time during the collaboration process. After the collaboration
    process, users with sufficient user profile can submit Cabinet Papers to the Agenda
    Portal. Users may also review and revise Cabinet Papers if they are returned by the
    Cabinet Secretariat after the submissions.
•   Consultation Portal: This is a separate Portal which resides on its own separate
    network to allow external third party organizations to view the content of Cabinet
    Papers in order to submit their review comments on the Papers.



                                           34
•   Agenda Portal: It allows users with Cabinet Secretariat profile to manage Cabinet
    and Committee meetings. Meeting function includes: (1) meeting type, (2) meeting
    date/time, (3) Cabinet Papers which are to be attached to the Agenda, and (4) the
    order of the attached Cabinet Papers. All Cabinet Papers submitted to the Agenda
    Portal can be reviewed and either returned to the submitting Ministry or added to a
    Cabinet/Committee Agenda. Also, the Agenda Portal manages all Cabinet Secretariat
    documentation process. For example, once a Cabinet decision is made, following-up
    process is automatically generated in the system.
•    Information Portal: It allows users with the appropriate user profile to view the items
    on the most current Agenda, also to follow up the previous Cabinet decisions.
•   Meeting Portal: It provides the President, the Prime Minister and other Ministers an
    easy-to-use interface for reviewing the Cabinet Papers during Cabinet Meetings and
    Committee Meetings. The Meeting Secretary controls the current topic of discussion
    and flags the decision taken by the Cabinet/Committee.
•   XML Author: XML Author is an Add-In function for Microsoft Word which allows
    users to create XML documents in a familiar authoring environment. XML Author
    function is integrated in the eCabinet system and it allows users to (1) download and
    open pre-defined templates, (2) save those templates, and (3) view the content in
    various formats.

eParliament system: The eParliament system has launched in November 2010 and is
currently used by the members of Parliaments. The system aims to facilitate the
Document Management System. Members can access to all documents within the
Parliament (e.g., act) from the Parliament LAN. Also, some features are open to the
public on its website (www.parliament.gov.rw).

Following functions are available in the eParliament system:

•   Admin Module: This is a core module of the E-parliament system for administrators.
    Administrators can record the data essential for members (Deputies or Senators)
    regarding parliamentary activities, committees’ activities, assembly activities, etc.
    Also, administrators can record election results, government structure, member data,
    parliamentary tasks, plenary session meeting agenda, plenary session meeting
    decisions, committee meeting agenda, committee meeting decisions, and some
    additional tasks.
•   Member Module: This is the Second Part of the E-Parliament system used by the
    members and Ministries. Members can retrieve all related data of the admin module
    all at once, and search for parliamentary documents and articles in the Constitution or
    the Internal Rules, and conduct paper-less preview of the meeting documents.
•   Reporting Module. This module is open for the members and Ministries as well as
    public users through its website. The following reports are available: (a) Parliament
    Achievements Statistics; (b) Parliamentary Tasks Reports;(c) Committee Reports; and
    (d) Members Reports.




                                             35
Document Tracking and Workflow Management System (DTWMS), e-Forms:

•   Document Tracking and Workflow Management System (DTWMS): The GoR
    envisaged having one-stop eGovernment services, which allow the front end-users to
    interface and transact with any back-end systems without knowing the details of
    service providers. DTWMS is an activity to support one-stop eGovernment services.
    DTWMS aims to reorganize each ministry’s back office systems and platforms, and
    to set up one-stop eGovernment services across the ministries. The eRwanda project
    supported RDB/IT( managing entity of DTWMS) to conduct the initial study and
    purchase hardware and software licenses (ORACLE licenses). As a result of the
    initial study, RDB/IT identified which existing workflow will be automated and
    integrated with other ministries’ back office systems.

•   e-Forms: This is an initiative to automate public information and enable online
    application processing, which is closely linked to the DTWMS. The eRwanda project
    supported the purchase of hardware, software licenses, and some cost of system
    implementation. When the ICR team visited, the first phase of the e-form initiative
    (automation of visa forms) was ongoing. Business flow analysis of the existing
    (paper-based) visa application process, and training for the system developers had
    been completed. After the eRwanda project, RDB/IT will be in charge of overall
    project management and technical supervision working closely with respective
    government institutions. In the case of online visa forms, RDB/IT is working with the
    immigration office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

IT Capacity Building: eRwanda provided IT training for government employees (both
technical staff (system administrators) and end-users of the new LAN system), and other
high priority groups (National Women’s Council members, private sector, etc.) (Table 5).

Component 2: Improving service delivery to citizens and the private sector

        This component assisted the Government to widen the dissemination channels of
relevant information to the targeted population including vulnerable groups (women,
children, and farmers). This component funded the development and management of (i)
service applications in health, agriculture, environment and education; and (ii) public
access points in urban and rural areas. Training of community members through the
public access points (telecenters) is also included.

Development of Service Applications: eRwanda supported the establishment of the
following applications.

eSoko: eSoko is an agriculture mobile application to provide commodity market prices
through mobile phones (text messages(SMS) and interactive voice response ( IVR)) as
well as through a website (www.esoko.gov.rw). This application launched in June 2009,
and currently covers 77 commodity prices in 50 markets across the country. The
commodity market prices are regularly collected through smart phones by the eSoko
information agents and the price information is updated on a weekly basis. So far, SMS is
the major access channel for eSoko, and total traffic (inbound and outbound) reached
27,293 SMS since the system launched. After the eRwanda project, day-to-day operation
and management was handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture. Going forward, content
aggregation would be the key to expand the eSoko service to all mobile subscribers,
which enabling to provide affordable and quality services across the country.

   2 staff were trained in one district, but one was resigned after the training. Then the eRwanda team trained his
replacement.




                                                           37
Telemedicine: The eRwanda project supported establishing telemedicine systems in
partnership with the Ministry of Health. The two major regional hospitals in Rwanda
(Ruhengeri Hospital and Kabgayi Hospital) were linked through the Internet to the most
advanced hospital in Kigali (King Faisal Hospital (KFH)). Also the project provided IT
training for all doctors and nurses in the three hospitals. Through the system, doctors in
regional hospitals can ask for remote diagnosis and treatment and second opinions, and
send referrals to KFH. Also, through regular video conferences among the three hospitals,
doctors and nurses can continue professional education and obtain the latest health care
information. The telemedicine system was launched in 2009. In May 2010, the
Telemedicine Administrator was recruited to manage the day-to-day operation and
facilitate more usage of the system on a daily basis. After the eRwanda project, the
Ministry of Health took over the administration and management of the system.
According to interviews with the National eHealth coordinator, low awareness and usage
of the system is the main challenge; however, the government will gradually set up a
policy to mandate the use of the telemedicine system in daily diagnosis, and most likely it
will start with two areas (radiology, and dermatology).

Digital Content creation:

Creation of MDAs websites (Enhancement of the GoR web presence): The project
supported the creation of websites including: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MINAFFET) and its 20 overseas embassies, the Ministry of Local Government and 30
districts and 2 provinces, the Ministry of Youth, the Ministry of ICT, the Parliament and
Senate, the President’s Office, Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA),
Rwanda Development Board (RDB), and Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA).
The Project also redesigned websites for several other Ministries. In total, 94 websites
were either developed from scratch or redesigned.

Creation of web-based information applications: The project supported the creation of
the following online applications: REMA Online biodiversity catalogue, and the
Kinyarwanda Digital Library at the National University of Rwanda (NUR) Library which
340 Kinyarwanda books were digitalized.

Provision of public access points (telecenters) to provide access to information and to
government services

Public Access Points (Telecenters): The eRwanda project implemented 18 district
telecenters equipped with Internet connected PCs, printers, scanners, and training
facilities (such as overhead projectors). The telecenters are open 7am-8pm on weekdays
(Mon-Fri), and provide Internet access, IT training, printing and scanning service. The
service charges are established based on the income level in the area set by each
telecenter manager with RDB’s approval. The manager and IT technician/training
instructor recruited by RDB are dispatched to the area and delegated day to day
management.




                                            38
ICT buses: The eRwanda supported the expansion of public access points especially in
rural areas. The project introduced “ICT bus? consisting of four buses each equipped with
20 laptop computers, Internet access, overhead projector, large TV monitor, and power
generator (Figure 5). These “movable? telecenters visit the underserved areas (areas
without electricity supply in households) to provide opportunity for rural people to get
familiar with using computers and Internet. The concept of the ICT buses is to introduce
the possibilities ICT brings to the local people and eventually navigate the people who
took training at the ICT buses to the district telecenters where advanced IT training and
Internet cafés are provided. Local people from the neighboring sectors and villages can
take the basic IT training at ICT buses. The training curriculum covers basic computer
literary and software (MS Word, Excel, Power Points) and email/Internet. It takes 2
weeks (8hrs per day) to complete, and at the end of the training participants receive a
certificate from RDB. The training itself is free of charge but attendance is strictly
monitored and reported to the sector and village offices which select the people to
participate. Following the list of underserved areas provided by the Government, the ICT
buses visit sectors or villages and stay in the field for 2-3 months. Bus drivers and IT
training instructors stay in local accommodation during the field visits. Since the launch
in November 2009, ICT buses have covered 33 out of 49 sectors in 4 districts (Gisagara,
Kamonyi, Ngororero, and Kirehe), and a total 1,044 rural people visited the ICT buses
(Figure 6).

Component 3: Improving access to services through enhanced infrastructure in
energy and telecommunications

        This component assisted the GoR to provide competitive and affordable
telecommunications services in rural areas. The activities included: (i) strengthening the
operational efficiency of the regulatory agency for the telecommunications sector
(RURA) and (ii) improving basic access to infrastructure by financing connectivity to
province and district offices, and linking public access points in rural areas.

Improving basic access infrastructure: eRwanda supported several studies which became
the foundation of another IDA operation (RCIP Rwanda) including: “Assessment of East
Africa Submarine Cable Project?, “Preliminary Study on National Connectivity Options?,
and “Detailed Study on National Connectivity Options?. These studies worked very well
not only to accelerate the RCIP Rwanda project preparation but also to prompt timely-

response to the recent launch of international submarine fiber-optic cables in East Africa
(EASSy, TEAM, SEACOM) and terrestrial fiber-optic backbone networks (from the
Rwandan national backbone to the submarine cable points in Mombasa and Dar es
Salaam).

Component 4: Project Management

        This component provided financial and technical support for the GoR (i) to
establish the Project Management Unit to facilitate the implementation of the project
activities, and (ii) to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity for better project
management. The support was initially focused on the Ministry of Infrastructure which
led the eGovernment reform and on its implementation agency (RDB, former RITA).

Project Management: In addition to the operational costs for the project, eRwanda
supported the project staff training. The following is a list of courses that eRwanda staff
completed (Table 6).

Monitoring and evaluation in ICT program in KIST: In addition to the periodical data
collection for the M&E indicators, eRwanda supported setting-up a new M&E course in
the Kigali Institute of Science Technology (KIST). The project funded the purchase of
equipment for the “M&E Lab?- a classroom equipped with 20 PCs connected to a LAN
and printer, one projector, textbooks and some reference books on project monitoring and
evaluation, and consultancy service to develop the curriculum. The curriculum of this
course consists of two parts: methodological course work and field trip. Given that the
number of PCs in M&E Lab is limited and the course is extremely popular among young
students, only the top 20 students are allowed to participate in the field survey and

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

        The key objective of the project was to improve (i) the efficiency and
effectiveness of some internal processes of the Government of Rwanda, and (ii) the
delivery of services in selected key sectors including better access to information through
the use of technology.

        In recent years, many studies have attempted to quantify the economic and
financial impacts of eGovernment projects. Because of the nature of the public sector, it
is not always easy to measure the impact of eGovernment (e.g., diverse IT system design,
support for public goods, etc.) 48. No specific economic and financial analysis was carried
out at the time of the project appraisal. This ICR adapted the methodology of Bhatia et al.
(2009) and analyzed the impact of the project by defining expected benefits for
eGovernment service users. The analysis for the public institutions that implemented
eGovernment applications was initially considered but rejected because of insufficient
transaction volume data. The performance measures and indicators for the eRwanda
project is defined in Table 9. The data was collected from repeated surveys in 2008
(mid-term) and 2010 (end-term).

(1) Cost of accessing service consists of two key indicators: travel time to service
delivery sites and time saved to identify the location of service counter.
• Travel time. This model only uses the travel time from the users home to the service
    delivery sites (District Offices, Telecenters) as a proxy for the accessibility cost.
    Public transportation service in rural areas is underdeveloped, and according to the
    survey results, the majority of people (45.5 percent) accessed service centers by foot.
    In 2010, 26.2 percent of the people took between a quarter hour and a half hour to get
    to the service centers (Figure 7). This is a significant improvement from 2008 survey
    in which the largest proportion of people (31.3 percent) spent at least an hour to an
    hour and a half to access to the service centers (Figure 7).

•      Time saved to identify the location of service counter. This key indicator identifies
       how much total time (minutes) that a client stated was spent to identify the service
       delivery counter of his/her interest. Comparison data from the non-project areas and
       the project areas (i.e., the eRwanda implemented District Office LANs and
       telecenters) was collected and compared for 2008 and 2010. The data in 2010
       indicates that people in non-project areas spent almost twice the amount of time than
       people in project areas to identify the location of their service delivery counter of
       interest (Figure 8). Furthermore, the time required to locate the service delivery
       counter of interest in project areas was 5 minutes less in 2010 compared to2008.

•      The 2 indicators (travel time to service centers and time to identify service counters)
       reduced the cost of accessing services from 2008 to 2010 in the project areas. The
       eRwanda project set up government websites (central and district offices) and
       implemented telecenters where people could access various services and resources
       through the Internet. The systems and services implemented by the project reduced
       the cost of accessing services.

(2) Quality of service was measured by two key indicators: outcomes at service delivery
sites; and user perceptions of service quality.

Outcomes at service delivery center. This indicator measured the consequences of
transactions at service delivery centers. In 2010, three quarters of the total service
requests were resolved within one or two transactions and almost half of service requests
(47.2 percent) were resolved in a single transaction. Even though in 2010 the number of
requests that were resolved in a single transaction slightly lower than 2008, the number
of unsolved requests in 2008 (20 percent) declined in 2010 to 12 percent (Figure 9)

•   Overall the outcomes at the service delivery counters improved in 2010 compared to
    2008. Comparison data between the eRwanda project area and non-project area was
    also collected in 2010. The results show the service centers in the eRwanda project
    area processed the citizens’ requests more promptly than non-project area. For
    example, the rate of requests processed within two transactions in the project area was
    70 percent compared to 50 percent in non-project area. In addition, almost twice as
    many users in the non-project areas, compared to the users in project areas, reported
    that the outcome of their transaction did not resolve and they would have to return to
    the service center again (Figure 10). Conclusively, there was a significant
    improvement in service quality and efficiency in the project area.

•     User perception of service quality: Four user satisfaction indicators were collected in
      the surveys: (i) satisfaction of the results of service center visit; (ii) satisfaction of
      customer service; (iii) satisfaction of service delivery speed; and (iv) general
      satisfaction of government service delivery. The data was collected in 2008 and 2010.
      Comparison data between the eRwanda project area and non-project area was
      collected in 2010.

            (i) Satisfaction of the results of service center visit. This indicator measured
                the degree of satisfaction of the results that people obtained at service centers.
                In 2010, approximately 70 percent of the project area users were satisfied with
                the result from their visit to service centers, which is a 7 percent increase from
                the 2008 survey (Figure 11). In 2010, responses from the project area were
                more positive than the ones from non-project area. In the non-project area,


                                                                    52
           Project area users were very satisfied two times more than the non-project
           area users.. In the non-project area, more than one-third of users were either
           dissatisfied or very dissatisfied, which was almost two times the number of
           dissatisfied or very dissatisfied users in the project area. (Figure 12).

            number of users who were satisfied (“very satisfied? and “satisfied?)
            increased in 2010 compared to 2008. In 2010, approximately 80 percent of
            project area users were satisfied with customer service (Figure 13). The
            satisfaction rate of customer service in the project area was overall higher
            compared to the non-project area. There was twice the number of “very
            satisfied users in the project area, compared to the non-project area (Figure
            14).

       (iii) Satisfaction of service delivery. This indicator measured users’ satisfaction
            of the speed of service delivered at service centers. Similar to the indicator
            number (ii), the number of responses as satisfied (?very satisfied? and
            “satisfied?) in the project area rose in 2010 (Figure 15). Especially, the
            responses of “satisfied? increased by 17.5 percent, and the responses of
            “dissatisfied? dropped from 12 percent in 2008 to 3 percent in 2010 (Figure
            3.9). Responses from the project area observed very low dissatisfaction rate
            (i.e., 3 percent for “dissatisfied? and 1 percent for “very dissatisfied?) in 2010.
            In contrast, 14 percent of the users in the non-project area were “dissatisfied?
            with the speed of service delivery and 4 percent of them responded as “very
            dissatisfied? (Figure 16).

       (iv) Source: RDB. General satisfaction of government service delivery. This
            indicator measured users’ perception of overall government service delivery.
            In 2010, approximately 80 percent of citizens in the project area were satisfied
            with government service delivery, which was a significant growth compared
            to 2008 (Figure 17). Several activities, such as government IT system
            integration and eGovernment applications implemented by the eRwanda
            project, were responsible for this improvement. Compared to the responses
            from non-project area, the rate of satisfied answers (i.e., “very satisfied? or
            “satisfied?) were almost the same, however, there were higher “dissatisfied?
            responses observed in non-project area (Figure 18).

The survey results demonstrated the quality and speed of service in the project area had
improved over the project period. The data suggests the eRwanda project lowered travel
cost to access service centers and increased user satisfaction compared to the non-project
area. Therefore this analysis concludes that the eRwanda project has made a significant
impact on improving efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery to citizens
through streamlined ICT platforms.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Background
Two large-scale groundbreaking user surveys were conducted in 14 districts and 17
ministries 49 during the project implementation period led by the eRwanda team with
partnership with KIST. A baseline survey (Mid-term) was conducted in October 2008. A
follow-up survey (End-term) was conducted in October 2010 to measure the progress.
The objectives of the survey were:
    • Benchmark the existing ICT infrastructure and applications usage and distribution
        in government institutions
    • Assess the public service delivery performance at Government institutions
    • Assess the awareness of eGovernance among Rwandan citizens
    • Benchmark the level of citizen’s access to Information and public services

The questionnaires included: public service delivery performance, user perception, user
usage, and user satisfaction of telecenters, and user satisfaction of e-services
implemented by the project. The data was collected through: (i) exit surveys at public
service offices, (ii) household questionnaires, and (iii) interviews at work places.
The questionnaires were prepared and distributed in two languages (English and
Kinyarwanda). Qualified Computer Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT)
major students from KIST participated in the interviews, and data analysis (17 students
participated in the 2008 survey, and 45 students participated in the 2010 survey).

     •   The 2008 survey: collected 2,809 responses (58% male and 42% female).
     •   The 2010 survey: collected 3,394 responses (55% male and 45% female).

The responses were tabulated by target groups, and presented in the summary reports.
The survey results were used to generate part of the M&E indicators and Economic and
Financial Analysis (see Annex 3).

Results
In 2008 survey:
    • Overall 61.6% of respondents were satisfied with the speed of service delivery,
       while 65% were satisfied with the customer care at the service centers and 68.3%
       were satisfied with the general delivery of government services.
    • In terms of citizen’s access to information and public services, the major means of
       transportation to access were on foot 52.3% and by taxi/motorcycle 23.9%. On
       average the majority of people (31.3%) spent at least one and a half hours to
       access their nearest service centers.


49
   The eRwanda project had engaged in all 17 Government ministries, and 12 districts and several Public institutions
on various ICT for development projects that include setting up of ICT infrastructure, applications development and
reinforcing human resource capacity. Survey areas included 2 non-project districts. Sample size and framework were
determined following the sampling over time methodology (Sapsford and Jupp, 2006).


                                                         60
   •   In terms of computer use, as a proxy of assessing the availability of necessary
       access infrastructure, 11% of peopled responded they had computers at home
       while 27% people responded that they used computers at their work place.
   •   With regard to the easiness to access ICT, 56% people responded that it was easy
       for them to access the necessary ICT and media. Mobile phones had the highest
       score for the most accessible ICT with 70% percent positive responses. Fixed line
       and Internet access had the lowest score. 80% of people responded those were the
       least accessible ICT.
   •   Regarding awareness of telecenters, only 36.7% acknowledged awareness of
       telecenters and what kind of information and services were available at telecenters,
       while 80.9% were positive that availability of telecenters would be of great help
       to the local communities.
   •   Regarding awareness of eGovernment, only 29% of the respondents
       acknowledged awareness of accessing services electronically of which only 17%
       people responded that they had used electronic services such as on-line banking,
       etc.

In 2010 survey:
    • Overall 81% of respondents were satisfied with the speed of service delivery,
       while 80.8% were satisfied with the customer care at the service centers and
       80.6% were satisfied with the general delivery of government services. These
       findings indicated increments of 15.8%, 19.4% and 12.3% in citizens’ satisfaction
       with customer care, speed and general service delivery respectively from the 2008
       survey.
    • In terms of citizen’s access to information and public services, the major means of
       transportation to access were on foot 45.5% and by taxi/motorcycle 21.2%, and
       on average the majority of people (26.2%) spent between 45 minutes and an hour
       to access their closest service centers, it was over 13% improvement from the
       2008 survey.
    • In terms of computer use, as a proxy of assessing the availability of necessary
       access infrastructure, 17% of people responded they had computers at home while
       23% people responded that they used computers at their work place.
    • With regard to the easiness to access ICT, 36% people responded that it was easy
       for them to access the necessary ICT and media. It was 20% decline from the
       2008 survey, although any specific reason was not mentioned in the summary
       report. Mobile phones had the highest score for the most accessible ICT with
       91% percent positive responses. Fixed line and Internet access had the lowest
       score. 80% of people responded those were the least accessible ICT. It was no
       change from the 2008 survey.
    • Regarding awareness of telecenters, only 56% (20% increased from the 2008
       survey) acknowledged awareness of telecenters and what kind of information and
       services were available at these info-access points, while 76% were positive that
       availability of telecenters would be of great help to the local communities. (It was
       slightly declined from the 2008 survey, although no specific reason was
       mentioned in the summery report.)
