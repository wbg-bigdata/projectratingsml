REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT

donors. 'The substantial assistance received from these sources is likely to
be sufficient to finance most of the cost of restoring the system to pre-
1971 levels.  Two seconded Bank staff members with the United Nations High
Level Consultants' Mission under Ambassador Erna Sailer which visited Bangla-
desh in March 1972 assessed the damage to the system and estimated what was
required to restore satiSfactory operation. In the light of their conclu-
sions, some items for the telecommunications sector have been included among
the items eligible for financing under the proposed IDA reconstruction im-
ports credit.
6.        The newly established Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Depart-
ment has made rapid progress in restoring service. The Government is
anxious to press ahead with urgently needed development and has requested
the Association to reactivate the earlier telecommunications project within
the territory of Bangladesh. The expenditures eligible for IDA financing
under the first telecommunications project in what is now the territory of
Bangladesh amount to approximately US $7.3 million, which is the amount of
the proposed new credit and consequently the amount by which Credit No.
1h5-PAK would be reduced. This amount is made up of US $2.1 million which
had been disbursed for goods and services already supplied to the former
East wing prior to the suspension of disbursements in December 1971, US $0.1
million required for the payment of retention monies in respect of those
goods and services, and US $5.1 million for payments to be made on account
of contracts awarded by the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department for
equipment and supplies which have still to be delivered (see paragraph 9
below).
7.        The corresponding reduction in the amount of Credit No. 145-PAK
would be effected by notionally repaying from the proposed new credit to Bangla-
desh, and thus debiting Bangladesh with, the US $2.1 million disbursed from
Credit No. 145-PAK against former East wing expenditures prior to the suspension
of disbursements, and by cancelling US $5.2 million of the undisbursed balance
of Credit No. 145-PAK, being the amount of the expenditures which were intended
to be made in the East wing and will now be made within Bangladesh. Except for
the reduction in principal amount and a corresponding modification of the descrip-
tion of the project, Credit No. 145-PAK will remain in force as originally approved.
8.        A technical note, dated October 31, 1972, attached hereto as
Annex III, describes the present status of the Bangladesh portion of the
telecommunications program. As the note explains, the need to carry out the
main, elements of the program is even greater now than it was when it was
first approved by the Association. Because of the recent changes in currency
values, the amount of the proposed credit will not be sufficient to carry out
all parts of the original project, and therefore a few less urgent items have
been excluded in the new project.  It was considered whether the amount of
the proposed credit should be increased from funds not pr6viously committed
to Pakistan, but the Government of Bangladesh decided to arrange the necessary
foreign exchange from other sources or, failing that, to defer these less
urgent items for the time being.
9.        The specific works to be included in the project are the installa-
tion of microwave systems between Dacca, Mymensingh and Bogra, and between
Dacca and Sylhet, and the installation of coaxial cable systems between Kushtia,



- 3 -
Natore and Rajshahi and between Bogra and Rangpur, as well as the provision
of multiplex equipment.  Dacca is the capital of the new nation, and the
other towns mentioned are important population, administration and business
centers. Contracts for the imported equipment for these links were awarded
in 1971 by the Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department, and partially
executed, though no deliveries have taken place. The Government and the
suppliers are presently negotiating the transfer of these contracts to
Bangladesh at the original contract prices; since the contracts are expressed
in Japanese Yen, the US dollar equivalent now is somewhat higher. Neverthe-
less, assumption by Bangladesh of these contracts, which were awarded after
international competitive bidding, would be advantageous since it would avoid
renewed bidding, which would take time and almost certainly result in higher
prices. Two short microwave/coaxial cable sections included in these
contracts are among the less important items which will be financed from
other sources, or deferred.
10.       The total estimated cost of the project proposed for IDA financing
-- including those goods and services which have been received in Dacca
previously, at a value of US $2.2 million -- is US $12.1 million, including
US $7.3 million in foreign exchange. The proposed credit would thus cover
the full foreign exchange requirements of the reduced project, but none of
the local currency expenditures. The proceeds of the credit would be relent
by the Government to the Bangladesh T & T Department; the local funds
required to carry out the project will be made available by the Government.
11.       The project will be executed by the Bangladesh T & T Department.
This Department had to be built up after independence since prior to that all
headquarters functions of the all-Pakistan T & T Department were centralized
in Karachi. The Government of Bangladesh is fully aware that the new depart-
ment has to be strengthened as quickly as possible; it will shortly submit
to the Association a program of action designed to ensure that the Bangladesh
T & T Department will be in a position to operate its facilities effectively,
and in accordance with sound financial and management principles. The objec-
tives sought by the financial covenants of the original credit agreement
remain unchanged; however, the covenants of the proposed new agreement, in-
cluding a provision dealing with the terms of the relending to the T & T
Department, are framed in more general terms until specific determinations
can be made pursuant to the Government's program of action. The Association
will closely observe the action taken by the Government toward this objective.
12.       The proposed project is economically sound and properly integrated
into the overall development of the country's telecommunications sector. The
waiting list for new telephones is expanding rapidly, and the volume of
long distance telephone traffic has, where facilities exist, been growing at
about 27 percent per annum. The proposed project will provide added traffic
capacity at a substantially improved quality of service, and promises a rate
of return of at least 36 percent on the capital invested.

Procurement:
International tendering procedures under the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement have already been followed and orders for the equipment
have been placed. Government has confizued that Bangladesh is prepared
to take over these contracts; this should enable the equipment to be
supplied quickly without the need for new bids. This will also ensure



rapid disbllrseent of the credit as shown in Annex 5.
Rate of Return
The rate of return on the least profitable route was calculated
at about 36% in the original project.

PROJECT SI3MARY AND TECHNICAL NOTE ON TELEOO)MUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUJKARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        There is an immediate need in Bangladesh not only to restore
communications damaged during hostilities but also to undertake development
which has been interrupted after March 1971. The previous IDA projects
form a suitable basis for this development.
ii.       In the previous IDA Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK an estimated
US$11.3 million was expected to be used for development in Bangladesh;
equipaent to the value of US$2.2 million has been delivered and it is now
proposed to allocate a further US$5.1 million (representing clearly
identifiable items cancelled from the IDA Credits to Pakistan) making a
total of US$7.3 million for development in Bangladesh. Goods to the value
of US$2.8 million which were intended for use in Bangladesh have since been
used in Pakistan. The Balance of US$1.2 million represents goods which are
not readily identifiable.
iii.      The development which can be undertaken under the proposed IDA
Credit is necessarily lizited by the amount available to the most urgent
parts of the original project.  These consist of the microwave and coaxial
cable systems linking Dacca with Sylhet, Mymensingh, Bogra, Rajehahi and
Rangpur.
iv.       Procurement would be by taking over existing contracts entered
into under Credit 145-PAK after international bidding following IDA procure-
ment procedures. The equipment has in part been manufactured.
v.        On the basis of the agreement reached with the Bangladesh
Government on the points set out in section 7.01 of this report the project
is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$7.3 million equivalent.
Vi.       This report has been prepared in Washington based on information
gathered by the Bank staff who participated in the UN Mission for relief
and rehabilitation which visited Bangladesh in March 1972. Because of the
special circunstances in Bangladesh the information available is limited
and must in some respects be treated as tentative. A mission will visit
Bangladesh later this month to obtain additional information, coordinate
the various proposals for rehabilitation and development and discuss
arrangements for the execution of the project.

BANGLADESH TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT
PROJECT SUMMARY AND TECHNICAL NOTE ON TELEBOCUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      Historically, development of communication facilities in Pakistan
had been limited and had largely been concentrated in urban areas so that in
consequence East Pakistan with over half the population had only 29% of the
telephones.
1.02      Prior to the formation of Bangladesh a telecommunications program,
financed by IDA. Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK and bilateral credits, was being
carried out to meet some of the urgent requirements of Pakistan including
the eastern province, now Bangladesh. A telecommunications subproject for a
cyclone warning system had also been appraised for an IDA operation.
1.03      However, from March 1971 onwards, dcue to the serious disturbances
and subsequent hostilities, the operations of Pakistan Telegraph and Tele-
phone Department (PTT) in Bangladesh were disrupted, the expansion projects
were held up and many of the then existing assets destroyed.
1.04      A Bank team visited Bangladesh in March 1972 as part of a UN mission
and reported (Sailer report) on the urgent tasks, recommending essentially
that the facilities destroyed during the March-December 1971 period should be
restored as part of the UN effort and that the work of expansion covered in
the IDA and other projects should be resumed when funds became available. The
UN has accepted the mission's recommendations and has received offers from
donor countries for the urgent rehabilitation work.  The implementation in
physical tenms is only in its early stages.
1.05      This report reviewing the status of the projects and assessing
immediate requirements has been prepared in Washington by Mr. C. R. Dickenson
and Mr. B. Johnsson who participated in the UN mission. Because of the
special circumstances in Bangladesh the information available is limited and
must in some respects be treated as tentative. It is the intention to
arrange for a mission at an early date to obtain additional information,
coordinate the various proposals for rehabilitation and development and
discuss arrangements for the execution of the project. In addition, at an
appropriate time within the next six months, a second mission will discuss
with the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department (BTT) and Government
the timetable for changes in organization and setting up a new accounting
system (see paragraphs 5.03 and 6.02).

2.   THE SETOR
Organization
2.01      Before separation from Pakistan in December 1971 the headquarters
for telecommunications services including management, accounting, planning
and procurement functions, was located in West Pakistan.  The administrative
center for operations in the eastern province was located at Dacca with
authority for the day-to-day operations of the region vested in the Regional
Director.
2.02      Since independence BTT has been placed under the control of the
Ministry of Communications. One of its immendiate tasks in converting from
a regional to a full headquarters organization is setting up adequate
accounting, planning, procurement and international services sections.
Further aspects of this reorganization are discussed in sections 5 and 6 of*

2.03      The development of telecommmnications facilities in what is now
Bangladesh was well below the average for developing countries with only
0.07 telephones per hundred population. The long-distance network was based
on VHF radio and open-wire lines. Service to West Pakistan and international
services were provided by HF radio. The long-distance and international
services were overloaded and the,quality of transmission poor. Many of these
meager facilities were further disrupted or destroyed during the March-
December' 71 period (see para. 2.09 and 2.10 below).
Proposals for Development and Improvement Prior to December, 1971
2.o4      Major proposals for telecommunications development were included
in the Pakistan Third and Fburth Five-Year Development Plans (1966-75). The
foreign exchange cost of these proposals was to be financed through IDA and
through bilateral sources. Local costs were to be met from internally
generated funds. The part of these proposals relating to East Pakistan
allowed for an increase in telephone subscribers connections from 37,000 to
109,000, the provision of an adequate long-distance network, improved
international facilities and extension of service in rural areas. The
estimated cost of the goods and equipment to be purchased under the credits
for development in East Pakistan was US$11.3 million.  Further details are
given in Annex 1.
2.05      At the time hostilities commenced, due largely to delays in
procurement, very little progress had been made with the IDA-financed
projects and actual achievements were restricted to the installation of an
additional 24,000 subscribers connections and minor extension of service in
rural areas. Goods and equipment to the value of US$2.2 million have been



-3-
delivered to East Pakistan and other goods to the value of US$2.8 million were
redirected to West Pakistan. The bala'nce of the total amount of US$11.3
million is made up of clearly identifiable items costing US$5.1 million
and goods not readily identifiable costing US$1.2 million. Further details
including the procurement and disbursement position are set out in Annex 2.
2.06      Bilaterally financed microwave systems linking Dacca-Khulna-Chalna
were commissioned during the hostilities and installation and commissioning
of a system Dacca-Chittagong was nearing completion. Both of these links
were damaged during the conflict (paras. 2.09 and 2.10).
2.07      Following the 1970 cyclone, proposals for improvement of meteoro-
logical communications and provision of a radio network serving police posts
in cyclone threatened areas were included in an IDA cyclone relief project
which has not yet been implemented.
2.08      As part of the Development Plan two factories, one located at Dacca
and manufacturing telecommunication equipment and the other at Khulna making
cables, were set up. These were partly financed by Siemens of Germany, but
majority ownership was vested in Government. Further details are given in
Annex 3.
Destruction of Telecommunications During March-December 1971 Hostilities
2.09      During the hostilities demolitions took place at a number of focal
points where microwave and exchange equipment was damaged or destroyed; there
were also many cuts in the open-wire network and many cases of damage and
theft of equipment. However, most of the main telephone exchanges and radio
stations escaped major damage.
2.10      Temporary restoration of the open-wire circuits has been effected,
as has also the restoration of most of the VHF radio systems and small manual
exchanges. The remaining major points of damage are at Hajiganj where the
microwave relay station in the Dacca-Chittagong link was demolished; at Khulna
where the local exchange, trunk exchange, telex exchange and -the microwave
terminals on the Dacca-Khulna and Khulna-Chalna links were demolished and
Jaidebpur where the HF receiving station, which included a microwave terminal
working to Dacca,; was blown up.

3.   THE PROGRA AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      The program which can be undertaken is dependent on the available
funds. These are not sufficient to carry out all the desirable rehabilita-
tion, improvement and expansion of the network and at this stage the program
must be restricted to those high priority works which can make the most
impact within the period July 1, 1972 to June 30, 1975.
3.02      A program has been prepared based on the above considerations.  It
falls essentially under four headings:
'(a) Rehabilitation and restoration of the network to its pre-March 1971
status, as proposed by the UN mission, utilizing funds from donor
countries. Priority should be given to the restoration of the
microwave systems linking Dacca to Chittagong, Khulna, Chalna and
Jaidebpur and the HF receiving station at Jaidebpur. (These works
involve relatively minor expenditures estimated at US$450,000 and
are of vital importance to the economy).
(b)  Completion of the projects financed under IDA Credits 145-PAK and
186-PAK. The funds which can be made available through cancel-
lations will not meet the total foreign exchange requirements and
the items to _be financed under the proposed credit will consist of
the most urgently required long-distance systems. The possiblity
of obtaining bilateral finance for completing the other parts of the-
project is being pursued independently.  Of these deferred7'items the
earl completion of the Hajiganj-Coimilia long-distance link should
be given priority.
(c) Provision of the Cyclone Warning Network for the coastal area
under a separate IDA credit. This project includes a mi:crowave system
Chittagong-C&x's Bazaar.               '
(d) Other urgent bilateral projects such as the satellite ground
station, for which financing should be sought.
Annex 7 gives full details of the program which might, assuming bilateral
finance is available, cost Taka 370.1 million (US$51.0 million) with a foreign
exchange component equivalent to Taka 213.9 million (US$29.5 million).
The Project
3.03      The project proposed for Association financing under this credit
consists of the provision of microwave systems Dacca-Sylhet and Dacca-
tymensingh-Bogra and coaxial systems Kushtia-Nator-Rajshahi and Bogra-Rangpur.
Orders have been placed for this equipment by PTT but they will now have to be



-5-
assumed by BTT. The suppliers are understood to be prepared to accept the
original contract prices. The credit would also include the amounts
disbursed and retention payments for items delivered to East Pakistan prior
to December 1971. The original proposals under Credit IL5-PAX also allowed
for coaxial cable sections between Nator-Bogra and Comilla-Hajiganj. Due
to the effects of ch&nges in currency parities and because IDA funds for
additional expenditures are at this stage limited td US$5.1 2nillion, it has
been necessary to defer the Nator-Bogra section and deal separately with
the Comilla-Hajiganj section. The map shows details of the proposals.
Cost of the Project
3.04      The estimated cost of the project is Taka 87.7 million (US$12.1
miillion) including a foreign exchange canponent of US$7.3 million and is
suna.rized below:

No contingency provision is proposed in view of the fact that it is intended
to take over ftrm orders which have already been placed. Government has
confirmed that the necessary local funds will be made available for implemen-
tation of the project.



- 6-
Procurement and Disbursenment
3.05      International tendering procedures under the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement have already been followed and orders for the equipment
have been placed. Government has confirmed that Bangladesh is prepared
to take over these contracts; this should enable the equipment to be
supplied quickly without the need for new bids. This wili also ensure
rapid disbursement of the credit as shown in Annex 5.
Fxecution
3.06      Assistance will be given by manufacturers installers in the
execution of the project and should enable BTT to complete it without
difficulty.  The timetable for revised deliveries and the commnissioning
of the systems will have to be worked out by BTT with the suppliers at
the time of finalizing the arrangements for taking over the contracts.
3.07      Additionally in or~der to assist in the rehabilitation program
and the early stages of planning to meet the longer term requ±rements,
BTT has already obtained through the ITU the services of a project manager
and is also seeking assistance in obtaining experts in training, planning
and international operating procecdures and arrangements. Assistance has
also been sought through Siemens for experts to assist in the operation of
the cable and telephone equipment factories.



-7-
4.   JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.ol      Telecommunications services primarily serve business and Government
subscribers and while the number of telephones has been gaining at about 10%
per annum, long-distance traffic has, where facilities exist, been growing at
about 27% per annum. The long-distance network in Bangladesh is now seriously
overloaded and delays of many hours in obtaining a call are normal on most
routes.  The quality of the service, which is based on open-wire lines and
obsolescent VHF equipment is also very poor. Restoration of the microwave
systems Dacca-Chittagong and Dacca-Khulna-Chalna will provide ani adequate
quantity of circuits giving good quality transmission to areas south and
west of Dacca. Communications to the north of the capital can only be
improved when the three main artery routes provided for under the project
are brought into use.
4.02      The system capacities proposed under the project have been based
on a detailed analysis of the requirements on individual routes made in
connection with the original credit and still remain valid. The systems
designs were based on present value cost studies of engineering alternatives
and are the optimum solution. The rate of return on the least profitable
route was calculated at about 36%.



-8-
§. FINANCE
5.01        The previous regional headquarters in Dacca was responsible for
the day-to-day operations of the region; local accounting functions had been
decentralized to the various divisional headquarters. The present position
is believed to be that the accounts maintained in B  headquarters in Dacca
are essentially a record of cash transactions; cash collections are paid to
the Government consolidated fund and expenditures are charged against that
fund. Control of these expenditures is vested in the Accountant General.
5.02        While the funds needed to meet the local expenditures for the pro-
grams will, on the basis of the present financial structure, have to be provided
from the consolidated fund, it is desirable to have some idea of the viability
of BTE operating as a separate entity and to know to what degtee, if any,
financing by Government might be necessary to carry out the program. Using
infornation frm a recent supervision nission and statistical records for
E;ast and West Pakistan, a notional operating statement (Annei 6) has been.
prepared for BTT for the year ending June 30, 1972. This tentative analysis
shows that using the net surplus and depreciation provisions, and provided
no payment on equity is made to Government, an estimated Taka 4S8.4 million
(US$6.7 million) should be available annually to meet local expenditures for
rehabilitation and development. This would more than meet estimated require-
ments of local funds for the prject and even of the program as set out in a
tentative financing plan attached as Annex 7.
5.03      Although the objectives of financial covenants set forth under
Credit 145-PAX remain appropriate for Bangladesh, it has been agreed by the
Goverment and the Association that it is premature to refoMulate them for
the proposed Credit, in recognition of the fact that the Bangladesh T&T
Department is only now being organized. However, general covenants acknowl-
edging the objectives of the previous covenants have been agreed while the
details wuill be discussed and agreed between the Government and the
Association at the appropriate time in the future.  The timetable for
setting up a conrnercial accounting system will be agreed and letters exchanged
at a later date; similarly the application of a rate of return on fixed
assets, debt service coverage and payments on Govermnent equity investment
will all be discussed and details agreed to when the accounting system has
been set up, actual financial results are known, an evaluation of fixed
assets has been carried out and the debt position established.

6.   THE BENEFICIARY
6.01      BTT as a previous region of the Pakistan P&T Department suffers
from some of the organizational weaknesses which led the Association, as a
condition for the first telecomunications credit, to require reorganization
of the Department and the setting up of a modern accounting system with the
assistance of consultants. At the same time BTT must also strengthen its
organization to cover all functions of a full national headquarters.
6.02      The Minister of Communications has indicated Government's intention
of setting up a satisfactory organization for BTT. This would give the chief
executive adequate financial responsibility for the operation of the depart-
ment and the control of its finances within the limits of the parliamentary
budget system or such other system of overall governmental control as is
consistent with the constitution of Bangladesh. It has been agreed with the
Bangladesh Government that a program acceptable to Government and the Associa-
tion,designed to insure that BTT shall be in a position to operate its services
effectively on the basis of sound financial and management principles,will be
implemented according to a timietable to be agreed with the Association. The
Association will review the position during supervision missions with a view
to ensuring that the organization which is decided upon is introduced and
developed along suitable,lines.

7.   RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreement has been reached with the Bangladesh Government on the
following principal points:
(a) BTT will be allowed to retain or will have made available to it
the necessary local funds to execute the project (para. 3.04);
(b) the Bangladesh Government is prepared to take over the contracts
for the proposed microwave and coaxial cable systems (para. 3.05);
(c)  the Bangladesh Government will on the basis of a timetable to be
agreed with the Association ensure that BTT introduces an effective
accounting system and applies proper financial controls (para. 5.03);
(d)  a satisfactory organization for BTT will be introduced according to
a program to be agreed with the Association (para. 6.02).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$7.3 million.

Bangladesh Component of Pakistan Development Program
1.        The Pakistan Telecommunications Development Program for the period
July 1968 - June 1972 included the following works in Bangladesh:
(a)  the addition of 72,000 telephones (out of a total of 175,000);
(b) provision of subscriber long-distance dialing facilities to
13 main automatic exchanges;
(c) the expansion of the trunk network and provision of adequate
protection against breakdown for the main line routes, using
modern microwave and coaxial cable techniques; the systems provi-
sions allowed for were Dacca-Chittagong, Dacca-Khulna-Chalna,
Chittagong-Barisol-Khulna, Dacca-Sylhet, Dacca-Mymensing and
Kushtia-Rajshahi-Bogra-Rangpur;
(d) the extension of public call office (PCO) facilities to 200
towns and villages in ru.ral areas;
(e) provision of a satellite ground station to improve communication
between the two wings of Pakistan;
(f) improvement of existing High Frequency (HF) radio facilities;
(g) extension and improvement of the telegraph and telex networks;
(h) employment of consultants to recommend and assist in the
reorganization of the Region and of PTT as a whole.
The two IDA projects together are comprised of parts of items (a), (c),
(d) and (h) above.
2.        An IDA credit of US$16 million was approved in 1969 to help finance
these proposals.  The first project gave some emphasis to the developtent of
communications in East Pakistan and provided for microwave and coaxial cable
systems between Dacca-Sylhet, Dacca-Dymensingh, and Kushtia-Nator-Bogra-
Rajshahi-Rangpur; interim extensions to the HF international/interwing
facilities; extension of the local cable networks in the cities and provision
of service to 200 public call offices (PCOs) located at police posts. The
second IDA Credit (186-PAK) of US$15 million was approved in 1970 to further
extend facilities in both East and West Pakistan. Out of a total sum of
US$31 million provided under the two credits, it is estimated that US$11.3
million was to be expended in what was then East Pakistan.

3.        The development of additional long-distance facilities (Dacca-
Kushtia-Khulna-Chalna and Dacca-Chittagong) was separately provided for
under bilateral credits.
4.        A Canadian International Development Agency credit was obtained
to finance satellite ground stations designed to improve and extend both
interwing and international communications facilities.
5.        Negotiations were in hand in March 1971 for bilateral financing
of the Chittagong-Barisal-Khulna system.
6.        Equipment for local and long-distance switching, subscribers
apparatus and teleprinters was being produced in the local factories.

Progress Made on Projects in Bangladesh
Financed under Credits 145-PAK and 186-PAK
1.        The cable financed under the first credit had been delivered,
certain of the local network extensions completed and about 24,000 of the
scheduled 72,000 subscribers lines connected. Orders had been placed for
the long-distance systems and equipment was in course of manufacture for
the microwave systems serving Sylhet and Mymensingh. HF radio equipment
for the interim extension of international and interwing facilities had been
delivered and partly installed. While the majority of the wire required for
the PCO network had been delivered, delays in placing the order for pole
materials had held up work execution and only 48 of the 200 PCO's had been
provided. The associated schedule shows the financial provisions, commit-
ments made and disbursements under the credits.
2.        The line wire for the PCO provisions may have in part been used
for restoration of other circuits, some may also have been stolen. AUl
pole materials providAd. for under the first credit and cable under the
second credit have been redirected to West Pakistan. HF radio equip-
ment consisting of two lincompex terminals has also been redirected to
West Pakistan.

BANGLADESH
BANGLADESH TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT
Telecommbnications Factories
1.        There are two factories manufacturing telecommunication materials
in Bangladesh: Telephone Industries Corporation (TIC) in Dacca and Cable
Industries (CI) in Khulna, both were set up in cooperation with and financed
in part by Siemens of Germany, with majority ownership vested in the Govern-
ment.
2.        Construction of buildings and installation of machinery was com-
pleted in mid-1970 and the production started in both factories in the fall
of the same year. During the hostilities in 1971, the operations of both
factories were interrupted but no damage was caused to buildings or machi-
nery.
3.        The Telephone Industries Corporation, TIC, was designed to produce
30,000 telephone sets and 20,000 telephone exchange lines of Siemens' EMD-type
equipment per year. Only 40% of the component parts for assembly of switch-
ing equipment were to be produced by the factory, the rest were to be delivered
from West Pakistan or Germany. The production of additional component parts
in the factory is now planned in order to compensate for the loss of supplies
from West Pakistan but it will still be necessary to import some parts and
components in the future. The production of telephone sets has not yet
started.
4.        A visit to the factory was made by the Bank team which formed part
of the Sailer Mission in March, 1972. Production was limited to the few
items of switching equipment for which piece parts were available; due to
lack of many items it was not possible to meet an order for any complete
installation.  The stocks of parts were also very low.  The total number of
workers and penmanent staff was 520.
5.        The Cable Industries, CI, in Khulna is equipped for the production
of plastic insulated indoor and outdoor cables needed for the provision of
20,000 local exchange lines per year. There are ample space and facilities
for further expansion of the factory; the production can be doubled by
installation of a second production line.
6.        The production in CI in March 1972 comprised only outdoor cables.
The stock of raw materials was then:
Polyethylene for nine months production
Copper for 24 months production
Steel band for six months production
No manufacture of indoor cables was going on due to shortage of PVC-plastic
and tin. The number of workers and permanent staff was 140.

BANGLADESH TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT
The Program-(1972-75)
1.        The program consists of four groups of work as follows:
Rehabilitation and Restoration Proposals (UN Project)
(a) The proposals include the following:
i. Restoration of the Dacca-Chittagong microwave system. With
the possibility of some delay in'restoring and commissioning
this system a temporary tropospheric scatter system was
allowed for between Dacca and Chittagong. This will probably
not now be needed;
ii. restoration of the Dacca-Khulna-Chalna microwave system;
iii.restoration of the Jaidebpur HF receiving station and micro-
wave system;
iv. provision of HF and VHF emergency networks;
v.  restoration of the Khulna Telephone and Telex exchanges.
vi. completing on a permanent basis the restoration of other
installations and plant damaged during the war.
(b) The estimated total cost of the rehabilitation proposals, including
an emergency radio network, was US$2.98 million out of which
US$o.43 million was for restoration of the railway and civil
aviation networks.
(c) Following a recent survey a UN telecommunications expert has
estimated that the cost of the rehabilitation proposals will
increase from US$2.98 million to US$4.50 million. This figure,
however, includes the tropospheric scatter system and provisions
which go beyond the immediate rehabilitation proposals as formu-
lated by the original mission. Funds to the total amount of
US$4.50 million are understood to be available from donor countries.
Of this amount it is estimated that US$0.26 million will be avail-
able for local expenditures.
The IDA Projects
Due to the effects of changes in currency parities and limiting
additional IDA funds to US$5.1 million for new works it has been necessary
to defer certain of the provisions and concentrate on the more urgently
required items. The project items under (a) below describe the urgent
works to form the IDA project; other items are given at (b) to be taken up
when financing arrangements become available.



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 4 pages
(a)  The project proposed for Association financing would consist of
the uncompleted works covering the provision of microwave systems
Dacca-Sylhet and Dacca-Mjymensingh-Bogra and coaxial systems Kushtia-
Nator-Rajshahi and Bogra-Rangpur for all of which orders have been
olaced. The Credit 145-PAK project also included coaxial cable
sections between Nator-Bogra and Comilla-Hajiganj. The Nator-Bogra
section was provided to give an alternative route and can be defer-
red for some years. The Comilla-Hajiganj section is important for
meeting traffic needs and should be provided as soon as funds are
available. The credit would also include for administrative pur-
poses, amounts disbursed and retention payments for cable, line
plant materials and HF radio equipment already delivered to East
Pakistan prior to December 1971. The estimated cost of the project
proposals is Taka 87.7 million (US$12.1 million) with a foreign
exchange component of US$7.3 million. These figures do not include
previous local expenditures for duties and installation in respect
of equipment to the value of US$2.2 million which has already been
delivered.
(b)  Other items in the IDA projects for which financing is not available
are:
i.   Completion of the HF International Radio Facilities involving
replacement of two radio terminals redirected to West Pakistan.
ii. Connection of the balance of 152 PCOs for which materials have,
in part, been redirected to West Pakistan.
iii. Connection of the additional 48,000 subscribers for which cable
and line plant materials have been redirected to West Pakistan
(components are also necessary for local manufacture of 22,000
lines of switching equipment).
T'he Cyclone Warning Network
(a)  This project has been rev4sed by BTT to reduce the number of PCOs
to 100 and to include a microwave system from Chittagong to Cox's
Bazaar.
(b)  Credit No. 339-BN of US$25 million for the Coastal Area Rehabilitation
and Cyclone Protection Project includes US$6.4 million to finance the
foreign exchange cost and part of the local cost of this project. The
project is estimated to cost Taka 83.4 million (US$11.5 million) with a
foreign exchange component equivalent to Taka 35.8 million (US$4.9 million).
Other Schemes Under Bilateral Projects
(a) The items for which bilateral financing was originally proposed and
should if possible be obtained are:
i.   Supply of components for manufacture of the balance of 22,000
lines of switching equipment.
ii.  Provision of trunk switching equipment for STD working at 13
main switching centers.
