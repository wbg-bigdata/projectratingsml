1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal of Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), India’s
urban population was growing and expected to increase from the 2002 level of 300
million to 410 million by 2010. The role of cities in the national economy was increasing,
and the share of urban Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over national total had grown
from 50 percent in the early 1990s to 60 percent in 2000. However, urban growth was
also accompanied by a shift of poverty concentration from rural to urban areas. In 2002,
about 70 million urban residents, accounting 23 percent of the total urban population,
lived below the national poverty line.

2.      The Indian urban transport sector was unprepared to face the issues
accompanying rapid urbanization, namely: insufficient and inefficient public transport,
fast motorization growth, heavy traffic congestion, poor road network and traffic safety,
high transport-related pollution and above all very weak institutional arrangement to
coordinate the work of government agencies within each metropolitan region.
Furthermore, funding of the sector was insufficient. Urban infrastructure was primarily
funded through budgetary support from the state budget and to a much lesser extent, local
governments through their Five Year Plans. The private sector was not active in the
sector in part due to lack of clear policy support and regulatory environment, as well as
long gestation period and the massive size of capital investments.

3.     Government’s Strategy: In 1998 the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment
(MUAE) endorsed a report entitled "Traffic and Transportation Policies and Strategies in
Urban Areas in India", which reflected the current strategic thinking of the Union
Government on urban transport issues. The Ministry of Urban Development (the
successor to MUAE) adopted several of the key recommendations as their policy and
decided to grant aid to cities which were ready to follow the policy. In a pioneer step in
the country’s sector, the State Government of Maharashtra (GoM) accepted such
conditions to improve the urban transport sector in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region
(MMR).

4.      Urbanization, Land Use and Transport System: MMR had a population of 14
million and an area of 1,467 sq. km. Its population was forecast to grow to 22 million by
2011. As the commercial and financial center of India, MMR generated about five
percent of national GDP and contributed over one-third of India's tax revenues. At the
center of MMR lies the City of Mumbai on an 18 km long peninsula running generally
north to south. At the southern tip is the "island city" where the Central Business District
(CBD) is located. This is a dominant employment center. The urban transport network is
linear in a north-south direction along the peninsula, and there are very little east-west
road links. Two suburban rail services and the three urban arterial roads were the
backbones of MMR's transport system. Cross road links were less developed. The streets
in most parts of Mumbai city were old and narrow, and their capacity was seriously



                                             1
reduced by lack of adequate maintenance and appropriate management of traffic and
parking. Public transport plays a dominant role in MMR. Rail and bus services combined
carried 88 percent of the region's motorized personal trips. The suburban rail services
carried a total of over six million passengers per day. Buses carried over 4.5 million
passengers per day, 60 percent of whom transfer to rail.

Strategy: Responsibilities for the general direction of urban development and urban
transport rested with the GoM through the Department of Urban Development and the
Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), a regional agency in
charge of land development and associated infrastructure services. To assess future travel
demand and assist in policy formulation, a Comprehensive Transport Study (CTS) was
carried out in 1994 under the auspices of MMRDA with Bank assistance. The objective
was to develop a coherent transport strategy for 2011 linked with a rational land use plan.
By 2011, motorized travel demand (and private car trips) were forecasted to increase by
50 percent over 1994 levels, with little change in mode share (excluding walking) for
public transport (85 percent compared with 88 percent). The CTS considered four
alternative strategies to meet the future travel demand: a "do minimum" strategy and
three investment options. The investment options included two rail based options
(comprising combinations of enhancement of existing corridors and construction of new
corridors) and one road oriented option. All strategies were evaluated using economic,
social, environmental, and performance criteria. The preferred strategy and a related short
term implementation plan were then developed. The preferred strategy was to strengthen
the public transportation system and put in place appropriate demand management
measures in congested parts of MMR like the island city of Mumbai.

6.      The GoM and Indian Railways (IR), Ministry of Railways accepted the general
recommendations of the CTS strategy. CTS also evaluated and recommended a number
of investment and policy actions for implementation. The priority actions included: (a)
suburban rail capacity expansion; (b) improving east-west connectivity; (c) better parking
controls and traffic demand management; and (d) improved road safety. The highest
priority issues in Mumbai to be addressed by MUTP relate to the capacity and speed of
rail services; decision making for rail services; and resettlement and rehabilitation
(including land acquisition). The next priorities were east-west connectivity, traffic
management, and road safety. Equally important issues, but of a lower priority, included
bus services, pollution from motor vehicles, road maintenance, involvement of
stakeholders, institutional and financing framework.

7.     Capacity and Speed of Rail Services: Rail passengers suffered from some of the
most severe overcrowding in the world (with 9 car trains carrying over 5,000 passengers
at 16 persons per square meter against a normal capacity of 1,800) due to lack of track
capacity, lack of trains etc. Squatter settlements near the rail right-of-way safety zone,
and encroachers within it, seriously reduced train speeds, increased travel time, limited
capacity and hampered track maintenance work. The fares for suburban rail service in
Mumbai are among the lowest in the world on a passenger-km basis.




                                            2
8.      Decision making for Suburban Rail Services: Since the planning and provision
of suburban rail services are the responsibility of IR, MMRDA had little influence over
them. The allocation of resources for rail services is subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission and IR. Two zonal railways, Western Railway (WR) and Central
Railway (CR), operate within MMR as separate agencies with their own lines and no
integration of services. These arrangements limited the responsiveness of the suburban
rail system to users, as well as the participation of the state and city governments in the
decision making process. During project preparation, the Mumbai Railway Vikas
Corporation (MRVC), jointly owned by IR and GoM, was established to implement
suburban rail improvement projects in MMR. A separate business and operating plan,
including separation of costs for the suburban railway system, was developed with Bank
assistance. The project design supported these initiatives to bring decision making for the
suburban rail system closer to users and local authorities and to get the suburban railway
system in Mumbai seen as a distinct business, with adequate funding. Setting up of
MRVC was also considered as a first step towards eventual separation of the suburban
services from main line operation.

9.      Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R): Most
infrastructure projects in MMR involve acquisition of land and consequently
displacement of people, including residential and commercial squatters. Prior to MUTP,
the state government did not have R&R policy and had limited institutional capacity for
handling R&R matters. For MUTP, the planning for R&R measures started during
preparation with a consultative process for developing a resettlement policy for the
project. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) were engaged to assist in resettlement
planning and to support implementation in view of their close engagement with slum
communities in Mumbai. Given the large number of Project Affected Persons (PAP) to
be relocated, the team initially considered to undertake the resettlement activity as a
separate project. However, in order to align the resettlement activities with the civil
works in an efficient manner, the resettlement activities were included in the project as a
key component. This component of the project supported measures to improve the policy
framework, institutional and implementation arrangements for R&R, as well as funding
R&R activities. At Appraisal, the project was estimated to affect 19,228 households
including both residential and commercial units.

10.    Road Transport Issues in MMR: East-west road links were not well developed,
and that limited the functionality of the overall primary road system. CTS recommended
improving these as a priority action. In addition, the road system in Mumbai suffered
from a lack of application of basic traffic management measures. The planning and
implementation of traffic management schemes was a responsibility of Municipal
Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). However the Traffic Management Unit
(TMU) in MCGM had only just been re-established at project appraisal, and had little
technical capacity for this important task without having Area Traffic Control (ATC) or
operational manuals. The bus services within Mumbai were provided by a municipal
company, the bus division of the Brihan Mumbai Electric Supply and Transport
Undertaking (BEST). BEST is considered to operate a good quality service when
compared with similar undertakings in India with over 95 percent fleet utilization.



                                            3
However, operating cost/km was high and cost recovery was around 80 percent
(including provision for capital investment and depreciation). BEST bus operations were
cross-subsidized by revenues from its electricity distribution business. Its management
recognized the problems and prepared (at the Bank's request) a five year Business Plan,
including measures to improve efficiency and reduce its costs as an operator. It instituted
a series of cost-reduction measures, including "wet leasing" (bus with driver) or gross
cost contracting out (BEST conductor collects the revenue) of bus operations and a
Voluntary Redundancy Scheme (VRS). The project included Technical Assistance (TA)
to assist BEST in developing and implementing these and other reform measures. The
BEST bus fleet was aging and while existing buses were not gross polluters, emission
levels were higher than desired standards. There was a need to develop a new generation
of urban buses to better meet user needs and higher emission standards.

11.     Pollution: Air quality in Mumbai is generally poor. Air quality monitoring
showed that oxides of nitrogen (NOx) exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) at certain road junctions. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and
Particulate Matter (PM) less than 10 microns in size (PM 10) exceeded NAAQS at almost
all residential and industrial locations and at road junctions. Motor vehicle emissions
were estimated to be responsible for 70 percent of this pollution, however no systematic
study existed. Existing vehicle emission standards were poorly enforced. In response to a
Public Interest Litigation in December 1999, Bombay High Court had constituted a
committee under the chairmanship of the Transport Commissioner to recommend
measures for reducing urban air pollution in Mumbai.

12.    Road maintenance: Within Mumbai, road maintenance rests with MCGM. Some
of the arterials through the city are maintained by the PWD. About 6.5 percent to 7
percent of the total budget and expenditure of MCGM is for operating and maintaining
roads, bridges and traffic management. Based on rough estimates for preparation of a
report for quantifying road user charges it was estimated that budget provision by
MCGM corresponded to about 5 percent of actual needs. MCGM lacked modern
computer-based tools for maintenance planning and budgeting.

13.      Institutional Weaknesses: It is not uncommon in a mega-city like Mumbai that
many institutions are involved in urban transport. The central issue is that the
responsibilities assigned to different agencies did not seem to effectively respond to the
changing needs, and the mechanism for multi-agency coordination was weak. The
institutional mechanisms for implementing the integrated CTS policies still needed to be
developed.

14.     Involvement of stakeholders: Mumbai has an active media and a vibrant civil
society representing groups across the income spectrum. NGOs were able to contribute to
effective consultation with the affected squatters living in slums. However, such
interaction with NGOs was limited as the borrower had no established mechanism for
engaging with CSOs and citizen groups on a sustained basis. The project authorities
eventually recognized the scope for a deeper involvement of NGOs in implementation,
monitoring and evaluation (M&E).



                                            4
15.    Funding: Funding arrangements for urban transport infrastructure and services in
Mumbai are split between a number of national, state and local government agencies. No
single agency had the role or responsibility for preparing integrated investment and
operations budgets which meet travel demands and policy objectives, optimize the use of
scarce resources, and are affordable. Overall levels of investment had been lagging
demand (most notably on the railways).

16.     Project Rationale: Transport development in a mega-city such as Mumbai is a
complex, multi-faceted, continuous and long-term process. CTS’ recommended strategy
and priority actions provided the framework for the design of this project. However, it
was not possible for either the Bank or the Mumbai authorities to tackle all the issues in
five years or in a single project. Decisions based on professional and value judgments had
to be made. The project addressed, to varying extents, most of the key sector issues and
the critical areas where actions needed to be initiated. It was particularly designed to
support the urgently needed physical investments in the rail and road system, and to
strengthen the institutional capacities required for sustainable transport development,
particularly in traffic management, the bus system, road safety, emission control and
R&R. The project was seen by the Borrower and the Bank, as the first in a series of loans
through which the Bank would support transport and institutional development in a
programmatic manner. The timing and volume of future loans would be based on
evaluation of impacts of the project and the commitment of the counterpart agencies
involved.

1.2 Original PDO and Key Indicators (as approved)

17.     The PDO was to facilitate urban economic growth and improve quality of life by
fostering the development of an efficient and sustainable urban transport system
including effective institutions in MMR.

18.      Key performance indicators: The achievement of the project development
objective were measured through the ability of the project to (a) meet user needs; (b)
improve system efficiency; (c) bring about sustainable improvements; and (d) make
institutions more effective. The key performance indicators for these project-specific
objectives were: (a) rail travel comfort, substantially improved; incidence and severity of
pedestrian traffic accidents reduced; (b) suburban rail service frequency and train
availability enhanced; road journey times and junction delays reduced; (c) improvement
in public transport cost recovery; poor households resettled satisfactorily from hazardous
slum/squatter areas to permanent housing with improved living condition; and (d)
increased technical capacity for planning, traffic management, road safety, road
maintenance, air quality monitoring and vehicle emission control. (See Section F of Data
Sheet)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

19.      The PDO was not revised. The values of the Key Indicators were formally
revised, however, during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of October 17, 2005, and in the
2008 Project Restructuring to reflect the slow progress, elimination of some of the
activities and to adjust them to better reflect the implementation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

21.     A summary of the main components of the project, together with their costs, are
listed below. A detailed description by component is presented in Section F of Data
Sheet.

      (a) Rail Transport (US$ 654.30 million): This component aims to improve the
      capacity and performance of the suburban rail system through service efficiency
      improvements, (increasing existing track capacity, Direct Current (DC) to Alternating
      Current (AC) conversion, improving signaling, electrical and telecommunication
      systems), procurement of new rolling stock and upgrading of existing rolling stock,
      and expanding network capacity. The component would also support studies and TA,
      amongst other things, to improve the maintenance capabilities of IR for their railway
      tracks and rolling stock, the (FM) and control systems, the railway safety and Quality
      Assurance systems.



                                                     6
   (b) Road-based Transport (US$ 183.00 million): This component will support
   increases in the capacity, efficiency and safety of the road network, better facilities
   for pedestrians, improvements to the operating efficiency and quality of bus services,
   and reductions in motor vehicle emission levels. It will also strengthen the capacity of
   the responsible agencies to plan, deliver, maintain and operate efficiently road based
   urban transport infrastructure and services. Subcomponents will: (i) support traffic
   management programs including ATC to optimize the functioning of traffic signals,
   pedestrian facilities, Station Area Traffic Improvement Schemes (SATIS) and parking
   control; (ii) increase the road network functionality by improving two east-west link
   roads and eliminating the main road level crossings across railway tracks; (iii)
   improve the bus system through support of organizational reforms, efficiency
   measures and procurement of environment and user friendly buses; and (iv)
   strengthen the capacity of transport agencies in Mumbai in road in traffic
   management, road maintenance, road safety, and communication, and air quality
   monitoring as well as providing TA for updating of the CTS, review of User Charges,
   and developing a Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy (MVECS).

   (c) Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R&R) (US$ 100 million): This component will
   enable GoM to undertake the timely implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan
   (RAP) and resettle those affected by investments under the rail and road based
   transport components. It will also provide assistance to those displaced to improve
   their overall living standards. This component is to be financed through IDA funding.
   It will provide for the procurement of about 19,200 housing units and shops to resettle
   PAHs. In response to the Bombay High Court Order to relocate encroachers on the
   Harbor Line by March 2001, actions were taken under agreed procedures, with the
   expectation by GoM of retroactive financing from the Bank. Actions taken before the
   start of the project included: (a) Already built houses had been purchased to
   permanently resettle 3,935 PAHs; (b) 6,125 transit houses had been built as an
   interim measure to provide transit accommodation for around three years; and (c) 107
   petty shopkeepers were also offered alternative shops in the new sites to re-establish
   their lost shops. The other expenses under this component include the acquisition of a
   limited amount of land for civil works, reconstruction of some of the basic civic
   amenities for the left over population and payment of compensation for increased
   distance to work place and permanent loss of livelihood opportunities. The TA under
   this component includes consultancies for baseline surveys, preparation of
   Resettlement Implementation Plans (RIP), supervision consultants, NGO support for
   implementation, and training of project staff/NGOs involved with the
   implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

22.     Revisions were made to the project components at the request of the Borrower. As
a result of project restructuring of 2008, some of the subcomponents were dropped and a
few added. The main revisions are summarized below:




                                            7
23.     Rail Component: (a) The track laying related to the addition of a 5th line on the
Western Railway corridor between Santa-Cruz and Mahim was dropped and the scope of
the project was limited to off-line works; (b) Modification of the Harbor Line flyover at
Mahim was dropped. These activities are not financed by the Bank, but from counterpart
funding.

24.     Road Component: (a) SATIS was dropped. Six of them were included in the
original scope and had been reduced to four at MTR because of cost increases. These
schemes were still at the design stage; (b) Three ROBs that were meant to facilitate the
elimination of level crossings along the Western and the Central Railway corridors were
dropped. No construction works had yet been started for these facilities; (c) The number
of PGSS was reduced from six to two (retained from the original 26 foreseen at the
outset). The construction works for two of the deleted PGSS, which had significantly
started, were stopped and the original condition of safety was restored; (d) Provision for
traffic management improvements developed as part of the TA to TMU of MCGM was
dropped. This activity had not started; (e) Assistance to be given to the traffic police to
strengthen the accident recording system and black spot improvement scheme was
dropped. This activity had not started; (f) TA to be given to the Transport
Commissioner’s office for vehicular emission control was dropped; (g) Installation of an
efficiency monitoring system (EMS) in all buses was added. It consists of procuring
additional bus equipment intended to improve the efficiency of the fleet of BEST; and (h)
Procurement of a Management Information System (MIS) for the operation of BEST
transport department was also added.

25.    R&R Component: Buildings that had been procured but will not be used to
house project affected people were dropped. GoM reimbursed to MUTP IDA Credit the
funds provided for procurement of these buildings. The remaining balance of IDA after
disbursement for the activities planned as part of the R&R Component estimated at about
US$23 million, including the amount freed up by the reimbursement related to the unused
buildings, which is estimated at INR 310 million, i.e. US$8 million or SDR 5 million.
US$23 million of the available IDA balance was to be used to finance activities under the
Rail Component and the remaining balance for other eligible activities. The Borrower
was to reimburse to IDA the amount of INR 310 million corresponding to the
construction cost of the buildings dropped from the project. This reimbursement was to
be effected before the same amount is made available by IDA for the rail activities and
before December 31, 2008.

1.7 Other significant changes

26.     Inspection Panel and Temporary Suspension of the Road and R&R
components: Following several complaints by project affected persons to the World
Bank’s Inspection Panel in 2004 the Panel, authorized by the Bank’s Board, undertook an
inspection of MUTP (see also paragraphs 49 - 52). On March 28, 2006, the Executive
Directors discussed the findings of the Inspection Panel’s Investigation Report and the
Management Report and Recommendations on MUTP. The Board endorsed the
Management Report’s Action Plan that had been prepared in close consultation with



                                            8
GoM and requested a periodical update on progress made in its implementation. At the
beginning of March 2006, Management had suspended funding of two components (Road
and R&R) of the project, in light of concerns regarding the equitable R&R of the people
affected by the road component.

27.     The GoM substantially met the Bank’s conditions to address the outstanding
issues, and the suspension was lifted on June 29, 2006. One condition, completion of
negotiations with the Santa-Cruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) shopkeepers, was waived
because: (a) the RIP for SCLR, including a satisfactory set of procedures for negotiation,
had been finalized and disclosed; (b) negotiations had started; and (c) further extension of
the suspension might have given shopkeepers unrealistic expectations of extensive
rehabilitation beyond the set of alternatives agreed upon between the Bank and the GoM.
However, Management informed the Borrower that it would maintain active supervision
of the project and that it might have to seek remedies, including suspension of the balance
of the loan, if resettlement activities were not carried out in conformity with the agreed
procedures. Bank Management presented to the Board five progress reports on the
implementation of the Action Plan with the last one submitted in November 2011. The
progress reports noted that MMRDA had made noteworthy progress in reaching
mutually-acceptable and compliant solutions with the shopkeepers and recorded the clear
progress made on a number of management indicators related to: shifting of shopkeepers,
registration of cooperative housing societies of the PAP, issuance of identity cards to
PAPs, transfer of community facilities to cooperative societies and strengthening
MMRDA’s management capacity by filling up key staff positions and outsourcing
technical expertise for resettlement-related activities, and the efficient management of
post-resettlement support activities including housing management training, and
livelihood support for the resettled PAPs. The report also noted that the Independent
Monitoring Panel (IMP) had been playing an important role in contributing to better
outcomes, monitoring, and quality assurance.

28.     Project Restructuring in 2008: On March 10, 2008, GoM submitted a request to
restructure MUTP and extend the closing date. This request was transmitted to the Bank
by the national government on March 31, 2008. After analysis of the request, the Project
Agreement had a “second order restructuring? without changing the PDO. The proposed
changes aimed at establishing a more realistic implementation schedule for the remainder
of the project taking into account the reduced scope that can be financed by the IBRD
loan as a result of the appreciation of the Indian Rupee compared to the US dollar.
Progress had been slow in all components and most of the activities would require an
extension of the implementation period beyond what is an acceptable extension of project
closing date. Instead, the restructuring focused on the project activities that are critical for
the achievement of the PDO and provided additional emphasis to complete the activities
and ensure relevant outcomes within the extended period of the loan/credit. An interim
extension for three months, from June 30, 2008 to September 30, 2008, was made to
allow sufficient time to finalize the restructuring process, and the loan restructuring was
approved by the Board on September 30, 2008, to extend the period by 15 months to
December 31, 2009. Two additional extensions were granted on December 30, 2009 and




                                               9
June 15, 2010 making the final closing date at June 15, 2011, and a minor restructuring
was approved on April 26, 2011 cancelling a small part of the IDA credit

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29.     Project quality at entry was moderately satisfactory for the reasons described
below:
    (a) The background analysis that supported the project design was solid because it
    was fully aligned with the FY02-04 Country Strategy by supporting its main pillars:
    equity, sustainability, competitiveness, and sound macro-economic management. It
    was also aligned with the GoM’s strategy for the sector and the priorities established
    in the CTS study for MMR. More specifically, the Project supported the infrastructure
    investments and policy reforms required to improve the level-of-service offered to
    public transport users, increase traffic safety and management, strengthen institutions
    involved in the sector thereby contributing to economic growth and poverty
    alleviation by improving accessibility of low-income segments of the population to
    jobs, educational and health facilities.

   (b) The project incorporated in its design the lessons from several Bank-financed
   projects in urban transport in India, Brazil (where similar programs were underway)
   and elsewhere, such as the need to include institutional strengthening, institutional
   coordination, creating an enabling environment for private sector participation in the
   sector, fostering design and continuous updating of long-term integrated urban
   transport, land use and air quality strategies for MMR and ensuring adequate training
   and TA to increase the likelihood of sustainability of the proposed investments and
   policy reforms.

   (c) The project team worked hard during preparation to ensure that the different
   levels of government were committed to the Project and, the team was partly
   responsible for the creation of MRVC, a pioneer milestone in India’s urban rail sector.
   Project preparation appropriately recognized that successful project implementation
   required extensive coordination of the several institutions involved in the project.
   However, the Project Appraisal Document might have underestimated the high
   cumulative risks faced when so many institutions from different levels of government
   are involved in project implementation under the umbrella of a nascent institution
   (MMRDA) which required probably more time to mature and be fully in charge of
   the project. Also the implementation delays due to the huge number of people to be
   relocated and procurement-related issues appear to have also been underestimated.
   Nevertheless, these risks are unavoidable in a metropolitan region with multiple
   agencies responsible for the transport sector and large concentration of people and
   businesses. Therefore, the risks can be mitigated only during implementation, leading
   to the delays experienced in the road component.




                                            10
   (d) The project was otherwise solidly conceived from a technical standpoint. Several
   project alternatives were considered and the reasons for their rejection were clearly
   spelled out. Amongst the project alternatives analyzed were : (i) project scope, by
   evaluating the best priorities set out in the 1994 CTS; (ii) size of project was
   discussed to find the most adequate package of investments to attack the most
   pressing needs but recognizing that there would be much more to do in the sector;
   (iii) R&R matters on whether they should or should not have been included in the
   project or treated separately; (iv) selection of rail schemes that would maximize
   ridership and increase level-of-service and safety; (v)selection of road schemes that
   would maximize east-west connectivity; (vi) reform of rail operations, particularly the
   options to make MRVC as autonomous as possible from IR; (vii) reform of bus
   operations by considering options to improve BEST level-of-service and cost
   efficiency; (viii) Air Quality Management options to design a strategy and monitor air
   quality; and (ix) the options and timing for the creation of a Mumbai Metropolitan
   Transport Authority

30.     A broad variety of risks were evaluated during project preparation and appropriate
mitigation measures were considered, among the most important:

   (a) Delays in the procurement of consultants, contractors and suppliers: This was
   mitigated by ensuring that procurement plans prepared were realistic and bid
   documents for first year project components were already prepared and close
   monitoring of the procurement process. Despite all these mitigation measures
   procurement both in the rail and road components was often protracted either because
   Bank guidelines were not well known or because of changes requested by the
   implementation agencies which were not in line with the guidelines; or in other cases
   such as MRVC because of the very long process of procurement clearance which
   involved several levels of IR up to the Minister’s office;

   (b) Delays in the transfer of funds from GoM and IR to MMRDA and MRVC: The
   adequate funds flow was agreed at negotiations and this seems to have been
   satisfactory;

   (c) Delayed delivery of quality works, services and equipment: Use of independent
   engineers and supervision consultants to review and audit quality of works and work
   program. This mitigatory measure was insufficient to ensure quality particularly at
   MCGM;

   (d) Weak cooperation of several agencies involved: The mitigation measure was the
   creation of a high-powered Steering Committee and a Project Coordinating
   Committee (PCC). In retrospect, this was not enough and maybe would have worked
   better if MMRDA had been supported by a full time Project Management Oversight
   Consultant as later was done for the SCLR;

   (e) Non commitment of IR to agree action plans: The mitigatory action was the
   creation of MRVC as an implementing agency for the rail component. This was



                                           11
   clearly not enough because MRVC could not approve major projects without
   clearances from all levels of IR and the process was fraught with delays and
   disagreements;

   (f) Risks which were overlooked were project costs and time overruns due to several
   reasons, such as delays, and currency fluctuation; lack of capacity and empowerment
   of MMRDA to manage aggressively all the components and takeover any component
   such as the road component when MCGM and Maharashtra State Road Development
   Corporation (MSRDC) were not delivering. Finally, although efforts were made to
   have the first year program ready by project appraisal, the risks of poor coordination
   of engineering design and R&R, and the risk of weak project engineering design were
   possibly underestimated.

31.     On balance, the quality at entry is judged as moderately satisfactory because some
of the risks were underestimated, although as mentioned above, they were unavoidable.

2.2 Implementation

32.     The Board approved the Loan and Credit for MUTP on June 18, 2002 for US$463
million and SDR 62.5million respectively, equivalent to US$542 million. The loan
became effective on November 6, 2002. A MTR was held on October 17, 2005 and a
“second order? restructuring of the project was approved on September 30, 2008. As
mentioned above, Management suspended temporarily the road and R&R components on
March 2006 and after a thorough Inspection Panel investigation, the suspension was
lifted on June 2006. The original closing date was June 30, 2008 and the actual closing
date was June 15, 2011, therefore roughly 3 years later than originally planned. The DO
was only once considered unsatisfactory in 2006 but the IP was unsatisfactory or
moderately unsatisfactory from 2006 to 2008, when the restructuring took place. Since
the restructuring and the lifting of the suspension, the IP rating has been moderately
satisfactory.

33.     During the 2006-2008, the Project at Risk status applied. The MTR was very
thorough and resulted in very specific recommendations for action by GoM. There was
no Quality of Supervision Assessment by QAG. The main implementation problems
faced by the project were: (a) Long delays in the procurement process particularly in the
rail component which delayed the availability of the new trains and the conversion of DC
to AC; (b) Weak coordination between road engineering design and the R&R component
which affected both the JVLR and the SCLR road links, particularly the latter which was
not concluded at project closure; (c) Lack of a project management oversight consultant
at MMRDA level capable of quickly identify potential delays, weak implementation links
and assistance to MMRDA on how to deal with the issues at a higher level; (d) Inability
of MRVC or IR to use the “empowered committee? status to simplify procurement
process of the rail component and make quicker decisions; and (e) inefficient project
engineering design by outside consultants who often overlooked important aspects such
as the proper identification of utility networks, thereby choosing the wrong construction
methods.



                                           12
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.     M&E Design: Achievement of the PDO was measured through the ability of the
project to (a) meet user needs; (b) improve system efficiency; (c) bring about sustainable
improvements; and (d) make institutions more effective. The key performance indicators
for these project-specific objectives were: (a) rail travel comfort substantially improved;
incidence and severity of pedestrian traffic accidents reduced; (b) suburban rail service
frequency and train availability enhanced; road journey times and junction delays
reduced; (c) improvement in public transport cost recovery; poor households resettled
satisfactorily from hazardous slum/squatter areas to permanent housing with improved
living conditions; and (d) increased technical capacity for planning, traffic management,
road safety, road maintenance, air quality monitoring and vehicle emission control.
Annex 2 provides a summary of these output indicators by subcomponent and Section F
of the Datasheet aggregates them into the three components of the project.

35.    M&E Implementation and Utilization: The Project team appropriately used the
physical and financial output indicators to supervise the progress of the works and the
delivery of equipment. To measure the institutional development progress and
compliance with related covenants, the semi-annual monitoring reports included useful
updates on the progress of the studies and TA financed by the project. The ISRs were
timely and the main ones included a comprehensive aide-memoire as an attachment, and
they systematically reported on the M&E indicators to support recommendations or
inform management decision making.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Procurement

36.     The project closed with a moderately satisfactory rating on procurement
implementation. The procurement component was well designed and supervised but the
capacity of some of the implementing agencies involved adequately to follow
procurement process schedule and clearance deadlines agreed at appraisal caused some
delays. In some cases, the procurement processing agreements made at appraisal were not
followed. For example, the award decisions of several contracts were taken beyond the
agreed schedules. MRVC, as the major implementation entity in the project, was
delegated authority by Indian Railway to take procurement decisions for contracts up to a
value of Rs. 1,000 million (US$20 million). Most of the contracts except the one for the
procurement of Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) and kits were within the threshold of
the US$20 million. Bids within this limit were to be evaluated by a tender committee
consisting of 3 officers constituted by MRVC (empowered committee) and the
recommendations approved by the Director of the Corporation. MRVC had agreed on a
timetable for completion of the evaluation within 75 days of bid opening. In the case of
the Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) contract, valued over US$200 million, the bid
evaluation would be carried out by a committee of MRVC and Research Designs and
Standards Organization (RDSO) and forwarded to Indian Railway Board for review and



                                            13
approval of recommendations. MRVC/IR agreed on a timetable for completion of various
stages of the bid evaluation and award of contract to ensure that the contract would be
awarded within 150 days of bid opening. Unfortunately, most contracts including the
Procurement of EMU Rolling Stocks took much longer than the 75- 150 days. The EMU
contract got stuck because of disagreements with the supplier which took quite a long
time to resolve, despite clearances provided by the Bank, resulting in serious delays in
project completion. The time to complete the procurement processes were long and
affected the outcome of the project. They should have been corrected through high-level
communication between the high level officers of MMRDA and IR. Also, it seems that,
at times, lack of clarity on applying Bank guidelines being different from procurement
practices in IR had contributed to confusion, and requests were made that the Bank could
not approve, and in some cases led to mis-procurement.

37.      In the case of other agencies such as MCGM and MSRDC the procurement lead
times were also much higher than expected. In the case of the ATC procurement the
process had to be repeated because the first attempt was non-responsive and the second
took long due to anonymous complaints about the award which needed to be investigated.
Several procurement reviews of contracts without prior review were undertaken by the
team to ensure compliance with Bank guidelines. It appears that despite a well prepared
procurement plan and agreements made at appraisal, some of the major procurement that
started early enough could not be taken to conclusion due to cost considerations resulting
in inordinate delays in implementation. Subsequent procurement also got delayed
substantially as a result. In other areas, like the SCLR, work orders were given sometimes
before resettlement was completed and this resulted in delays to make available the work
zone to the contractor. Contracts Management potential was also an issue that contributed
to the large cost and time overruns in several cases.

2.4.2 Financial Management

38.     FM of the project was handled mainly by two agencies: MRVC (responsible for
the rail component) and MMRDA (responsible for the road component and R&R).
MMRDA also had the role of coordinating with MRVC and BEST, MCGM and
MSRDC. In terms of FM compliance, acceptable FM reports and annual project audit
reports were submitted regularly by both agencies and reviewed by the Bank. In some
cases, audit reports were submitted with delays resulting in temporary Statement of
Expenditure (SOE) based suspensions of disbursement of the road component.

39.    MRVC showed sufficient FM capacity except for some instances of
miscommunication with the Bank in respect of allocation of Special Commitment (SC)
payments between GoM and MoR and misunderstanding of general financial rules of the
Government of India (GoI) which required MRVC to deposit the rupee equivalent of SC
payments with Controller of Aid Accounts and Audit (CAAA) in time. The internal
controls in MRVC were strengthened by entity wide internal audit.




                                           14
40.     MMRDA struggled with FM issues early during project implementation, but
improved in the later part of the project. The root causes were (a) insufficient institutional
capacity in part due to the delay in appointing accounting professionals; (b) complex
funds flow mechanism which resulted in funds transfers between the implementing
agencies and book adjustments in order to apportion the funds and expenditure equally
between GoM and MoR; and (c) financial arrangements with participating executing
agencies (MCGM, BEST and MSRDC) which required timely and proper reconciliations.
MMRDA appointed an accounting professional towards project closing and also
intensified their efforts on FM with the Bank’s support.

41.    The Bank’s FM team played an active and hands-on role in training and guiding
the implementing agencies in the proper implementation of the Bank’s FM requirements.
The ISR rating moved between moderately satisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory (at
the time of SOE suspension), closing as moderately satisfactory.

2.4.3 Environmental Safeguards and Management

42.     The project closed with a moderately satisfactory performance on environmental
aspects due to the mixed performance from the implementing agencies to a well-thought-
out and balanced set activities that were expected to be implemented / supported under
the project.

43.     During project preparation it was determined that the activities triggered OP4.01
Environmental Assessment, OP4.04 Natural Habitats, and OP4.11 Cultural Resources.
The project envisaged a substantial thrust in improving air quality management in
Mumbai, in addition to protecting the mangrove habitat and management of construction
related adverse impacts, including safe working practices in congested urban settings.
Separate environmental management plans were prepared and adopted for each activity
and the project was selected for a Green Award for its treatment of environmental issues
in the preparation phase.

44.     For the Road Component, the deployment of environmental officers by the
Construction Supervision Consultants helped the contractors confirm the implementation
of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) aspects related to their works in a timely
manner for the initial phases. MMRDA and MSRDC were pragmatic in dealing with
short-comings and worked with the Contractor teams to ensure that key environmental
responsibilities were discharged in a timely manner, including taking extreme steps such
as removal of errant sub-contractors for tree plantation/transplantation. However, some
issues like the continued delay in monitoring of construction sites for air quality and
provision of adequate facilities for workers in contractors’ camps persisted during latter
half of project implementation. In particular, the removal of a batching plant which was
temporarily sanctioned for the project became an issue and the site continued to be used
by another contractor despite the original agreement on its removal following completion
of works in that stretch of the road. The tree transplantation from JVLR and by the
Railways received positive feedback even from local journalists and environmental
activists. The compensatory plantation for the mangroves and trees in lieu of those



                                             15
adversely impacted by the project has been successful to a considerable extent. For
instance, for JVLR I and III, out of the total of about 1,550 transplanted trees, over 1,400
survived, and out of the about 2,200 planted as compensation, the survival was just under
2,000 trees.

45.     For the Rail Component, MRVC benefited substantially from the capacity
building initiative on environmental aspects under the project and in addition to the
practical training for staff, the assignment also sensitized the organization to
environmental management issues. During implementation of MUTP, MRVC’s
management system has been separately confirmed to be adequate for ISO 14001
certification. MRVC was also successful in planting more than 12,000 mangroves.

46.      For R&R component, following the action plan agreed in response to the findings
of the Inspection Panel, a detailed monitoring mechanism for ensuring key environmental
facilities was implemented. Due to the proactive collaboration between its R&R and
Environmental Cell, MMRDA has confirmed that almost all the activities have been
implemented before the handover to MCGM began. In one temporary rehabilitation site
or transit camp in Mankhurd, the action plan implementation for compliance with the
Coastal Regulatory Zone notification with regard to the removal of toilet block within the
zone continued to be delayed due to the fact that the site is still utilized by MMRDA for
other projects.

47.     The use of environmental management capacity building consultants was quite
effective in parts where MRVC was involved, and where studies/pilots for MMRDA
were carried out. However, the continued augmentation of environmental management
capacity at MMRDA has been a challenge due to the multiple responsibilities handled by
Joint Project Director for Environment during the course of project implementation and
lack of support staff in the cell. MMRDA partially overcame this by deploying qualified
staff to the Environment Cell, but their frequent rotation/movement, as more interesting
opportunities were available to them, both within MMRDA and beyond, remained a
persistent issue. Procurement of 3 ambient air quality monitoring stations, which are to be
installed in the project influence area to support the development and operation of a
Mumbai-wide ambient air quality monitoring network, was also completed. The
noteworthy feature of this activity is the close collaboration between MMRDA and the
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, which would receive the data simultaneously and
share the costs of equipment in the operation and maintenance (O&M) period,
contributing to the sustainability of this activity.

2.4.4 Social Aspects

48.     At the time of appraisal in 2002, the magnitude of displacement triggered by
MUTP was unprecedented in an urban context in India. At the time of Appraisal, it
was estimated that the project would displace 19,228 households, or roughly 100,000
people, a majority of whom lived in informal settlements in challenging circumstances
along roads and railway tracks. In view of its size, it was initially planned to undertake
the resettlement activity as a separate project, however, it was retained as a component of



                                            16
MUTP in order for better alignment with civil works, In compliance with the Bank’s
Policies, the GoM adopted a project specific R&R policy to provide compensation and
assistance to the affected people. A project RAP summarizing the magnitude of
resettlement impacts on various socio-economic and land use categories, results of
baseline surveys, entitlement framework, and implementation arrangements including
grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation was prepared. Based on the RAP, specific
RIPs were prepared for each sub-project prior to undertaking civil work. Consultations
with the affected population groups were an important element in the process of planning
and designing the project. The affected communities were involved at different stages of
project preparation and implementation. A special Resettlement Cell was established
manned with professional staff and led by senior officer and services of NGOs long
engaged in urban slums hired to facilitate consultation with and participation of PAP
groups in R&R on an ongoing basis. A two stage grievance redress system was
established comprising representatives from the implementing agencies and NGOs with
IMP appointed for overall quality monitoring. Public Information Centers (PICs) were
established at the PMU (MMRDA) and at different project locations offering access to
key project documents and information brochures. These included key documents such as
RAP, RIP, other notifications, Implementation Manual and the list of eligible PAPs,
which were also disclosed on MMRDA’s web site. The Project was able to relocate
quickly over 6,000 households living along railway tracks with the help of community
mobilization support from NGOs. However, as the implementation progressed, the
client’s relative inexperience and the NGOs’ limited capacity stymied efficient
management of complexities associated with relocating large shopkeepers, land owners
and religious structures. (See Annex 8 for more details.)

49.     Requests for Inspection triggered by resettlement grievances. The
implementation of R&R, especially for the road projects, experienced delays due to
difficult situations on the ground. The Inspection Panel received four Requests for
Inspection submitted on behalf of several hundred residents and shopkeepers in 2004.
The Requests questioned: (a) adequacy of resettlement options and income restoration
opportunities provided in the MUTP R&R Policy, especially for shopkeepers; (b)
suitability and quality of resettlement sites; (c) poor housing and living conditions in the
resettlement sites; and (d) access to information, disclosure, consultation, and grievance
redress process.

50.     Panel Investigation. The Inspection Panel undertook an investigation and issued
its findings in its December 2005 Investigation Report and found areas of non-
compliance by the Bank with various aspects of its operational policies concerning
environmental assessment (OD 4.01), involuntary resettlement (OD 4.30), investment
lending-identification to Board presentation (OP/BP 10.00); economic evaluation (OP/BP
10.04), project supervision (OD/OP/BP 13.05), project appraisal (OMS 2.20) and the
Bank policy on disclosure.

51.    Management Report and Action Plan. Management in its Response prepared an
Action Plan to improve the quality and outcome of R&R implementation. The Action
Plan was included in the Management Report and Recommendation submitted to the



                                            17
Board and was discussed and approved by the Executive Directors on March 28, 2006.
The Action Plan focused on implementation issues, including the resettlement procedures
for shopkeepers with medium- and large-size shops, restoration of incomes, post-
resettlement services, baseline data, grievance redress mechanisms, and the quality of
supervision. The Board endorsed Management’s Action Plan, which was prepared in
close consultation with GoM, and agreed that an update report would be provided
periodically on progress made in its implementation. The Bank has been implementing
the Action Plan in collaboration with the Borrower, GoM, since March 2006.

52.     The Bank suspended disbursements in March 2006, in part due to concerns
regarding equitable resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs. The Bank and GoM
worked during the suspension period to resolve the issues raised by the Inspection Panel
and the suspension was lifted in June 2006 following implementation by the borrower of
a 10-Point Action Plan, which substantially addressed outstanding R&R issues. The few
instances of evictions, especially along SCLR, were resolved in a timely manner with
appropriate remedial measures. Several steps were taken to improve the quality of the
R&R process, including finalization and disclosure of implementation Manual, improved
data base management, disclosure of updated baseline surveys and RIPs prior to
relocation, regular implementation reporting, distribution of identity cards among the
PAPs, establishing procedures for relocating affected religious/ community structures
through negotiations, streamlining of the grievance redress committees, strengthening of
the post resettlement support to PAPs and reconstitution of IMP, which has effectively
monitored the resettlement activities.

53.     To date Management has submitted five progress reports on the
implementation of the Action Plan to the Board. The latest report submitted in
November, 2011, has confirmed that the measures listed in the Action Plan were for the
most part completed before the Project’s closing date of June 15, 2011 and recorded the
few remaining actions which include 40 shopkeepers, six residence and three religious
structures.

54.     There was a paradigm shift in the Approach to Resettlement Management
with Several Adjustments and Improvements in the Policy Procedures during
Project Implementation. The implementing agency substantially changed its approach
to resettlement after 2006 in order to break the deadlock with large shopkeepers, resident
land owners and custodians of religious/community structures. This involved several
steps including substantial readjustments in policy procedures; improvements in services
provided to the PAPs during and after relocation; and changes in implementation
management strategies. Some of the changes in policy procedures broadening
resettlement options beyond the MUTP R&R Policy include: (a) offering equal
alternative built up area to resident shop owners and acquiring land through
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU); (b) approving resettlement of large shopkeepers
and legal residents through private redevelopment schemes through negotiations between
PAPs and developers; (c) in situ resettlement of multi-storey residential buildings
providing almost double the existing floor area; (d) offering commercial/residential
tenements of equivalent area to displaced community facilities (schools, libraries, prayer
halls) in resettlement colonies through redevelopment; (e) provision of alternative
housing for squatters in host communities and construction assistance for relocating
religious structures; and (f) re-establishing grievance redress procedure with scope of
jurisdiction and time frame. New implementation procedures established include: (a)
procedure for resettling PAPs for sub-projects dropped from project scope as part of
restructuring; (b) procedure for resettlement of shopkeepers in the event of failure of
negotiations; (c) procedure for allowing retention of partially affected structures; (d) exit
strategy for handing over the resettlement buildings to the PAPs; and (e) consultation
with PAPs regarding relocation and Bank’s prior review of lists of people to be resettled
in order to ensure policy compliance.

55.     A central feature of the MUTP R&R process was measures taken to promote
self-management of resettlement buildings and sites by the PAPs. Services provided
to the PAPs in resettlement sites include: schools, health care/community center, roads
and street lights, water supply and transport, and drainage. The project authorities
provided mainstreaming support to the PAPs after relocation, enabling them to access
municipal services including health care, education, electricity, waste management,
public distribution systems, and citizen (voter) identity cards. The PAPs were relocated to
multi-storey buildings at several sites, which they will have to own and manage
collectively as a part of housing cooperatives. A post-resettlement support strategy was
prepared and implemented with the help of a professional consultant, emphasizing
registration of PAP housing cooperatives and provision of training and financial
assistance for ensuring their self management. The support provided for livelihood and
income activities through formation and training of women cooperatives has been
remarkable. Mechanisms were established to hear and address site specific and
complaints and issues.

56.      Overall, the quality of compliance in R&R improved considerably over the
life of the project and towards the latter part of project implementation, the focus of
technical support and monitoring gradually moved to strategic implementation
issues. The efforts by the Bank and the borrower in response to the R&R challenges led



                                             19
to a significant improvement in both MMRDA’s capacity and the R&R process, which is
now recognized in India and abroad for its innovative approach. During the course of this
project, MMRDA has created a permanent unit within MMRDA to manage the
resettlement impacts. MMRDA is successfully employing the approaches to R&R that
were developed under MUTP in subsequent infrastructure projects that require
resettlement.

2.5 Post completion operation/Next Phase.

57.    The vast majority of the components financed by the Project were
successfully completed. Components to improve railway services, road traffic
management programs and bus services have been essentially completed and operational
and maintained by respective agencies.

58.     The resettlement implementation is nearly completed. The remaining pending
actions include the relocation of the remaining shops and residences along SCLR and the
three religious structures (two along SCLR and one along JVLR); completion of a few
remaining land acquisition cases; integrating the resettlement sites into the urban service
network of the city and formally completing the Exit Strategy for the resettled PAP
cooperative societies. The Bank’s monitoring of these remaining R&R process has been
discussed with the borrower during the ICR mission and the process for implementation,
reporting and monitoring of the remaining activities was agreed upon.

59.     The project has assisted PAPs to improve their quality of life and work by
resettling nearly 19,000 households from squalid and dangerous environments to
new apartment blocks. The final number of families displaced by the project remained
more or less the same as estimated at the time of appraisal (only 0.86 percent higher)
indicating that the resettlement impacts were identified accurately at the outset. By
project closing date, resettlement implementation was nearly completed, with 19,348 of
the revised target of 19,394 households (99.8 percent) successfully resettled into new
housing or shops (or decided to resettle in partially affected structures or opted to settle
under non-MUTP resettlement/housing schemes or private in-situ redevelopment
schemes). The remaining 40 shopkeepers and six residences whose relocation is pending
have been delayed due to court litigations and administrative procedures associated with
the land and property acquisition. The total resettlement costs are 8.2 percent of the
project cost (US$92 million against the total project cost of about US$1,123 million).
This does not include expenditures incurred for post resettlement support by the project
authorities from their own sources.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

60.     The PDOs remained relevant throughout the life of the project and did not require
changes in response to changing government priorities and external conditions. The main
objective of “facilitating urban economic growth and improve quality of life by fostering



                                            20
the development of an efficient and sustainable urban transport system? was in line with
the main priorities of the Country Strategy for 2002-2005 and 2005-2008 which aimed at
improving the infrastructure bottlenecks to help sustain rapid economic growth and
poverty reduction which is aligned with GoI's own development priorities mentioned in
the Tenth-Five Year Plan (2002-2007). A quality and affordable urban transport system is
a good investment in infrastructure that promotes urban competitiveness and efficiency
(by requiring fewer resources to move passengers) and thus promotes growth. Because
most of the users of the public transport system are low-income, improvement of level-
of-service enhances their ability to access employment, education and health facilities.
The PDOs are also in line with the current Country Strategy for India which provides a
framework to deal with the challenges of achieving rapid, inclusive growth, ensuring
sustainable development, and improving service delivery, with a cross-cutting focus on
improving the effectiveness of public spending and achieving monitorable results, all of
which will help scale up the impact of Bank assistance. The overarching objective of the
current Country Strategy is to help India achieve the long-term vision encapsulated in the
Eleventh Plan of a country free of poverty and exclusion. Finally, the PDOs are also in
line with the latest Bank Urban Transport Strategy (Safe, Clean and Affordable
Transport, 2008).

61.     The Project design also remained relevant throughout the life of the project,
although it underwent several amendments at the request of the Borrower to facilitate
project implementation under changing macroeconomic conditions (exchange rate
appreciation) and slower than expected implementation progress. These amendments
involved changes to the project components as described above, reallocation of credit or
extensions of the closing date to complete implementation, showing an appropriate level
of flexibility by the Bank. However, in hindsight, given the complexity of the R&R
component, the original implementation period of five-and-a-half years ending in 2008,
turned out to be much too short given the complexity of the project, the absorptive
capacity of some of the institutions involved, and other risks known during project
preparation. The Bank could have relaxed the usual practice of keeping the project period
to five years for such a complex project.

62.     The overall rating for relevance is Highly Satisfactory based on the fact that the
project objectives and components remained relevant during the long implementation
period and continue to be so. In addition, the project was one of the few projects in the
Bank that attempted to address the urban transport problem of a mega city like Mumbai.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

(a) Infrastructure Development

63.     Achievement of the PDO was measured through the ability of the project to (a)
meet user needs; (b) improve system efficiency; (c) bring about sustainable
improvements; and (d) make institutions more effective. The key performance indicators
for these project-specific objectives were: (a) rail travel comfort, substantially improved;
incidence and severity of pedestrian traffic accidents reduced; (b) suburban rail service
frequency and train availability enhanced; road journey times and junction delays


                                            21
reduced; (c) improvement in public transport cost recovery; poor households resettled
satisfactorily from hazardous slum/squatter areas to permanent housing with improved
living conditions; and (d) increased technical capacity for planning, traffic management,
road safety, road maintenance, air quality monitoring and vehicle emission control.

64.     In the rail component: The indicators for the rail services improved
significantly, but the targets were achieved only to some extent. The peak hour
overcrowding was reduced from 5,400 to 4,016 but the target of 3,600 was not achieved
because demand increased more than expected, in part due to the faster-than-project
economic growth in India during the project period. Rail service demand in Mumbai went
up from 6.1 million to 7.2 million passengers per day between project start and closure.
The target to increase the average peak hour frequency of the suburban trains was
achieved thereby increasing availability. The target to increase train fleet availability at
peak hour (94 percent), that is, the number of trains that could be available to be put into
operation, was not achieved and remained around 91.5 percent because old trainsets are
still operating in the system and require more maintenance. The ongoing procurement of
new EMU trainsets under MUTP2A will increase the availability of train fleet at peak
hour, which contributes to the achievement of the target.

65.     In the road component: The reduction of journey times in the JVLR road link
was 5 minutes higher than the target of 24 minutes mainly because the actual traffic is 3
times higher than the forecast and also because some resettlement is still under way.
Nevertheless, this link provides a viable east-west connection which has improved the
mobility of road users and public transport services. The reduction of journey times in the
SCLR road link did not materialize because the works were not completed. Based on the
last supervision mission in May 2011, this link should be ready by 2013 and will alleviate
the traffic in JVLR with a good probability of achieving the journey time target despite
an expected increase in traffic.

66.     Traffic Management (Area Traffic Control): The target to reduce delays at ATC
controlled junctions was substantially achieved. This has resulted in improving traffic
flow and waiting at intersection. Generally, the ATC has been well received by users and
the press. The ATC system was given “Best Intelligent Transport System Project Award?
by the Ministry of Urban Development.

67.    Pedestrian road traffic safety: the target to reduce the incidence and severity of
pedestrian road traffic accidents was not achieved. During Project restructuring this
component was substantially reduced to only two pedestrian crossings which have been
completed. This number was 30 at appraisal.

68.    BEST acquired all the buses as planed to replace 644 used or over-aged buses,
which provided additional seats for users and improved their level-of-service. Acquired
buses were newer EURO III compliant, single-deckers, and the pass-by noise levels
reduced to 78dBA. Older buses were also upgraded to EURO II standards.




                                            22
(b) Strengthening of institutions

69.    Rail: The financial strengthening of the suburban railway services measured by
the working ratio (costs excluding depreciation and interest/income) was 0.88 and did not
achieve the target of 0.85 because the tariff surcharge was not implemented. In this case
just the creation of MRVC was a major institutional achievement to improve the
organizational structure for the institution in charge of suburban railway.

70.     BEST (buses): The target of >100 percent to increase the cost recovery of bus
services (income/cost) was not achieved because of additional operating costs particularly
due to the “dearness allowance? and Voluntary Retirement Scheme payments. At project
closure, cost recovery was 74 percent but is projected to increase in 2011 to 85 percent.
Although the target was not achieved, the project was able to provide BEST with the
tools to better manage its finances through improved MIS and fuel monitoring devices.
The cost-recovery (lack thereof) is now more transparent and GoM can make informed
decision about supporting BEST.

71.     MCGM (traffic management in municipal government): The target of increasing
the technical capacity in MCGM to manage traffic as per the modified MCGM Act was
fully achieved.

72.    MCGM (transport planning, road maintenance and road safety): the target to
increase the technical capacity of MCGM in these areas was achieved by the training of
15 professionals.

73.    Air Quality Monitoring: To strengthen air quality monitoring and reporting
system: this target has been achieved.

74.     Capacity to Handle Resettlement: The target to develop capacity for management
of resettlement implementation was fully achieved with MMRDA taking similar complex
resettlement activities for other projects and prepared to undertake future jobs of this
nature for Bank financed projects.

(c) Resettlement and Rehabilitation

75.      Housing area: The target of increasing the percentage of PAH living in houses of
at least 225 square feet was almost fully achieved with 17,566 of 17,572, or 99.97 percent
of the residential PAPs have been resettled in permanent buildings, joined other
redevelopment schemes or have retained their partly affected houses beyond the road
alignment. Only six cases remain to be resolved, and these involve legal cases. All
resettled residential PAPs have access to individual tap water and toilets. The rating for
the resettlement component is considered Satisfactory in view of the successful
negotiation with and resettlement of 97.8 percent shopkeepers including 98 percent of the
large- and medium shopkeepers and 99.97 residences in a complaint manner; and
remarkable post-resettlement support provided for self-management of the resettlement




                                           23
sites. The MUTP resettlement experience has been highlighted for several innovations
discussed in the section dealing with social safeguards.

76.     On the basis of the above, the project contributed towards the development of an
efficient and sustainable urban transport system and the strengthening of institutions
since most targets were substantially achieved or will be achieved in the medium-term, as
it is the case of the SCLR road link. Since the improvement of urban transport and
related institutions increase mobility and access in a safe, affordable and cleaner way, the
project improved the quality of life of users and their access to employment, health and
education facilities, thereby contributing to the economic growth of MMR. The only
problem in meeting the PDO were the higher than expected delays which affected the
expectations of the targeted population.

77.     In conclusion, the overall achievement of PDOs is rated Moderately Satisfactory
because targets were substantially achieved, albeit later than planned. This rating is
consistent with 18 of the 19 ISRs submitted.

3.3 Efficiency

78.     Economic analyses have been carried out using the actual costs incurred with the
project components each year and the actual traffic at the end of 2010. Future traffic has
been estimated using the models developed at appraisal stage with the current data on
speed, fare, inflation rate and number of trainsets in service in a given year. Under the
most likely traffic growth and anticipated completion of the SCLR road component, the
estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for rail component is 60 percent with a Net
Present Value (NPV) of Rs. 8,321 million, for road component excluding ATC, 27
percent with an NPV of Rs. 3,325 million and, for ATC, 19 percent with an NPV of Rs.
40 million. The overall ERR for the project will be 53.7 percent with an NPV of Rs.
11,686 million. (See Annex 3 for details.)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     This rating results from: (a) the relevance of the project objectives and design; (b)
a substantially achieved the development objective; (c) a comprehensive quality at entry,
albeit with a long preparation time; and (d) a robust economic efficiency of the project-
financed investments.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

80.    The independent resettlement impact assessment study carried out in 2007-8
covering the Anik, Mankhurd and Majas resettlement sites indicated that more than 80
percent of the households were satisfied with their new houses, held their previous jobs,
and retained their monthly incomes. The mean income levels of resettled PAPs


                                             24
interviewed remained unchanged. The average income levels seemed to have doubled.
Most resettled houses have added new assets such as TVs and mobile phones, and some
undertook interior decoration and remodeling. Their expenditures had increased due to
the need to pay for water and electricity, which affected the vulnerable households.
Secure tenure was likely to benefit shopkeepers in the long run, however, initially they
faced challenges in re-establishing their business after relocation. The offer of formal
housing and shops provided the beneficiaries with secure tenure and provided them
opportunities for better economic planning at the household level. While the loss of
supplementary incomes (due to relocation) and new expenditures (due to formal
possession of housing) presented a burden to PAPs, the improved access to the formal
sector has added to the overall household incomes.

81.     Gender Aspects: Gender and social development considerations were integrated
into the overall project implementation process. The baseline survey provided gender
disaggregated data. This helped to allot flats to women headed and vulnerable
households. Each resettlement building has a women center, offering a forum for women
group activities, including self-help, thrift and savings. Women workers who lost their
supplementary incomes had access to micro-credit groups, some of them provided with
vocational training. Over 10,000 women have been engaged in such group activities.
MMRDA has formed an industrial co-operative which provides income opportunities to
some 1,000 women. The resettled women expressed greater satisfaction regarding the
new houses compared to men because of the different appreciation of greater privacy and
enhanced personal security. Each building has a children’s center, where pre-school and
day care offers allow women to engage in productive activities. Women’s participation in
the management of the resettlement buildings has been guaranteed by reserving
membership in the housing cooperative executive committees. Some women have formed
community police groups focusing on resolution of domestic violence, marital conflicts,
and financial transactions involving woman and their role has been formally recognized
by the police department.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

82.     The creation of MRVC was a major improvement for providing suburban railway
service in Mumbai. MRVC, although it is still evolving, is a good institutional instrument
to improve the coordination decision making between IR and GoM. The project also lead
to the position of MMRDA being a key agency responsible for major transport and land
development in Mumbai.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

83.   A beneficiary survey was carried out for the R&R component, and is provided in
Annex 5.




                                           25
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

84.    The risk to development outcome of this operation is moderate for the following
reasons:

(a) The infrastructure and rolling stock acquired under the project are now in full
    operation by the Western and Central Railways. The risk of this infrastructure and
    rolling stock not being properly maintained and fleet periodically renewed due to
    improper allocations for maintenance and depreciation of equipment is low, because
    the railway is highly used and thus visible to all levels of the communities in Mumbai.

(b) The sustainability of the JVLR and SCLR which, once completed, will be maintained
    by MCGM, is dependent on an adequate maintenance program of these two roads.
    Given the condition of the majority of the urban network of MMR and the apparent
    budgetary difficulties of MCGM, it is likely that after the first few years, the two east-
    west links will not have the adequate maintenance they require. As such, mitigation
    measures must be sought to increase the likelihood of having a maintenance backlog
    which will increase the vehicle operating costs and the road accidents. There is
    therefore a moderate risk associated with the road component. The sustainability of
    the ATC system which will also be under MCGM will depend on adequate
    maintenance budgets and also on the ability to maintain highly trained staff in the
    operation control center of the Traffic Police and TMU. The ATC component has
    been very visible in Mumbai, with the press reporting on its efficacy in reducing
    travel time. As such, it is likely that MCGM will continue to maintain the system and
    there is a low risk that the good operation of the ATC system may be disrupted in the
    future.

(c) BEST is struggling to improve its coverage ratio and may continue to depend on cross
    subsidies. As such, there is a moderate risk that there will be deferred maintenance of
    the buses if the subsidies are not continued, and the busses’ useful life could be
    shorter and they will not provide as good a level-of-service as they would if properly
    maintained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.    At entry, the Task Team designed an urban transport operation that entailed sound
and innovative features that are still very much valid and appropriate today. These
included: (a) targeted investments in buses, rolling stock and rail and road infrastructure
to support improved services, modal integration, and streamlined operations; (b) it
included a separate R&R component recognizing that the infrastructure investments
would not be possible without the adequate relocation of over 19,000 PAHs; and (c)


                                             26
institutional development to promote metropolitan transport coordination through
capacity building and studies.

86.      Project alternatives were carefully evaluated and the reasons for their rejection
clearly documented. Amongst them were: (a) Project Scope by evaluating the best
priorities set out in the 1994 CTS; (b) Size of Project was discussed to find the most
adequate package of investments to attack the most pressing needs but recognizing that
there would be much more to do in the sector; (c) R&R matters on whether they should
or should not have been included in the project or treated separately; (d) selection of rail
schemes that would maximize ridership and increase level-of-service and safety; (e)
selection of road schemes that would maximize east-west connectivity; (f) reform of rail
operations , particularly the options to make MRVC as autonomous as possible from IR;
(g) Reform of Bus Operations by considering options to improve BEST level-of-service
and cost efficiency; (h) Air Quality Management options to design a strategy and monitor
air quality; (i) the options and timing for the creation of a Mumbai Metropolitan
Transport Authority; and (j) whether the financing instrument should have been an
Adaptable Lending Operation or a series of Conventional Lending Operations.

87.     In this context, the Bank and the Borrower prepared the project by (see also
section 2.1): (a) carrying out a solid background analysis; (b) evaluating lessons learned
from previous similar operations and appropriate alternatives; (c) holding detailed
missions with specialized teams of consultants; (d) designing a technically well-
conceived project; (e) evaluating a range of risks and proposing appropriate mitigation
measures; (f) paying attention to institutional aspects, such as the need to create a
coordination body ; and (g) gathering support from all levels of government and asking
them to show commitment.

88.     The Task Team also tried to ensure that the institutional framework of the project
would work and that the coordination of institutions by MMRDA would be feasible. The
Task Team should be commended for the effort made during preparation in the creation
of MRVC which was supposed to be the precursor of an autonomous suburban railways
entity fully in charge of suburban railways in MMR. The risk of institution coordination
was appropriately rated as “high? and the lack of coordination indeed proved to be an
implementation problem.

89.     Despite careful preparation, it can be argued that project preparation took too long.
In addition, although the risks in dealing with such a complex project, while properly
identified, the mitigation measures taken to deal with them were not effective and caused
delays in implementation and disbursement. Therefore, the rating of “Moderately
Satisfactory? reflects the need to be more realistic in assessing risks and proposing
effective mitigation measures, especially when several institutions with different
implementation capacities are involved in project implementation and there is a longer
than usual delay in project preparation.




                                            27
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

90.     Bank supervision is rated “Satisfactory? on the following: (a) prompt and sound
identification of implementation problems such as R&R and delays; (b) working
diligently to respond to the Inspection Panel investigations and working with the
borrower to implement the Action Plan and recommendation of the Inspection Panel
report; (c) high-quality advice and proposed solutions to the Borrower to address the
implementation problems, for example by agreeing to reallocate Bank financing of some
components when the US dollar devalued in relation to the Indian Rupee; (d) using local
consultants based in Mumbai to help supervise technical and procurement issues; (e)
frequent supervision missions (19 ISRs filed between August 2002 and June 2011 not
including FM, Social Development and Procurement supervision missions which took
place at least once every year); (f) appropriate and prompt Bank follow-up actions; and
(g) strong management support and budget allocations.

91.      The Inspection Panel investigation and the subsequent implementation of the
Action Plan to address issues of noncompliance have presented an additional challenge
where the Task Team and the Bank’s corporate units have provided critical support to the
client. The enhanced supervision that was triggered by the Action Plan focused on
improving the quality and outcome of R&R implementation, and in particular on
facilitating improvement in: (a) resettlement procedures for shopkeepers with medium-
and large-size shops, (b) restoration of incomes, (c) post-resettlement services, (d) quality
of census and baseline data; and (e) grievance redress mechanisms. As a result, there has
been a significant improvement in MMRDA’s capacity and the MUTP R&R process,
which is now recognized in India and abroad for its innovative approach.

92.     Overall, the Task Team showed profound knowledge of the client’s needs,
excellent engagement, and appropriately adapted the project to ensure maximum
relevance and achievement of PDOs in light of changing macroeconomic conditions and
local priorities. Two other relevant aspects of the Quality of Supervision were the very
thorough MTR and follow-up letter to the Borrower with recommendations; and
Management’s decision to temporarily suspend the road and R&R components followed
by an Inspection Panel investigation. Management reacted quickly to the Task Team
recommendations and the team provided all the information required for the Inspection
Panel investigation. This quick response allowed the lifting of the suspension in less than
four months. Finally, the Task Team provided outstanding support to the client and was
very responsive in processing the loan restructuring in 2008. The Bank Country and
Sector Management also provided excellent support to the Task Team, and allocated
adequate budget to supervise the high-risk, high-profile project. The Management kept
the Board informed through periodic (five) Progress Reports of the implementation of the
agreed action plans following the Inspection Panel investigation.




                                             28
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

93.    The Bank assisted the Borrower in the adequate preparation of the project. The
Bank also actively addressed implementation problems thanks to a careful and proactive
supervision. This helped adapt the project to changing circumstances and resulted in the
substantial achievement of the PDOs, albeit with 3 years delay. Because of the
extraordinary support the project supervision team provided the implementing agencies,
the Bank was able to maintain a good working relationship with the client throughout
Inspection Panel investigation and implementation of its recommendations. The
improved relationship led to the GoM to request a follow up project (MUTP2A).

Overall, Bank Performance is therefore rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     During project preparation, GoI and the GoM performed well by supporting the
necessary studies, estimating the investment needs, recognizing institutional weaknesses
based on previous experiences with Bank operations, and initiating reforms such as the
creation of MRVC and the empowerment of MMRDA to implement the project.

95.     However, during implementation, there were significant delays related to
protracted procurement in key contracts of the rail component in which GoM could have
approached at a very high level the Chairman of IR for faster decision-making and
resolution. GoM could have alerted GoI (Minister of Railways) for the excessive delays
in proceeding with the contracts and the opportunity cost of such delays, particularly
when the processes were dragging for a period longer than three months. In fact, the need
for periodic consultations between GoM and the Chairman of IR to speed up the
resolution of this type of issue is a lesson to be learned for the ongoing MUTP2A.
Agreement at a high-level may unblock the lack of decisiveness at lower levels.

96.     GoM showed strong commitment to the project through MMRDA and was able to
quickly satisfy the requests made during the Inspection Panel and took careful steps to
ensure that most of the resettlement and environmental management was carried out
according to Bank guidelines. GoM took notice of the recommendations of the MTR and
subsequently requested the loan restructuring in view of the slow progress of some of the
components and the currency fluctuation. GoM should also be applauded for supporting
this pioneer effort to improve the level-of-service in MMR with a multimodal project.

97.    Overall, both GoI’s and GoM’s performance are rated Moderately Satisfactory
because they were ready to react when asked by the project implementation agency.
However, they should have maintained a channel of communication obstacles such as the
ones faced during the implementation of the rail component.



                                           29
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     MMRDA: Since this was one of the first projects of this type handled by
MMRDA, there was a learning curve. Initially MMRDA was not fully equipped to
handle R&R, but later on its capacity to handle R&R and environmental management to
coordinate with other implementation agencies did improve. However, MMRDA’s ability
to coordinate the various agencies was weak, in part because it lacked a clear authority to
do so, and in part due to the fact that the other agencies are equally powerful within
GoM’s structure and political environment, and thus MMRDA’s ability to influence
change on the other agencies is limited. For example, with MSRDC, MMRDA was not
able to pressure MSRDC to improve its performance or to take over the construction of
the JVLR and SCLR despite the long delays and continued poor performance by
MSRDC. Finally, MMRDA’s performance could have been enhanced if it had hired a
Project Management Oversight Consultant to oversee the project and identify the areas in
which high level coordination could speed up the project. In view of the extraordinary
effort made by MMRDA to build up its capacity to manage R&R and environmental
management, and despite the above shortcomings, MMRDA’s performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

99.      To a large extent, MRVC completed the railway component and carried out the
activities assigned to it although its performance is marked by long procurement delays
due to the numerous clearances required to clear the bids and the evaluation reports. As a
result, its performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

100. MCGM successfully completed the implementation of the ATC component and
ensured the provision of good training to itself, including TMU, and Traffic Police which
operates the ATC control center. MCGM was unable to complete the Road Maintenance
Management System by project closure, and the delays in the construction of the
pedestrian crossing led to the substantial reduction of the number of crossing to be
included in the project. Overall, the rating for MCGM performance is Moderately
Satisfactory because it has implemented the most important activity, ATC.

101. BEST acquired the buses planned, improved its MIS and installed fuel
consumption monitoring devices in their buses. It was unable to increase its financial
coverage costs due to added expenses. BEST’s performance is rated as Satisfactory
because it implemented all the activities that were assigned albeit with minor delays. In
addition BEST is poised to undertake reforms to be more cost-efficient and improve its
cost covering ratio in the medium term.

102. MSRDC was in charge of implementing the JVLR and SCLR road links. These
links took longer than expected because of R&R problems which in some cases were also
caused by engineering design changes. It appears that coordination between MMRDA
and MSRDC, who received a fee from MMRDA to implement the links, was not very
good and caused several problems. Also, the coordination with MRVC and IR was at best
very inefficient as demonstrated by the several changes in the location of Pier 5, a SCLR

pier which needed to be built on rail right-of-way and which is not yet built because of
protracted discussions on its location. MSRDC’s performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory because it was unable to properly coordinate with MMRDA the
engineering design and the resettlement plans, and did not respond effectively to difficult
implementation problems.1

103. Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The project was complex and difficult for many of the agencies to
implement. Many of them had no previous experience with Bank project, and others were
completely new (MRVC). Despite the complexity and the difficult implementation
environment, many of the agencies came through and implemented their respective
activities albeit with some delays.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. The overall Borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory based on the
performance GoI and GoM, and the performance of the implementing agencies.

6. Lessons Learned

105. Similar projects should be designed in a way that inter-agency coordination
does not become an obstacle in the implementation of key activities. One of key reasons
explaining the slow pace of MUTP implementation was the complex project design with
ambitious implementation arrangements which involved multiple implementing agencies
without effective coordination. Five project implementing agencies were involved in the
implementation of the project (MMRDA, MRVC, MCGM, BEST and MSRDC) maybe
without sufficient power vested in the coordinating agency (MMRDA) to ensure effective
progress. Inordinate delays in project components such as SATIS and ROB, requiring
greater inter-agency coordination, forced the removal of these subcomponents from
MUTP as part of project restructuring. In order to minimize such delays due to weak
cooperation and ineffective inter-agency coordination, future projects should be designed
with fewer agencies involved in implementation, and with very clear roles and
responsibilities defined for each agency involved as well as enough power vested in the
coordinating agency. The implementation arrangements for the follow-up project
(MUTP2A) have been planned in a manner that progress will not be constrained by
challenges of inter-agency coordination. At the actual implementation level, the project is
sought to be focused on a limited set of important interdependent activities for enhancing
the efficiency of suburban rail services with MRVC reaming as the key implementing
agency.

106. The project design should adequately focus on capacity building of the client,
especially in new areas, and leave space for implementation arrangements to evolve,
instead of being frozen in time, to achieve greater efficiency. The nature and

                                                 31
significance of some major resettlement difficulties were appreciated by the client during
the process of implementation. Through very active Bank involvement, MMRDA
gradually evolved its mindset for resettlement from a bureaucratic to a more sustainable
and consultative approach. It developed capacity for managing a large scale and complex
resettlement process. The same was needed from other agencies such as MRVC and IR to
change their mindset and reinforce their capacity to address difficult and sensitive
challenges, such as the safety of trespassers and users, environmental management and
financial sustainability.

107. Mechanisms for strengthening transparency, accountability, and good
governance should be planned upstream and integrated in the project design in order
to enhance implementation quality and outcomes. Successful implementation of social
safeguards, the most challenging issue in MUTP, was due to establishing effective
institutional mechanisms including IMP for third party monitoring and a transparent and
accountable grievance redress mechanism for resolution of complaints and disputes.
Measures for transparency, accountability, and good governance including third party
monitoring and dispute resolution are incorporated in the follow-up project (MUTP2A)
as a part of the Governance and Accountability Plan (GAAP).

108. User Satisfaction with the project: A project of this nature should have
included a user survey to be undertaken by an independent entity before the proposed
investments were completed and after the entry in operation of some of the
investments. This would allow gauging the impact of the project components on
different segments of the population and start building up a philosophy that the users
must be heard periodically in MMR.

109. Importance of Long-term involvement of the Bank in MMR: The Project was
able to achieve its successful outcome despite very difficult challenges because MMRDA
and the Bank were committed to overcome a complex R&R program and changing
macro-economic conditions. At appraisal, it was recognized that MUTP was a large
intervention but did not address all the issues. Also, as seen by the traffic growth in the
railways and also in JVLR, it is clear that that there is a dormant demand and that longer-
term involvement of the Bank in MMR is justified as it was in the São Paulo
Metropolitan Region where a long-term program in urban transport leveraged the State’s
plans and increased private sector participation in the operation and investment of the
system, thereby decreasing the burden on government. Therefore, the strategy should be
to plan for long-term involvement in MMR’s urban transport sector to serve as a
demonstration project that can be replicated in other major Indian metropolitan areas.

110. Transition from an administrative “compensation? approach towards a “win-
win? negotiated approach. GoM adopted a set of alternative solutions for shopkeepers
within the MUTP R&R Policy, but in many cases went beyond these alternatives by
being willing to negotiate and agree upon schemes, which entailed numerous discussions
and offered more than what the MUTP policy prescribed. This approach included the
introduction of entitlement and market based solutions. Provision of free-of-cost
alternative housing with ownership title had a significant empowering effect on the
resettled PAPs and supported their ability to access the formal sector.


                                            32
111. Streamlining of grievance redress through independent and recognized
committees. This helped to quickly resolve entitlement-related complaints at the project
level and reduced the transaction costs to achieve this for both parties. The project
authorities have established weekly complaint hearing systems, which help to address a
wide range of issues. The introduction of IMP further helped MMRDA in resolving
issues and contributed to the successful outcomes of the R&R implementation process.
The panel monitored the post resettlement implementation activities, and key
implementation and broader policy issues.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies

112. Some of the implementing agencies carried out their own evaluation for their
respective project components. Their summary is enclosed in Annex 6.

113. The borrower/implementing agencies received a draft of the ICR. MSRDC
expressed its disagreement on the Unsatisfactory rating for the performance.
Acknowledging some of the arguments, the rating has been modified to Moderately
Unsatisfactory. MSRDC’s comments are attached in Annex 6.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1. Ex-post Economic Evaluation

1.      Economic analyses were made using the actual costs incurred within the project
components and the actual traffic at the end of 2010. Future traffic was estimated using
the models developed at the appraisal stage with the current data on speed, fare, inflation
rate and number of train sets in service in a given year.

1.1 Rail Component

2.      For the rail component the actual traffic carried by the suburban rail, its operating
cost, level of comfort were considered from 2002 to 2010 along the actual expenditure on
investments. The actual data on carried passenger was compared with the output of model
using the fare structure over the period from 2002 to 2010. Since the estimated number of
passengers according to the model was within 5 percent of the actual traffic, the same
model was used to estimate the traffic until 2010, after which the crowding level in the
trains reaches the same level as prevailed before 2002. It was assumed that traffic would
not grow any further on the rail system unless new rakes are introduced. The result of the
analysis is summarized in Table 1.

                      Table 1: ERR and NPV for Rail Component

 20%

3.      The ERR for the rail component increased from 36.4 percent at appraisal to 60
percent at closure mainly due to non-increase in the passenger fare. The second surcharge
was also not implemented. It resulted in more passengers carried by the rail and larger
diversion from the bus.

1.2 Road Component

4.     For the road component, only three subcomponents, JVLR and SCLR, ATC, and
two pedestrian subways, were implemented under the project. The economic analysis for
the ATC component has been separately done and the result is in section 1.3. The
analysis for pedestrian subways was not done because the cost comprised only about 1
percent of the total cost of the road component.

5.   The results of the economic analysis for JVLR and SCLR subcomponents are
summarized in Table 2 and the details are in Table 4.

                                                       (INRs. million)
   Base case                          27%                   3,325                  39.75%
   Benefit reduced by
                                      24%                   2,357                    n/a
   20%

6.      The ERR for these subcomponents, JVLR and SCLR, reduced from 39.75 percent
at appraisal to 27 percent at closure mainly due to almost 50 percent increase in the cost,
at constant 2002 prices, of the two roads and delay of over 4 to 6 years in completion of
the project. However, the project is still economically viable at completion.

1.3 ATC Subcomponent

7.      Milestone 1 which included installation of Fully Adaptive Traffic Control (FATC)
for 53 signal junctions reduced the number of stops experienced by traffic. It resulted in
the reduction in the transportation cost and drivers exhaustion.

8.      Estimates of the benefits obtained by the installation of an ATC system were
calculated by the TRANSYT modeling. The calculation was made based on the costs of
stops and delays derived from information supplied by MMRDA supplemented by data
from UK Highways Economic Note 2.

9.     The cost benefit analysis was done covering only Milestone 1 junctions because
of the availability of data. The maintenance costs that were considered in the analysis
include the maintenance cost of the system, the equipments and the software.

10.    The cost and benefit are calculated for a period of five years with a general
experience that the traffic management tools will need revision or a fresh review after
five years in order to account for any changes in the network or traffic characteristics.
The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 3.

11.    The calculation assumed VOC as the only source of benefit and the installation of
optimized signal system as opportunity cost. ERR before deducting the opportunity cost


6 Some of the assumptions were different such as including benefit from VOT.


                                                  39
       is 63%. If VOC is considered along with VOT as another source of benefit, ERR would
       be 163%, in which case, ERR before deducting the opportunity cost is 375%.

       1.4      Summary of the Analysis on Components

       12.     Overall ERR of above three components and subcomponents, calculated by the
       weighted average of each ERRs according to its component/subcomponent cost, is 53.7%
       with total NPV of Rs. 11,686 million.

                         Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      Resettlement Impact Assessment Studies. Three impact assessment studies were
carried out during project implementation to assess the impact of R&R implementation
and make mid stream alterations through remedial measures as appropriate. The first one
was carried out at the time of project approval in 2002 to determine which PAPs were
already resettled prior to project approval. Two more studies were carried out, in 2003
and 2008. Based on the results, MMRDA prepared remedial measures to address the
study findings and recommendations. Remedial measures included, inter alia, the
improvement of water supply, rectification of defects in the sewer systems, improvement
in garbage disposal services, construction of boundary walls, repair of lifts to bring to
them to working condition, expediting the completion of registration of housing
cooperatives, transfer of maintenance funds and creation of community revolving funds
for economic rehabilitation.

2.      The initial study carried out in 2002, prior to Board approval of the project,
indicated that eligible affected people had been provided with alternative houses and
shops and none had rented out or sold their houses, indicating the initial success of
resettlement implementation. Some of the positive impacts indicated by the PAPs, who
had been moved from squatter locations along the railway tracks, included: improvement
in physical living conditions; better access to basic amenities; security of permanent
houses; relief from police harassment and criminal attack, elimination of accident risk;
and reduced impacts from noise pollution.

3.       The next study, conducted in 2003, confirmed that more than 90 percent of PAPs
expressed satisfaction with both delivery of entitlements and the participatory process,
which was exemplary in the context of urban resettlement. Permanent housing, improved
access to basic amenities and security against eviction, accidents and thefts were
perceived as major gains of resettlement. The disadvantages reported include increased
distance from workplace, loss of supplementary income opportunities and increased
maintenance charges. The change in location did not affect occupations for the majority
of the main earners of the family; 85 percent of the main earners retained their
employment. Average incomes fell marginally mainly due to loss of supplementary job
opportunities for women at the new sites. Access to basic amenities was improved for 77
percent of PAPs over their previous location and neighborhood relations remained more
or less the same or were improved for the majority of households. The physical
environment in terms of light, water, noise, garbage removal and overall health
conditions were reported to be comparatively better than previous locations. Pertaining to
the transit resettlement arrangements the report indicated that overall living conditions in
transit housing were generally poor.

4.      The latest study, carried out in 2007-08, by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences
(TISS) at the major resettlement sites of Mankhurd, Anik and Majaj sites showed that
over 80 percent of PAPs, especially women, were happier after relocation in view of
much improved safety, privacy and increased self-esteem. The 20 percent who expressed
a lack of satisfaction did so due to the greater distance from their place of employment,



                                            44
loss of established social networks, and loss of supplementary income sources (informal
work done mostly by women). The study found that about 50 percent of families had
bought new household assets such TVs, fans, mobile phones, cooking gas, etc. It
confirmed an approximate 50 percent increase in average monthly household incomes
and 80 percent job retention among the relocated PAPs. The study also noted the loss of
supplementary incomes by women earlier employed in mixed communities, building
repair issues, etc. MMRDA initiated remedial measures, including establishment of a
Livelihood Cell; repair works in several resettlement buildings; and allotment of
shopping kiosks/work sheds to poor PAPs.

5.      Consultations with different stakeholder groups. During the ICR mission, the
Bank Team met with different PAP groups to ascertain their feedback and benefits
received from the project. The feedback from these groups is very positive and
encouraging. A section of United Shop Owners Association mentioned that it had entered
into a tripartite agreement with MMRDA and the builder for their alternative shops,
which are now ready for allotment and expected to be distributed soon. The consultations
with affected legal apartment owners reveal that they are satisfied with the outcome of
the long consultations with MMRDA and the Bank and are happy that they will soon get
their alternative houses. They also expressed that frequent changes to the alignment
delayed finalization of their plans but noted that the R&R team at MMRDA and
consultations have yielded results.

6.       The discussions with the shop owners at Powai Shopping Plaza reveal a success
story for the land owners, who received alternative shops of area equivalent to that lost to
the project. All the shop owners have rented out their shops to various specialized
institutions and are receiving the rent. They are more than happy with the outcome of the
long process of consultation and negotiation that they engaged in with MMRDA and the
Bank. They are now pursuing some of the issues such as registration of ownership of
their allotted shops and tax assessment.

7.      The discussions with the groups who have successfully relocated the religious
structures such as temples and mosques show that the approach followed by MMRDA in
providing alternative space along the alignment of the road, relocating those who were
willing and supplementing with cash assistance for re-construction of the affected
religious structures, has created satisfaction, as it enabled them to undertake in-situ
reconstruction of their places of worship and ensured that these are available to all who
are living nearby.

8.     The discussions with the supervision consultants reveal that managing the needs
and expectations of different stakeholders, including political parties and builders, during
project implementation involving complex R&R actions and coordination with civil
works, is a major challenge in the urban context and requires a great deal of cooperation
and support from stakeholders.

(a) Evaluation for Rail Transport component7

1. ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTED PROJECT

3.     The rail component of MUTP has been at last very successful because of the
following visible outputs.

1.1. Capacity enhancement of EMU Services

4.     First new EMU trains was received in Mumbai on 22.07.2007. Since, then more
than 1400 coaches (including Ministry of Railways contract) were in the period of three
& half years. Because of additional services it has been possible to introduce 418 services
on Central & Western Railway 944 services have been augmented from nine-car trains to
twelve-car.

5.     More than 31 percent additional carrying capacity has been generated and also
over-crowding level has come down by more than 20 percent for the first time in Mumbai
Suburban Rail Network. The salient features provided on new AC-DC dual voltage
trains under MUTP have been appreciated by Press, Media & Mumbai Suburban
Commuters at large.

1.2. Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R & R)

6.      For expansion of Suburban Railway Network, it was decided that each and every
project affected households (PAH) will be given a house of 225 sq. ft. at different
locations. 15,000 new flats have been constructed and all the PAHs have been resettled.
The works of vacating encroached land were expedited under MUTP due to clearance of
encroachment and R&R of PAPs under the separate framework of R&R policy
formulated by GoM/MMRDA based on WB guidelines. With removal of encroachments,

                                             46
3.2 lakhs sq. meters of encroached railway land both on Central and Western Railways
has been vacated.

1.3. Internal & External Audit

7.      Due to strict guidelines of WB procedure and constant supervision, monitoring
and proper guidance, it has been possible that no serious irregularities were observed by
both Internal as well as External Auditors during the execution of MUTP.

1.4. Strengthening of knowledge in World Bank procedures

8.     It has a real experience for MRVC officials in dealing with World Bank and their
procedures. During implementation of MUTP, MRVC acquire and strengthen the
knowledge on bank procurement procedures, banking transactions related to goods and
services, taxation issues while dealing with International suppliers etc.

9.      During execution of all the projects new accounting and finance manual was
developed by MRVC in keeping with the World Bank emphasis on having a proper
documented internal control system and for improving the knowledge of staff and
officers working in Accounts Department of MRVC.


2. CHALLENGES FACED DURING EXECUTION

2.1       Dispute between EMU Contractor and MRVC on contract provisions

10.    A dispute between M/s Siemens and MRVC occurred when MRVC, while
accepting the M/s Siemens’s bid, decided to delete the software item worth US$15
million (60 Crore). World Bank also did not agree for this proposed item without
supplier’s agreement. This issue involved MRVC, Ministry of Railways, M/s Siemens
and World Bank seriously affecting the progress of the MRVC project.

11.    The agreement between Indian Railways high level team and M/s Siemens in
April 2007 enabled MRVC to solve the following major problems:

         M/s Siemens agreed to delete the software item costing US$15 million (60
          Crore) of clause 1.11 of schedule 4 (a).
         On the basis of agreement between MRVC and M/s Siemens, World Bank also
          agreed to approve the change order for deletion of software.
         World Bank agreed to issue change order to permit M/s Siemens to commission
          all the trains being manufactured through MRVC contract.
         With the approval of common design for MoR contract and MRVC contracts
          duplication of mandatory tests was avoided.
         Design clearances for both contracts were obtained expeditiously and a time
          delay of one year was made up.



                                           47
         A cordial relationship between MRVC, Railway Board, M/s Siemens and World
          Bank was established.

2.2       Coordination with large numbers of Stakeholders

12.     It was noticed that to execute the rail project, proper and continuous coordination
with more than 40 independent agencies was required to be made by MRVC. With a view
to find out possible worktable solutions, action was also taken at MRVC to identify the
existing problematic issues between the various project implementing agencies. With the
effective coordination and negotiable approach with all the Stakeholders, it has been
possible to expedite the progress of MUTP works.

2.3       Difference of opinion with World Bank

13.     The bids for the World Bank funded Package-3 of Virar Car Shed consisted of
three lots: LOT-1 for Track works; LOT-2 for Ballast supply; and LOT-3 for OHE. The
World Bank had different views from those of the implementing agency on the bids for
LOT-1.

14.    The bid considered at first quoted with a substantial discount but was subject to
the consideration of awarding LOT-2 in addition to LOT-1. Because their bid for LOT-2
was considered unreasonably high, it was not awarded to the bidder.

15.     The next bid considered did not provided the validity of the bid security (Bank
guarantee) within 45 days as desired in terms of Clause 16.2 ITB of bid document. The
Evaluation Committee deliberated on the deviation in detail and decided not to consider
this as material deviation. The committee recommended bid for award, but it was not
agreed by the World Bank.

16.    The third bid was then evaluated and recommended for award by the Evaluation
Committee with satisfactory credit worthiness. However, the World Bank did not agree
with recommendation on the ground that the bidder did not provide liquid assets and or
availability of credit facility in the format provided in the bid document. The Evaluation
Committee finally recommended discharging the bid.

17.    The bids under NCB with counterpart fund were re-invited and finalized on
28.07.08. There was a saving of more than 2 Crores over the previous case and the work
was completed within the original validity of the contract.




                                            48
3. LESSON LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS

3.1     Lessons Learned

(i)     Liberal Advances

18.    In contracts financed by World Bank, the advances (mobilization, equipment, etc)
are granted interest free. Even in non Bank funded contracts, a nominal interest of 6
percent is charged by MRVC. Due to policy of liberal advance in MRVC, most of the
contractors avail of this facility and effectively utilize in execution of works.

(ii)    Milestones monitoring

19.     Unlike conventional system of contracting wherein only one completion date is
specified in contracts, in MRVC’s contracts intermediate milestones or sectional
completions dates are also specified. Failure to achieve Milestone target results in
penalties and therefore contractors are encouraged to work effectively during entire
stipulated construction period rather than planning and executing works at per his own
convenience.

(iii)   Mandatory provisions of Environmental Management (EMP)

20.     In all MRVC contracts, it is mandatory to follow the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) and an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) of the project is done,
which takes up environmental issues such as health and hygiene at labour camps, safety
regulations for labour/public, pollution controls. This results in adoption of better
construction practices.

(iv)    Reimbursement/recovery for statutory change in statutory taxes

21.     Changes in tax rates after the contract can put high burden on contractors. After
such incident, a clause for reimbursement/recovery due to change in statutory
taxes/royalties/VAT etc. was added in all contracts, and it has been looked as a positive
and rational feature in successful contract implementations.

(v)     No risk and cost

22.     Risk and Cost (R&C) tenders have well know problems including time
consuming reinvitation of tenders with possibilities of poor or nil responses and
difficulties in the process of recovery often involving lawsuits and/or arbitration. In
MRVC contracts, if the contract is terminated due to breach of contract by contractor, a
fixed percentage (usually 20 percent) applied on the cost of work not completed is
recovered from contractor and all liabilities of the contractor will close after the payment
of above amount. No R&C tender is required to be floated. This system tides over all the
limitations of R&C tenders and losses and project delays due to contract failure are




                                            49
minimal. Learning with past experience, railways also have now done away with R & C
tenders.

(vi)    Additional Performance Security for unbalanced bid

23.     In tenders, unfairly low rates for some items or schedule can be quoted and the
contractor desists from or even abandons these items. In MRVC contracts, safeguard
provisions against such eventualities have been provided. If the bid of successful bidder
is seriously unbalanced as compared to Employer’s own assessment of estimates in
respect of some of the items, then contractor is required to furnish additional performance
security for low rate. In contract of Type V flats at Nirmal Park, the bidder quoted low
rates for Electrical schedule. In Virar Car shed work, the rate of Fusion Bonded Epoxy
Coating is much below market price. In both the cases, additional performance securities
have been taken from the contractors and these low rate items are successfully being
executed.

(vii)   Credit facility certificate from Bank

24.    The bidders are required, in bidding stage, to produce a credit facility letter from
bank certifying to provide overdraft/credit facilities to meet working capital requirements
for executing the contract. This ensures the funding needs for the work.

(viii) Compulsory insurance to minimize risk

25.      The GCC of MRVC bid documents mandates contractors to be insured for
unforeseen events such as (a) loss of or damage to the Works, Plant and Materials; (b)
loss of or damage to Equipment; (c) loss of or damage of property in connection with the
Contract; and (d) personal injury or death. This insurance minimizes the risk of contract
failure.

(ix)    Compensation for delayed bill payments

26.     As per contract conditions, if the Employer makes a late payment, the Contractor
shall be paid interest on the late payment. In MRVC, both executive and finance teams
work hard to make timely payments of bills and the bill position is uploaded on website.
To date, there has not been a single instance of contractor claiming interest charges for
delayed payment.

3.2     SUGGESTIONS:

        (i)    The World Banks should allow submission of bid documents that are
               downloaded from website. It is allowed by all the government departments
               in India.

        (ii)   The World Bank should accept credit facility documents in non-standard
               format as long as there is only a minor deviation.



                                            50
(iii)   The format of the B.G. should be as per commercially acceptable practice
        considering banks often add a few qualifying sentences to safeguard their
        interest.

(iv)    The experience of the bidder as a subcontractor or a partner in a J.V.
        should be considered or clearly brought out in I.T.B.

(v)     As per the Clause 38.1 of conditions of contract, the rates are not liable to
        change, if the change for a particular item is less than 1 percent of the
        initial contract price regardless of the value of the contract. It needs to be
        properly addressed to regulate variation of small value items in large value
        contracts.

(vi)    As per Clause 60.1 of conditions of contract, if the contract is terminated
        because of the fundamental breach of the contract by the contractor then,
        the payment to the contractor is reduced by a percent to be applied to the
        component of the work not completed. In case the work is completed to
        the extent of initial contract price, but the work is still going on account of
        variation, then, how much value is to be recovered is to be specified.

(vii)   There should be suitable clause to increase the value of the performance
        guaranty and retention money in case the contract value is revised on
        account of variation.

(viii) In the standard format of B.G., there is no specific mention of the date up
       to which B.G. should be valid. Often contractor submit B.G. in parts with
       different validities assuming that recovery will be effective accordingly
       and then value of B.G. will reduce as per the outstanding recoveries.
       Though it is a good practice from contractor’s point of view, it often
       results in tedious accounting of B.G. and its validity.

(ix)    In case of NCP (W2) bidding documents, the price variation was to be
        calculated quarterly, but the definition of a quarter is not properly given. It
        was disputed it should be financial quarter or three months immediately
        preceding the month of opening of bids. Further, in case of negotiated bids,
        it should be clearly mentioned that the Base quarter will be decided as per
        the month of negotiated bid.

(x)     As per Clause 29.5 of I.T.B., the amount of performance security is to be
        suitably increased in case of unbalanced bid to protect interest of the
        employer. A definite method maybe given to work out the level of
        unbalanced bid and amount to be increased.

(b) Evaluation for Area Traffic Control (ATC) subcomponent8

1. PDO and Project Beneficiaries

27.     The reduction in junction delays overall was to the tune of 20 percent to have
1,800 pcu-hr/hr compared to the target value of 15 percent reduction to have 2,440 pcu-
hr/hr. This also improved the journey speed of the network to the tune of 8 to 10 percent
at the various corridors in the city.

28.    The main beneficiaries were the road users of the city, whose travel time and
junction delays were significantly reduced, despite the very high congestion levels
generally seen in the city.

29.     In addition, the safety aspects in the signal system (including red lamp
monitoring) helped reduce the uncertainties in the junction for the users, thereby
increasing the safety levels.

30.     The green wave facilities introduced in the new system provides better movement
for the VVIPs, which also reduces the problems for the general users who were otherwise
blocked off for considerable period of time.

31.    The Secondary level beneficiaries included the Traffic Police personnel and the
MCGM officers who were trained in the implementation, O&M management of the
system.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

32.    The original bid and contract for traffic detector was approved with induction
loop system which was to be placed beneath the road surface. Immediately after the
implementation, it was noted that about 30 percent of such loops were damaged due to
external factors. The proposal was made by the Authorities to change the detection mode
to video based one. Also, in the control rooms, video walls were proposed to be
implemented. The net cost increase was 1,219,022.28 which was approved in January
2010. Due to the changes in junction geometry of various signal junctions there was
increase in quantity of civil works and cables. This resulted in additional cost of INR
7,614,355.79 which was approved on 1st April 2011.

33.    Direct interactions with the suppliers and sub-contractors were held for increasing
the speed of implementation, and two milestones in the original contract were merged
into one. Despite all these, the project took considerable time to complete. The major
reasons are as follows:

                                                  52
 (i)   Restriction of working hours in the City: The traffic levels in the city road do not
       allow the Contractor to work in the day time. Working in the night time also was
       restricted in view to avoid noise, pollution and disturbance to the community.
 (ii) Terror Attack in Mumbai: The terror attack happened in November 2009 in
       Mumbai created substantial hurdles to the project development as the Police
       insisted on verification of all personnel including the labourers working on the
       project.
 (iii) Prolonged monsoon period in the City: The City had almost 4 months of monsoon,
       during which any kind of civil works were not allowed on the street.
 (iv) The frequent festivals and VVIP movements in the city: There are many festivals
       celebrated in the city which restricted the work on the streets severely. The
       frequent movement of VVIPs in the city also put restrictions on the work of the
       Contractor, especially after the terror attack.

34.    The following actions from the various stake holders have helped in the
successful delivery of the project:

 (i)   Commitment of the Employer: The Employer formulated a dedicated team of
       about 10 engineers to handle the project. The involvement of the Employer’s team
       during the late night working (to pacify the disturbed community), the dialogues
       between the main contractor and their suppliers/sub contractors for speeding up
       the works etc. have substantially helped to deliver the project. The speed of the
       decision making by the Employer also is commendable, which avoided major
       road blocks normally found in these types of works. The blanket permission given
       directly by the headquarters to the contractor for carrying out the works also was a
       major boost.
 (ii) Commitment of the Traffic Police; The Traffic Police also formed a dedicated
       team which helped substantially to move the project in a fast pace. They also
       helped in managing the traffic for carrying out the works and got involved
       directly in the implementation of the project.
 (iii) Commitment of Engineer; The Engineer also went beyond their normal duties in
       setting up, calibrating and fine-tuning the system. These tasks involved informal
       training of contractor’s personnel about the safe practices and imparting their
       local knowledge about traffic pattern and behavior.
 (iv) Continuity of the project team; Most of the team members from the implementing
       agency and the Bank remained the same from project inception and throughout
       the extended implementation period. This promoted close cooperation between
       the Bank and the client, while building stronger ownership and commitment to the
       project among the local authorities’ staff.

3. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.     The Employer and the end users are operating and maintaining the project facility
in a satisfactory manner. This is ensured by way of proper training at the implementation
stage. The Employer after seeing the benefit of the implementation has approached for a
further expansion of the project to cover the entire signals within the city.

4. Assessment of Outcomes (Efficiency)

36.     A summary of the economic analysis for the ATC subcomponent is shown in the
table below.

 for Milestone I (VOC only)


5. Lessons Learned

37.    One of the predicaments in the project was that the civil works dominated the
time schedule and also contributed to the delays, which indirectly affected the
performance of the main contractor who are electronic / system based companies. From
this experience it seems that the installation / implementation of ATC system shall be
disconnected from the civil works.

38.     The experiment of the JV with an expatriate and Indian firm also did not work
well in the project as the lead firm (which was an expatriate) could not have full control
on the quality and timely delivery of its Indian partner. Ideally, JVs of similar nature
should not be allowed.

(c) Evaluation for BEST component9

1. Procurement of Buses

39.     BEST has procured 644 buses under MUTP-II and put them in service between
1.9.2005 and 19.6.2006. As a result of this addition, the average age of the bus fleet was
significantly reduced from 9.28 in 2004-05 to 5.56 in 2005-06, which led to reduction in
cost of maintenance of old buses. Buses procured under the project complied with Bharat
Stage III emission norms made applicable from the year 2005.

2. Challenges faced

  (i) It was for the first time that such a large no. of buses were procured that too fully
       built. It was a challenge to carry out stage-wise inspection at the location of
       multiple bus body builders. To overcome this challenge several teams were formed
       comprising of officers working at the Depot and Workshop. A satisfactory level of
       quality was maintained and the buses were put in service within a record time of
       less than 10 months.
  (ii) BS-III compliant norms were implemented for the first time in India. The
       technology used to achieve BS-III norms consisted of auto electronics and various
       sensors. This was not only a challenge for the manufacturer but also for BEST who
       had to understand the technology and design practices to effectively maintain the
       buses. A team of senior and middle level engineers were trained at the premises of
       the vehicle manufacturer to understand the technology better.

3. ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTED PROJECT

40.     The BEST Undertaking keeps on shuffling the buses that are operated in a
particular route. As a result of this, some part of the fleet operated on a particular route
always keeps on changing. 644 buses procured under MUTP were a small proportion of
this total fleet of the Undertaking which was around 3400 in June 2006. Hence, no
independent bus user survey was conducted to assess the impact.

(d) Evaluation for Santacruz Chembur Link Road I & II

41.     A brief evaluation for the sections I and II of SCLR on their alignment and
construction implementation was provided by MSRDC’s consultant and shared with the
bank. It is stored in the Project File.

        Ref.:- Michel Andige, sector Manager Transport, South Asia
        Region Letter Dated 21st November 2011

Sir,

      With reference to the World Bank letter dated 21st November- 2011 this office
having a strong objection on the points referred in ICRR as under.
  1) As referred by the bank on point b) page no. 31, the relevant close co-
       ordination were tendered by the MSRDC to the Employer i.e. MMRDA. It is
       very unfortunate to hear from your end that, MMRDA not able to pressure
       MSRDC to improve its performance or to take over the construction of JVLR
       and SCLR, despite the long delays and continuous poor performance by
       MSRDC.
  2) Can this office request to go through the previous minutes and site visits were
       commented by your official which indicates the proactive initiative was taken
       by MSRDC as a result the JVLR was completed and SCLR is also in a good
       shape.
  3) MSRDC had played a vital role in completion of JVLR and SCLR which are
       urban infrastructure projects and having unique challenges like Co-ordination
       of Utility Agencies, Implementation of MOU in between IIT and MMRDA, etc.

  4) MSRDC was not directly involved in R&R part. Due to delay in R&R and Govt.
      policies the projects were delayed for which MSRDC is not responsible which
      is agreed by bank in Para-108 Page No. 32.

        This office also having strong objection on the comments issued by Bank in
para 108 where MSRDCs performance was rated unsatisfactory. The bank officials
are well aware in this regards for the performance which may kindly be verified and
corrected at your level.

                                Annex 8. Resettlement and Rehabilitation

   1.       Land acquisition and R&R are dominant issues in Indian cities: a large share of
   the urban population lives in slums or as encroachers and in the past that has been a
   major impediment to developing the infrastructure network. In this context, MUTP is a
   landmark project as it is the first attempt to resettle such a large number of people in an
   urban area. MUTP is the largest urban R&R project of the Bank and the largest in India
   to date.

   2.     Overall Assessment. The project involved displacement of population of 19,394
   households (about 100,000 people). The status of resettlement implementation at the time
   of ICR preparation, shortly after project closure, is summarized below.

   3.      Long term benefits and impacts. This resettlement has translated into positive
   impacts in the form of secured housing with title and improved basics amenities, which in
   turn has improved the overall living standards of PAPs in the form of better housing,
   access to running water, separate sanitation facilities, etc. One of the long term impacts is
   the increased expenditures on recurring costs of maintenance and municipal services for
   housing cooperative societies. To offset this impact, the implementing agency has
   contributed INR 20,000 (ca. US$500) for each household as a Maintenance Fund and the
   interest earned on this amount can be used for payment of taxes and maintenance. The
   shifting of a large number of affected people away from the railway tracks had a
   significant impact in the form of increased speed and frequency of local trains in
   Mumbai, besides reducing accidents and improving safety.

   4.     Quantification of resettlement benefits. PAPs are provided with a house or shop
   of up to 225 sq. ft, free of cost, and cash assistance towards one time maintenance
   charges, shifting charges and a contribution towards a community revolving fund, to be




                                                           61
managed by the respective cooperative societies. In the absence of land cost, the ready
reckoner rates10 used for registering a property when sale transition takes place are used
to estimate the costs involved for each household resettled under the project. The data
indicates that the project incurred expenditure between INR 333,000 - 785,000
(US$6,800 - US$16,000) for each residential household, consisting of alternative houses,
cash assistance and technical assistance for different sites. In the case of commercial
households, the expenditure incurred varies between INR 506,000 and INR 1,714,000
(US$10,300 - US$35,000) for a unit size of 225 sq. ft. for each commercial household,
consisting of alternative shop, cash assistance and technical assistance for different sites.

5.      Resettlement of shopkeepers. A shopping mall (The Powai Plaza shopping
complex) was developed in order to offer more attractive resettlement option to the
shopkeepers along JVLR, many of whom owned shops on private land with formal or
informal land title and were therefore refuse to be treated at par with squatters on public
land. This shopping complex contains high quality shops that were provided to some of
the affected shopkeepers to reestablish their businesses. It was constructed by a private
developer in exchange for Transfer of Development Rights (TDR).11

6.       Income Restoration Measures. MMRDA also took several measures to
strengthen income restoration and livelihood activities with a special focus on poor
resettled women. It established the Livelihood Cell in 2008 to promote income generating
activities among the resettled women groups. As a result of various initiatives undertaken
by the Cell, women have engaged in a number of businesses which afford them financial
independence and secured education for their children. The Sankalp Mahila Audyogik
Sahkari Sanstha, set up by Livelihood Cell, runs canteens at many institutions including
MMRDA, produces and sells office stationary, gift and seasonal items and also offers
housekeeping to various public and private organizations. In addition, 64 Self Help
Groups and eight Livelihood Groups were formed to enable about 1,000 women to secure
sustainable monthly incomes and improve their living standards. The presence of these
vulnerable women engaged in gainful economic activities has had a positive
demonstrative influence on other resettled women. In various resettlement sites, over
10,000 women are now enrolled in different group based income activities through Self
Help Groups.

7.      Resettlement of Apartment Owners. Another highlight of the resettlement process
is the resettlement of affected legal owners of residential apartment buildings through
MoUs. Under this process, MMRDA is constructing the houses for this category of
people under a redevelopment scheme close to the affected area and the PAPs will be
provided with apartment space almost double that of their previous houses. During the
transition period of 3 years or until the houses are built and the shift takes place, PAPs are
being paid a rental allowance (at market rate and inflation adjusted) of about INR 10,000



10 Ready Reckoner Rates are used to calculate stamp duty for real estate property.
11 Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) is a development permit which makes available certain amount
 of additional build up area in lieu of the area relinquished or surrendered by the owner of the land, so he
 can use the extra build up area either himself of or transfer it to a third party.


                                                    62
per month (about US$200). A total of 444 households residing in 19 Maharashtra
Housing Area Development Authority (MHADA) buildings have opted for such private
in-situ redevelopment schemes. These people have reached or are in the process of
reaching an agreement with MMRDA according to which MMRDA will redevelop their
buildings and provide flats almost double the size of their previous houses in the same
locality.

8.      Key issues encountered during implementation. The key issues encountered
during project implementation were: (a) resettlement of medium and large size
shopkeepers; (b) management of post resettlement issues such as registration of
cooperative societies, adequate water, transport, schooling facilities, etc.; (c) lengthy and
complex land acquisition process; (d) relocation of religious and community structures;
and (e) resettlement of legal residential apartment owners.

9.      Institutional Capacity. The implementing agency has greatly progressed in
addressing these issues, with the active support and advice of IMP. MMRDA developed
substantial capacity over the life of the project. It created a permanent unit to manage
resettlement impacts of various projects in the city. The R&R unit in MMRDA is headed
by a Chief Officer reporting to the Additional Metropolitan Commissioner. The Chief
Officer is assisted by several specialists. With the increase in work related to post
resettlement, a new position, Chief Office (Post Resettlement), was created and a Senior
Officer has been assigned to it. The two NGOs with long experience of working in the
slums of Mumbai have provided complementary support for implementation of
resettlement activities.

10.     IMP. In addition to the above arrangements, IMP, headed by a former
Metropolitan and Municipal Commissioner and consisting of members from fields of
journalism, legal and academics, regularly met and reviewed progress in key activities
and also undertook field visits to assess improvement in the resettlement colonies and to
hear from PAPs.

11.     Grievance redresses process. A two stage grievance redress process was
established at the beginning of project appraisal which was streamlined during
implementation. The Grievance Redress committees (Field Level and Senior Level),
handled complaints and grievances from PAPs and were administered by independent
persons not associated with the project implementation. The field level committee heard
and resolved 3,704 cases and the senior level committee resolved 902 cases. The
independent impact assessment study carried out in 2008 recorded a high degree of PAP
satisfaction with the grievance redress process.

12.    Post-resettlement Support. The post resettlement support in this project can be
considered as best practice. The support includes: (a) assistance with registering PAP
cooperative societies; (b) support for Community Management Funds (CMF) and
Maintenance Funds; (c) undertaking building repairs; (d) training in building
management and provision of maintenance manuals; (e) allotment of additional locations
for common facilities; (f) strengthening of basic services such a community halls, health



                                             63
centers and schools; and (g) establishment of the Livelihood Cell to support and monitor
income activities.

13.     MMRDA’s overall post-resettlement activities have been notable, despite the
delay in implementing the exit strategy. The progress MMRDA has achieved in
registering and training of 95 percent of PAP cooperatives and enabling them to
responsibly self-manage their affairs after program exit gives confidence that the post-
resettlement strategy can be concluded in a sustainable manner.

14.     The remaining aspects of the post-resettlement strategy involve formal handing
over of the resettlement buildings to the cooperative societies. The preparatory work for
this, namely housing society registration and training, has been substantially completed.
The mainstreaming of the resettlement sites into the urban services network remains a
challenge even as MCGM provides the basic services. MMRDA is pursuing the matter
with GoM and MCGM regarding long term sustainability of the basic services provisions
to the resettlement sites.

15.     The sustainability of building management was noted during the field visits of the
ICR mission. The discussions with some of the cooperative societies revealed that they
have issued share certificates to their members and audited their financial reports and also
maintain substantial reserve fund balance for unforeseen expenditures. They are carrying
out minor repairs of the buildings and regularly paying the electricity dues and property
taxes, ensuring the security of the buildings, maintaining details of flat owners and the
building.
