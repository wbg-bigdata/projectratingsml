dependent on already constrained public budget financing, and waterborne
diseases and infant mortality would be significantly reduced. The project
would benefit the whole population of Fes through the rehabilitation of
existing interceptors and the construction of wastewater treatment plants and,
would benefit the poor, in particular, since social sewerage house connections
would be located in low income neighborhoods. The total additional
population serviced through the proposed project is estimated at 300,000
people to which about 200,000 equivalent inhabitants are to be added,
representing the equivalent increase in industrial pollution.
Risks:         The project would not pose specific technical risks. Execution of physical
components would be straightforward. The risks mostly involve the
Government's willingness to enforce the stipulations of the "Protocole
d'Accord" and in particular i) adaptation of the legal framework to enhance
RADEEF's managerial and financial autonomy; ii) needed sewerage charge
adjustments; iii) settlement of arrears; and iv) reinstatement of RADEEF's
autonomy. The tariff structure and the industries contribution level will be
based on a tariff study which is a component of the proposed project. The
1994 and 1995 significant tariff increases (40%  for water and 48%  for
sewerage), the 1993 settlement of 33% of the "Collectivit6s Locales" (CLs)
arrears, the 1994 settlement of Government arrears, shifting from a priori to
a gosteriori control, prove that the Government is committed to the Regies'
sustainability. Technical assistance and training under the project would
reinforce the Government's and RADEEF's commitment to the needed
reforms by identifying and enforcing the implementation of procedures
necessary for sound financial management and sustainable autonomy.
Sustainability would be enhanced through possible privatization of water and
sewerage services, following the current review by the Government of private
firms' proposals. A Bank note of December 1994 was distributed to the
Government, reminding it, inter alia, of the basic principles of sound
privatization:   competition and transparency. Technical assistance in
implementing, operating, and maintaining project works would also minimize
any technical risks.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RE-USE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANlTATION SUB-SECTOR
A.   Country Background. Water Resources and Sub-Sector Organization
1.01 The country and sector background, water resources and current sector organization are
described in Annex 1-1.
B.   Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Sub-Sector Strategy
1.02 The proposed project fits into the Bank's current CAS of November 1993 supporting
Government efforts to deepen adjustment and reform, alleviate poverty, strengthen public sector
and natural resource management, and encourage private sector development. Details of this
Strategy are given in Annex 1-2. The proposed project is also consistent with the World Bank
strategy for water resources management' and MENA strategy for managing water2, in that it
is an outcome of an analysis taking into account social, environmental and economic objectives;
it supports more efficient sewage collection, treatment and disposal in an environmentally
sustainable and economically viable manner, and promotes decentralized management as well
as a system of water charges to endow municipal water utilities, R6gies, with operational and
financial autonomy.
C.   Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.03 The Government recognizes that the establishment of efficient and cost-effective sewerage
and pollution control management systems, as well as institutional management, are critical to
the country's overall development. Based on long-standing relationships in the sector, the
Government has requested continued Bank participation as a development catalyst, both at the
micro-level of sanitation and at the macro-level to assist in addressing intra-sectorial issues.
Details concerning Bank-funded projects including lessons learned from previous Bank operations
are given in Annex 1-3. The proposed project would lead to improved operational efficiency of
sector agencies, particularly the Regies, and to expanded sewerage service levels benefitting low
income consumers. Focussing on social sector development through comprehensive action plans
in the water and sewerage sector would be part of the overall post-adjustment strategy. It would
follow on the successes and avoid the shortcomings of the ongoing Greater Casablanca Sewerage
Project in addressing sector-wide institutional and financial issues through the establishment of
global eligibility criteria (see para. 2.02). The proposed project would directly benefit the Regie
of Fes, while supporting ongoing policy changes affecting all Regies and adopting the
Government's social sewerage connection program.

D.   Sewerage Sub-Sector Issues and Proposed Actions
Institutional Aspects
1.04 Currently sewerage systems are not operated satisfactorily by the Municipalities,
essentially because their revenues (municipal taxes) are insufficient, and there are no allocations
made for a specific service like sewerage. To overcome these shortcomings, the Government
intends to adopt a basic institutional scheme in line with the "charte communale" of 1976
entrusting responsibility for sewerage services to the "Collectivites Locales" - CLs
(Municipalities), as per its Sub-Sector Policy Letter (see Annex 1-4).
Cost Recory
1.05 The Government agrees that full cost recovery through sewerage user charges to
approximate the long-term marginal cost (LRMC) of sewerage works is the optimal solution to
be pursued (see Sub-Sector Policy Letter in Annex 1-4). This is in line with the Government
economic strategy of discontinuing its involvement in services to be provided in local
communities (CLs) and also in line with the Bank policy. However, the implementation of this
solution can sometimes face serious socio-economic constraints, as sewerage charges cannot
exceed the affordability level.
1.06 During appraisal, the Bank has carried out financial projections for the sewerage activity
of three Regies: RAD of Casablanca, RADEEF of Fes and RADEEMA of Marrakech.
Furthermore, during pre-appraisal the Bank has carried out preliminary financial projections for
the sewerage activity of four additional Regies: RADEEC of Settat, RADEEN of Nador, RAID
of Tangiers and RDE of Tetouan and five ONEP centers, to determine the order of magnitude
of sewerage charges needed to reach financial viability (applying the above-mentioned cost
recovery assumption). The financial projections take into account house owners' contributions
which consist of a 'Participation au Premier Etablissement -PPE" paid by new house owners and
developers, proportional to the surface area of premises to be connected to the sewerage
network. In addition, a 20% surcharge is added to the cost of house connections for construction
cost and 10% for work supervision on the cost of the tertiary network. These contributions and
the methodology are defined in the Regies By-laws. The financial projections show that funding
sewerage investments at IBPD loan terms is appropriate for the cities of Casablanca, Fes and
Marrakech, for which the resulting user service charges are acceptable. Similarly, funding
sewerage investments at EEB loan terms is appropriate for the cities of Nador, Tangiers, Tetouan
and Settat, where the resulting user service charges are also acceptable. For the five ONEP
centers, the application of IBRD terms would result in sewerage charges far too high relative
to users' ability to pay, and if costs were to be recovered through user charges only. Therefore,
additional financial projections were carried out under the assumption that funding would be
provided through donor grants.
1.07 The first phase investment program which includes the proposed project (Fes), as well
as Casablanca and Marrakech, would not need any Govemment subsidy for funding the required
investments. The resulting average sewerage user charges range between 1.5 and 3.5 DH/m3
(17 to 31 US cents per m3) during the implementation period, same order of magnitude as the
long-term marginal cost of sewerage works, which compares with current water tariffs ranging
between 3.5 and 6.5 DH/m3 (or 31 - 57 US cents per m3). For the city of FRs, a study of the
tariff structure will be carried out, to identify for each beneficiary the sustainable level of



- 3 -
sewerage charges and, if a contribution from the central or local budget is set, design the
sewerage charge structure in such a way that lower income beneficiaries would benefit most
from of the contnbution. The European Investment Bank would provide external funding
through loans at concessional terms for the sewerage systems of Marrakech, Nador, Settat,
Tangiers and Tetouan without any need of Government subsidy. Similarly, no Government
subsidy would be needed for the sewerage systems of Erfoud, Errachidia, Goulmima, Ouarzazate
and Rich, if external funding is provided by a donor grant - eventually the European Union (EU)
or the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). The results of preliminary financial projections
show, in fact, that sewerage user charges remain at a tolerable level for small-size communities
only if investments are funded through grants or subsidies. This means that, due to the limitation
of donor grant amounts, most of the sewerage systems needed in the 235 small-and middle-size
towns can be implemented only if funding is provided by massive Government subsidies. Under
this assumption, Bank funding would still be feasible, provided that debt service is assumed by
the Govemment which would yield the assets to the communities as equity contribution.
Conditionalities
1.08 The above-mentioned institutional set-up and cost recovery plan would be implemented
through conditionalities agreed with by the Govemment, RADEEF and donors (CFD, EIB, EU,
KiW, USAID).
Two conditionalities were complied with prior to appraisal:: (i) availability of an adequate
environmental impact analysis (EIA) of the proposed sewerage works; and (ii) availability of
1993 and 1994 audit reports;
Three conditionalities were complied with prior to negotiations: (i) transfer of sewerage
responsibility to the autonomous water, electricity and sewerage utility RADEEF of FRs; (ii)
availability of a draft addendum to the RADEEF "Protocole d'Accord", covering the
improvement of its managerial autonomy and financial and operating performance for the
sewerage activity; and (iii) carrying out by RADEEF a vigorous sanitary education campaign,
to inform the population of Fes about appropriate use of sewerage facilities. The agreed
addendum No. 1 to the RADEEF "Protocole d'Accord" is shown in Annex 1-5.
Agreements were reached during negotiations that, prior to Board presentation, the following
conditionalities would be complied with: (i) signature of the above-mentioned addendum to the
"Protocole d'Accord" satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) reception by the Bank of the Government
Sewerage Sub-sector Policy Letter satisfactory to the Bank including, inter aia, the eligibility
criteria (complied with on March 15, 1996).
II. THE PROJECT
A. The Nation-Wide Sewerage Investment Program
2.01 Currently in Morocco the urban population (about 14 million inhabitants) lives in 260
Municipalities (communes urbaines), 20 of which have a population ranging from 100,000 to
3 million people. The rural population (about 12 million inhabitants) lives in 1,290 rural
communities (communes rurales) grouping 31,000 douars (villages). The progressive migration
of rural population to urban areas makes the sewerage issue even more urgent in those areas.
Sewerage feasibility studies and master plans are partly finalized and partly under way in



- 4 -
13 cities (by the Regies and Municipalities) and 137 towns (by ONEP), with the assistance of
consultants, through funds provided by the Bank and other co-financiers. These studies would
identify for each city or town a justified phased investment program. Based on data gathered
from these studies, the estimated per capita investment needed to cover sewerage needs in the
year 2000 is ranging between $60 to $180 for large cities and small towns respectively, which
translates into a global estimated investment of $1.4 billion. The coverage of sewerage needs
beyond the year 2000 will require additional investments on the same order of magnitude.
B.   Eligibility Criteria
2.02 During appraisal, the Government has agreed that each city and town need to comply
with the following eligibility criteria, to be included in the nation-wide sewerage investment
program, irrespective of the fund source; confirmation of this agreement was reached during
negotiations as per Sewerage Sub-Sector Policy Letter (see Annex 1-4 and para. 1.08). They
consist of: (a) availability of a thorough sewerage feasibility study and master plan giving full
justification (technical, economic, financial) for the recommended investment; (b) availability
of an adequate environmental impact analysis (EIA) of the proposed sewerage works; (c) transfer
of the sewerage responsibility from Municipalities to autonomous utilities; and (d) availability
of audit report(s) of said utilities.
EMect Appo:ach and Objectives
2.03 The implementation of the above-mentioned investment program depends on the timely
availability of adequate funds at appropriate terms. The pre-appraisal mission has identified a
first phase sewerage investment program concerning twelve cities and towns for which thorough
sewerage feasibility studies and master plans satisfactory to the Bank, were available:
Casablanca, FRs, Marrakech, Nador, Settat, Tangiers, Tetouan, Erfoud, Errachidia, Goulmima,
Ouarzazate, and Rich. The Govemment wishes to first use grants and funds at concessional
terms which would be made available for small cities and towns. The Bank intervention would
concern the city of FRs where sanitation issues are most acute; this would constitute the proposed
Bank project. The Bank was instrumental in mobilizing funds at concessional terms: (i) from
CFD to secure parallel financing to complete the external funding of the Fes sewerage system;
(ii) from EIB to secure external parallel funding needed to finance the sewerage systems of
Marrakech, Nador, Settat, Tangiers and Tetouan; and also in interesting the EU and KfW to
provide parallel grant funds for the sewerage systems of Erfoud, Errachidia, Goulmima,
Ouarzazate and Rich. The project would develop the Govemment sector strategy by improving
the operational and financial perfommance of sector institutions, extending ongoing rehabilitation
and expansion programs, expanding sewerage services to the poor and mobilizing adequate
financial resources to fund delayed infrastructure investments. The Govemment is currently
reviewing a privatization proposal from a French company for water, electricity and sewerage
services for Casablanca. Privatization would improve the efficiency of sewerage services, and
bring in funds which would reduce the Govemment contribution to project funding. A Bank note
of December 1994 (see Annex 1-6! was distributed to the Government, reminding, inter aia,
the basic principles of a sound privatization: competition and transparency. Assurances were
reached during negotiations that the Government would mention the privatization option in the
sewerage sub-sector policy letter (see Annex 1-4 . The project would establish a consistent
framework within which it would replicate any further project in the sewerage sector, to all
cities complying with eligibility criteria mentioned above. The role of the Bank would
essentially consist in assessing compliance with eligibility criteria, in lieu of the classic project



cycle (preparation, prappraisal and appnaisal). The project's major objecdve is to achieve
satisfctory public health condidons by transporting and adequatdy ftraing and disposing
effluents far from the populated areas; this would drasically reduce the waterbome diseases
which are the major cause of morbidity.
C.           r
2.04 The project area is the entire country in so far as it supports institutional and financial
reforms of water distribution and sewerage utilities (R6gies) and ONEP which operate all over
the country (IBRD Map No. 25095). Forecasts and statistical data concerning sewerage facilities
of the three major cities of Casablanca, Fes and Marrakech are given in Annexes 2-1and2-2.
Sewerage works were identified and justified on the basis of priorities set forth in the feasibility
studies and master plans, as mentioned in para 2.03 above. The proposed project would focus
on the city of Fes and include sewage collection system, pollution control works, equipment,
consulting services, technical assistance and taining. A detailed description of sewelage works
is given in Anexc 2-3. Sewerage works are shown in Anes 2-(L4fl, 2-s  l3E   and
2-6 (ItADEEMA).
D.   Status of   tPre      aon - FoloW-U Proect
2.05 Project preparation is well advanced. Sewerage feaibility studies and master plans
satisfactory to the Bank are available. The first phase sewerage works of the twelve cities and
towns considered during pre-appraisal are identified and justified. Part of final design and
bidding documents is also completed. The completion of final design and bidding documents of
sewerage works of the city of FPs is scheduled for mid 1997. Terms of reference for consulting
savices, TA and traing are available. Due to the different progress of project preparation -
sewerage master plans have been finalized for 12 cities and towns, and some are just staring
or are underway (Agadir, Melnes, Kenitra, Rabat-Sai, Safi, Oujda, and 137 ONEP centers) -
(see Anne 2-7), it is likely that the proposed project would be followed by a further project
at a two to three years interval. The preparation of the proposed project would be closely
coordinated with the ongoing activities in the water and sewerage sector.
E.   Cost Ffl
2.06 The estimated costs for the sewerage worls of the project city of Pes (icluding taxes,
duties and interest during constucton) are detailed in Annex 2-8 and summarized in Table 2-1
(see next page). Annex 2-8 also provides detailed cost estimates of sewerage works for the cities
of Casablanca and Marrakech considered dunng appraisal, as well as Nador, Settat, Tangiers,
Tetouan, Errachidia, Erfoud, Goulmima, Ouarzazate and Rich considered during pre-appraisal.
2.07 The project cost is estimated at US$97.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$51.5 million (53%). Taxes and duti  estimated at about US$13.1 million
equivalent would be funded entirely by the Pes water and sewerage utility and by the house
owners. The base cost estimates are expssed in January 1996 prices. Cost estimates are based
on data provided by the feasibility studies, master plans, and final deign. Unit costs are based
on recently awarded contracts. Physical contingencies of 10% have been added to the costs of
all components and price contingencis toalling 15%  of the base costs and physical
contingencies are based on the following inflation rates:

2.09 The proposed IBRD contrbution of US$40.0 million would finance 63% of the project
foreign exchange and 23% of local currency costs through a loan agreement to be made with
RADEEF. Thirty-seven percent of the project foreign exchange and 14% of local currency costs
would be funded by CFD. Home owners and RADEEF would fund 73 % of the local currency
costs plus taxes and duties or 35 % of the investment program. The whole amount of the loan
would be guaranteed by the Government. The foreign exchange risk on the loan would be borne
by RADEEF.
2.10 All project components are designed to allow for an implementation period of about seven
years, i.e., from mid 1996 to 2003 (Aamc 2-10). The implementing agency would be the Rdgie
RADEEF. Consulting services would be provided to support RADEEF in bidding document
preparation, procurement, and works supervision. TA would be provided to RADEEF for the
organization of its sewerage department and training for wastewater treatment facilities and
equipment use. The operation and maintenance of all facilities would be carried out by
RADEEF. The organization of the Regies is described in Annex 2-11. The organizational chart
of a typical R6gie is shown in Annex 2-12.
R.   Procurement
2.11 Civil works, sewers and equipment would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Eligible domestic manufacturers of pipes and equipment bidding under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be awarded a 15% preference on the CIF price
or the prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided
the local value added to the product is not less than 20% of the ex-factory bid price. The supply
and installation of pipes and equipment will be tendered as single packages and grouped in such
a way as to maximize competition. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures, acceptable to
the Bank and in which foreign bidders would have an opportunity to participate would be used
for the following: contracts for equipment and vehicles estimated to cost less than US$75,000
each, up to a total amount of US$400,000; and contracts for civil works estimated to cost less
than US$2,500,000 each, up to a total amount of US$10,000,000. Contracts below US$50,000
for equipment and vehicles, up to a total amount of US$250,000 would be awarded under Local
Shopping (LS) procedures in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Consultants would be
recruited in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Terms of reference for the various asignments
were reviewed by the Bank. Due to the urgency of rehabilitation works, some project activities
(procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines) would be carried out prior to loan signing.
Consequently a small amount of retroactive financing (less than US$0.7 million) would be
provided under the proposed Bank loan.
2.12 All contracts awarded through ICB and LCB, as well as all consultant appointments
above US$100,000 for firns and US$50,000 for individuals, will be subject to prior Bank
review. This will result in prior review of about 90% of total procurement. All other contracts
will be subject to selective a posteriori review by the Bank.
2.13  Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 2-3 where the figures in parenthes
represent amounts financed by the Bank and the others are the total amounts of the project
elements.

I.    Reporting and Monitoring
2.14 RADEEF would report twice a year on the progress of project implementation and the
achievements of the project would be monitored. RADEEF  would also prepare an
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). These reporting requirements were agreed upon
during negotiations. Key indicators for RADEEF are mentioned in Annex 2-13. Agremnt
was reached during negotiations that during project implementation: (a) a yearly review would
be conducted by the Bank to verify the compliance by RADEEF on the actions stipulated in the
performance agreement (Protocole d'Accord and its addendum), including: implementation
measures, water tariff and sewerage charge adjustments, self-financing of no less than 25% on
average of the investment program, account receivables no more than three months of water
billing by 1998, and debt service no more than 1.2.; (b) an annual report covering all the
indicators to be submitted by RADEEF no later than September 30 of each year of project
implementation, and identifying appropriate remedial measures if indicators stipulated in the
agreements are not realized; (c) a mid-term review to be carried out jointly with the Bank no
later than October 31, 1999, to verify the implementation of the -Protocole d'Accord' and its
addendum and identify appropriate remedial measures to complete the project as scheduled, and
to achieve all the project objectives; and (d) annual audit reports on the accounts of the previous
year, project accounts and special accounts (to be prepared by independent audit firms acceptable
to the Bank) based on terms of reference to be agreed on by the Government and the Bank, no
later than June 30 of the foLlowing year.
J.    Disbursent
2.15 Loan proceeds would be disbursed as shown in Table 2-4 on the basis of full
documentation, except for eligible expenditures with a value below US$100,000. These would
be covered by statements of expenditure. This documentation would be made available for
review at the project audit offices of the implementing agencies. The loan would be disbursed
against foreign exchange expenditures and part of local expenditures over seven years, this

period being based on experience gained from the implementation of similar projects with ONEEP
and the R6gies. The Bank loan includes US$0.7 million of retroactive financing for urgent works
carried out after March 1, 1996. In order to expedite disbursements, agm=nL was reached
durin" negotiations that the Government will establish a Special Account for RADEEF at the
National Treasury in the amount of five percent of the loan amount. This account will be used
to prefinance eligible expenditures under the Bank loan and will be replenished on the basis of
standard Bank procedures. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account will be
submitted to the Bank on dates to be specified by the Bank. The project disbursement schedule,
in line with the standard disbursement profile for water supply and sewerage projects including
preparation of bidding documents and work construction, is shown in Annex 2-14.
2.16 The risk of delaying project implementation and having to finance a higher proportion
of project costs would be borne by RADEEF. Assuming implementation begins in mid 1996,
loan proceeds would be fully disbursed by June 30, 2003. The closing date would be
December 31, 2003.

K.   Poect Risks
2.17 The project would not pose specific technical risks. The risks mostly involve the
Govemment's willingness to enforce the stipulations of the "Protocole d'Accord' made, and its
addendum to be made, with RADEEF and, in particular, agree on the needed user sewerage
charge adjustments. Annex 2-15 explains how the project risks will be kept within tolerable
limits.
L.    Environmental Aspects
2.18 This project is a first major effort of the Government and the Bank to address a backlog
of water pollution issues in accordance with the country's environmental priorities and the
MEENA Environmental Strategy. Minimizing existing environmental health problems related to
poor water quality observed for some time, has been the decisive factor in determining priorities
for site selection for the project. This has been especially an issue of concern in the Fes Valley.
The project will reduce the flow of raw sewage and industrial effluent into surface waters of
highly urbanized areas in which agricultural production takes place. Upgrading of the municipal
infrastructure in the municipality of FRs will have a significant impact on environmental health



- 10-
of communities located along the rivers downstream of Fes. At the same time, it will improve
the living conditions of people in the municipalities by controlling flooding of raw sewage in the
old city of Fes.
2.19 Environmental benefits of this project will also include improvement in the quality of the
wastewater used for irrigation by bringing it to levels recommended by the Bank. This will
improve the quality of foodstuffs produced by private farmers. The institutional aspect of the
project allows for expanding the scope of work of water utilities to also cover wastewater
treatment. Effluent monitoring will be conducted by the utility. Quality monitoring will also be
carried out by the responsible agencies: ONEP, the Administration de l'Hydraulique (AH) and
the Ministry of Environment (ME). An environmental impact analysis has been carried out by
ME, ONEP and consultants for the twelve cities and towns considered during pre-appraisal and
appraisal, in accordance with Bank requirements, and mitigation measures have been
incorporated into the project design. These include sludge handling in such a way as to allow
for separation of heavy metals from industrial wastewater before it is mixed with municipal
wastewater. Sludge will be used in agriculture. For each wastewater treatment plant, effluent
standards were set to allow for wastewater to be used in the farming of products to be cooked.
For the purpose of environmental rating this project has been rated as " B " in accordance with
O.D. 4.01.
m. FINANCUL ANALYSIS
3.01 RADEEF generates its revenues from consumers' charges and contributions. Water and
electricity revenues are based on consumptions metered and billed to users. During the 1990-
1994 period, RADEEF electricity revenues covered its operating expenses including depreciation
costs and met its financial requirements under Loan No. 2910-MOR, while water revenues do
not. Water activities generated operating deficit due to the preponderance of operating expenses
over total revenues. The shortage to cover operating expenses as well as investments is made
up by customers' contributions and subsidies from electricity. In 1994, the FRs Municipality
entrusted the sewerage activity to the "Regie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution d'Eau
et d'Electricite de FRs" (RADEEF). To date, no financial statements are available regarding the
sewerage activity. The financial analysis covers the three activities: water, electricity and
sewerage.
A. Pad and Current          Performance of
3.02 RADEEF's past and present performance is shown in its financial statements for fiscal
years 1990 through 1994, summarized in Annex 3-1 (Tables 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6).
During this period, RADEEF performed satisfactorily and met its financial requirements for the
electricity activity. However, the financial statements of its water supply activity show that the
financial equilibrium and operating efficiency are low and show deficits due to the
preponderance of operating expenses and interest over total revenues, and deferral of tariff
adjustments. However, working ratio improved slightly from 109% in 1990 to 92% in 1994 and
its operating ratios improved from 133% in 1990 to 108% in 1994. As a consequence, the net
operating deficit and net deficit after taxes decreased, respectively, from DH22.0 million to
DH11.0 million and from DH26.0 million to DH20.0 million. The consolidated financial
statements showed an overall satisfactory performance in 1994.



- 11 -
3.03 RADEEF's low profitability in water supply activity is mainly compounded by (a) the
inadequacy of tariff to keep up with escalating operating costs, and (b) the low water distribution
network efficiency, due to insufficient maintenance and rehabilitation as well as lack of
resources. In addition, according to the Moroccan fiscal code, net income before taxes is
subject to a 36% (40% up to 1992) corporate income tax, but in case of net losses, a 2.5% tax
is levied on actual turnover.
3.04 This lack of performance in its water supply activities is being addressed to some extent,
by the 1993, 1994 and 1995 average tariff increases of more than 25% each year, and through
appropriate measures covenanted in the Fifth Water Supply Project and related "Protocole
d'Accord" (Loan 3364-MOR) i.e. annual tariff adjustment, settlement of arrears, implementation
of new tariff structure and improvement of network efficiency from 64% in 1994 to 80% in
2000.
3.05 Tables 3-2, 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of Annex 3-1 show how RADEEP's water supply equity has
eroded: cumulated retained losses reaching about 35 % of equity in 1994. Furthermore, balance
sheets have increasingly expanded from the large accumulation of unpaid bills owed to RADEEF
(account receivable representing about 33 % of total assets) and by RADEEF (account payable
representing about 15 % of total equity and liabilities). Throughout the period, RADEEF's debt
to equity and current ratio were satisfactory, and its cash generation reached the required level.
Trhe RADEEF financial performance for both water supply and electricity activities is expected
to improve drastically in 1995 and thereafter, due to settlement of all arrears owed by the
Government and CLs as of December 1992, and annual water tariffs adjustments in 1994, 1995
and 1996 of about 25% each year, implementation of new tariff structure for electricity in 1996,
as well as Government's and RADEEF's commitment to meet financial and operating
requirement stated in Loan Agreement 3664-MOR and "Protocole d'Accord" signed between the
Government and RADEEF on December 6, 1993.
B.   RADEEF's Future Fnancial Performance
3.06 Financial projections for water supply and power activities, as well as the consolidated
financial projections suggest that under the assumptions outlined in Annex 3-2 and the
agreements reached under the 5th Water Supply Projects, RADEEF would perform satisfactorily
and meet all financial and operational requirements in terms of efficiency (80%), debt service
coverage (1.2) and cash generations (25%) (Anne= 2-13) provided that the adequate tariff
structure will be implemented in 1996 and tariffs level adjusted as described in Annex 3-2. The
RADEEF's forecast financial statements are presented in Annex 3-1 (Tables 3-7 through 3-15).
3.07 The financial analysis for the proposed project suggests that the average sewerage user
charges of RADEEF should be at DHL.0 in 1996 and would increase to reach DH3.09 in 2002
and 3.61 in 2004. The first increase in the average sewerage charge of about 25% should be
in effect in January 1997. Thereafter, sewerage charges are assumed to increase by 17% each
year in average as foreseen in Annex 3-2. On this basis, projections indicate that these tariffs
would allow RADEEF's to achieve satisfactory operating efficiency and financial performance
throughout 1996-2002 period. They would allow RADEEF to adequately cover operating
expenses and other recurrent charges, including debt service and produce acceptable overaU net
cash generation over the implementation period. It would keep its operating ratio at a satisfactory
level (average operating ratios will be 82% decreasing from 909% in 1996 to 73% in 2002), and



- 12 -
generate a net internal cash, including customer contributions for new connections, to service
the debt (1.6), and cover a substantial portion of its investment program (33%). The RADEEF's
debt-to-equity ratio would be satisfactory, it would be kept at less than 50% as would be its debt
service coverage. Under the above assumptions, the average debt-to-equity ratio would be about
46%. The Loan Agreement would contain a debt limitation covenant, whereby no new debt
would be incurred without consulting with the Bank unless future internal cash generation were
at least 1.2 times future debt service, including that on the proposed borrowing, and the self-
financing ratio were no less than 25%.
3.08 The Government and the RADEEF cost recovery policy aims at preserving the short-and
long-term financial viability of the three sub-sectors. At the same time, it aims at ensuring that
low-income water supply users are serviced by the sewerage systems, and to creating appropriate
incentives for decreasing the quantity of domestic and industrial effluents and discharge of
wastewater through adequate tariff levels and structure. The current structure approved in 1994
that became effective in 1995 for RAD and RADEEF is still low compared to the potable water
tariffs and the expected level of services to be delivered. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that, the "Protocole d'Accord" signed on December 16, 1993 between the
Government and RADEEF will be completed with an addendum providing appropriate user
charges and structures (including identification of charges by category of consumer and tranches
of water consumption). It will include a provision for the annual revision of user charges on the
basis of updated financial projections acceptable to the Bank, and in the light of the Regie'
medium-term cash flow needs (para. 3.07).
The Arrears Issue
3.09 As has been the case for the Fifth Water Supply Project (Loans 3664-MOR and 3665-
MOR), the settlement of mutual debts is a national issue and does not only apply to public
utilities. Annex 3-4 is a matrix showing the arrears due to the Regies ONE and ONEP by the
Government and the Collectivites Locales (CLs) as of March 1, 1995. The arrears owed by CLs
is the major issue regarding Regies' own current liabilities. The national budget allocations for
1993, 94 and 95 to the Regies have not been sufficient to meet the costs of providing electricity
and water to the Administration as well as the local communities (CLs). Consequently, arrears
are building up. The Government is taking action to address the arrears issue through (a)
settlement of arrears of CLs and the Administration (see the Bank's letter to the Minister of
Interior of March 1,1995 given as Annex 3-5; (b) two vigorous incitations of the Minister of
Interior to the R6gies to curtail water and electricity to CLs which have been accumulating
arrears (Annexes 3-6 and 5-7) and (c) debt rescheduling which is currently being discussed.
During negotiations, the situation of the RADEEF arrears was examined and the apropriate
measures to be taken were identified and agreed upon (Annex 3-4).
3.10 Annexes 3-6 and 3-7 specify the RADEEF's legal right to discontinue service to
customers whose payments are in arrears. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
RADEEF would reduce private and parastatal receivables to under three months of billing by
1998, by strengthening its commercial department, and implementing new and appropriate billing
and collection procedures, including disconnection campaigns.
3.11 Fixed assets: Long-term debt. The addendum to the RADEEF's "Protocole d'Accord"
would provide, as outlined in the Fifth Water Supply Project, that sewerage assets will be



- 13 -
inventoried and revalued, and that the Treasury and the RADEEF would evaluate undisbursed
loans onlent to RADEEF. Fixed assets have been brought into account based on their historical
cost. The capital expenditure is assumed to be incorporated into the balance sheet at its actual
cost. The inflated balances of accounts payable and receivable are assumed to be reduced
sharply, under the proposed settlement arrangement (paras. 3.07 to 3.10), and then to taper off
slowly, to a more reasonable level.
C.   Audit and Iluac
3.12 The existing project agreement between the Regies and the Bank (under Loan 3664-MOR)
provides for an audit of the Regie by independent auditors. Agreement was reached du=i
negotiations that audited financial statements, project accounts, and special accounts be prepared
by independent audit firms acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with terms of reference to be
agreed on by the Bank, RADEEF, and the Government, and that the audit reports should include
auditor opinion on the commitment of RADEEF on arrears setdement, and submitted to the Bank
within six months after the closing of the fiscal year. The quality of the audits performed to-date
by independent auditors has been improved. Until 1994, RADEEF accounts were not certified
due to discrepancies in its accounting procedures and weak internal control. These discrepancies
are being addressed through studies financed under Loan 2825-MOR which recommendations
would be implemented in 1996 and 1997.
3.13 On the tariff assumption and arrears (paras. 3.08 to 3.10) and those of fixed assets and
working capital (para. 3.11), RADEEF would be able to perform its new responsibilities and
reach operational and financial targets outlined in paragraph 3.07. However, a sensitivity
analysis shows that cash flow ratio, and operating efficiency are particularly sensitive to
revenues, investment fluctuation and interest charges (Anne 3-3!. Therefore, the financial
situation will be closely monitored during project implementation.
3.14 Under the project, RADEEF will further develop the skills of the departments in charge
of intemal audit and organization, in line with the recommendations of the Regie restructuring
study (Anne& 4 and the ongoing study for implementing accounting and management systems.
IV. ECONOMC JUSTlCATION AND RISKS
l?oject benefits
4.01 The project would have major benefits stemming from: (a) reduction in the health hazards
to the local population through better sewerage infrastructure, increased connections and
treatment of wastewaters; (b) improvement of environmental conditions through treatment of
wastewater, separation of heavy metals from industrial wastewaters and rehabilitation of the
existing infrastructure; (c) promotion of local resource mobilization and cost recovery; and
(d) improved operational efficiency of RADEEF.
4.02 By the year 2004, year of expected completion of investment works, approximately 1
million people will live in the targeted project area. Currently, 480,000 million people are
served by sewerage infrastructure, and this number should reach 880,000 million in 2004 when
all the additional benefits of the project will materialize. The project would benefit the
population of Fes through the rehabilitation of existing interceptors and the construction of



- 14 -
wastewater treatment plants and would benefit the poor, in particular, since most sewerage
system extensions would be located in low income neighborhoods. The total additional
population serviced through the proposed project is estimated at 300,000 people to which about
200,000 million equivalent inhabitants are to be added, representing the equivalent increase in
industrial pollution. The project would provide a total of 21,000 social sewerage house
connections, and the level of sewerage service should increase from 65 percent in 1994 to 84
percent in 2004 for the project area. It is estimated that the implementation of the proposed
investments, excluding consulting services and technical assistance, will have a positive impact
on local unemployment rates by employing 22,000 person/year of skilled and unskilled local
labor. For the first time, sewvage would be collected in Fes and Marrakech (in this latter city
external funds would be provided by EIB), while in Casablanca additional sewage is currently
captured and channelled to an ocean outfall of 3.6 Km made operational in January 1995. This
is expected to greatly improve the sanitary situation of the area and reduce the diffusion of
waterborne diseases whose incidence in Morocco and in the project areas is still high.
4.03  Impact on health. More than 900,000 cases (3 out of 100 people) of diarrhea and 2000
of cholera were registered in 1993. Children between 0 and 11 years old are the most affected
group with 405,000 cases of diarrhea, and 33 percent of total cholera cases. The project area
of FRs, is among the provinces where the incidence of waterborne diseases is the highest.
According to the analysis carried out by Esrey (1991) on over 144 studies, sanitation facilities
would decrease diarrhea morbidity by 26 percent, and improved water supply and sanitation
would decrease child mortality by 55 percent. Since it is the first time that wastewater will be
treated in FRs and Marrakech and a large number of people will be newly serviced by the
system, the project is expected to have significant health benefits.
4.04 In order to evaluate the whole set of positive externalities and benefits stemming from the
project, a comparison of land values of sample areas in Morocco, before and after sewerage
infrastructure implementation , has been carried out. The appreciation attributable to the
expected benefits of the provision of sewerage infrastructure has been estimated at 4 billion DH
for Casablanca for 4500 ha of newly equipped areas and 570 million DH for Marrakech for
2,850 ha of newly equipped areas. For the city of FRs, data were not available. However,
given the scarcity of land, netland appreciation for new development, the value for the newly
equipped areas is expected to be at least higher than the one surveyed in Marrakch where land
is abundant. Some of these benefits are partially captured by the participation in project
financing of house owners' contributions.
4.05 Water re-use. In the inland cities of Fes and Marrakech, raw sewage is currently used
for irrigation under extremely bad hygienic conditions. The proposed project would make
available wastewater treated according to effluent standards allowing for wastewater to be used
in farming products to be cooked. The treated water flow will dominate the irrigation perimeters
by gravity down the slope from the treatment plants (2,000 ha and 200 ha for Marrakcch and
Fes respectively) - see Annex 4. The proposed project does not include the construction of the
irrigation perimeters which is currently undertaken by peasants. For the moment, no water
reuse for agriculture is foreseen in Casablanca where the treatment of sewage and the pumping
of treated water to agricultural areas, would impose an additional cost of around 4DH/m3. Even
if this cost is likely lower than the opportunity cost of water, this investment would not be viable
for RAD since the level of water tariffs for irrigation in agriculture is so low that it restrains any
development of a market for treated wastewater.



- 15 -
4.06  Impod mobilization of local resources and affordabil. The introduction of full cost
recovery of the proposed investments and management of the sewerage infrastructure by
qualified technical institutions in Fes and Marrakech, will overcome the chronic problem of
insufficient municipal resources for the provision of sanitation services. The project was
conceived in such a way as to limit the investment costs of this first tranche of investments as
much as possible and allow for tariffs that will be increased slowly over a seven-year period and
reach an average value of around 3.34DH/m3. It was estimated that, in FRs, yearly payments
for the consumption of 100 liters per capita per day (ld) in an average family of six people
would represent about 2.5% of the expenditure distribution average projected for year 2001, at
3 percent yearly increases in real terms during the 1991-2001 period and measured at 1994
prices. The yearly payments would represent 4 percent of the average expenditure for
consumption estimated for the cumulative distribution of 44 percent of population. Assuming
that the consumption of low income customers is likely to be lower than 100 lcd, i.e. 60 lcd,
the budget share of the urban poor would be 2.6 due to the tariff structure that benefits low
consumption customers. Table 5 in Annex 4 shows the budget shares for different expenditure
groups calculated at 1988 tariffs and 2001 tariffs. These values are within the range of
acceptability by Bank standards.
Least-cost solution
4.07 The project's physical components represent the first phase investments identified in the
sewerage feasibility study and master plans of the project cities. The most economic alternative
(sewerage systems working by gravity) was selected to meet the demand for improved sanitation
services and the expected quality objectives for the discharged effluents. For sewage treatment,
a phase approach has been adopted and different process alternatives have been studied and
compared by analyzing discounted capital and operating costs. In FRs and Marraketch, given the
cost of land and its availability, the lagoon anaerobic system has proven to be the most
economical. Capability of progressive expansion to meet higher effluent standards in the future
was also taken into consideration.
Economic rate of return and sensitivity analysis
4.08 Project economic evaluation for rehabilitation, and new investment components comprise
separate assessments for RADEEF and for the Regies considered during appraisal. The average
selling price for the sewerage service which will apply in 1999, year in which part of the project
is expected to start operations, has been considered in order to calculate revenues. The use of
the expected price charged for delivering the service as a proxy for benefits is extremely
conservative since most of the benefits deriving from the existence of a performing sewerage
infrastructure are not quantified and hardly quantifiable. The costs and benefits streams presented
in Tables 1. 2. 3 Annex 4, include the net additional cost of meeting the sewerage service
demand up to 2004. The expected ERR is estimated at 11.5 percent for RADEEF. Given the
nature of the project and the wide positive externalities that it would produce, the expected ERR
can be considered satisfactory. The ERR of the project is slightly lower.
4.09 The sensitivity analysis indicates that the switching values for tariff levels in 1999 is
around 1.60 DH/m3 at 1995 prices for RADEEF (see Table 4, Annex 4!. This condition
represents approximately the project tariff level estimated for year 1999. Therefore, compliance
with the proposed financial projections will be a determinant of the financial viability of the



- 16 -
project. A 20 percent increase in the costs and 20 percent decrease in the benefits will make the
project non-viable. This indicates that the project will have to be implemented on schedule and
according to the technical specifications agreed to avoid cost overruns. The benefits are in fact
less manageable since the amount of wastewater collected and treated depends on the level of
water consumption which is affected mainly by other variables than sewerage tariffs. However,
if the projected financial tariff increases are implemented in a timely fashion, the ERR for the
project will substantially improve even if there were a reduction of 20 percent in benefits.
4.10  According to a 1994 poverty assessment, about 18% of those whose incomes are below
the poverty threshold and 20% with incomes only just above, are concentrated in urban areas.
Basic services such as sewerage infrastructure have direct and indirect benefits for the well-being
of the population and its productivity. 50 % of the urban poor are served by a sewerage system,
25 % by individual systems and 25 % are unserved. The proposed project will extend sewerage
infrastructure to newly reclaimed areas, medinas, areas where social housing projects have been
carried out during recent years and where a high percentage of poor live. These areas represent
35% of the area that will be newly equipped. In these areas, the project would provide for a
total of 21,000 social sewerage house connections. Most of the existing bidonvilles will not,
however, be served by sewerage, but sanitary campaigns will be provided to improve the current
situation.
Risks
4.11 The project would not pose specific technical risks. The risks mostly involve the
Government's willingness to enforce the stipulations of the RADEEF's "Protocole d'Accord"
and in particular i) adaptation of the legal framework to enhance RADEEF's manageral and
financial autonomy; ii) needed sewerage charge adjustments; iii) settlement of arrears; and iv)
reinstatement of RADEEF's autonomy. However, the significant water tariff increases of 1992,
1993 and 1994, reinforcement of the Regies autonomy, efforts to reach a solution for the arrears
and positive Government attitude towards privatization, prove the Government's commitment
to the sustainability of water and sewerage operations. Technical assistance and training under
the project would reinforce the Government's and the sewerage operators' commitment to the
needed reforms, by identifying and enforcing the implementation of procedures necessary for
sound financial management and genuine autonomy. The appointment of financially autonomous
sewerage departments for the implementation, operation and maintenance of sewerage works,
would also minimize technical risks.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RE-USE PROJECT
Country and Sector Background, Water Resources
And Current Sec(or Organization
Country Background
1.    Morocco is situated in tihe northwestern comner of Africa. The Mediterranean Sea
forms its boundary to the north, the Atlantic ocean to the east, and the narrow fertile strip
of Algeria to the nortlheast. Elsewhere the country is bordered by the Sahara. The country's
four climatic zones reflect this setting: the coastal areas, the interior plains, the mountains,
and the desert. The inlteior plains and the coastal zone enjoy a mediterranean climate with
the interior having greater seasonal and diumnal temperature variations. Summers are hot and
dry, whiile spring and fall rains are generally light and irregular with the main precipitation
concentrated in the few winter months. Hence either natural or artificial water storage is
required to compensate for the seasonal and irregular rainfalls.
2.    According to the last 1994 census, 12.7 million persons, or almost 49% of the total
population of 26.1 million, were urbanized with urban growth rates averaging 3.5% over
the preceding decade. Natural growth accounted for about 60% of the increase, immigration
from rural areas for the remainder. In spite of the preeminence of Casablanca (3,531,000
inhiabitanits) and the capital area, Rabat-Sal6 (1,433,000 inhiabitants), Morocco has a well-
balanced network of small and medium-sized cities. About two-thirds of GDP is generated
in urban areas, and urban incomes are at least 30% higher than, and (have been increasing
twice as fast as) those in rural areas. The urban population is expected to reach 16 million,
or 54% of the projected national total of 29.6 million by the end of the century.
3. -  In spite of a slow down in urban population growth in the last few years, additional
urban growth and rural-to-urban migration can be expected given the country's present state
of economic development. Socioeconomic conditions are expected to give rise to more urban
growth and rural-to-urban migration averaging 3.4% p.a. thlrough the end of the century,
exacerbating deficiencies in the urban infrastructure. Since the Government decision, in
1989, to donate land to slum dwellers, most slums are now being replaced by permanent
dwellings, thus paving the way for the supply of basic services such as water, sanitation,
and power. The result is a substantial improvement in urban development througliout the
country.

4.    Since the 1980's, the Government has sought to improve the provision of sewerage
services, in particular in urban areas, first through an Engineering Loan in 1977 (IBRD
Loan No. S-7-MOR) and, in 1988, througli the Greater Casablanca Sewerage Project (IBRD
Loan No. 2826-MOR) that includes priority sewerage works in Casablanca and
Mohammedia and nine sewerage master plans for Agadir, Casablanca, Fes, Marrakech,
Meknes, Nador, Rabat-Sal6, Settat and Tangiers. Simultaneously, other sewerage master
plans have been undertaken for Tetouan through funds provided by USAID and the Tetouan
Municipality, for Kenitra through funds provided by the Kenitra Municipality, and for 137
ONEP centers, tirough funds provided by the KfW, CFD, ADB3 and ONEP, within the 5ti
Water Supply Project. Financing for urgent sewerage and depollution works were provided
by KfW  and EIB, mainily for ONEP centers.
5.    In the 1990's, additional funds have been provided by CFD, GtZ and OECF for
testling innovative sewage treatmenit techinologies. Despite these efforts, the sewerage sub-
sector is grossly underdevelopcd: several densely populated urban areas are not provided
with any sewerage systems, existing sewerage systems are under-sized and deteriorated and
domestic and industrial liquid wastes are often discharged near residential areas without any
prior treatment. The  environmental conditions  resulting  from  this  situation  are
unsatisfactory: public hcalth is seriously affected, water resources as well as the coastal sea
waters are polluted. Responsibility for sewerage services is vested in the Municipalities
(Collectivitds Locales) which generally do not possess adequate know-how and financial
resources to operate and maintain their sewerage systems and to plan and implement the
needed rehabilitation, reinforcement and extensions. This unsatisfactory situation is further
aggravated by a shortfall in finaicial resources in tlle 1980's wlhich led to the postponemeint
of several investmilcints, with particularly negative impacts on service levels for low-incomiec
consumers.
6.    The proposed project would address the sub-sector's most pressing needs arising froml
tie inadequacy of tie current institutional set-up and financial resources, inadequate
sewerage infrastructure works, physical deterioration and limited service to the poor.
Water Resources
7.    Water is scarce in Morocco. The annual rainfall averages 30 billion m3, of which
22.5 billion m3 are drained by the rivers and 7.5 billion m3 infiltrate and recharge aquifers.
TIhe overall national water balance is relatively well known and with the completion of the
water resources master plans for the major river basins financed under the Second and Third
Water Supply Projects (Loan 1724-MOR and 2006-MOR), almost all potential water
resources will have been surveyed. The water resource potential has been estimated at 21.0



- 21 -
ANNEX 1-1
Page 3 of 5
billion m3, of whiicih 16.0 billion m3, or 52%  of the potential, are being exploited.
Agricultural use was about 92% with the remaining 8% for urban (5%) and industrial (3%)
uses. It is estimated that the regularized volumes could reach 14.0 to 14.6 billion mn3 (or
two thirds of tie potential) by the year 2000, of which 12.0 billion m3 (90%) would be
consumed by agriculture and 1.15 billion m3 (10%) by potable and industrial users.
Although it is estimated that by the year 2000, supply and demand of water will be in
balance in the aggregate, the growth of demand, at about 3 to 4% p.a., is expected to
produce water shortages in tlie medium term.
8.    Most of the potable water supplied to populated areas up to 500,000 inhabitants is
groundwater from nearby aquifers. However, due to yield limitations, surface water
resources are increasingly exploited, requiring dams, conveyance over greater distances, and
tihe provision of pumping stations, treatment plants, and large transmission pipelines. The
physical, chemical, and bacteriological quality of drinking water supplied to most of
Morocco's urban areas is acceptable. However, this is not the case in most rural areas
where groundwater is often contaminated by unsanitary domestic waste disposal.
Sector Organization
9.    Study and development of water resources for all users is the responsibility of the
"Adminiistration de l'Hydraulique" (AH) within the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW).
This administration is also responsible for the operation, maintenance, and control of all
major dams. Management responsibilities of other water resources are vested witI thle
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Administration (Ministere de l'Agriculture et de la
Reforme Agraire - MARA), National Water Production Agency (Office Natiolial de l'Eau
Potable - ONEP), Local communities (Collectivites Locales - CLs) and their public utility
enterprises (Regics) an(d otlier agencics. The executive power of tie coordinating body, thc
Higher Water and Climate Council (Conseil Superieur de l'Eau et du Cliniat - CSE) is
linited. Allocation of water resources among various consueinrs is at present dcletriliicd
by a special commission within tie Prime Minister's OfFice.
10. -  Production of potable water and conveyance to the larger agglomerations is ensured
by ONEP under the supervision of the MOPW. The Regies are in charge of watcr
distribution in the 16 largest urban agglomerations. Ten of these Regies are also responsible
for electricity distribution; three for water, electricity, and sewerage; and one for water and
sewerage. The Rdgies are under die administrative tutelage of die Ministry of Interior (MOI)
thiroughi its Public Utilities Directorate (Direction des Regies et Services Concedes - DRSC).
Since  January 13, 1993, DRSC has had the role of the Regies' a posteriori control
(inspection). The finanicial tutelage of the Regies is the responsibility of the Directorate of
Public Utilities and Participations (DEPP: Direction des Etablissements Publics et des
Participations). The R6gies performance, although limited, is gradually improving throughi

restructurinlg, concerning in particular the six Regies participating in the ongoing Fiftlh
Water Supply Project (Loan no. 3664-MOR). While some Regies still exploit their owI1
groundwater resources, die quantities produced are small and are increasingly being
supplemented by ONEP's water. ONEP is also operating the water supply systems of 200
small-and-mediuin-sized agglomerations on behalf of the respective municipalities. In the
past, some ONEP centers developed to such an extent as to justify the creation of new
independent R6gies, while some others have been incorporated into existing ones. This
process is likely to continiuLe albeit to a limited extent. ONEP is a well managed autonomous
and sustainable institution.
11.   The construction and, to some extent, the maintenance of water supply systems in
rural areas has traditionally been MARA's responsibility with the rural communities
ensuring day-to-day operationis. However, with the implementation of the communal reforn
datling back to 1976, MOI now plays an active role in planning, implementing, and
operating basic infrastructure in the rural communes such as water supply systems througl
its Water and Sanitation Directorate -WSD (Direction de l'Eau et de l'Assainissenient) -
DEA  within  the Local Communities General Directorate (Direction  Generale des
Collectivit6s Locales-DGCL) - CLs.
WVater Supply
12.   Relatively higih per-capita investment costs in rural areas and budgetary constraints
hiave tius so far directed most of the investments to the densely populated urban areas where
limited financial resources can yield maximum  benefits. In 1990, 90%  of the urban
population had access to piped water with about 76% served by house conntectiolns and 14 %
by public stanidpipes. Operation and maintenance of the water supply systemiis is adequate
and the quality of water is acceptable. The water service is generally continuous. However,
in the rare cases of initermiittenit service, there is the potential risk of contamination from
sewage penetrating tlhrougih leaking water pipes. In rural areas, about 14%  of tile total
population has access to safe drinking water: 2% throughi house connectionis, 6% through
public standpipes, and 6%  throtigh public wells. Countrywide improvements in service
levels are being achieved throughi the responsible agencies, namely ONEP and the Regies
in urban areas, and MARA and MOI in rural areas. Government policy for urban areas is
to make potable water available through house connections to 90% and 98% of the
population respectively in 2000 and 2020. The remaining 10% and 2% of the urban
population would be supplied through public standpipes. Government policy for rural areas
is to make potable water accessible to 80% of the population by the year 2010: 10% tirouglh
house connections, 40%  through public standpipes, and 30%  through public wells. This
policy is consistenit with the Moroccan stabilization program  and institutional reforms
envisaged for the sector. One of the main objectives of the post-adjustment strategy is
poverty alleviation. Therefore emphasis will be given to increasing infrastructure services



- 23 -                                       ANNEX 1-1
Page 5 of 5
to rural areas whlich would increase service levels.
13.   The number of households served by house connections in the urban areas increased
by about 4% P.A. During the same period, tde service level for the population with housc
connections increased from 48% to 76%. The introduction, in 1980, of credit facilities for
low-income customers for financing the cost of individual house connections has contributed
more than 20%  of the improvement in the service level. A recent assessment of the
investments needed to meet future water supply demand showed that this would require,
depending on the desired service level, between 0.6% and 0.3% of GNP, or between 7%
and 3 % of gross fixed investmenits. For the Five Year Plan 1988-92, sector investments
totalled US$694 million.
Sewerage
14.   Sewerage has not developed commensurately with water supply. Although sewagc
collection systemns exist in most medium-sized and large cities, they have not been extended
to cope with the rapid growth of the population and industry. In most cases, they are
insufficienlt and poorly maintained. Communities in the hinterland discharge untreated
sewage into rivers, whichi are usually not perennial, whereas communities along the coast
disclharge effluent at the shoreline. This practice seriously pollutes the environment and
creates a major healtlh hazard. So far sewerage has been the responsibility of the CLs, which
face financial constraints and have limited know-how. Consequently, they have been unable
to ensure the proper functioninlg of their sewerage systems which are generally in a serious
state of disrepair. Maintenianlce often entails repairs after breakdowns. Lack of personnel
with adequate technical skills is common and compounds maintenance deficiencies. The
Govemrnment, with the Bank's assistance, has been examining ways to improve the
management of the sewerage sub-sector. In 1985, as a pilot operation, the Governmcnt
transferred the sewerage responsibility in the Greater Casablanca area from thie municipal
autlhorities to the water and electricity distribution Regie (RAD). In 1991 and 1994, this
experience was replicated in Agadir and Fes respectively where the CLs entrusted the water
distribution R6gie RANMSA and the Water and Electricity Distribution Regie RADEEF withl
responsibility for sewerage. A substantial improvement of sewerage services is expected
dtrough tde proposed project.

SECOND SEWERAGE AND WASTE WATER REUSE PROIECT
Drinkiti2 Water SUDily and Sewerage Sector Strategv
1.    The Bank strategy for the sewerage subsector is developed in a policy paper on water
resources management issued in 1993 and in the MENA strategy for managing water of 1994.
At the country level, the Bank strategy for the sewerage subsector is highlighted in a Watcr
Sector Review issued in December 1994, and in an Environmental Strategy Note issued in
March 1994. The Government strategy for the drinking water supply and sewerage sector was
elaborated in a sector strategy letter under the Fifth Water Supply Project approved by the Board
in November 1993. The proposed project would focus mainly on the urban population which is
most affected by sanitation problems and for which the sector strategy, as defined in the above
mentioned letter, is as follows:
(a)   For the year 2000: provide adequate water service to 90% of the inhabitants
through house connections and to 10% of the inhabitants through public
standpipes, and adequate sanitation to 90% of the inhabitants through sewerage
and individual sanitation systems; and
(b)   For the year 2020: provide adequate water service to 98% of the inhabitants
through house connections and to 2% of the inhabitants through public standpipes,
and adequate sanitation to all inhabitants through sewerage and individual
sanitation systems.
The current situation is that water service is provided to 76% of the inhabitants through house
connections and 14% through public standpipes, and 80% of the inhabitants are provided with
sanitation through sewerage and individual sanitation systems.
Government Sector strategy for the rural population is to make:
(c)   potable water accessible to 80% of the population by the year 2010: 10% through
house connections, 40% through public standpipes and 30% through public wells.
Currently, 14% of the rural population has access to potable water: 2% through
house connections, 6% through public standpipes and 6% through public wells.
2.    In the sewerage subsector, the Bank strategy is to assist the Government in the creation
of competent and sustainable institutions capable of: (a) implementing sound operations,
maintenance, and cost recovery policies; (b) efficiently managing sewerage works; (c)



- 25 -
ANNEX 1-2
Page 2 of 2
safeguarding the environment from pollution and health hazards through the application of
appropriate technologies for sewage collection, treatment and disposal; and (d) planning and
implementing adequate expansion programs. The present strategy hinges on the: (a) a pilot effort
in which sewerage assets were transferred by the Municipality of Casablanca to RAD, the
country's largest Regie; (b) development of sewerage master plans for 13 other cities served by
water and electricity distribution Regies; and (c) rehabilitation and expansion of sewerage works,
to include the construction of required sewage treatment plants, culminating in the appropriate
re-use of wastewater. Currently, RAD, RAMSA and RADEEF are entrusted with tile
responsibility for sewerage services in Casablanca, Agadir and Fes, respectively, through each
of their sewerage departments. Technical assistance (TA) and training are being provided to
RAD through Loan 2826-MOR, the sewerage department of which is satisfactorily run and
organized. The sewerage department of RAMSA, although weak, is improving its performance
through training and the purchase of maintenance equipment. The Caisse Francaise de
Developpement (CFD) is ready to fund TA and equipment for RAMSA to further develop the
capability of its sewerage department. Prior to shifting sewerage responsibilities from the local
communities (CLs) to other R6gies, competent and sustainable sewerage departments are to be
created within each R6gie. These departments are supported by adequate TA, training and
equipment and provided with adequate financial resources through user charges.
3.    The above development program and strategy are consistent with the Government's
objectives for rationalizing public enterprises, as supported by the Public Enterprise
Rationalization Project (PERL 1). They are being implemented through the ongoing National
Water Supply Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 2825-MOR), the Greater Casablanca Sewerage Project
(Ln. 2826-MOR), the Fifth Water Supply Project (Loans 3664-MOR and 3665-MOR) and the
proposed Second Scwerage and Water Re-Use Project.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WASTE WATER RE-USE PROJECT
Bank's Involvemenit and Lessons Learned in the Water SuDPlY
and Sewerage Sector
Bank Involvement
1.    The First Water Supply Project (Loan 850-MOR of US$48 million, dated July, 1972),
completed in 1980, supported the establishment of ONEP and financed the construction of water
production facilities for the coastal zone from Kenitra to Casablanca. This project also helped
the newly created ONEP strengthen its institutional capacity by financing the construction of
training facilities and consultant services for management development, in-service training, and
a tariff study. The project's main physical objective was to ensure safe and reliable water supply
to the coastal area of Morocco extending from Kenitra to Casablanca, through the expansion of
an existing water treatment plant, and construction of a dam, pumping station, and transmission
facilities. The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3721, dated December 16, 1981)
concluded that the project had achieved its physical objectives and was instrumental in helping
ONEP develop into a competent water production authority.
2.    The Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1724-MOR of US$49.0 million, dated June 1979
and completed in 1987) continued the strengthening of ONEP's managerial and financial
capacities, contributed to tie financing of the expansion of water production facilities for the
coaslal zone from Kenitra to Casablanca and Greater Agadir, and provided, on a pilot basis, tile
means for low-income customers to finance the cost of individual house connections through a
revolving fund. The Project Performance Audit Report, (No. 8725, June 8, 1990) concluded
that the project had achieved its primary objective and that the project benefits appeared to be
sustainable.
3.    The Third Water Supply Project (Loan 2006-MOR of US$87 million, dated September
1981 and completed in 1989), financed the construction of regional water supply systems, water
supply systems in medium-sized towns in the country's hinterland, and a substantial expansion
of credit facilities to finance house connections for ONEP's and three Regies' low-income
customers.  The social connections programs were satisfactorily implemented withi the
installation of 130,000 house connections since 1980. This was the first time in Morocco, that
the Bank (a) helped finance improvements to water distribution systems, (b) addressed the issue
of water resources planning, development, and management, and (c) became involved in the
rural sector by helping finance the Errachidia-Erfoud-Rissani Regional Water Supply Project and
a study on water supply systems in rural areas. This operation also defined and implemented
adequate arrangements to ensure proper operation and maintenance of rural water supply systems
oll a pilot basis. The Project Completion Report for Loan 2006-MOR was issued to the Board



- 27 -
ANNEX 1-3
Page 2 of 3
of Directors on the end of June 1993. An audit of the project by OED is currently underway.
4.    The National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project, or Fourth Water Supply Project, (Loan
2825-MOR of US$60.0 million, dated July 1987), which became effective in April 1988,
supports the Government's broad-based effort to rationalize sector development. This ongoing
project provides for a development program that includes the rehabilitation of some ONEP
facilities, the partial rehabilitation of water distribution facilities of 11 Regies, water resource
master plans for AH, and updating of water supply master plans of the same Regies. It was
launched concomitantly with the Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL I - Loan 2820-
MOR) under which the Government and ONEP signed a performance contract specifying their
respective obligations in terms of tariff levels, operating ratios, Ministry of Finance control over
investments, and the Government's contribution to ONEP's investment program. Disbursemcnts
of Loan 2825-MOR are progressing satisfactorily.
5.    The first Bank loan to the sewerage sector was an Engineering Loan (S-7-MOR of August
1977), which assisted in the financing of a sewerage study for the Greater Casablanca area. The
Project Completion Report of June 14, 1984 concluded that the project-financed studies had been
successfully completed and had assisted the Government in addressing the major aspects of the
sewerage sector in general. A follow-on project, the ongoing Greater Casablanca Sewerage
Project (Loan 2826-MOR of US$60.0 million, dated July 1987), which became effective in
October 1988, has been assisting the Government in carrying out sewerage master plans of nine
major cities as well as rehabilitation works in the sewerage system of Casablanca. Most of the
sewerage master plans are progressing satisfactorily, and the disbursement rate for the RAD
(Casablanca) sewerage rehabilitation works is improving due to the current strengthening of the
sewerage department.
6.    The Fifth Water Supply Project (Loan 3664-MOR of US$128.0 million and 3665-MOR
of US$32.0 million, dated December 1993), which became effective in September 1994,
stipports the Government policy towards the sustainability of the water, sewerage and electricity
distribution Regies and of ONEP. This ongoing project provides a development program
including rehabilitation, expansion and reinforcement of the water distribution facilities and
reinforcement of operational and managerial capabilities of six Regies (RAD-Casablanca,
RADEEF-Fs, RADEM-Meknds, RADEEMA-Marrakech, RAK-Kenitra and RED-Rabat-Sale)
and ONEP, including consulting services, technical assistance and training. Disbursements of
loan proceeds are just starting.
7.    In addition, seven Bank-financed irrigation and rural development projects include water
supply components providing for potable water at public standpipes in villages within the
relevant project areas. Two urban development projects provide for infrastructure, including
water distribution and sewers in the project areas.  The Pilot Project for the Communal
Infrastructure Fund (FEC), financed under Loan 2272-MOR, and the First Municipal Finance
Project (Loan 3616/17-MOR) are geared towards improving the financing of municipal
infrastructure investments, including water and sewerage. These projects also aim to strengthen



- 28 -
ANNEX 1-3
Page 3 of 3
FEC's organization and staffing, improve its loan preparation, appraisal of sub-projects, project
pipeline development, programming of operations, and financial planning.
Lessons Leamed
8.    The following main lesson learned from previous Bank operations was taken into accountl
in the preparation of the proposed project: with the main constraint for access of the poor to
sewerage service being the cost of sewerage house connections and the payment procedure, the
proposed project would provide for 32,500 social house connections, to be paid for in 60 equal
monthly installments. The proposed project would provide for sensitization and education of the
population to use sewerage systems in an appropriate way, and in particular to discontinue the
current practice of disposing solid wastes into the sewers.
9.    ONEP was the main beneficiary of the First, Second and Third Water Supply Projects.
The PCRs of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Project and the SAR for all projects highlighted the need to
strengthen institutional capacity and operational efficiency, and to maintain full financial
sustainability through adequate cost recovery. The two 'contrat-programmes" between ONEP
and Govemment and the six "protocoles d'accord" made between the Regies RAD, RADEEF,
RADEEM, RADEEMA, RAK and RED and the Government under the Fifth Water Supply
Project, would enable both ONEP and the Regies to achieve financial sustainability. Actually,
"protocoles d'accord" or "contrat-programmes" are lease contracts and can evolve towvards
"contrat d'affermage" or concessions and thus be an appropriate vehicle towards privatization
of water and sewerage services. The proposed project would apply the above-mentioned sound
principles to the Regies restructuring and strengthening through increased efficiency and
adequate cost recovery, in the framework of addenda to the existing "protocoles d'accord", to
cover the sewerage activity.

PRESIDENT DE LA BANQUE INTERNATIONALE
POUR LA RECONSTRUCTION ET LE DEVELOPPEMENT
1818 H. STREET N.W.
WASHINGTON DC. 20.433 U.S.A.
OBJET  Strategie du Royaume du Maroc en matiere d'assainissement
liquide.
Monsieur le President,
Dans le cadre de l'accord de pret relatif au deuxieme projet
d'assainissement, j'ai l'honneur de vous confirmer les termes de la lettre n
211/DCL du 17 Decembre 1986 constituant la declaration de politique
generale du Royaume du Maroc en matiere d'assainissement liquide et
visant l'amelioration des conditions de vie des populations, la protection
de l'environnement, de la sante publique et des ressources hydrauliques
ainsi que le developpement des capacites locales de gestion des
equipements urbains.
Les Collectivites Locales ont ete appelees a developper leurs
services d'assainissement par le recours a des organismes publics ou
prives, autonomes et specialises et par la recherche de nouvelles
ressources financieres permettant le recouvrement de coats des
equipements.
C'est dans ce cadre que s'inscrit le premier projet
d'assainissement en cours d'achevement, qui a permis la restructuration, la
rehabilitation et l'extension des reseaux d'assainissement du Grand
Casablanca. Ce projet a egalement permis aux principales agglomerations



-30 -                             AEX 1-4
Page 2 of 4
du Royaume de disposer de plans directeurs d'assainissement definissant
les dispositions d'ordre technique, operationnel, institutionnel et financier
permettant d'apporter la meilleure solution possible a moindre coit aux
problemes d'assainissement.
Concernant le deuxieme projet d'assainissement, je tiens a vous
confirmer la poursuite de la strategie du Royaume du Maroc basee sur les
trois principes suivants:
1) - Au Plan Institutionnel:
La Charte Communale de 1976 reste le document de base de notre
politique en matiere de decentralisation. Elle offre une souplesse et une
variete de formules en ce qui concerne la gestion autonome des services
d'assainissement, notamment la regie directe avec budget annexe, la regie
autonome existante ou a creer, les societes d'economie mixte et la
concession ou l'affermage a des entitees speialiskes publiques ou privees.
Dans les grandes agglomerations, le transfert de la gestion des
services d'assainissement aux Regies intercommunales chargees de la
distribution d'eau potable, en tant que demembrement des Collectivites
Locales, est preconise dans la mesure ou ces R6gies prennent les
dispositions necessaires pour rationaliser leur gestion et optimiser leurs
moyens humains et financiers dans un souci de rentabilite reelle du secteur
de l'eau et de I'assainissement.
D'une facon generale, les Collectivites Locales, sont appelees a
user des prerogatives et possibilites que leur offre la Charte Communale
pour developper l'organisation de leurs services d'assainissement. ll s'agit
d'une strategie contractuelle basee sur la responsabilite communale,
utilisant des acteurs potentiels publics ou prives. au niveau de leurs
capacites specifiques.
En creant en 1991 au niveau national, une Direction speialiske de
l'Eau et de I'Assainissement au sein de la Direction Generale des
Collectivites Locales, le Ministere de l'Interieur a contribue a la promotion
du secteur de l'assainissement et a permis la coordination des actions dans
ce secteur, notamment les etudes des sch6mas et plans directeurs engages
avec l'aide de la Banque Mondiale et des autres organismes de
cooperation.
2

Page 3 of 4
Dans ce cadre, ce departement a lance l'etude d'un schema
directeur national d'assainissemnent liquide dont l'achevement est prevu
pour le mois de Deembre 1996. Cette etude doit constituer un outil de
reference pour un developpement et une organisation colherente et efficace
du secteur de l'assainissement liquide.
En vue de donner une nouvelle dynamique a ce secteur, et de
fournir un meilleur service d'assistance et de conseil aux Collectivites
Locales dans leurs efforts de developpement et d'innovation des services
d'assainissement, un projet de loi portant creation d'une Agence Nationale
d'Assainissement est en cours d'etude. Cette agence serait chargee dans les
domaines de l'assainissement liquide des eaux usees, des eaux pluviales et
des dechets solides, de l'evaluation des besoins, de la definition des
priorites et leur planification, de l'elaboration des etudes, de l'examen des
sch6mas et plans directeurs, de l'elaboration et de la diffusion de la
r6glementation techinique, de l'assistance et du conseil sous toutes ses
formes aux Collectivites Locales et de la recherche des financements ainsi
que de toutes mnissions que les Collectivites Locales decident de lui confier.
20) - Au plan finiancier:
Les Regies assurant la gestion des services d'assainissement
doivent faire face aux nouvelles clharges decoulant de cette mission et
assurer A terme un autofinancement ad6quat des investissements qu'elles
devront realiser. A cet effet, elles sont autorisees, dans le cadre de la
reglementation en vigueur sur les prix, a recouvrer aupres des usagers des
redevances pour services rendus et a appliquer des dispositions tarifaires
appropriees au titre de la participation aux depenses de premier
etablissemenet.
Selon les premieres estimations issues des etudes des plans
directeurs d'assainissement, les besoins en investissement dans ce domaine
sont considerables plus particulierement en matiere de grands travaux
d'infrastructure et d'epuration. Ces investissements necessiteront pour les
prochaines annees un plus grand concours des pouvoirs publics.
En vue de limiter les redevances d'assainissement a un niveau
tarifaire raisonnable tenant compte des capacites contributives des
differentes couches sociales des usagers, la consistance du deuxieme projet
d'assainissement a et limitee en matiere d'epuration, a un premier niveau
de traiternent des eaux usees.

La strategie nationale en matiere d'assainissement liquide tient
compte au niveau de l'ligibilite des projets des criteres ci-apres:
- disponibilite d'etudes completes de factibilite et de plans directeurs
d'assainissement;
- disponibiite d'une analyse adequate d'impact sur l'environnement des
ouvrages d'assainissement proposes;
- transfert des services d'assainissement a des entites autonornes,

les services d'assainissement.
Pour le cas particulier de la vile de Fes le projet d'assainissement
retenu a fait l'objet d'une analyse environnementale qui confirme ses
avantages substantiels tout en indiquant les mesures correctives
permettant de reduire les impacts negatifs qui en resultent et qui seront
natureUement ndses en application.
Enfin, je souhaiterais attirer votre attention sur l'importance que
nous accordons a ce futur accord de pret, et vous assurer que la mise en
oeuvre des principes de notre strategie dans le domaine de
l'assainissement, sera poursuivie.
Elle s'inscrit dans une demarche globale visant la mise en place
d'un plan national d'assainissement, associant l'Etat, les Collectivites
Locales, les Etablissements Publics concernms et le secteur prive, et que nous
souhaitons concretiser avec le soutien technique et financier de la Banque
Mondiale et celui des autres organismes d'aide et de cooperation.
Veuillez agreer, Monsieur le President, I'assurance de ma tres
haute consideration./.                 ., 1 11 uIit.rictur

PROCEDURE DE GESTION COMMERCIALE PAR LA RADEEF
ABONNEMENTS DES COLLECTIVITES LOCALES (C.L)
ET DES ADMINISTRATIONS
La Regie prend acte de l'opportunit6 de la procedure telle
qu'elle est definie ci-dessous:
1.        Perfectionnement d'une procedure de gestion commerciale des
abonnements des Collectivites Locales et des Administrations qui doit
prendre en compte la creation de l'abonnement, la facturation des
consommations et des travaux, le recouvrement et, le cas echeant, les
r6siliations et les transferts d'abonnement. La procedure doit aussi
porter sur le processus de budgetisation des previsions des
consommations et des travaux qui devraient gtre definies sur la base
des abonnements pris en charge par les C.L. et les Administrations,
des consommations et les travaux realis6s anterieurement et des
hypothAses de consommations A venir.
2.        Justification des montants comptabilis6s par la RADEEF et
contestes par les C.L. et les Administrations et recours en cas de
besoin,  A  l'arbitrage  de  l'Etat.  L'analyse  doit  se  faire  par
anciennete de creance et doit d6finir les mesures A prendre A
l'chelle des C.L./Administrations et Regies pour assainir la
situation. Ces mesures peuvent inclure entre autre: 6cheancier
(maximum sur quatre annees 1996-1999), budgetisation complementaire
et annulation de cr6ances.
3.        La decentralisation  du traitement  informatique et des
procedures de releve, facturation, recouvrement et r6siliation, ainsi
que le suivi des travaux abonnements et leur prise en charge dans le
fichier facturation et le suivi des impayes devraient permettre de
r6duire les d6lais de facturation, relance et recouvrement a des
valeurs normales.
4.        S'assurer que la programmation des paiements des montants
echus, des conventions signes avec les C.L. ainsi que des impay6s sur
les consommations de 1992 et 1993 des C.L. et des ecarts entre les
montants factures et les montants des vignettes emises pour le
paiement des consommations des Administrations, conformement A la
circulaire du Premier Ministre NO 69 du 13 novembre 1992.

KINGDOMI OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RE-USE PROJECT
Project Description
The proposed project would focus on the city of Fes. As the cities of Casablanca and Marrakech were
also appraised, the following description includes the sewerage components of the three cities:
(a)   rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of sewerage facilities consisting of supply and
laying of interceptors, sewers, sewerage house connections and lining of existing sewers requiring
rehabilitation and ancillary works (manholes for inspection and maintenance, etc). The materials would
be reinforced concrete and PVC which are manufactured in Morocco. No pumping equipment is
required, as both the existing and future sewerage combined systems (transporting organic and
industrial sewage as well as drainage water) would operate by gravity. In the Fes Medina, the laying
of sewers will be closely coordinated with the laying of water pipelines in the framework of the
ongoing Fifth Water Supply Project (Loan 3664-MOR);
(b)   waste water treatment works consisting of lagoon anaerobic systems in Fes and Marrakech,
including floatable removal, making treated waste water available for re-use, in line with
recommendations made in the 8-th session of the "Conseil Superieur de l'Eau et du Climat" held in
Rabat in 1994. The limitation of treatment to anaerobic is due to the need to keep the sewerage user
charge within tolerable/affordable limits (see chapter IV), which limits the amount of first phase
investments. However, the anaerobic systems would abate the pollution in a very significant way, and
thus substantially improve the hygienic conditions of the current re-use of waste water. For Fes and
Marrakech, a pre-treatment plant is envisaged prior to the lagoon system to abstract heavy metals
(chromium, in particular) to allow the utilization of sludge for agricultural purpose and recover part
of the costs. For Casablanca, the depollution system already exists: it consists of floatable removal

Current Organization of the Regies
Organization and Management
1.    The regulatory provisions governing the management and operation of the water supply and electricity
Regies are set out in Decree No. 2-64-394 of 1964. The Regies have the status of autonomous municipal
utilities and are managed in accordance with commercial rules under the supervision of MOI and MOF. The
first ten Regies created during the period 1961-1971 have developed into experienced technical institutions,
partly as a result of the transfer of trained technical staff from the former REI and from the Morocco Water
Distribution Company (Societe Marocaine de Distribution - SMD), a private Moroccan company and
subsidiary of the French company "Lyonnaise des Eaux". The most recently created Regies are responsible
for water supply only. The Regies have benefitted from the Inter-Regie Training Center (CIRF), created at
RAD (Casablanca) in 1975, in building up their technical capability.
2.    A board of ten members supervises the operations of a Regie. The provincial Governor is the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, which also includes representatives of the MOI, MOF, and six elected
members from the local municipal council. Regie Directors are appointed by the Minister of Interior and
are responsible for day-to-day operations, although with some restrictions. Existing organizational structures
vary with the size and sectoral responsibilities of the Regies. To standardize the Regies' managerial
procedures and to implement a comprehensive MIS, the Regie of Rabat-Sale (RED) is currently executing
an MIS study within the framework of the ongoing National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project (Loan
2825-MOR). The results of this study will be considered within the proposed project.
Personnel and traininp
3.    The Regies salary structures, though somewhat lower than those in the private sector, appear to be
adequate when considering the whole compensation package which is designed to attract qualified personnel
interested in the career prospects of these fast-growing organizations. With an average of six technical staff
per 1,000 house connections in 1990, the Regies are not overstaffed when compared with other
Mediterranean countries whicih average seven to nine staff per 1,000 connections.
4.    In 1975, RAD was entrusted by MOI and the other Regies with the responsibility for managing and
training newly recruited staff for the operation and maintenance of the water and electricity distribution
networks. CIRF has been operating since July 1977 and offers two-year training courses from which 395
staff have graduated so far. This initial training, however, represents only part of the training needs of the
Regies. In July 1985, RAD assessed the Regies' training needs and concluded that existing CIRF training
capacity of 116 students p.a. should be increased to about 350 to allow for the recycling of administrative
and accounting staff as well as that of specialized technicians. The extension of existing CIRF training
facilities estimated at DH 15.5 million was included in RAD's 1987 investment budget.
5.    All implementing agencies have established their training programs and will seek Bank approval of
candidates' qualifications, the costs to be incurred at training institutions, and placement or re-integration
of trainees into the respective implementing agencies.

Accounting System
6.    The accounting systems of the Water Supply, Sewerage and Electricity Departments of the Regies
are entirely separate, with appropriate cost centers and overhead allocations. Accounts are kept on an accrual
basis. The general and cost accounting systems, which were inherited by the Regies from their previous
concession owners, have a general common nucleus but vary in specific features from Regie to Regie due
to the absence of a standard manual. There is no specific account for work in progress and with the
exception of assets with a less than a five-year life span, depreciation is replaced by a renewal reserve which
bears no relation to the value of assets in operation. Assets are accounted for at their historical value. The
Rdgies accounting systems need to be upgraded to international standards to provide adequate information.
7.    Aware of the above deficiencies which affect all Public Enterprises (PEs), the Govemment prepared
a new National Accounting Plan with the assistance of independent experts financed under the PERL I
project with PPF funding. A first draft Accounting Plan was completed in February 1987 and was circulated
among Ministries and PEs for comments. The New National Accounting System was applied in the Regies
between 1993 and 1994. A cost accounting study is also being executed by RED, also on behalf of the other
Regies, within the framework of the ongoing National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2825-
MOR), which includes assets inventory and evaluation.
Billing and Collection
8.    Billing is carried out by RAD on behalf of the 16 Water Supply and Electricity Regies. The period
which elapses between RAD's receipt of the meter readings from the Regies and its return of the bills to the
Regies varies between 3 and 30 days depending on the quality of the meter reading. Bills are sent out
monthly to industrial customers, quarterly to domestic customers, and bi-annually to Government agencies.
9.    Collections from domestic and industrial customers are generally adequate mainly because of the
possibility of curtailing water supply services and collection through the judicial system. However, collection
from Government agencies and CLs has been difficult. As a result, the Regies finances have been affected
by sizeable arrears for water sold, leading them to withhold payables to other Government agencies. To
avoid the recurrence of such a situation, a new procedure has been recently identified and put into
application by the Government, whereby each Government agency is granted a specific realistic annual
amount (in stamps called "vignettes") and the Regies are authorized to curtail the water service to
Government agencies whose payments are in arrears.

ANNEX 2-15
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RE-USE PROJECT
Limilation of Project Risks - Elaboration ol
the Environmental Analysis
Limitation of Project Risks
1.    The significant water tariff increases of 1992, 1993 and of April 1994, the progressive
settlement of arrears, the progressive reinstatement of the Regies autonomy and the positive
Government attitude towards privatization (on March 14, 1996 the Municipality of Casablanca
decided to entrust the responsibility for water, sewerage and electricity services to a private
French company) prove the Government commitment to the sustainability of the water and
sewerage operations. Technical assistance and training under the project would reinforce the
Government's and the sewerage operators' commitment to the needed reforms, by identifying
and enforcing the implementation of procedures necessary for sound financial management and
genuine autonomy. The appointment of financially autonomous sewerage departments for the
implementation, operation and maintenance of sewerage works, and the technical assistance to
be provided by ANA for planning, design and coordination of sewerage works (in particular to
small Municipalities), would also minimize any technical risks.
Elaboration of the Environmental Analysis
2.    The environmental analysis for the proposed project was carried out in accordance with
TOR reflecting Bank operational directives and was completed in March 1995. The team in
charge of this analysis consisted of specialists of the ME, of ONEP (the same who carried out
the environmental analysis of the Fifth Water supply Project) and several individual consultants.
This project, by improving sewage collection,, treatment and facilitating appropriate waste water
re-use and disposal, would significantly improve the environmental conditions by enhancing
public health through a drastic decrease of waterborne diseases. This project is currently
assigned to category B. Appropriate specifications to minimize environmental disturbance during
construction were identified through the environmental analysis and would be included in the
bidding documents.

be 4.5 percent in 1995, 4.3 percent from 1996 to 1999, and 4.2 percent in 2000 and thereafter.
Annual foreign price increases are estimated at 4.5 percent in 1995, 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3
percent in 1997, 2.5 percent from 1998 to 2001, 2.4 percent in 2002 and 2.1 percent thereafter.
The exchange rate in January 1995 was about DH 8.90 per US Dollar. It is assumed that the
exchange rate will vary in relation with those of inflation rates.
Financial Forecasts
2.    The Regies main financial statements, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Sources
and Application of Funds are summarized in Tables 3-1 to Table 3-18 in Annex 3-1.
Water Production and Distributions
3.    Production and consumption of water are estimated to increase respectively by about 2
percent in 1995 and 1996 and 3 percent per year thereafter for RAD, 2.5 percent per year from
1996 to 2002 for RADEEMA, and 3 percent per year from 1995 to 2002 for RADEEF. The
Regies efficiency is expected to progressively improve, reaching 75 percent in 1998 for RAD,
in 2002 for RADEEMA and in 2000 for RADEEF. The population served and new connections
are forecast to increase by about 4.5 percent per year. New connections are assumed to increase
by about 30,000 for RAD, 42,000 for RADEEF and 25,000 for RADEEMA over the project
period (1995-2002). Other related activities increase would be based on the number of new
connections and consumers at the end of each year.
Revenues
4.    Regies' revenues for each activity are forecast on the basis of the current average tariff
applied to the electricity and water consumers and to the volume of water consumed by users
connected to sewer networks. These volumes are estimated to be equal to the volume of potable
water consumed. The average sewerage charge is DHl.00/m3 in 1995. It is expected to be
increased by 17 percent p.a. through 2002 and by the rate of local inflation thereafter. The
average tariff will be increased to DHl.25/m3 in 1997 and would be further increased by 25
percent in 1998 and 1999, 10 percent in 2000, 20 percent in 2001, and 2002 and by 8 percent
thereafter. Revenues related to works and services for all activities are based on average price

for connection and number of new connections, charges for clearing and cleaning, and local
inflation rate.
Average tariffs taken into consideration are shown in the table 3-1A hereunder:

RADEEMA         1.48    1.63    2.04    2.44    2.93    3.22    3.55
Operational Expenses
5.    Maintenance costs of the existing facilities are estimated on the basis of their current
value. They include materials and external services which are forecast respectively at about 3
percent of the R6gie's gross fixed assets in operation depending on their composition and age
and the need for materials for house connections and network expansion. Wage increases are
estimated at about 11 percent of which 8 percent is for salary adjustments. It is assumed that
the number of RADEEF employees will increase by about 40 to fill new positions resulting
from the extension of networks in areas of intervention and from creation of the new sewage
activities.
6.    The Regies will pay the Government a 34 percent corporate tax based on their positive
net income or 2.5 percent based on their total turnover in case of negative net income.
Bad Debt
7.    A provision for potentially bad debts of 3 percent of total revenues will be used over the
1996-2002 period.

8.    The Regies only depreciate assets with a life span of five years or less, overall
depreciation is replaced by a renewal reserve which represent 5 percent of total fixed assets in
operation. For the financial projection, the average depreciation for water supply and sewerage
infrastructure and equipment of the Regies is about 4 percent, and about 5% for electricity
activities in the line with the Moroccan accounting code.
Interest
9.    New investments are assumed to be financed by loans at an interest rate of about 7.5
percent p.a. and .025 percent commission charges with a repayment period of 20 years,
including five years of grace. Financing will cover about 65 percent of the Regie's total
investment program. Charges for foreign exchange risks are borne by the Regies and recorded
as non-operating revenues and/or expenses.
Non-operating revenues and/or expenses
10.   Non-operating revenues and/or expenses take into account the exceptional profits resulting
from reintegrating depreciation of assets financed through customer contributions, and exchange
risk born by the Regies.
Balance Sheets
11.   Fixed assets have been brought into account in their historical cost. The new investments
are assumed to be incorporated in the balance sheet at their actual cost. Concerning water
supply as well as sewerage activities fixed assets, the "Protocole d'Accord" provides that these
assets will be inventoried and revalued in line with the procedures recommended in the study
initiated in 1993 in the framework of the ongoing Loan 2825-MOR.
12.  Inventories are assumed to be equal to six months of expenditures for materials and
supplies. Account receivables are expected to decrease at the same pace as those for water bills
from 9 months in 1995 to 3 months in 1998 for RADEEF. They will be kept at three months
thereafter. This assumes settlement of cumulated arrears in 1994 over the period of 1995-1997
and improvements in the billing and collection system of the Rgie. Suppliers are assumed to
represent three months of operating expenses and three months of investments. Other receivable
and payable essentially comprise income and liabilities to be received and or paid as well as
unpaid TVA to or by the R6gies and Treasury. Adjustment of previous accounts receivable and
payable as well as taxes and penalties due to the Government and various suppliers would be
offset in 1995, 1996 and 1997.

Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis to test the expected financial performance of the project indicates
that net cash generation and debt service coverage ratios are sensitive to changes in revenues and
size of investment program as shown in the following table. Tariffs, efficiency, and investments
and their impact on revenues will therefore be closely monitored during project implementation
with a view to maintaining an appropriate level of financial and debt service coverage ratios.

IEINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RIEUSE FROD3C
Economic Anvsk
1.    The purpose of this note is to explain the underlying assumptions and the methodology
used in the calculation of the rate of return of the project components to be executed by the
Regies. In Morocco, financial prices are close to economic prices, in particular with reference
to the exchange rate, interest, and tradeable commodities reflecting minimal overall distortion
in the economy. The Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) has been evaluated, by the Country
Operation Division, at 0.90. Project investments and operating costs are expressed in constant
1994 prices and are converted into economic costs by removing taxes and duties, and border
pricing the local component for all cost categories.
2.   Investment costs associated with the rehabilitation of sewerage infrastructure, expansion
of the network and treatment of effluents cover procurement of pipes, civil works, waste water
treatment plants, expenses for consulting services, studies, technical assistance and training
contributing to improving the efficiency of the existing system and expansion to unserved areas.
Cost of connections and revenues from customers contributions were not taken into consideration
in the evaluation of costs and benefits.
3.    Fes is the only Regie for which the proposed project finances physical investments.
However, the economic evaluation was carried out on the proposed investments of the three
Regies which were assessed during appraisal and it is presented hereafter. Directly quantifiable
benefits of the project components would be revenues generated by the collection and treatment
of waste waters carried by the system in Fes and Marramech and revenues generated by the
additional volume of waste water collected in Casablanca (extension and reinforcing of the
system represent 85 % of the investment costs. In Casablanca, the project is expected to raise
the rate of connection to the sewerage system from 0.7 in 1996 to 0.79 in 2004. 900,000 new
people will be served and 56 million m3 of effluents will be collected and channelled to the
outfall. The project components operated by RADEEF and RADEEMA which will likely start
their first investments in this subsector under the proposed project, consist of large rehabilitation
programs (due to the obsolescence of the existing system) and the installation of a waste water
treatment plant to treat the current and projected volume of waste water. In FRs, the project is
expected to improve the connection rate from 0.69 in 1996 to 0.84 in 2004 serving 300,000
additional customers. In Marrakech, the connection rate will increase from 0.8 in 1996 to 0.88
in 2004 serving 100,000 additional population. In both towns, the project will benefit, however,
the whole population since rehabilitation of the primary network and construction of the waste
water treatment plants will improve the service for all and will treat current and expected
effluents. To evaluate these benefits, the assumption that 75 % of the effluents being produced
by the population served through connections will be treated and will benefit from rehabilitation,
was made.
4.    The demand projections estimating the additional volume of effluents to be collected and
treated in the participating Regies during project operations are calculated with the same
assumptions that were adopted in the evaluation of the Vth Water Supply project, but they have
been updated to reflect 1993 and 1994 real consumption levels. They are reported for 1995 and



- 110 -                            ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 8
2000 in Annex 2-1. Revenues have been calculated by applying the projected tariff level in the
first year of partial operation of the project, 1999. The tariff, expressed in constant 1995 prices,
are 1.72 dh/m3 for RADEEF, 2.10 dhJm3 for RAD and 1.83 dh/m3 for RADEEMA.
5.    The AIC of providing sewerage infrastructure connecting by 2010 93%, 85% and 94%
of the population for RADEEF, RAD and RADEEMA respectively, was calculated. It was also
assumed that the quality objectives would be maintained. The AIC represents in this case a
benchmark value against which the projected financial tariffs are compared to assure that
resources are used efficiently (see Table 1,2,3, hereafter).
6.    The main unquantified benefit of the project is the positive impact on health and the
improvement of the urban environment. Attempts to quantify, as benefits, the costs of treatment
that would be saved if the morbidity rates of selected water borne diseases such as diarrhea,
cholera, typhoid were decreased because of the implementation of the project were carried out
during preparation and pre-appraisal. At the moment, however, specific information on
treatment costs, length of the disease by age group and duration of hospital study for each
considered disease, are not available.
7.    The practice of using raw waste waters for irrigation purposes is currently used on about
700 ha in Morocco, two-thirds of which are in the Fes area. In Fes, the treated waste water will
benefit existing perimeters which are currently irrigated with raw sewage. In Marrakech, a
larger area of agricultural land, around 2000 ha, designated for cultivation of olive trees, wheat
and beans, would benefit from the treated waste waters.
8.    Another way to look at the whole set of positive extemalities and benefits that sewerage
infrastructure can generate is to use hedonic pricing as an indication of the likely impact of the
project through a comparison of land values of a sample of areas before and after sewerage
infrastructure was implemented. During project preparation, each Regie conducted a smal
survey to evaluate the differential in land values. According to several developers, the provision
of sewerage infrastructure can influence land value appreciation even more than electricity and
direct water supply. The survey was done in areas that were already fully equipped except for
sewerage. Treating the provision of potable water, electricity and sewerage as equivalent to the
provision of complementary goods, it can be assumed that, i.e. only 30% of the appreciation is
attributable to sewerage services. In the case of Fes, data was unfortunately not available;
however, surveys conducted in Casablanca and Marrakech shed light on the range of the net land
appreciation value that can be expected in Fes where land shortages are experienced. In the case
of Casablanca, the average appreciation spread was 300 dh/m2 over a sample of about 3,000 ha
of different location and nature of development; this would mean 2.7 billion DH (1994) are
attributable to the expected benefits and extemalities of the provision of sewerage infrastructure.
If the same average value was applied to the project areas (around 4,500 ha) where extensions
of the system and new connections are going to be implemented and accounted for in the
probable rental values of that land, the project would have an expected ERR of 28%. In the
case of Marrakech, the average appreciation value was much lower, 20 DH/m2, also reflecting
the abundance of land around the town; however, considering the areas that will be equipped
during project implementation or where major rehabilitation will reduce flooding of sewerage,
the net land appreciation value would be 570 million DH (1994); also, in this case, the additional
value incorporated into the land price is substantial. Hedonic pricing helps quantify those
benefits that the population will get from the project that would remain otherwise unaccounted

for with traditional economic evaluation techniques.
9.    The R6gies apply differential water tariffs to residential customers, with the lowest tariff
level applied to customers consuming 24 m3 or less per trimester. For RAD, the first Regie to
start operating sewerage services, those who fall into this tranche of consumption are currently
exempted from paying user fees for sewerage service while a flat rate is applied to the other
tranches of consumption. Based on the financial projections for the three Regies camed out
during the preparation of the Vth Water Supply project and the proposed project, the average
water and sewerage charges are projected to reach their highest value in real terms by 200, the
following: DH7.5/m3 and DH8.7/m3 for RADEEF for the second and third tranche respectively
at 1995 prices; DHIO.9/m3 and DH14.2/m3 for RAD and DH8.1/m3 and DHIO.9/m3 for
RADEEMA.
10.   Assuming that the tariff structure underlying the projected average would be the same
as the current structure, and that the structure of the consumption expenditure distrbution would
be the same as in 1990/911, in Fes the yearly payments for the consumption of 100 liters per day
per person in an average family of six people would be about 1.2% of the mean of the
expenditure distribution projected for year 2001, at 3 percent yearly increases in real terms
during the 1991-2001 period and measured at 1995 prices. The yearly payments would represent
2 percent of the mean expenditure for consumption estimated for the cumulative distribution of
44 percent of population. It would represent, however, 4.3 percent of the household budgets
of the urban poor. Assuming that the consumption of low income customers is likely to be
lower than 100 lI/d/p, i.e. 60 lI/d/p or 43 1/d/p, the budget share would be 1.8 and 0.8
respectively due to the tariff structure that benefits low consumption customers. Table 5 shows
the budget shares for different expenditure groups calculated at 1988 tariffs and 2001 tariffs.
The values of budgets shares indicate that the expenditures for water and sewerage according
to the projected tariffs, are within the range of acceptability by Bank standards. However, these
calculations were done using mean expenditures for consumption calculated in 1990/91 at the
national level for urban areas. Therefore, during negotiations, agreement was reached with
RADEEF to carry out no later than December 31. 1998. a detailed tariff study for defining a
tariff structure more appropriate for keeping the budget shares of expenditures for water and
sewerage under 5 percent of household income or expenditures, if the latter is the datum
available. The study will also define the most appropriate and economically viable tariff
structure for each category of customers.
