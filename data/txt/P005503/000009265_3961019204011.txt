MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE WATER, ELECTRICITY AND SEWERAGE REGIE OF FES (RADEEF)
FOR A SECOND SEWERAGE AND WATER RE-USE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan in the amount of US$40.0 million to the Water, Electricity and Sewerage R6gie
of Fes (RADEEF) to help finance a Second Sewerage and Water Re-Use Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five
years of grace. The loan would be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Morocco. The project would
be co-financed by CFD.
2.          Background. While Morocco has been successful in providing water supply to
its urban population of about 14 million, rural water supply and sanitation have been developed
on a very limited basis. The progressive urbanization of the rural population is slow but constant
and is exacerbating the need for sewerage infrastructure. Water service is currently provided to
76% of the inhabitants through house connections and 14% through public standpipes, but only
65 % of the urban inhabitants and 35 % of the rural population are provided with sanitation. Since
the 1980s, the Government has sought to improve the provision of sewerage services, in
particular in urban areas, and has started a few programs with the Bank and other donors.
Despite these efforts, the sewerage sub-sector is grossly underdeveloped: several densely
populated urban areas are not provided with any sewerage systems, existing sewerage systems
are under-sized and deteriorating, and domestic and industrial liquid wastes are often discharged
near residential areas without any prior treatment. Responsibility for sewerage services is vested
in the Municipalities (Collectivites Locales) which generally do not possess adequate know-how
and have limited financial resources to operate and maintain their sewerage systems and plan and
implement the needed rehabilitation, reinforcement and extensions.  In a strategy letter
elaborated under the Fifth Water Supply Project approved by the Board in November 1993 , the
long-term objectives of this strategy are stated as, by the year 2020, adequate water service to
98% of the inhabitants through house connections and to 2% of the inhabitants through public
standpipes, and adequate sanitation for all inhabitants (through sewerage and individual sanitation
systems). The proposed project would address the sewerage most pressing needs arising from
the inadequacy of the current institutional set-up, financial resources, infrastructure works,
physical rehabilitation and service to the poor.
3.          Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Operations. The Bank financed two
operations in the sewerage sub-sector, including priority sewerage works in Casablanca and
Mohammedia and sewerage feasibility studies and master plans for nine cities. ONEP and the
R6gies were the beneficiaries of the five water supply projects financed by the Bank. The PCRs
of the completed projects and the SARs for all projects highlighted the need to strengthen
autonomy, institutional capacity and operational efficiency, and to maintain full financial
sustainability through adequate cost recovery. While full cost recovery is now being accepted
as a general principle and water tariff increases are following the agreements taken by the



-2 -
Government in the Fifth Water Supply Project, the six "Protocoles d'Accord" made between the
R6gies RAD, RADEEF, RADEEM, RADEEMA, RAK and RED and the Government under
the same project, would enable both ONEP and the Regies to achieve financial sustainability
while improving operational efficiency and strengthening institutional capacity. The proposed
project would apply the above-mentioned sound principles to the sewerage activity of RADEEF,
in the framework of an addendum to RADEEF "Protocole d'Accord".
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project fits into the Bank's CAS
of November 23, 1993 supporting Government efforts to deepen adjustment and reform, alleviate
poverty, strengthen public sector and natural resource management, and encourage pnvate sector
development. The proposed project is consistent with the World Bank strategy for water
resource management. The Bank has also conducted a Water Sector Review and prepared an
Environment Strategy Note, highlighting the Bank strategy in Morocco for the sewerage sub-
sector. The Government recognizes that the establishment of efficient and cost-effective
sewerage and pollution control management systems, as well as institutional management, are
critical to the country's overall development. Based on long-standing relationships in the sector,
the Government has requested continued Bank participation as a development catalyst, both at
the micro-level of sanitation and at the macro- level to assist in addressing intra-sectorial issues.
The Bank would lend to RADEEF which will bear the foreign exchange risk. This is consistent
with the Regies restructuring plan currently being implemented under the Fifth Water Supply
Project, whose major objective is the financial viability of the Regies at the end of the project
implementation period 1994-1998.
5.          Proiect Objectives. The project's major objective is to achieve satisfactory public
health conditions by transporting and adequately treating and disposing effluents far from the
populated areas; this would drastically reduce the waterborne diseases in the project area which
are the major cause of morbidity and mortality still registered today. The project would provide
social sewerage house connections to make sewerage accessible to the poor. The project will
be instrumental in alleviating the burden of poverty and enhancing public sector and water
resource management which are among the objectives of the country assistance strategy. The
project will also contribute to the effort of preserving water resource quality by adequately
treating industrial and domestic effluents. The project will also continue the effort of deepening
the financial and managerial autonomy of RADEEP and create the right environment for private
sector involvement, through stipulated reforms of the sector. Privatization has to be encouraged,
as it would not only improve the efficiency of sewerage services, but also generate funds which
would reduce the Government contribution to project funding. Last, the project would establish
a consistent framework within which it would replicate any further project in the sewerage
sector.
6.          Project Description. The project would provide institutional, operational and
financial assistance to strengthen RADEEF, in particular, in building up and reinforcing its
financially autonomous sewerage department. Other Regies would indirectly benefit from the
project, by replicating the same innovative approach adopted for RADEEF. The project would
focus on the city of FRs and include the following components: (a) rehabilitation, reinforcement



- 3 -
and expansion of sewerage facilities and pollution control works; (b) equipment to upgrade
operational efficiency and provide adequate maintenance (O&M); (c) consulting services;
(d) technical assistance to strengthen the sewerage service and allow private operators to take
over sewerage services; and (e) training. A special attention would be paid to the re-use of
treated wastewater, which is one of the priority issues emphasized in the 8th Session of the
"Conseil Sup6rieur de l'Eau et du Climat" held in Rabat in 1994. The project includes: (a) a
social component providing access to sewerage to about 135,000 low income inhabitants (US$4.5
million), living in the fringe areas of Fes through 21,000 social sewerage house connections; and
(b) waste water treatment plants to improve water resources management (US$16 million). The
total additional population serviced through the proposed project is estimated at 300,000 people.
7.          Project Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out by
RADEEF. The project cost is estimated at US$97.0 million equivalent including taxes, duties
and interest during construction with a foreign exchange component of US$51.5 million
equivalent (53%). The Bank would finance US$40.0 million equivalent (63% of the foreign
exchange including interest during construction estimated at $1.5 million or 48 % of the total and
23% of local expenses or 9% of the total) including $0.7 miUlion of retroactive financing for
urgent works carried out after March 1, 1996. CFD would co-finance US$23.6 million
equivalent (37% of the foreign exchange including interest during construction estimated at
US$0.8 miUion or 29% of the total and 14% of local expenses or 4% of the total). RADEEF
would fund US$18.8 million equivalent of local expenses (or 41%), including taxes and duties
estimated at about US$13.1 million. The home owners' contribution would fund US$14.6 million
equivalent of local expenses including taxes and duties (32%). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule (based on the water and sewerage sector average
disbursement profile) are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 15433-MOR dated
March 29, 1996, is being distributed separately.
8.          Project Sustainability. The proposed project has been designed to enable water
utilities to assume sewerage responsibility through financially viable sewerage departments,
which means in particular, full cost recovery including debt service, operation and maintenance,
as well as contribution of no less than 25 % of the investment program. The proposed sewerage
user charge adjustments, in line with the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), would guarantee the
efficient use of resources. Sustainability would be enhanced by promoting privatization of some
activities, e.g. , through concession and upgrading operational efficiency.
9.          AErd Actions. The Bank and the Government have agreed that full cost
recovery through sewerage user charges to approximate the long-term marginal cost (LRMC)
of sewerage works is the optimal solution to be pursued, in line with the Government economic
strategy consisting of discontinuing its involvement in services to be provided in local
communities (CLs) and also in line with Bank policy. However, the implementation of this
solution may face serious socio-economic constraints when sewerage charges exceed the
affordability level. The full cost recovery of economic and financial costs principle is affordable



for RADEEF, while in other cases assistance from concessional sources of financing to set
sewerage charges that are in line with the users ability to pay will be needed. The contributions
of industries and the tariff structure will result from a tariff study which is a component of the
proposed project. For small-size towns, sewerage user charges can be set at an affordable level
only if investments are funded through subsidies and concessional financing. This means that,
due to the limitation of donor grant amounts, most of the sewerage systems needed in the 235
small-and middle-size towns can be implemented only if funding is provided by Government
subsidies. Under this assumption, Bank funding in follow-up projects would still be feasible,
provided that debt service is assumed by Government which would yield the assets to the
communities as an equity contribution.
The Bank, Government and donors (CFD, EIB, EU, KfW and USAID) have
agreed that each city and town need to comply with the following eligibility criteria, to be
included in the nation-wide sewerage investment program, irrespective of the funding source:
(a)   existence of a thorough sewerage feasibility study and master plan giving full
justification (technical, economic, financial) of the recommended investment;
(b)   existence of an adequate environmental impact analysis (ELA) of the proposed
sewerage works;
(c)   satisfactory institutional set-up, by transferring the sewerage responsibility from
the Municipalities to autonomous entities; and
(d)   existence of audit report(s) of said autonomous entities.
The realization of the nation-wide investment program depends on the timely
availability of adequate funds at appropriate terms. The support of the whole donor community
being needed, the Bank has collaborated closely with the above-mentioned donors in the
preparation and pre-appraisal and appraisal missions of the proposed project.
The following stipulations agreed upon prior to negotiations have been complied
with: (i) transfer of sewerage responsibility for FRs to an autonomous sewerage department
created within RADEEF; (ii) availability of a draft addendum to the RADEEF "Protocole
d'Accord", covering the financial and operating performances for the sewerage activity and
providing for settlement of government arrears and new management procedures to avoid further
arrears; and (iii) a dated covenant for carrying out a sewerage tariff structure study.
The following stipulations agreed upon prior to Board presentation have been
complied with: (i) signature of the above addendum satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) reception
by the Bank of a sewerage, policy letter satisfactory to the Bank including, inter aia, the
eligibility criteria.
10.         EnviromnentWl Asnect. An Environmental Impact Analysis (ELA) based on
TOR reflecting Bank Operational Directives was carried out for the proposed works in the
participating city of FRs and in another eleven cities and towns, under the leadership of the
Ministry of Environment (ME). By improving sewage collection and treatment, and facilitating



appropriate wastewater re-use and disposal, this project would significantly improve the
environmental conditions by enhancing public health through a drastic decrease of waterborne
diseases and reducing the pollution charge of fresh waters. This project is assigned to category
B. Appropriate measures to minimize environmental disturbance during construction were
identified through the EIA and will be included in the bidding documents.
11.         Poverty Alleviation. Extending infrastructure to areas where poverty is prevalent
provides an efficient method of benefitting the poor. Extending social sewerage house
connections to urban areas only partially served by sewerage systems will improve the well-being
of urban poor and positively affect their productivity.
12.         Benefits. The project would improve the operational efficiency of sewerage
system operators and provide adequate sewerage service to the inhabitants of Fes. The project
would benefit the whole population of Fes through the rehabilitation and reinforcement of
existing interceptors and the construction of wastewater treatment plants and would benefit the
poor, in particular, since most sewerage system extensions would be in low-income
neighborhoods. The total additional population serviced through the proposed project is estimated
at 300,000 to which about 200,000 equivalent inhabitants are to be added, representing the
equivalent industrial pollution. The expected ERR is estimated at 11.5%. The quantification of
benefits was limited to the expected revenues stemming from the sewerage service evaluated at
the average selling price. The overall incremental benefits of collecting and treating waste
waters are expected, however, to be higher, given the wide positive externalities that the project
would produce. Waterborne diseases and infant mortality would be significantly reduced and
productivity of affected population improved. The project is also expected to substantially
contribute to the improvement of fresh water quality by treating domestic wastewater of Fes.
Substantial decrease of contamination of irrigated perimeters, due to the use of treated
wastewater versus currently used raw sewage is also expected.
13.         Risks. The project would not pose specific technical risks. The risks mostly
involve the Government's willingness to enforce the stipulations of the "Protocole d'Accord"
made or to be made with RADEEF, and, in particular, make the needed user sewerage charge
adjustments and settlement of arrears and debt owed to and by the Government and Regies.
However, the important water tariff increases of 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, the reinforcement
of the Regies autonomy, the efforts to reach a solution for the arrears and the positive
Government attitude towards privatization (on March 14, 1996 the Municipality of Casablanca
decided to entrust the responsibility of water, electricity and sewerage services to a private
French Company) prove that the Government is committed to the sustainability of the water and
sewerage operations. Technical assistance and training under the project would reinforce the
Government's and the sewerage operators' commitment to the needed reforms, by identifying
and enforcing the implementation of procedures necessary for sound financial management and
genuine autonomy. The appointment of financially autonomous sewerage departments for the
implementation, operation and maintenance of sewerage works, would also minimize technical
risks.
