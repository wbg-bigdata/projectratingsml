Project Risks
77.       Smallholder agricultural development projects are inherently complex
and the full attainment of project benefits may conceivably be jeopardized by
delays in implementation and inadequate staffing. These risks will be reduced
by having as a condition of effectiveness the appointment of consultant firms
to undertake the international recruitment of key project personnel. Risks
of a technical nature are not great because the technological packages are
conceptually fairly simple and are supported by research data and experience
obtained elsewhere in Nigeria. A major advantage for project implementation
will be the experience to date on the earlier Bank-assisted Gombe agricultural
development project.
78.       The proposed project would entail a significant increase in Bauchi
State expenditures devoted to agriculture from an estimated N14.6 million in
1980 to N44 million in 1985, and this suggests some risk that the State may
find it difficult to furnish all the necessary counterpart funds to the
project in a timely manner. In order to assess the magnitude of this risk a
special study of Bauchi State public finances was conducted by Bank staff
parallel to project appraisal. It emerged from this study that, despite the
substantial financial requirements of the project, total expenditure on agri-
culture would not rise significantly as a proportion of total State expendi-
tures but would remain in the range of 10-12 percent. This is due to the
significant increases projected in State revenues as the result of both an
improved national fiscal position as well as an anticipated increase in the
share of Federal resources being channelled to Bauchi State. Furthermore, a
number of financial covenants were agreed during negotiation that are designed
to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funding.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
79.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Bauchi
State of Nigeria, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement have been distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
80.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III to this Report. Additio-nal conditions of loan effectiveness are
that (a) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Bauchi State
shall be signed; (b) a commercial bank account shall be opened for BAPMU with
initial deposits of N5.0 million and N2.0 million from the Bauchi State
Government and the Federal Government respectively; (c) a commercial bank
account shall be opened for BASAC with an initial deposit of N1.0 million
from the Bauchi State Government; (d) arrangements shall be made for BAPMU to
have overdraft facilities with a commercial bank guaranteed by BSG; (e) an
action plan for the first year of project implementation shall be drawn up in
a form acceptable to the Bank; (f) BSARDC and BSADPTC shall be established and
gazetted with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; (g) a contract or



- 22 -
contracts shall be executed between BSG and consultant firm(s) having qualifi-
cations and experience acceptable to the Bank for the recruitment of staff to
BAPMU; (h) a program manager and financial controller shall be appointed to
BAPMU; and (i) a management contract shall be executed between BSG and a
consultant firm having qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank
for the management of BASAC.
81.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
82.       I- recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
NIGERIA - BAUCHI STATE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Federal Republic of Nigeria
Beneficiary:           Bauchi State of Nigeria
Amount:                US$132 million, equivalent
Terms:                 Payable over 20 years including 5 years of grace
at an interest rate of 9.6 percent per annum.
Relending Terms:       The full amount of US$132 million would be onlent by
the Federal Government to the Bauchi State Government
on the same terms as the Bank loan. The Bauchi State
Government would carry the exchange risk.
Project Description:  The project would seek to apply statewide the success-
ful experience of the Gombe project (Loan 1164-UNI)
which was located in the south east of Bauchi State.
Similar to its predecessor, the project would consist
of a package of farm support services and physical
infrastructure designed to benefit some 425,000 small-
holder families throughout the State. Support services
would include extension advice, improved seeds, farm
input supply and crop protection measures. Physical
infrastructure would include the construction and
maintenance of feeder roads and a major program of
rural water supply.
To implement the project the State Ministry of Agri-
culture would be reorganized to accommodate four zonal
units of management, each modelled along lines similar
to the Gombe Management Unit. A number of senior posts
would be filled initially by internationally recruited
staff and a massive training program would be under-
taken to upgrade local managerial and technical skills.
Consultant services would be engaged to recruit senior
staff and to support the project management with
specialized skills and services. A statewide study of
the highway system would be undertaken to assess require-
ments for the expansion and improvement of the road
network in support of the proposed project.
The technical risks of project implementation are not
great because the basic agricultural package is simple
and well tested. To reduce the risk of the project
being impaired by financial or managerial problems,
arrangements have been made to ensure adequate and
timely counterpart funding as well as proper staffing.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIA
FOR A BAUCHI STATE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$132 million
to help finance a statewide project for agricultural development in Bauchi
State in Nigeria. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 9.6 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan
would be relent to the Bauchi State Government on the same terms as the Bank
loan. The Bauchi State Government would carry the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last Country Economic Memorandum on Nigeria (Report 2428-UNI)
distributed to the Executive Directors was dated June 19, 1979. An updated
Country Economic Memorandum, covering the country's short-term developments,
is scheduled for distribution in late April 1981. An economic report examin-
ing the long-term economic prospects and policy options facing Nigeria is
being prepared and will be circulated later this year. Country data are
attached as Annex I.
Political Background
3.        The present civilian Government, headed by President Alhaji Shehu
Shagari, assumed office on October 1, 1979, following 13 years of military
rule. The Government's priorities and policies are set out in the recently
issued Outline of the Fourth National Development Plan (1981-85). Rural
development, increased food production, education, and low-cost housing are
focal points of the new administration's program. The desire for decent-
ralization, and the fact that in many states the opposition parties are in
power, constitute a formidable challenge for the Nigerian leadership in
successfully implementing a national development strategy.
Recent Economic Developments
4.        Although oil output rose rapidly in the early 1970s, reaching a peak
of 2.3 million barrels a day (mbd) in 1974, it was only with the quadrupling
of the oil price in 1973-74 that Nigeria's financial situation changed funda-
mentally. The dramatic rise in the oil income occurred at a time when Nigeria
ranked among the world's poorest countries and had a predominantly agricultural
economy, with manufacturing accounting for less than 10 percent of GDP.
5.        The Government's first concern, as reflected in the Third National
Development Plan (1975-80), was to use the new wealth to modernize the country.
The four-fold increase in public revenue allowed initiation of a vast investment



- 2 -
program, and generated a growth rate of 7 percent a year. Public investment
was concentrated on developing transport and communication networks, expanding
education, and setting up heavy industry. But the large public expenditures
also caused high rates of inflation in the early years and wastage of resources.
In fact, expenditures rose much faster than income, and within two years
deficits reappeared on both the budget and the balance of payments. These
developments brought the country to the brink of financial crisis in 1978.
6.        With the successive increases in the oil price over the past two
years - from US$14 to US$39 per barrel - Nigeria's financial position has once
again greatly improved. In 1980, export earnings and government revenue are
estimated at about 2-1/2 times the level in 1978. Federal Government expendi-
tures in the budgets of 1980 and 1981 have been allowed to rise roughly in
line with the increase in revenue. The composition of capital expenditures
proposed for 1980 and 1981 reflects the new Government s increasing emphasis
on agriculture, housing, water supply, and road maintenance.
7.        Nigeria's pattern of economic growth over the past few years has
displayed many of the characteristics associated with the development of other
oil exporting countries. High rates of domestic inflation, combined with an
appreciating value of the naira, meant that domestic costs of production rose
relatively to foreign costs. At the same time, costs in such purely domestic
sectors as construction and services (where supplies could not be augmented
through imports) rose at a more rapid pace than costs in the tradeable sectors.
Consequently, agriculture and manufacturing were placed at a disadvantage
vis-a-vis both foreign produced goods (which became relatively cheaper) and
purely domestic sectors (which became more profitable). In the agricultural
sector, the output of subsistence crops as well as traditional export crops
stagnated. The manufacturing sector too found it difficult to compete with
imports, despite extensive government incentives, and suffered from rising
costs and infrastructure bottlenecks.
Poverty and Basic Needs
8.        Nigeria has an estimated population of 83 million (1979) and a per
capita income of about US$670. Although Nigeria is placed among the middle-
income countries, acute poverty is still widespread. In 1978, an estimated 35
percent of the households in the urban areas and 55 percent in the rural areas
were unable to meet the minimum expenditure required for food and other
necessities of life. A substantial portion--20 percent of all households in
urban areas and 40 percent in rural areas--did not have incomes adequate to
meet even basic food requirements.
9.        In terms of such health indicators as infant mortality, life expec-
tancy, and incidence of disease, Nigeria is not much better than the poorest
countries in Africa. Infant mortality is believed to be well over 100 per
thousand, and life expectancy still under 50 years. This is in spite of a
substantial rise in the number of doctors, nurses, and hospitals in relation
to Nigeria's population. Reduction of mortality in Nigeria, as in other coun-
tries experiencing rapid rises in income, will be a slow process, requiring



- 3 -
the spread of an effective primary health care system and progress on a range
of related socio-economic factors, particularly nutrition, primary education,
and water supply.
10.       Nigeria has, however, taken big strides in human resource develop-
ment through the Government's firm commitment to universal primary education
(UPE). As a result, some 60 percent of the school age children are now
enrolled, and in several parts of the south, UPE is already a reality. The
pace at which the program was pursued inevitably created problems, e.g. lack
of trained teachers, deterioration in the quality of education, diversion of
labor from agriculture, and a rising demand for secondary education. But
these initial troubles are likely to ease when the rate of expansion stabi-
lizes. Within the next two decades Nigeria should be transformed from a
country with very high rates of illiteracy to one where most of the population
has been to school.
11.       Although there was little increase in agricultural output during
most of the 1970s, off-farm rural activity expanded considerably, mostly from
public expenditures on construction following the oil boom. Rural incomes
were also augmented by the rapid growth in the service sectors and a probable
increase in remittances from urban areas. The growth in incomes appears to
have been spread widely and to have relieved the rural poverty somewhat.
12.       In urban areas, formal sector employment rose rapidly, perhaps
around 8 percent a year in the 1970s. But real wages appear not to have risen
over the last 15 years. In 1975, there was a substantial increase in public
sector wages, promptly followed by an increase in the private sector. But
this gain was quickly eroded by the ensuing high inflation and the Government-s
restraint on further wage increases as part of its policy to control inflation.
Nevertheless, average real wage earnings appear to have risen as a result of
the distribution of employment moving towards the higher paying sectors. Fur-
thermore, since formal sector employment rose in relative terms, an increasing
proportion of the labor force came to enjoy a higher standard of living.
Although the relative size of the informal sector appears to have declined
slightly over the past decade, it still is the dominant mode of employment in
urban areas. Because of the rapid expansion in construction, trade and
commerce, the income earning possibilities in this sector remained generally
good, and average real incomes at the lower end of the scale probably remained
stable, or even improved slightly.
Economic Prospects
13.       As the major source of public revenue and foreign exchange earnings,
oil is basic to an assessment of Nigeria's long-term economic prospects. On
present knowledge, Nigeria-s oil output over the next decade is not expected
to be sustained above the current average of 2.15 mbd; by 1990 it may even
begin to decline. With domestic consumption of oil products rising rapidly
(over 15 percent a year), the exportable surplus is expected to decline from
the current rate of over 90 percent of output to about 70 percent by 1990.
Thus, if past trends persist, and no new sources of export earnings and public



- 4 -
revenue are developed to make up for the relative decline of the oil sector,
Nigeria's balance of payments and fiscal situation can be expected to tighten
over time. Even with a relatively moderate rise in imports, large current
account deficits can be expected to reappear towards the end of the 1980s,
leading to a deterioration in the balance of payments in the l990s, when
maintenance of steady economic growth will become increasingly difficult.
Budgetary deficits could appear even sooner, threatening domestic economic
stability. Future dramatic increases in the oil price may postpone the
financial difficulties, but this is a risky basis for formulating a long-term
growth strategy.
14.       In order that dependence on imports may decline and non-oil exports
may gradually begin to replace oil exports, projections suggest that Nigeria
has roughly ten years to make the necessary structural adjustments. Accelera-
ting growth in the agricultural sector - which grew by only 1 percent a year in
the 1970s - will be the most difficult task. The growth of the other sectors
of the economy, such as power, transport, and construction, should receive its
impulse primarily from commodity production. The expected rapid increase in
population and labor force (estimated at over 3 percent a year) necessitates
maintaining a fairly high rate of economic growth over the next two decades.
15.       The Government of Nigeria is committed to achieving a balanced and
sustainable economic growth path. The Outline of the Fourth National Develop-
ment Plan indicates that, while the unfinished projects from the Third Plan
period would be speedily completed, greater emphasis will be placed on sti-
mulating agricultural production. A target of food self-sufficiency by 1985
has been set, and a Food Production Plan has just been completed. It sets out
the Government's agricultural strategy over the coming five years, which is
centered on raising the productivity of smallholders. While the target is
ambitious, and may not be achieved within the plan period, it is indicative of
the high priority that is being attached to this sector. There is likely to
be strong emphasis again on education, as in the past, but the expected in-
clusion of a large low-cost housing program would be a new departure. Given
the great improvement in Nigeria's financial prospects, and assuming an active
private sector, domestic investment is expected to be maintained at a high
level. This should permit the economy to grow at around 5 percent a year--
more than 6 percent for non-oil GDP--with fair potential for employment
generation.
16.       The availability of skilled manpower will remain a major constraint
on economic development over the coming years. Although the Government has
given high priority to manpower development, there are still severe shortages
in several lines of activity. The dependence on expatriates is particularly
high in scientific and technical occupations. The demand for middle-level
skills is expected to rise rapidly with an increasing emphasis in government
programs on poverty alleviation, education, and preventive health. In the
short-term, expatriates may alleviate some of these shortages, but ultimately
the solution lies in improving the quality and coverage of education and
expansion of pre-service and in-service training programs.



External Borrowing and Creditworthiness
17.       Total debt outstanding (including undisbursed) amounted to US$7
billion at the end of 1980. A limited amount of borrowing on commercial terms
is expected to continue. However, by the mid-1980s, when the debt service on
currently contracted loans will peak, payments will still amount to no more
than 5 percent of export earnings. The World Bank's share in total debt
outstanding amounts to about 15 percent. Given the relatively low level of
external indebtedness, the Government's generally cautious approach to external
borrowing, and the favorable prospects for oil, the debt service is likely to
remain around 5 percent through 1990. Under the circumstances, Nigeria is
creditworthy for considerable Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA 1/
18.       Bank and IDA lending to Nigeria as of February 28, 1981 amounted to
US$1,408.5 million (net of cancellations). The amount of these loans and
credits disbursed as of February 28, 1981 was US$726.0 million, leaving an
undisbursed balance of US$682.5 million. Transport, power and water supply
together account for about 50 percent of total commitments; agriculture for
about 31 percent (most of which was committed in the last six fiscal years);
and education, industry, urban and the post-war rehabilitation loan for the
remaining 19 percent of total commitments. Gross disbursements in FY79 were
about US$60 million, and US$64 million in FY80, but are expected to increase
in the coming years in line with the expansion of Bank lending to Nigeria.
There have been only two IDA credits to Nigeria, for US$35.3 million; both
are fully disbursed. IFC has made five loans to borrowers totalling US$17.4
million, and six equity investments totalling US$5.4 million. Of these
amounts, US$4.2 million have been repaid, cancelled, or sold. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments,
as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       The main thrust of the Bank's activities in Nigeria in recent
years has been to support agriculture and rural development, with particular
emphasis on institution-building and transfer of technology. These objec-
tives are in consonance with the Federal Government's priorities under the
Third Plan, which places considerable emphasis on agriculture, and its
policy to use the proceeds of Nigeria-s oil revenues to increase the pro-
ductive capacity of the economy, and thereby raise the standard of living of
its population, particularly the rural poor.
20.       In view of the interest which Nigeria has expressed in greater
Bank involvement, an expanded Bank lending program has been initiated.
In developing a broader approach to lending in Nigeria, a central objective
is to encourage the shift (already discernable in the Federal Government's
1/   This section is substantially unchanged from the President's Report
for a Sixth Highway Project approved by the Board on June 24, 1980.



- 6 -
investment programming) away from the massive and diffused infrastructure
investment, which characterized the two or three years following the oil
boom of 1973/74, towards a more discriminating support for growth in the
commodity producing sectors. A second objective of Bank lending is to raise
the productivity of the lowest income groups and thereby diminish the
incidence of absolute poverty in Nigeria. This objective has been actively
pursued in recent agricultural projects which benefit some of the very
lowest income groups. Agricultural lending of this kind would continue to
figure prominently in the future lending program. A third objective of Bank
lending is to support the Federal Government's efforts to diversify the
economy, and reduce the excessive dependence upon petroleum as a source of
foreign exchange and fiscal revenue. Agricultural lending, in particular,
would include strengthening the potential for export crops such as cocoa.
21.       The directly productive sectors constitute an appropriate focus
for an expanded lending program. Projects in both agriculture and industry
together should account for a large share of Bank lending in the coming two
or three years. Effective support for the commodity producing sectors will
also require strategic investment in production-related infrastructure,
however. There would appear to be good opportunities for the Bank to make a
significant contribution in power, water supply, and highway maintenance.
Further project identification work is under way in these sectors. Similarly,
there is a strong case for continued lending for education. In this context,
it is proposed that vocational, technical, and teacher training be given
special emphasis. Finally, the Bank would support the Federal and state
governments' efforts to spread the benefits of growth to the social sectors.
It is envisaged that some of the pressing problems of rapid urbanization will
continue to be addressed through a number of urban development projects, along
the lines of the ongoing project in Bauchi State, focussed on the needs of the
urban poor. A sectoral distribution of lending along these lines would be in
keeping with the need to generate employment, and would also support the
Federal Government's aim of mobilizing Nigeria's petroleum revenues to
alleviate poverty and improve the overall distribution of income.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
22.       Agriculture continues to play an important role in the Nigerian
economy despite the prominence of the petroleum sector. Approximately 60
percent of Nigeria's population is dependent upon agriculture for its prin-
cipal source of employment and income. Value added by agriculture accounts
for almost one-quarter of GDP, and almost 40 percent if petroleum production
is excluded. However, production has fluctuated significantly from year to
year, and there was hardly any real growth of value added during the period
1970-78. At the same time, food prices rose precipitously as demand out-
stripped domestic supply. Yet this sector must continue to play a key role
in the economy both as an employer and as the source of food for the rapidly
growing urban population.



23.       Agricultural production is almost entirely in the hands of small-
holders, with the typical unit being a family farm of 2-4 hectares. Little
use is made of modern inputs, such as fertilizer and improved seeds, or of
mechanized techniques. As a result, yields are very low, and in some cases
have even declined because of deteriorating soil fertility. The incidence
of rural poverty is high, and in some areas, malnutrition is a serious
problem. Although there is some cultivation of cash crops--oil palm, cocoa
and other trees in the south and groundnuts and cotton in the north--almost
every farm family grows some of its food requirements. Only a relatively
small proportion of these food crops enters commercial trade for shipment to
other areas, mainly to the urban centers and to the food deficit areas of the
south.
24.       Rapid development in the non-agricultural sectors and rising
standards of education, both of which contrast sharply with the poor returns
to labor and drudgery of traditional agriculture, have encouraged the drift
of young people away from rural areas. In the long run, a prosperous agricul-
tural sector capable of reducing this drift can be achieved only through the
application of more advanced farming techniques that would provide significant
increases in income per man-day.
Country Policies and Performance
25.       Successsive governments have emphasized the need to improve
performance in the agricultural sector. In the Third Five-Year Development
Plan (1975-80), US$4.8 billion was earmarked for agriculture. Although the
plan's target growth rate for agriculture was set at 5 percent per annum, the
estimated actual rate did not exceed 1 percent. Annual imports of food rose
from about US$300 million in 1974 to about US$1,500 million in 1978, and
agricultural exports declined steadily. If this trend were to continue it
could result in a food deficit in 1990 of 11 million tons (cereal equivalent),
or about 40 percent of demand.
26.       The disappointing performance of the agricultural sector can be
attributed in large part to previous policies which placed strong emphasis on
large-scale irrigation and intensively mechanized government-run schemes with
generally disappointing production results. At the same time, little was
done to develop essential support services aimed at the farming community as
a whole. Despite the declared intentions in the Plan, small-holders, who
produce 90 percent of total agricultural output, were not the principal focus
of the agricultural strategy. The few government sponsored progams for the
development of smallholder agriculture have suffered from poor management, a
shortage of funds, and from being stretched too thinly in order to cover all
states. Against this background Bank-supported agricultural development
projects (ADPs) have succeeded in achieving significant advances in small-
holder agriculture. As a consequence the Federal Government is now seeking
to base its medium-term sector program upon the ADP model.
27.       Upon assuming office in October 1979, the new government announced
that it would give high priority to agriculture with the objective of elimi-
nating Nigeria-s dependence upon food imports by the mid-1980s. To recommend



- 8 -
a plan of action for achieving this objective the Government established a
food strategy commission in which the Bank was invited to participate.
A final report entitled "The Green Revolution: A Food Production Plan for
Nigeria was published in May 1980 and the principal recommendations were
accepted by the Government.
28.       This Food Production Plan (FPP) acknowledged that the target of
eliminating Nigeria's dependence upon food imports by 1985 was probably over-
ambitious. It recommended the adoption of a 4 percent annual growth target as
the maximum that could be applied realistically to the agricultural sector.
It is particularly noteworthy that, in weighing the alternative strategies of
large-scale mechanization against a discerning support for smallholder agricul-
ture, the FPP came down squarely in favor of the latter. To supplement the
program of Bank-supported ADPs the FPP proposed the immediate implementation
of a concurrent smallholder program for the residual areas not yet covered by
ADPs. The nation-wide program would contain most key elements of the ADP
concept but in a less intensive package and with lower managerial demands.
The program was endorsed by the Government early in 1981 and the Bank was
asked to provide technical assistance in support of implementation. To this
end, a proposed Bank loan in support of an agricultural technical assistance
project has been negotiated and is expected to be presented to the Board
before the end of this fiscal year.
Development Constraints
29.       One of the principal constraints to the development of the sector
is the lack of effective agricultural support services. The transport of
produce is hampered by a lack of feeder roads. Many farmers have to travel
long distances to obtain fertilizers and other basic farm inputs which, in
many cases, are supplied only irregularly. Consequently, even with the
prevailing high levels of subsidies on farm inputs, farm production has not
increased significantly and has actually declined in some areas. Extension
services are generally deficient and the new technologies that are available
are not reaching farmers in remote rural areas. A greater effort is also
required, particularly by the agricultural research institutions, to improve
the technical, economic and financial analysis of farming innovations and
adapt them to the diverse socio-ecological conditions of Nigeria.
30.       Shortcomings in the efficiency of commercial support services to
agriculture have also constrained growth. Agricultural supply services remain
almost entirely in the hands of the public sector, whose administrative
capabilities are already overstrained. Given the size of Nigeria's massive
development program, the Government should divest itself progressively of
responsibilities for marketing farm inputs because this function can be
handled more efficiently by private enterprise. In this respect, it is
encouraging that the FPP favors preparing the way for greater participation
of the private sector in agricultural supply services.
31.       The government-s policy of maintaining a relatively fixed exchange
rate during a period of domestic inflation has adversely affected the price-
competitiveness of some domestic farm produce vis-a-vis imported foodstuffs,



- 9 -
and the policy of subsidizing farm inputs has not succeeded in compensating
fully for this handicap.   In an effort to protect domestic producers from an
influx of imported farm products, the Government has placed quantitative
restrictions and even outright bans on the import of some commodities. The
strategic objective has been to admit imports only to the extent that domestic
production falls short of demand. However, this is a difficult policy to
administer in practice and it has not been able to prevent cross substitution
by consumers between traditional indigenous foods such as cassava and yam on
the one hand and imported foods such as wheat on the other. The FPP recom-
mends that the Government make greater use of import duties to establish an
appropriate structure of price signals, an approach that should prove more
effective than the prohibition of specific commodity imports.
32.       Government policies for the subsidization of farm inputs have not
always worked to the advantage of the farmers and, in the case of fertilizers,
have served to remove the incentive for private sector participation in the
distribution system, thereby creating problems of availability. The Bank has
consistently urged a lower level of subsidy in the interest of efficiency and
equality. It is encouraging to note that the FPP also recommended a lower
level of subsidization. While the Federal Government agrees with the prin-
ciple of reducing subsidies, for political reasons it is likely to adopt a
cautious approach to the gradual phasing out of input subsidies.
33.       The prospects for agricultural development, however, depend even
more critically upon procedures for the timely international procurement of
fertilizer and upon the mechanisms for financing the subsidy than upon the
level of the subsidy itself. The prevailing institutional arrangements for
the procurement and the finance of the subsidy have proved unsatisfactory. To
overcome these problems, the Government has now approved the establishment of
a public company operating along commercial lines for the procurement of
fertilizer (see paragraph 66 below).
Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
34.       Agriculture forms the core of the Bank's lending to Nigeria:
since 1974, nineteen loans for agriculture totalling US$443 million have been
approved, and loans to this sector constitute almost half of the proposed
lending program for FY 1981-85. The central objective of Bank involvement in
the sector has been to increase food production and thereby raise the incomes
of rural dwellers, who are amongst the poorest in Nigeria. To this end, a
major effort has been made to develop the abilities of agencies at all levels
of government to prepare and implement agricultural projects. The Bank also
supports the Federal Government's effort to decentralize agricultural develop-
ment and to build up the role of the recently created Local Government Councils.
Yet another instrument that may further the general objective of Bank lending
is to increase the extent to which agricultural services are provided by
private commercial institutions, or at least on a self-financing basis by
government institutions. The Bank has sought to encourage the adoption by
Government of policies on input subsidies, interest rates and producer pricing
that are conducive to attaining the sector's development goals.



- 10 -
35.       Bank-supported projects in this sector fall into three broad
groups. There have been eight loans for the development of specific crops,
forestry, and livestock. One loan has been made for the establishment of
an agricultural management training institute. The third group consists
of nine projects for the comprehensive agricultural development of target
areas, and the proposed project is of this type. The first three ADPs--
Funtua, Gusau and Gombe--are nearing completion. They have demonstrated the
effectiveness of an integrated services package in increasing farm output
and farmers incomes.
Conclusion
36.       It is a measure of the success of these Bank-supported projects
that the Federal Government is basing its Green Revolution upon a program
of support for smallholder farming structured along broadly similar lines to
the approach adopted by the ADPs. It is encouraging also that the recommen-
dations of the FPP report on many sector issues are designed to rationalize
government policies and to provide an adequate framework of incentives.
In brief, there is evidence of a growing awareness that financial resources
alone will not solve the problems of the agricultural sector unless they can
be deployed within the framework of an appropriately structured set of
policies. Bank strategy in the medium term future will be to assist the
Government transform this growing awareness into firm action.   The proposed
state-wide project is an important step in that direction.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The genesis of the proposed state-wide project is to be found
within its predecessor, the Gombe agricultural development project (Loan
1164-UNI of 1975) which applied the same fundamental concepts of farm and
livestock development to an area in the south-east of Bauchi encompassing
about one-tenth of the State. During the mid-term review of the Gombe
project in 1978 it was already apparent that the basic goal of increased
farm production was being achieved and the Bauchi State Government asked the
Bank to support a second stage project that would extend these benefits
throughout the entire State. Preparation of the statewide project was done
by staff of the Gombe project on behalf of the Bauchi State Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Following completion of the preparation
report in September 1979, the project was appraised in January 1980 and the
staff appraisal report (3040a-UNI) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Negotiations were held with the Nigerian authorities
in November 1980. Supplementary project data are presented in Annex III.
38.       The Gombe agricultural development project, on which the proposed
state-wide project is based, has had a significant impact upon farming in the
limited project area. Physical infrastructure has been substantially improved
with the construction of 370 km of all-weather feeder roads and 34 small dams.
A network of 40 farm service centers has been established to provide inputs
and extension services to some 58,000 farmers. It is estimated that about



- 11 -
60 percent of these farmers have responded positively to the package of
services offered by the project and have improved their farming practices with
the use of better seed varieties and with modest applications of fertilizer
and pesticides. As a result, average farm yields increased by some 6 percent
annually between 1977 and 1980. This is lower than the projection made at the
time of appraisal but nonetheless significant when compared with the previous
static production pattern. It is anticipated, moreover, that further increases
will materialize during implementation of the second stage state-wide project.
39.       The primary objective of the proposed project is to extend state-
wide the experience gained under the Gombe project. Bauchi State comprises
7 percent of Nigeria's total land area and has a marked climatic variation
from the northernmost part (where annual rainfall averages 600 mm) to the
south (with an average annual rainfall of 1,000 mm). Most soils are low in
organic matter and have only a low potential for continuous cropping. Yet
although the agricultural potential is only fair, relatively high yields can
be obtained from the application of fertilizers together with careful farming
practices.
40.       The entire population of Bauchi State is estimated at about 4
million of which about 2.5 million derive their principal livelihood from
farming. The proposed project would raise the productivity and hence the
income of this latter group. However, past experience indicates that the
project may fall short of reaching the entire farming community, at least in
its first phase. It may reasonably be expected that during the five year
project period only about two thirds of the target population (about 280,000
farm families) will benefit directly from the proposed project.
41. The distribution of land amongst farm families throughout Bauchi State
is quite egalitarian and large farms are rare. The typical farmer cultivates
an average of only four hectares which he holds under the traditional land
tenure system. Smallholdings of this size yield an annual income of approxi-
mately US$1580 for an average family of between five and six, amounting to
some US$280 per capita. Average family incomes would be raised by an esti-
mated 5 percent per annum in real terms over the five-year project period,
which constitutes a major improvement when compared with the present static
production performance outside the Gombe area. Since the population of
Bauchi State is predominantly rural and since the principal source of income
is from agriculture, the proposed project would constitute, in effect, the
mainstay of the State's development effort during the coming five years. It
would also aim to establish the institutional and policy framework for sus-
tained growth in the longer run.
42.       The proposed statewide project would preserve the basic concep-
tual framework that has been applied with success in the case of its pre-
decessor. The vehicle for accomplishing the goal of increased productivity
would consist of a package of services to assist farm, crop and livestock
development together with strategic investment in supporting infrastructure
such as feeder roads and water supply. To implement the project the State
Ministry of Agriculture would be reorganized to accommodate four zonal units
of management, each modeled along lines similar to the Gombe management unit
and all four coordinated by a program manager centrally placed within the
Ministry.



- 12 -
43.       In terms of farm and crop development the project estimates to
increase production of both subsistence and cash crops on some 330,000 ha. of
land. Farming practices would be improved by providing fertilizers, improved
seeds, crop protection measures and better access to farm credit. A key
element of the project would be to strengthen extension services by raising
the ratio of field staff to farmers. Since the farming population in Bauchi
State is quite widely dispersed, relatively high numbers of extension workers
are needed in comparison with other states in order to provide the farmers
with an effective service. Consequently, the ratio of field staff to farmers
would be increased from the present level of 1:1,200 to a level of 1:700 which
the Gombe project has shown to be much more adequate. The extension service
would operate from a state network of 98 farm service centers of which 58
would be constructed under the proposed project. In addition to general
extension advice, a farm management advisory service would be established
to provide planning assistance to more advanced farmers operating either
individually or in groups.
44.       Past experience has shown that the majority of small-scale farmers
in Nigeria are quite conservative in their adherence to traditional farming
practices. Only a progressive minority are likely to adopt advanced produc-
tion methods within the five-year project period. Accordingly, the project
is structured in such a way as to offer both a Basic Service Package (BSP)
and an Advanced Service Package (ASP). The main benefits from the BSP would
accrue as a result of modest applications of inorganic fertilizers, the use of
improved seeds, increased planting densities, and better control of disease,
pests and weeds. On the basis of past experience the BSP participants are
likely to apply improved practices to little more than one-third of their
cropped area. Participants in the ASP, on the other hand, are likely to adopt
more advanced production methods on up to one-half of their farm. The more
sophisticated technologies would involve the use of oxen- and tractor-drawn
implements, a wider application of sole-cropping and improved crops storage.
It is expected that some 60 to 70 percent of farmers will adopt either one or
the other of these packages.
45.       Special provisions would be made to encourage the better use of
the low-lying valley areas, known as fadamas, that are subject to seasonal
flooding. More efficient use of run-off water would be made through bunding
and ridging. Using simple and relatively inexpensive technologies, on-farm
tests would be made of small-scale irrigation equipment. In particular the
practicability would be explored of using low-lift hand pumps and small motor-
driven pumps to replace the traditional shadoof. Such an innovation would, of
course, entail an adaptation of the traditional shadoof gardens to accommodate
a greater water supply and this could be achieved only with strong support
from the extension sevice. Provision has been made for consultant services to
assist in adapting these innovations to the project area. The cost of these
and all other short-term consultancy services for the project are estimated at
US$11,000 per man-month.
46.       The proposed project would also seek to integrate animal rearing
with arable farming, making use of the increased supply of crop residues for
fodder. A Livestock Development Unit would be established within the MANR to
assess on a pilot basis the potential for raising both draft animals and
animals for slaughter. If the pilot scheme proves successful, the program
would be expanded.



- 13 -
47.       In order that the food production goals of the project may be well
structured, a nutrition consultant would be engaged to assess the status of
nutrition amongst the rural population and to make appropriate recommendations
concerning such matters as cropping patterns and agricultural processing. The
consultant would also assist the Ministry of Rural Development and Coopera-
tives (MRDC) to improve its program of rural nutrition education.
48.       In support of the overall livestock and crop development effort,
some 1200 km of low-cost gravelled feeder roads would be constructed. It was
agreed at negotiations that an annual action plan for implementing the feeder
road program would be drawn-up for review by the State Government, the local
governments and the project management in October of each year (see Section
2.15(a) of Project Agreement). An important project goal would be to ensure
the proper maintenance of these feeder roads in the longer term future. To
this end, training would be furnished to Local Government Council (LGC) staff
responsible for such maintenance. At the same time, LGCs would be encouraged
to pool their financial and manpower resources on a zonal basis to take
advantage of the potential economies of scale. In the longer-run it is
envisaged that LGCs within the State would group themselves into 4 separate
joint boards for the planning, budgeting, and execution of feeder road con-
struction and maintenance.
49.       Over and above the evident need for a rational program of feeder
road construction and maintenance, it would appear that the primary and
secondary road structure of Bauchi State also warrants careful scrutiny
with a view to assessing the requirements for expansion and improvement of
the road network in support of agricultural development. Such an assessment
may possibly indicate the need for statewide highway project suitable for
Bank support. Accordingly the proposed project makes provision for consul-
tancy services to prepare a statewide road program together with the detailed
engineering design of about 100 km of major road sections.
50.       Another component of major importance within the proposed project
would be the supply of drinking water to small rural communities. The
scale of the statewide project would make it economically and financially
advantageous to engage a qualified and experienced firm to undertake the
drilling of some 1,200 boreholes, fairly equally distributed throughout the
State. Boreholes have a twofold advantage over traditional wells in that
(a) penetrating to deep fissures in the hard rock they provide access to a
source of water that is less subject to seasonal variation, and (b) being
totally capped by a hand pump, the water is not subject to contamination
from the surface. Consultants will furnish the specialized hydrogeological
skills needed to plan and execute the drilling program.
51.       The program of boreholes would not exclude, however, support
for more traditional forms of water supply such as wells and small reser-
voirs. It is envisaged that some 200 standard hand-dug wells would be sunk
in areas where geological conditions or accessibility would cause problems
for the borehole program. Some 75 earth dams would be constructed at low
cost to establish small reservoirs for the watering of livestock.



- 14 -
Project Implementation
52.       The proposed statewide project would seek to utilize as fully as
possible the managerial and implementational experience gained under the
Gombe project. The management unit concept that has proved so effective under
that and other similar projects would be conserved and the State would be
partitioned into four zones, each with its own management under the overall
coordination of a Bauchi Agricultural Program Management Unit (BAPMU) centrally
positioned within the MANR. Such an organizational structure would entail a
fundamental reorganization of the MANR as well as some redefinition of areas
of responsibility between the MANR and the MRDC. It would also entail a
carefully structured hierarchy of responsibilities from state level authori-
ties through authorities at the zonal level to local level authorities.
53.       The present Agricultural Services Division of the MANR, under the
leadership of an internationally recruited program manager who is already in
post, would be redesigned to form the core of a project management encompas-
sing key financial, administrative and training functions. BAPMU would
provide centralized technical services to zonal subproject units in overall
planning as well as in the specialized fields of civil engineering, water
supply, land use planning, agricultural research and farm management. It
would also provide a focal point of coordination and guidance for three
specialized institutions operating under the broad umbrella of the project:
the existing Cooperative Financing Agency (CFA) that provides agricultural
production credit to project beneficiaries, the proposed Bauchi State Agricul-
tural Services Company (BASAC) that would be established to supply inputs to
project farmers and market their principal products, and the existing Chief
Registrar of Cooperative Societies (CRCS) that would be revitalized to give a
common direction to the cooperative movement within the project area. To
provide a coherent framework for project implementation, BAPMU would draw up
an annual action plan for review with the Bank. It would be a condition of
loan effectiveness that the first such action plan had been furnished to the
Bank for review (see Sections 6.01(h) and 2.03(b) of Loan and Project Agree-
ments).
54.       Reporting to the program manager would be four zonal managers who
would have a large degree of operational autonomy in discharging their
responsibilities for project planning, budgeting and implementation within
the respective zones. The responsibility for effective liaison with LGCs
would lie principally with the zonal management units and they would play a
major role in preparing the LGCs to take over in the longer run many critical
functions at the local level such as feeder road construction and maintenance,
rural water supply and farm extension services. To fortify the skills both
of zonal management as well as of central program management, consultants
specialized in management and accountancy training would be engaged.
55.       The agricultural services company (BASAC) that the State would
establish separately to handle the commercial activities of the project,
would operate a chain of 98 service centers to retail farm inputs and agricul-
tural equipment. Senior managerial and commercial staff needed by BASAC would
be provided by an experienced commercial concern contracted internationally



- 15 -
for this purpose. It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that a
management contract be executed with such a firm on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (see Sections 6.01(g) and 2.04(a) of Loan and Project
Agreements respectively).
56.       An important project objective would be to strengthen and expand the
already active cooperative movement within the State. Officers of the present
245 cooperatives (grouped into 16 unions) would be provided with specialized
training at the existing Bauchi School of Agriculture (BSA). In order to
prepare the BSA for its more prominant role, physical facilities would be
improved and staffing would be strengthened under the project by both local
and international recruitment. There would also be a major expansion of
farm credit through cooperatives, and to this end agreement was reached
at negotiations that BSG would subscribe N6 million of equity to the CFA,
representing a four fold increase in its present equity over a four-year
period (see Section 2.08 of Project Agreement). In areas where cooperative
facilities are not yet available, the farm service centers may supply inputs
to individual farmers on a deferred payment basis over a single season for a
10 percent service charge.
57.       Staffing of both the specialized project activities and overall
management functions at state and zonal levels will be germane to the success
of the project. Experience shows that there is a great scarcity in Nigeria of
manpower with the capability and experience necessary to manage a project of
this nature. In nine other ongoing agricultural development projects the Bank
has encouraged state governments to recruit qualified Nigerians for senior
positions, but it has proved extremely difficult to find suitable candidates.
In order to upgrade local skills a program of intensive training is envisaged,
particularly at the start of the project, to ensure that a full complement of
managerial, technical and administrative staff can be mobilized at all levels.
The project also makes provision for the international recruitment of some
57 key managerial and technical staff, totalling 240 man-years. Since the
contracts of these staff would extend over a number of years, the average cost
per man-month would be US$8,000--significantly lower than the cost of short-
term consultants. The recruitment would be undertaken on behalf of BSG by one
or more consultant firms experienced in this task. These firms would supply
back-up administrative services to the technical staff they provide and would
also assist the project management in progress reporting and in training
Nigerian staff. It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that contracts
for the recruitment of staff to BAPMU have been executed between the Bauchi
State Government and consulting firms with qualifications and experience
acceptable to the Bank (see Sections 6.01(g) and 2.04(b) respectively of the
Loan and Project Agreements). It would also be a condition of loan effective-
ness that the program manager and financial controller for the project be
appointed (see Sections 6.01(f) and 2.04(b) respectively of Loan and Project
Agreements). The Bank-s own Agricultural Projects Management Unit for West
Africa would assist in the recruitment of some key posts if the State govern-
ment so desired.
58.       The prominence of the project within the development effort of
Bauchi State is such as to warrant that the management structure be subject



- 16 -                     I
to policy guidance at the highest level of state government. For purposes
of formulating such an overall policy framework both for the project and for
the longer-term agricultural and rural development strategy of Bauchi State,
an Agricultural and Rural Development Council (BSARDC) would be established.
The State Governor or his representative would chair this Committee, and the
membership would comprise commissioners of pertinent ministries and co-opted
representatives from selected agencies as well as the program manager of the
proposed project. In addition to its other functions, the Committee would
consider and approve the annual project budget.
59.       To supervise the implementation of BSARDC policies and to coordinate
the operational aspects of the project on a more regular basis an Technical
Committee (BSADPTC) would be established under the chairmanship of the Commis-
sioner of Agriculture. The senior project management (including the four
zonal managers) and the permanent secretaries of pertinent ministries would
constitute the core membership of BSADPTC. Its responsibilities would include
the appointment of senior staff, the drawing-up of an annual project budget
and approving the award of all procurement contracts valued at N60,000 or
more. The legal establishment of both BSADPTC and BSARDC would be conditions
of loan effectiveness (see Section 6.01(e) of Loan Agreement).
60.       At the zonal level also there would be established Zonal Development
Committees (ZDC) which would bring together the senior zonal project staff and
representatives from local governments and from traditional councils. In
addition to providing a forum for consultation and coordination to expedite
project implementation, the ZDCs would also be instrumental in mobilizing the
rural population in support of the project.
61.       It is envisaged that project implementation along these lines would
permit a smooth transition towards self-sustained development in the post-
project period. To facilitate this transition, it was agreed at negotiations
that plans for the longer term development of agriculture in Bauchi State be
drawn up for discussion between the Bank, FGN and BSG no later than the fourth
year of the project (see Section 2.14(a) of Project Agreement). Furthermore,
in order to provide a sound institutional framework for the specialized needs
of infrastructure construction and maintenance, assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the BSG would prepare, no later than December 31, 1984,
detailed plans for the future maintenance of feeder roads and rural water
supply facilities (see Section 2.14(b) of Project Agreement).
Project Costs
62.       Total costs for the five year project period 1981-85 are estimated
at US$351 million (including taxes and duties of US$15 million), of which the
foreign exchange component would account for 43 percent or US$151 million.
A breakdown of costs by major expenditure category is given in the loan and
project summary. An allowance has been made for physical contingencies
equal to 5 percent for most items. For project components where the element
of uncertainty is more than usual, however, provision has been made for a
higher physical contingency: 10 percent for civil works other than buildings



- 17 -
and 25 percent for rural water supply. Price contingencies for foreign costs
allow for the annual rate of international inflation to decline from 9 percent
to 7 percent over the project period. Price contingencies for local costs are
estimated at 15 percent per annum except for government-hired labor, the cost
of which is expeced to rise by 10 percent a year. On the basis of these
considerations, total contingencies are estimated at US$98 million--some
28 percent of base costs.
Project Financing
63.       The proposed loan of US$132 million would finance 39 percent of
total project cost net of taxes and duties and would be equivalent to the
entire foreign exchange cost of the project other than the foreign exchange
cost of incremental fertilizer requirements (which would be financed by the
Federal Government). The full US$132 million would be onlent by the Borrower
to the Bauchi State Government on the same terms as the Bank loan and the
State Government would carry the foreign exchange risk. The signing of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Bauchi State Government
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (see Section 6.01(a) of Loan
Agreement).
64.       The Federal Government would finance 25 percent of total project
cost other than the cost of farm inputs for which the long-term aim is to seek
full cost recovery from farmers. This 25 percent, when added to the federal
subsidy on incremental fertilizer requirements, amounts to US$94 million or
27 percent of total project costs. Of the remaining US$125 million total
project cost, the Bauchi State Government would contribute US$98 million and
the participating farmers another US$27 million by way of purchasing farm
inputs. Their respective share in total project cost, therefore, would amount
to 28 percent and 8 percent respectively.
65.       A number of ongoing Bank-supported agricultural development projects
have suffered in the past from a failure of the Government to provide adequate
counterpart funding in a timely manner. In some cases there have also been
administrative delays in passing Bank funds to the project unit. In order to
minimize such problems, agreements were reached during negotiations that: (a)
as a condition of loan effectiveness, a commercial bank account be opened for
BAPMU with initial deposits of N2.0 million from both the Bauchi State
Government and the Federal Government; (b) also as a condition of loan effec-
tiveness, a commercial bank account be opened for BASAC by the Bauchi State
Government with an initial deposit of N1.O million; (c) as yet another
condition of loan effectiveness, the BSG extend its guarantee to any bank
overdrafts drawn by the BAPMU up to N5.0 million (see Section 6.01(b), (c) and
(d) of Loan Agreement); (d) the Bank disburse funds directly to the commercial
bank account of BAPMU; (e) BAPMU submit to the Federal Government, the State
Government and to the Bank, at least 4 months prior to the beginning of each
fiscal year, an annual budget duly approved by the BSARDC; (f) both the FGN
and the BSG provide their quarterly financial contribution to the project of
least 3 months in advance in accordance with the approved annual budget of
BAPMU; (g) in the event that the project does not promptly receive funding
from the BSG, the FGN be authorized to pay directly to the project-s commercial



- 18 -
bank account that part of the State's statutory allocation corresponding to
its agreed financial support for the project; (h) the audited accounts of
BAPMU, BASAC, CFA, the Department of Cooperatives and the Bauchi School of
Agriculture be submitted to the Bank within four months after such fiscal
year together with statements from the auditors certifying that Bank funds
have been used for their intended purposes. These understandings are to be
reflected in Sections 2.03, 2.12 and 3.02 of the Project Agreement.
Cost Recovery
66.       BASAC would recover the full cost of chemicals, sprayers, farm
implements and other inputs through appropriate charges to the farmer.
Only where Government policy provides for explicit subsidization would an
exception be made to this principle. The most prominent such case is that of
fertilizer where present government policy is to charge the farmer a fixed
price amounting to only 17 percent of total fertilizer cost at the farm gate
in Bauchi. The remaining cost is covered by state and federal subsidies.
Although the government recognizes the need in the longer run to reduce the
present high level of subsidization, it does not consider the time opportune
to do so at present because such a move may be misinterpreted as a weakening
of its commitment to the "Green Revolution" and to special assistance for
low-income farmers. Furthermore, while there is evidence that the high level
of subsidization sometimes results in inefficiency and waste, it is apparent
that the timely availability to the farmer of sufficient fertilizer is more
important for agricultural development than is the retail price of fertilizer.
67.       To overcome the serious problems of fertilizer supply encountered
by many ADPs in the past, the Federal Government has approved the establish-
ment of a national fertilizer supply company to handle the procurement of
fertilizer and its sale within Nigeria on a commercial basis. The company
will be managed by experienced and well qualified staff. It will be respon-
sible for delivering fertilizer to BASAC for retail distribution throughout
Bauchi State. At negotiations, the Federal Government gave assurances that
Bauchi State would be delivered sufficient fertilizer for the project in a
timely fashion (see Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement). The cost recovery
system of BASAC would be reviewed annually by the Bank during the course of
project supervision (see Sections 3.04 and 2.05(c) of Loan and Project Agree-
ments respectively).
Marketing
68.       By far the greater part of incremental farm production will be
consumed within Bauchi State itself. Traditional marketing arrangements
would be adequate to handle the amount of produce involved. Nevertheless,
the project would facilitate local marketing through the improvement of
on-farm storage facilities and through the construction of feeder roads.
69.       In previous years, problems have been encountered with the marketing
of maize. There may be a need for special marketing arrangements to handle
an estimated 25,000 tons of incremental maize production from the project,
much of which may be surplus to the state's internal requirements. Although
the Federal Government has recently strengthened the management of the National
Grains Marketing Board, this institution has not been very effective in the
past and it may take some time to improve the efficiency of its operations.



- 19 -
In order to provide the project with an alternative avenue for the marketing
of maize, it was agreed during negotiations that BASAC would be appointed a
licenced buying agent for the Grains Marketing Board. Furthermore, it would
be empowered to establish, on a trial basis, a grain marketing program designed
to explore the possibility of supplying bulk contracts (see Section 3.05(a)
and (b) of Loan Agreement).
70.       Cotton is another commodity that has experienced marketing difficul-
ties in the past. In part, the problem can be traced to operational short-
comings of the National Cotton Board (NCB) which acts as a monopsony buyer and
supplies commercial ginneries throughout Nigeria. Present pricing policies
are also a disincentive to cotton poduction, however. In present market
circumstances there is little scope for increasing the output of cotton, and
the project would concentrate upon improving productive efficiency. At the
same time, BASAC would be appointed a licenced buying agents of the NCB and
would work with the NCB to improve local cotton marketing practices.
Procurement
71.       Contracts for pesticides, vehicles, tractors, agricultural imple-
ments and heavy equipment valued at US$200,000 or more would be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
The aggregate value of such items of procurement is estimated at about US$113
million. Local competitive bidding in accordance with procedures satisfactory
to the Bank would be employed for equipment contracts of less than US$200,000
but over US$60,000. For contracts of less than US$60,000 local competitive
shopping would be employed. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed
15 percent preference or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower, for
purposes of bid evaluation. In order to make the program of borehole drilling
for rural water supply sufficiently attractive to international bidders, it
would be offered for tender in a single package valued at some US$19 million.
Other civil works contracts of US$2 million or more would also be subject to
international competitive bidding. Smaller contracts would be let by local
competitive bidding because experience shows that they would not be attractive
to foreign bidders. The recruitment of consultants and internationally
recruited staff and the provision of overseas training (valued at some US$30
million) would be undertaken in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the
Bank.
Disbursement
72.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over the period 1981-86.  Dis-
bursement would be made against 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures
on vehicles, equipment and farm inputs other than fertilizer. Where items
are manufactured locally or purchased off-the-shelf, disbursement would be
made against 85 percent of total cost except in the case of farm implements
and incremental farm inputs where only 75 percent of total cost would be
reimbursed. For borehole drilling contracts, disbursement would be made
against 100 percent of foreign cost or 70 percent of total expenditures. For
buildings, disbursements would be against 50 percent of total expenditure.
The salaries and allowances of internationally-recruited staff, consultant
services, and overseas training would be fully compensated. On this basis



- 20 -
total disbursements are estimated at US$20.5 million against buildings,
US$45.4 million against vehicles and equipment, US$12.2 million for a con-
tracted program of borehole drilling, US$27.3 million for internationally
recruited staff, consultancy services, studies and overseas training and
US$13.6 for incremental farm inputs. An additional provision for US$13.0
million has been made on an unallocated basis. Provision has also been made
retroactive financing of up to US$600,000 to reimburse the cost of key
internationally recruited staff that may be engaged to assist in project
start-up activities.
Economic Benefits
73.       The overall economic rate of return is estimated to be 18 percent
excluding the rural water supply program for which it was not possible to
quantify all of the indoubtedly significant benefits resulting from safe and
secure water supply. This rate of return, although satisfactory, is never-
theless lower than that for some other projects of a similar nature because
Bauchi State is relatively poorly endowed with rural infrastructure and must
make heavy investments in order to mobilize its full agricultural potential.
Sensitivity tests show that even if farmer adoption rates are only 62 percent
of targeted levels the rate of return would still be equal to the 11 percent
estimated opportunity cost of capital.
74.       Most of the project beneficiaries would be drawn from the lowest
income groups in Nigeria. The level of farm income in the project area
amounted to an average of only US$280 per capita in 1980--little more than
the relative rural poverty level which is provisionally estimated at US$233
for that year. If the project achieves its target of raising farm incomes
by about 25 percent in real terms it will have a major beneficial effect
upon nutritional standards in the State and will contribute significantly to
raising the living standards of the 280,000 farm families directly benefitting
from the project.
75.       In addition, the project is expected to yield a number of other
major, albeit non-quantifiable benefits. The rural water supply program
would have a major impact upon the health and welfare of the rural popula-
tion. The training of technical staff and the development of appropriate
institutions would strengthen the capabilities of the Bauchi State Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources. This would facilitate the planning
and implementation of future projects in the State and set the stage for a
smooth transition towards self-sustained development in the post project
period. The project would also demonstrate the viability of commercial
development of support services and the benefits of decentralizing public
sector operations in agricultural development, all of which may have a
far-reaching and profound impact upon the broader policies and programs of
the Government in the agricultural sector.
76.       Other benefits are relatively modest.  Direct employment genera-
tion would amount to between 25,000 and 30,000 man-years and would involve,
for the most part, a more intensive use of family labor. Some non-farm
employment in other sectors would be induced, however, by the higher level
of economic activity in the project area.

Project Risks
77.       Smallholder agricultural development projects are inherently complex
and the full attainment of project benefits may conceivably be jeopardized by
delays in implementation and inadequate staffing. These risks will be reduced
by having as a condition of effectiveness the appointment of consultant firms
to undertake the international recruitment of key project personnel. Risks
of a technical nature are not great because the technological packages are
conceptually fairly simple and are supported by research data and experience
obtained elsewhere in Nigeria. A major advantage for project implementation
will be the experience to date on the earlier Bank-assisted Gombe agricultural
development project.
78.       The proposed project would entail a significant increase in Bauchi
State expenditures devoted to agriculture from an estimated N14.6 million in
1980 to N44 million in 1985, and this suggests some risk that the State may
find it difficult to furnish all the necessary counterpart funds to the
project in a timely manner. In order to assess the magnitude of this risk a
special study of Bauchi State public finances was conducted by Bank staff
parallel to project appraisal. It emerged from this study that, despite the
substantial financial requirements of the project, total expenditure on agri-
culture would not rise significantly as a proportion of total State expendi-
tures but would remain in the range of 10-12 percent. This is due to the
significant increases projected in State revenues as the result of both an
improved national fiscal position as well as an anticipated increase in the
share of Federal resources being channelled to Bauchi State. Furthermore, a
number of financial covenants were agreed during negotiation that are designed
to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funding.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 838-UNI    Fifth Highway Project:  US$26.3 million Loan of
June 26, 1972; Effective Date: February 20, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project has been completed. Final disbursement claims for the
training of maintenance technicians and preparatory work for the Sixth Highway
Project are being processed by the Federal Ministry of Works. As soon as
these claims have been settled by the Bank, any amounts remaining undisbursed
will be cancelled.
Loan No. 929-UNI    Third Education Project:  US$54.0 million Loan of
August 16, 1973; Effective Date:  January 14, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Since appraisal, project costs have increased fourfold. In FY79,
the scope of the project was reduced and the closing date was extended.
Project management has since then improved but project progress is behind
schedule.
Loan No. 1045-UNI   Second Cocoa Project:  US$20.0 million Loan of
October 11, 1974; Effective Date: October 15, 1975;
Closing Date: September 30, 1981
The project-s planting targets have been fully achieved by all
four participating states.   Loan recovery performance has however surfaced
as a major problem. A tight "action program" has been initiated, and updating
and reconciliation of farmer loan records has been completed.
Loan No. 1091-UNI   Livestock Development Project:  US$21.0 million Loan
of March 20, 1975; Effective Date: July 19, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1981
Project implementation is much improved. The project is now
under good management which has overcome many of the initial problems.
Supporting services are better organized, and credit is now being effec-
tively channeled through NACB.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1092-UNI   Funtua Agricultural Development Project:  US$29.0 million
Loan of March 20, 1974; Effective Date:  January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
Project implementation has been satisfactory with excellent
farmer response and the full support of both Federal and State Governments.
Demand for inputs is consistently above appraisal estimates. The federally
controlled Agricultural Projects Monitoring and Evaluation and Planning Unit
financed under this loan is fully operational. Project costs are in line with
appraisal estimates. An expanded second stage project to cover the remainder
of Kaduna State has been appraised.
Loan No. 1099-UNI   Gusau Agricultural Development Project:  US$19.0 million
Loan of April 4, 1975; Effective Date: January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
The project has been completed with satisfactory support from both
Federal and State Governments. Farmer response has been good, and appraisal
objectives have been met and in some cases exceeded. A second phase project
to cover the remainder of Sokoto State has been appraised.
Loan No. 1103-UNI   Rice Project:  US$17.5 million Loan of April 25,
1974; Effective Date:  January 10, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation made a slow start due to deficiencies in
counterpart funding and staffing limitations.  The Bank has withdrawn from
the project component located in Cross River State because of acute problems
of cost overruns and inadequate physical progress. The remaining funds set
aside for Cross River State will be reallocated to project components in
Anambra and Imo States, where physical project progress and counterpart
funding are more satisfactory, and development is accelerating.
Loan No. 1164-UNI   Gombe Agricultural Development Project:  US$21.0 million
Loan of September 29, 1975; Effective Date: December 29,
1976; Closing Date: July 1, 1982
The project has been implemented satisfactorily with full support
from both Federal and State Governments and is virtually complete. A
project completion report is being prepared. It is proposed that the whole
of Bauchi State will be served by a second-stage project.

Loan No. 1183-UNI   Mid-Western (Bendel) State Oil Palm Project:  US$29.5 mil-
lion Loan of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: October 17,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Loan effectiveness was substantially delayed because of problems
relating to staff recruitment, land acquisition, and completion of the
Federal and State Legal Opinions and State Loan Agreement. Appraisal targets
for the nucleus estate and smallholder components have not been met due to
delays in land acquisition as well as continuing financial and managerial
problems. The monitoring component has not been fully effective because of
staffing difficulties. The Bank has advised the Federal Government that it
will have no alternative but to halt disbursement under the Loan formally
if no remedial action is taken by May 31, 1981.
Loan No. 1191-UNI   East Central (Imo) State Oil Palm Project:  US$19.0 million
Loan of February 12, 1976; Effective Date: April 6, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Project implementation was initially delayed due to the creation of
new states and problems with staffing. Project management and staffing are
now satisfactory, but appraisal planting targets have not been met and the
construction of palm oil mills has been delayed. Substantial cost overruns
are expected.
Loan No. f192-UNI   Western (Ondo) State Oil Palm Project:  US$17.0 million
Loan of September 22, 1976; Effective Date: February 13,
1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The smallholder component continues to face financial difficulties,
and final targets may not be achieved. For the nucleus estate component,
land acquisition, management, and funding problems have delayed progress.
Plantings are in poor condition and processing facilities are inadequate.
Although actions to resolve these problems have been initiated, corrective
action has been insufficient so far. Consequently, the Bank has advised the
Federal and State Governments that disbursements under the Loan have been
suspended until further notice.
Loan No. 1454-UNI   Lafia Agricultural Development Project:  US$27.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1977; Effective Date: March 3, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Although local counterpart funding is now adequate, the project
is still experiencing some problems of a technical nature, particularly
concerning extension and training. However, overall project progress is
satisfactory.

Loan No. 1455-UNI   Ayangba Agricultural Development Project:  US$35.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1977; Effective Date: March 3, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project continues to improve with satisfactory support from the
Federal and State Governments. The most significant improvement is the
introduction of the Training and Visit system, which has enhanced the impact
of the extension services. Farmer participation and physical project progress
is good. Disbursements are also proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1591-UNI   Rivers State Nucleus Estate/Smallholder Oil Palm Proj-
ect: US$30.0 million Loan of July 24, 1978; Effective
Date: July 10, 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
Loan effectiveness was delayed because of problems regarding comple-
tion of the State Loan Agreement, a Management Agreement, and Federal and
State Legal Opinions. Physical progress is satisfactory, and earlier funding
problems have been overcome. The smallholder component faces some managerial
difficulties.
Loan No. 1597-UNI   Nigerian Industrial Development Bank, Ltd.:  US$60 mil-
lion Loan of June 15, 1978; Effective Date: October 24,
1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
About 70 percent of the Loan has been committed and about 12 per-
cent disbursed. Both are less than expected at the time of appraisal owing
to the investment climate in 1978/79 which was affected very much by the
uncertainties surrounding the change in government in late-1979. The invest-
ment climate has recently improved considerably, however, and it is expected
that the Loan will be fully committed before the end of this year.
Loan No. 1667-UNI   Bida Agricultural Development Project:  US$23 million
Loan of September 17, 1979; Effective Date: April 25,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1668-UNI   Ilorin Agricultural Development Project:  US$27 million
Loan of September 17, 1979; Effective Date: April 25,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1679-UNI   Forestry Plantation Project:  US$31 million Loan
of October 29, 1979; Effective Date: June 30, 1980
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The project is progressing satisfactorily in its initial stages.
However, the Ogun State component is being affected by inadequate state
financing.

July 16, 1979; Effective Date: July 22, 1980
Closing Date: December 31, 1985
Project implementation was impaired by some initial procurement
problems which are in the process of resolution.
Loan No. 1719-UNI   Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute
Project: US$9 million Loan of July 16, 1979; Effective
Date: March 30, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
Management consultants are in the field and project implementation
has been initiated.
Loan No. 1766-UNI   Lagos Power Distribution Project:  US$100 million
Loan of February 19, 1980; Effective Date: July 22, 1980
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is progressing satisfactorily in its initial stages.
Loan No. 1767-UNI   Urban Development Project (Bauchi State):  US$17.8 million
Loan of February 19, 1980; Effective Date: August 12, 1980
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project is progressing satisfactorily in its initial stages.
Loan No. 1838-UNI   Oyo-North Agricultural Development Project:
US$28.0 million Loan of August 25, 1980; not yet effective;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985
The Oyo State Government is making good progress toward meeting the
effectiveness conditions.
Loan No. 1854-UNI   Ekiti-Akoko Agricultural Development Project:  US$32.5 mil-
lion Loan of December 15, 1980; not yet effective; Closing
Date: September 30, 1985
Ondo State Government is making good progress toward meeting the
effectiveness conditions.
Loan No. 1883-UNI   Sixth Highway Project:  US$108 million Loan of August 25,
1980; Effective Date: December 11, 1980;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985
Contracts for the road strengthening works, the feasibility study
of the Calabar-Ikom road, and the training of maintenance technicians have
been awarded, and the project is progressing satisfactorily in its initial
stages.
