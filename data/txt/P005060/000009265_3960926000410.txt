LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Amount:                    US$70 million equivalent.
Terms:                     Twenty years, including five yearb grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Implementing Agency        Ministry of Irrigation.
Project Objectives         The objectives of the project would be to improve
and Description:           channel maintenance, and reduce its cost.  The
project would introduce modern channel maintenance
practices, replacing the traditional system of
excavation with a balanced cycle of weed mowing,
herbicide treatment and desilting. This change has
become necessary followinD  the commissioning of the
High Aswan Dam: the reduced silt load in the Nile
below Aswan has changed the principal maintenance
requirement from silt removal to the control of
weeds, and the current practice of using heavy
excavat ag equipment for this purpose is not only
expensive and inefficient, but damages the channel
section. The Bank loan would be disbursed over
eight years, during which time the equipment fleet
of the channel maintenance contractors--including,
for the first time, private sector companies--would
be upgraded, and cycle-based maintenance schedules
would be introduced over the entire 48,000 km
network of public channels. Technical Assistance
would be provided to the Irrigation Sector, the Weed
Research Institute, and the Public Sector Excavation
Companies to improve management, planning and
monitoring togethe- with specialist support on
specific technical issues, giving special attention
to improving the cor.trol in the use of chemicals.
Benefits and Risks:        The project would lead to improved maintenance at
lower costs. Better maintenance will directly
benefit the entire irrigated area by improving the



- ii -
capability of the canals to meet peak irrigation
demands, and also the effectiveness of surface and
subsurface drains in speedily removing excess
water. The project would also reduce the budgetary
burden of maintenance costs. Similar maintenance
techniques have been successfully used elsewhere
and, on a pilot basis in Egypt; thus the risks-of
failure are negligible.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
CHANNEL MAINTENANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Egypt has a total area of one million (M) square kilometers (kM2)
or 238 M feddans (fed).  About 962 of the area of the country is desert, and
the remaining 42, c ncentrated mostly in the valley of the Nile and its delta,
is densely populated averaging 1,300 persons/km2 and is agriculturally
productive.  This arable area of some 6.4 M fed amounts to only 0.14 fed per
capita--amongst the lowest levels of availability in the world.
1.02     The productivity of this limited land resource depends upon
irrigation (para. 2.06).  Following completion of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) and
the provision of perennial supplies to all irrigated areas, cropping
intensities and water use per unit of area increased.  A consequence of
intensified irrigation has been a rising groundwater table, and increased
problems of waterlogging and salinity. More intensive irrigation also
requires higher peak discharges from the caral system; thus the demands placed
on both the irrigation and drainage channels have become more severe. In
parallel with these changes, the HAD resulted in much reduced silt loads in
the irrigation water, and--due to the clear water and increased use of
fertilizers--much improved conditions for weed growth in irrigation and
drainage channels (paras. 3.01 and 3.16). Thus, while the demands on the
system were increasing, the maintenance needs were changing from silt removal
to weed control, and constituted a key constraint to efficient functioning of
both the irrsgation and drainage channels (para. 4.01). The Government of
Egypt (GOE) has therefore accorded high priority to improving the drainage
conditions in the agricultural land as well as to removing the constraints
that prevent the channels from operating at their design potentials (paras.
2.12 and 3.05).
1.03     The need for improved channel maintenance became particularly
apparent during implementation of the-first four Bank-supported sub-surface
drainage projects (paras. 3.06 and 3.07). The proposal for a project to
improve channel maintenance was discussed in general terms 'in Washington
during the visit of the Minister of Irrigation in September 1983. During a
follow-up Bank mission in March 1984, the project outline and timetable for
preparation were agreed. Accordingly, the Project Preparation Department
(PPD) of the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI), using consultants recruited under
an IDA Technical Assistance Credit (116Z-EGT), prepared the project. In
response to the MOI's request, two Food and Agricultural Organization/World



-2-
Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) preparation assistance missions visited
Egypt during November 1984 and May 1985. The appraisal was based on the
FAO/CP Project Preparation Rep3rt (92/85 CP EGY 34 dated July 24, 1985), and
the MOI's 12-Year Channel Maintenance Plan (Report dated September 24, 1985)
prepared in compliance with a covenant under the Drainage V Project (Loan
2652-ECT).
-                    II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Resouree Base
2.01     Egypt has a  pgpation estimated at about 47 M in 1985, increasing at
an annual rate of about 2.6%. Almost 50% of the population is rural, its
proportion having steadily declined from 62% in 1960.  Average per capita
annual income is US$640/annum.
2.02     Farm sizes are generally small, averaging 2-3 fed.  Under the
Agrarian Reform laws, some I M fed were redistributed to those having little
or no land, and farm sizes were restricted to a maximum of 50 fed. Leasing is
common: almost half of all land is farmed under some form of leasehold. In
part, this allows consolidation of fragmented holdings. Although no formal
land consolidation plan is in operation, a benefit of Government's annual crop
consolidation plan is that it allows large, contiguous areas of the major
crops to be grown by individual farmers.
2.03     The land base for agricultural production consists of 5.5 M fed of
"old" lands and 0.9 M fed of reclaimed lands--the so called "old-new" lands.
The old lands include all of the more fertile areas in the valley of the Nile
and the delta where about 97% of Egypt's total agricultural production is
generated. The old-new lands were developed from the late 1950s through the
early 1970s, primarily on the marginal sandy soils along the western edge of
the delta. A large proportion of these reclaimed lands, about one-third, have
not been fully productive.  Some additional land is being reclaimed but the
potential for increasing output is much greater and the costs substantially
less per unit of output on old lands than on reclaimed new lands. (See Maps,
IBRD 19445 and 19447, for irrigated areas).
2.04     The topography in old lands is flat with a gentle slope towards the
north. Generally, the soils are alluvial and fine textured, tending to be
coarser in the south. The alluvium averages 9 to 10 meters (m) in the delta,
and varies from 4 to 15 m in thickness in the valley. In each case, the
alluvium overlies deep deposits of water bearing sands and gravels. Soils
throughout the Old Lands are fertile and highly productive. With proper
irrigation and drainage, a variety of crops and some fruits can be grown.
Salinity and water logging problems exist in areas where drainage is not
adequate for perennial irrigation. -
2.05     Water Resources.  The Nile River accounts for more than 95% of
Egypt's water resources. Of the average annual supply of 74 billion
(milliards) cubic meters (m3) provided by the HAD net of reservoir losses of
10 milliards m3, the Nile Waters Agreement (1959) 1/ allocates 55.5
1/ Between Egypt and Sudan.



-3-
milliards m3 to Egypt and 15.5 milliards m3 to the Sudan.  The live
storage capacity of the HAD is 130 milliards ml, which provides over-year
storage and thus enables a very reliable water supply. Because groundwater
reservoirs underlying the Nile Valley and the Delta are supplied by deep
percolation of irrigation water, groundwater is not in itself a resource.
However, the Nile system has sufficient water to meet current water -
requirements and, with proper conservation and management, it seems unlikely
that water will be a constraint to the development program in the immediate
future.
2.06     The climate is characterized by a mild winter, and a hot summer.  The
normal mean monthly temperatures are high in Upper Egypt, ranging from 16.80C
to 34.2°C at Aswan, and gradually decrease northwards to a range of 13.7°C to
26.6°C on the Mediterranean coast. Annual rainfall averages about 120
millimeters (mm) at the northern periphery of the delta, and decreases sharply
moving southward to only 26 mm around Cairo. Upper Egypt is virtually
rainless. Because of scanty rainfall, the nation's farm lands are almost
entirely dependent on irrigation, which allows year-round cropping (para.
1.02).
B. Sectoral Perfornance and Constraints
Agriculture in the Economy
2.07     While the importance of agriculture in the Egyptian economy declined
significantly during the 1970s, it still represents about 18% of GDP and 40%
of total civilian employment. Historically, the agricultural sector was a
major contributor to the Egyptian economy, providing the bulk of employment
and output, and crucial to Government revenue and foreign exchange earnings.
The sector's dominant role was reinforced by its strong performance between
1955 and 1969. During this period, agricultural production grew at a rate of
over 3% annually--an exceptional performance, given the relatively high base
level.
2.08     In the 1970s, the pace of growth declined to around 2% due to
levelling of crop yields in old lands and a lower output than was expected
from reclaimed lands (para. 2.03). Given that the high growth rates of the
previous decade included the impact of the HAD, this does not reflect a
significant change in the underlying growth trend. However, other factors
accentuated the impact of slowed agricultural growth on the economy in
general: first, population continued to grow annually at over 2.5%; secondly,
per capita income grew very rapidly, and th,irdly, consumer prices for
foodstuffs were held to extremely low levels, compounding the demand increases
generated by the first two factors. These developments led to dramatic
increases in per capita consumption over the period 1974-80. Annual rates of
increase for some major crops were: wheat 4.8%, sugar 7.8%, white meat 7.6%
and fish 8.3%.
2.09     The net effect of these trends is summarized in Table 2.1:

Uricultura1 Constraints
2.10     Three primary constraints to agricultural growth are: (i) the very
limited availability of agricultural land (para.. 2.03); (ii).the difficult
situation with respect to waterlogging and soil salinity (para. 2.04), and
Miii) weaknesses in the institutions responsible for providing support
services (para. 2.13).  In addition, outmigration of labor-both to cities and
abroad--has resulted in labor shortages at times of peak demand.  Further, the
Government intervenes significantly to affect cropping patterns and
procurement prices, causing distortions in the relative prices of products,
and generally depressing the level of farm incomes. However, in the last
three years,-Government has increased the prices of some agricultural
commodities, with a view to providing improved incentives to producers.
2.11     The land constraint is exacerbated by urban and industrial
encroachment into agricultural land, estimated at 20,000-40,000 fed/year, and
by falling productivity, due to waterlogging and soil salinity. Institutional
constraints are important because the main source of increase in the growth of
agriculture will continue to be the old lands (para. 2.03), where productivity
is already high, requiring sophisticated, well-organized, and high quality
supporting services, particularly extension. Constraints of a general nature
include overlapping responsibilities among Ministries, low public sector
wages, and ixcessive governmental intervention into pricing and marketing
arrangements; more specific issues are the lack of communications between
researcher and farmer, and the inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of
the irrigation and drainage systems. The labor constraint is difficult to
quantify. Undoubtedly, there are labor shortages at times of peak
agricultural demand, manifested by high and rapidly rising wage rates. The
main contributory factors appear to be the migration of rural labor to urban
areas and other countries in the Middle East, and the impact of remittances on



work incentives for agricultural labor. The future prospects for the labor
market are inereasingly uncertain as the fall in oil prices reduces the demand
for Egyptian labor abroad.
Public Investment in the Sector
2.12     In the current Five-Year Plan for 1982/83-1986/87 !I, the proportion
of total investment allocated for agriculture has been increased to 13X
compared to 81 in the late 1970s, with an additional 6S allocated for
fertilizer plants, and for agricultural storage and processing facilities.
However, the above constraints, and the growing gap between agricultural
production and consumption, are only partially addressed in the plan
allocations. More than half of the total investment in agriculture is for new
lands reclamation--an activity that seeks to address the primary constraint of
land scarcity, but which has been markedly unsuccessful in the past (para.
2.03). Further, if a large program of this nature is undertaken without a
careful assessment of viability in each instance and ranking of priorities, it
will result in suboptimal investments and will also compete for the limited
water resources (para. 2.05). Of the residual investment in the sector,
drainage, with an allocation of about 301, is appropriately the largest single
item.
Arieultural Supportmq Services
2.13     The Supporting Services including research, extension and input
supply account for only a small share of the public expenditure in the sector,
although increases in cropping intensity and yield will be the main sources of
agricultural growth. In January 1983, research and extension services were
integrated under the Agricultural Research Center to ensure better
coordination of the two activities, and to improve their quality. However,
this reorganization did not yield the expected improvements and, in early
1985, a Ministerial Decree returned the extension service to central Ministry
of Agriculture (MOA) control under an Undersecretary having specific
responsibility for extension affairs. MOA proposes to maintain and strengthen
the interrelationships between extension and research by regular interaction
between officials of these services at all levels. Furthermore, MOA has
established extension as a separate function but coordinated with agricultural
regulatory affairs. A Director General of Extension has been appointed with a
modest supporting staff based in Cairo. These changes will take time to have
their full effect at the field level--through provision of adequate numbers of
mobile, trained extension staff. However, a career path has been opened up,
and the extension service will be in a much stronger position to develop
effectively, unencumbered by regulatory functions. This approach is based on
experience from the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD)-supported Minya and Fayoum Agricultural Development Projects (IFAD
Loans 114-EG and 157-EG), appraised and supervised by the Bank.  The effects
of these recent changes remain to be demonstrated, but the Egyptian Major
Cereals Improvement Project and the Rice Research and Training Project,
1/ For a more detailed review, see IBRD Report No. 5269-EGT, Arab
Republic of Egypt - Review of Medium-Term Investment Program, October 1984.



-6-
supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
have shown that very large gains in productivity can be attained where
research technology is disseminated to farmers through intensified extension.
Under both these projects, substantial yield increases have been achieved over
large areas, and it is clear that even higher yield levels can be obtained
under Egyptian agro-climatic conditions.
2.14     Agricultural credit and inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides, are currently supplied to the farmer mostly through the
Governorate level-Banks for Development and Agricultural Credit and, to a
limited extent, through village cooperatives. Inputs are often provided on
credit and their costs are deducted from the amount due to the farmer from
sale of compulsory quota crops, such as cotton and wheat. While highly
developed and widely available, the current structure of these services does
not provide the farmer with much choice among alternative channels and often
leads to parallel markets for inputs which are, at official prices, in short
supply. lIput supply services were provided by the village cooperatives up to
1977, and there are currently plans to reactivate that system in addition to
allowing increased private sector participation in input marketing.
C. IDA/Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.15     Bank Group Operations.   Past operations in the sector have sought to
address major elements in the development strategy. The Bank serves as the
executing agency for Water Master Plan, a UNDP-financed project (EGY/84/007)
for planning water development and use. The Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 1162-EGT) was designed to help Government develop an institutional
capacity to undertake planning and feasibility studies for agricultural
projects; as a result, suitably equipped PPDs have now been established in the
Ministries of Irrigation, and Land Reclamation. The major component of Bank
lending, in terms of number of projects and resources committed, has been a
series of five drainage projects covering about 2.6 million fed of irrigated
area (para. 3.06). The ongoing Irrigation Pumping Stations Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 2270-EGT) is the first phase of a national program to prevent
crop losses due to irrigation/drainage pump failures and to strengthen the
institution responsible for pumping stations. The first Agricultural
Development Project (Credit 830-EGT) sought, as a pilot project, to raise
productivity in two governorates, by improving the standard of farm
mechanization and strengthening agricultural credit, cooperatives and
extension services.  Despite initial difficulties, progress has been made with
the project, leading to the Second Agricultural Development Project (Loan
2561-EGT). The Fruit and Vegetables Project (Loan 1276-EGT) includes a
variety of components-credit to fruit and vegetable processors and exporters,
co-nstruction of the West Nubariya Drain, and a seed farm. This project has
also been satisfactorily completed, except for the development of the seed
farm.
2.16     In the two IFAD Projects, for which the Bank acts as executing
agency, emphasis is placed on research and extension services (para. 2.13).
Other agricultural projects financed by IDA/Bank include the A"roindustries I
and II Projects (Credit 988-EGT and Loan 2243-EGT), and the Fish Farming
Project (Credit Ill-EGT). The New Lands Development Project - West Nubariya
(Credit 1083-EGT) involves the reclamation of 24,000 fed desert land and
settlement of 4,000 small holders. The agro-industries projects are



7-
progressing satisfactorily but the Fish Farming and the New Lands Projects
have been facing problems of implementation delays.
2.17     Lessons Learned. The main elements of Bank Group involvement in the
sector have focussed directly on assisting Government to maintain and increase
productivity in the old lands. Of the completed projects, Project Performance
Audit Reports (PPARs) have been issued only for the first two drainage
projects (Credit 181-UAR and 393-UAR). Much has been learned about the
problems of the Irrigation and Drainage Subsector during the Bank's long
association with, and substantial support to, GOE's drainage program (para.
3.06). In turn, this has improved the efficiency of the major organization
involved, the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP). Bank's
involvement in the sector, and in particular with drainage, has highlighted
the following important lessons, which have been incorporated into the design
of the proposed project, that: (a) the most effective projects are simple, and
preferably involve only one implementing Ministry; (b) newly established
organizations are generally slow in mobilization; (c) the project
implementation period needs to take account of factors that may cause delays,
such as, procurement problems, shortage of staff, and inadequate budgetary
allocations for projects, and (d) the strengthening of Government agencies
involved in furthering development of existing resources is the highest
priority.
D. Other Donor Support to Irigation and Drainage
2.18     A brief summary of other externally supported programs and projects
in the subsector of irrigation and drainage follows:
(a) Dutch-Egyptian Bilateral Program. Dutch technical assistance for
drainage and channel maintenance started in December 1975. A report
on aquatic weed control was issued in 1978. The Dutch Government has
also supported research by the Weed (Control) Research Institute
(WRI) on biological weed control. In addition, a four-year '1983/87)
ongoing program aims at training the staff of EPADP in construction
management and maintenance of drainage facilities (para. 6.14).
(b)  USAID Program.  Three projects funded by USAID relate to improving
irrigation facilities and to strengthening manpower development. Of
the two completed projects, the Agricultural Canal Reconstruction and
Maintenance Project provided channel maintenance equipment amounting
to about US$30 M between 1978 and 1982. The ongoing Irrigation
Management Systems Project 1/ covers 10 sub-projects with USAID input
totalling US$139.5 M. Started in 1981, it is currently scheduled for
completion in July 1987. The sub-projects include: replacement of
11,000 deteriorated water control structures throughout the
Irrigation System; a telemetry system (260 locations) to monitor and
improve system operation; training and manpower development, and
irrigation improvement.
(c) The Canadian International Development Agency is also funding an
irrigation and drainage improvement program in some 50,000 fed in the
East Delta (see Map, IBRD 19445).

lL IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND THEiR MAINTENANCE
A. The Nile River l!jption and Drainage Systenms
General
3.01     In Egypt, irrigation initially depended on annual flooding of the
Nile. The area served was gradually extended by a canal system which has
evolved since the 1840s when perennial irrigation began on a significant
scale.  The system is functional, but in many respects is not as efficient as
it could be. A serious problem exists with regard to maintenance of
irrigation and drainage channels, caused both by the improper techniques
currently in use and by the unique combination of conditions which encourages
profuse weed growth (paras. 1.02 and 3.16).
Irrigation and Drainage Facilities
3.02     Irrigation Facilities.  Releases of water to the system are
controlled by the HAD and the old Aswan Dam. Seven barrages on the main Nile
River and its two branches divert about 80% of the water into 13 main canals
by gravity; the remaining 20% is diverted by pumping. Currently, there are
some 460 irrigation pumping stations, of which 178 are considered main pumping
stations. The total length of the public canal system is approximately 31,000
km. The privately owned farm header ditches (called mesqas) extend to over
80,000 km. (See Maps, IBRD 19445 and 19447 for Irrigated Areas and Annex 4,
Chart 1, World Bank - 30166:4, for Schematic Diagram of Irrigation System).
3.03     Water is released from the HAD for irrigation, power, navigation,
municipal and industrial usesA For agricultural use, which constitutes about
902 of total demand, the water is supplied according to seasonal estimates of
demand based on irrigated area, crops, climate, soils, and efficiency of the
irrigation system. Since the HAD was commissioned, the gross amount of water
supplied to irrigated areas has been sufficient to support an irrigation
intensity of close to 200%.
3.04     The hierarchy of public canals incluides main canals, branch canals
and distributaries.  The canals deliver water into mesgas serving 50 to 500
fed.  Mesgas, in turn, feed marwas or farm ditches serving usually one to five
farms of a total area of 20 to 30 fed. System operation is based on rotation
in the canals, coupled with rotation among farmers at the mesqa level. Most
farmers in the old lands receive water in the mesgas typically one-half meter
below the elevation of the fields, and lift it from there to the marwas using
animal-driven sakias (water wheels) and increasingly diesel-powered pumps.
Studies carried out under the USAID-supported "Egyptian Water-Use and
Management Project" inter alia indicate that daytime irrigation was preferred
by farmers; thus during the night, some farmers allowed water to flow through
the system to the drains or across their fields and into drains.
3.05     While the HAD has allowed control over the seasonal availability of
water, the control of water distribution is weak. The limited control which
exists is further weakened by badly deteriorated water control structures, and
the difficulty-due to the flat topography--of measuring flows in the
channels. The effect of these two factors is further aggravated by the poor
state of maintenance of canals. The first two problems are being addressed



*9-
with USAID financing (para. 2.18 (b)), and that of maintenance is the subject
of the proposed project. An essential outgtowth of the "Egyptian Water Use
and Management Project"' is the setting up of an organization within MOI for
providing technical assistance, construction assistance and economic analysis
for upgrading and integrating irrigation with on-farm development. This
organization is also supported by USAID under the Irrigation Management
Systems Project (para. 2.18 (b)) and, once tested and accepted, will be-the
basis of a long-term improvement program throughout the old lands.
3.06    Drainage Facilities.  The drainage system comprises: (a) open drains
totalling 16,700 km in length (see Annex 4, Charts 2 and 3, World Bank-30166:5
and 30166:6, for Schematic Diagrams of Main Open Drains); (b) subsurface
drains installed in an area of about 2.6 X fed, and (c) 73 main and 23 minor
pumping stations. Subsurface drains are being installed at an annual rate of
about 170,000 fed, and will eventually cover most of the irrigated area.
Since 1970, the GOE's drainage program has been supported by the Bank Group
through a series of five projects, aggregating to US$246 M of credits/loans
(paras. 2.15 and 2.17). Of 2.7 M fed so far provided with improved open
drains and subsurface drainage, about 70% has been supported by Bank projects.
3.07     The economic returns to proper drainage are high (about 25%) and
farmers are enthusiastic. However, the maintenance--particularly of open
drains--continues to be substandard. The PPARs of the first two drainage
projects (para. 2.17) recommended that the Government should organize an
adequate maintenance operation which would safeguard the investments made on
drainage.
3.08     Channel Lengths.  The total length of canals and drains is estimated
to be about 48,000 km. Table 3.1 below gives length of canals and drins by
bed-width.  (see details by Governorate in Annex 4, Table 1).  Mesqas total
over 80,000 km in length, of which some 12,000 km (15%) are large mesoas,
serving 200 fed or more (para. 3.02).

B. Existing System of ChannelMntenance
Responsibilities
3.09  -  The MOI is directly responsible for the operation and maintenance
(O&M) of all public irrigation canals (through its Irrigation Sector, or IS)



- 10 -
nd drainage channels-(through both the IS and EPADP).  The WRI, which
iperates under the Water Research Center (WRC), provides technli    support to
both these agencies in weed control.  Mea maintenance is the responsibility
of the farmers, who may undertake the work themselves, employ private
contractors, or request the MOI to maintain the channel..at their expense.
Where mesqa maintenance is unsatisfactory, the MOI has legal authority to
perform work at the expense of the farmers.. (See Annex 3, Chart 1, World
Bank - 30166:2, for MOT General Organization.)
3.10     The Irrigation Sector.is responsible for providing technical guidance
to, and supervision of, the field organization for O&M of the canal system
and, at present, maintenance of some 8,200 km of open drains. Under the
direction of a First-Undersecretary, the headquarters' organization has three
main departments, each headed by an Undersecretary, concerned with budget and
accounts, maintenance and water distribution. The field units comprise 19
Irrigation Directorates which are subdivided into 41 Inspectorates and 167
Districts. The IS has a work force of 9,500 staff (excluding helpers), of
whom some 600 engineers and over 1,000 technicians are directly concerned with
O&M activities. Directorates range in size from 170,000 to 600,000 fed of
land under irrigation and are appropriately staffed to carry out all O&M
functions. The Directorate staff, in turn, provide supervision of the
District Engineers who, with technicians,.are directly responsible for O&M of
the system in areas up to 50,000 fed.
3.11     The EPADP, a sem,i-autonomous authority, was established in 1973 to
implement IDA-financed drainage projects (para. 3.06). In 1979, the Authority
was also given responsibility for the maintenance of open drains associated
with subsurface drains. At present, it is responsible for some 8,500 km of
open drains and will take over increasingly responsibility for this from the
IS with the expansion of subsurface drains (para. 3.06). The Undersecretary
for Maintenance in EPADP administers 9 field Directorates which, in turn, are
divided into 50 Centers, and for maintenance of field drainage into 214
Subcenters. Directorates range in size from 150,000 to 300,000 fed of drained
land and Centers from 40,000 to 50,000 fed. The staffing structure and
management functions of Drain Maintenance Directorates and Centers are similar
to those of Irrigation Directorates and Districts, respectively (para. 3.10).
Plannig and Budgeting
3.12     Channel maintenance is financed through the Government's general
budget. Annual-budgets are established by the MOI in three categories: (i)
salaries and wages for permanent MOI employees in the IS and EPADP; (ii)
maintenance contracts between the IS and-EPADP on the one hand, and four
Public Excavation Companies (PECs) and private contractors on the other, and
(iii) a fund for chemical weed control.  The budgetary process is
satisfactory, but t-he allocation of funds is oriented to traditional channel
excavation rather than to current maintenance needs, particularly for weed
control (paras. .4.01 and 4.04). Table 3.2 gives the total 1983/84 MOI
expenditures for channel maintenance.

3.13     Annual maintenance expenditure in 1983/84 averaged EE 1,200/km, and
the average cost/fed of irrigated land was EE 10, or about 1 of the gross
annual agricultural income. Total expenditures (EE 42 M) on maintenance
contracts have increased by about 50% since 1980/81. This level of funding
would be adequate to meet expenditures projected for the maintenance schedule
proposed under the project (para. 5.21).
3.14     The budget allocation among the 19 Directorates of the IS and 9 of
EPADP (paras. 3.10 and 3.11) is made at the central level of each
organization. The work load is also allocated at the central level among the
PECs, which operate under the direction of the Irrigation Public Sector
Authority (IPSA), and execute 80-90% of the work. This allocation is
generally made through a negotiation process based on the capacity of the
companies, their equipment fleets, and non-maintenance work load.
3.15     At the Directorate level, the detailed schedule of works by channel
reach is prepared, and work orders are issued to the PEC designated for the
Directorate. Also, the Directorates award contracts to private contractors on
the basis of Local Competitive Bidding'(LCB) procedures.  The Directorate
staff are responsible for quality control and following up progress of work.
Execution of Channel Maintenance Works
3.16     Maintenance Needs and Methods.  Construction of the HAD has greatly
reduced sediment deposits in canals (paras. 1.02 and 4.01). Growth of weeds
in both canals and drains has increased due to the presence of agricultural
fertilizers in the drainage waters, perennial use of the channels, and the
clearer irrigation water which allows more sunlight to reach the weeds (para.
1.02). Despite this drastic change, MOI continues to rely on large-scale
excavation as the principal means of maintenance.
3.17     The traditional method of excavation is either by draglines,
maintained and operated by PECs, or by private contractors using'labor
intensive methods. In 1983/84, 87% of expenditures were paid to PECs and 9%
to private contractors. Chemicai maintenance expenditure (4%) was mainly for
Acrolein or Magnacide H injection into large canals for submersed weed



- 12 -
control, and for spraying with Ametrine against water hyacinth.
3.18     Mechanical Maintenance.  The programmed volume of earthwork has
increased from 58 Mm' in 1980/81 to 100 Mm' in 1983/84. In part, this has
resulted from increasing the area of deweeding from 18 nm2 to 33 Mm2
because, in the field, excavation and deweeding are accomplished in the same
operation. Table 3.3 summarizes the work done by each PEC and other
contractors in 1983/84. However, the quantity recorded for excavation is "pay
quantity" (guaranteed depth of 30 cm) which is substantially larger than the
actual excavated quantity.

3.19     Manual Work.  Manual weed removal is still used for canals and, to a
limited extent, for drains with bed-width less than S m. Manual maintenance
is declining because of the increasing labor costs and reduced labor
availability. It is mainly done by private contractors, with a small amount
by the PECs in association with their mechanical work.
3.20     Chemical Weed Control.  The annual expenditures of only 4% of the
total maintenance budget understates the importance of herbicides in the
control of weeds (para. 3.17). Herbicides provide the only effective method
of controlling submersed weeds in the larger canals, and are also important in
controlling water hyacinth.
3.21     For the control of emersed and ditchbank weeds, excavation is
sometimes combined with the application of Dalapon (Dowpan M) and Glysophate.
These herbicides represent minimal health hazards. While both these
berbicides have a good potential for controlling ditchbank weeds, current
.reatments are not very effective because of inadequate spraying-equipment and
incorrect application methods.  Floating weeds, mainly water hyacinth, are
treated with Ametrine through aerial or mechanical spraying. Ametrine is a
moderately effective herbicide with minimal health hazards, although
restrictions apply to its use near potable water intakes.

3.22     Following experiments carried out with participation of the World
Health Organization, the MOI has used Acrolein successfully for the last ten
years to control Bilharzia and to manage submersed aquatic weeds. No adverse
effects on people have been reported. The herbicide is very effective, but is
considered to be an undesirable hazard to the aquatic environment, and is thus
a "restricted use" herbicide. While MOt has satisfactory regulations
governing the-use of ACrolein, its transport,-storage and application is, in
practice, poorly managed, and must be rectified if its use is to be safely and
effectively continued (paras. 5.18 and 8.02).
3.23     The MOA has the responsibility for authorizing the use of any given
herbicide. The decision to use herbicides for control of ditchbank or
submersed weeds is taken at the Directorate level and they are applied by the
staff of Irrigation Districts or EPADP's Centers (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
Existk    EqPment and Maintenance Facilities
3.24     The PECs have traditionally used draglines and suction dredgers for
excavation. Hydraulic excavators were introduced for the first time in 1977.
Between 1980 and 1983, a small n-imber of weed mowing buckets and wheel
tractors with side-mounted booms were procured, but this equipment has hardly
been used because of the low unit rates paid for weed mowing. However, a
revised contract-effective since September 1985-provides for remunerative
rates for weed mowing. The PECs production equipment fleets consist of 646
draglines (246 over 15 years old), 374 hydraulic excavators, 80 wheel tractors
with side booms, 34 suction dredgers and 41 bulldozers (see details of
equipment by company in Annex 6, Table 1). However, a large number of
draglines and almost all dredgers are currently used for non-maintenance
works. The equipment fleets used for channel maintenance are deficient in
weed mowing equipment, supporting equipment (transporters, workshops) and
small (7-ton) hydraulic excavators. Despite the age of the fleet, the
equipment availability factor is satisfactory.
3.25     The Egyptian Dredging Company %EDC) and Mechanical Excavation Company
(MEC) have their own workshop facilities, Irrigation and Drainage Company
(IDC) uses three mobile workshops and Upper Egypt Dredging Company (UEDC) has
no repair facilities. Besides repairs and overhauls, workshops of the EDC and
MEC produce spare parts, mainly for draglines. Workshops of EDC and MEC need
to be expanded to include facilities for servicing modern equipment and
vehicles. Also, the present management information system (MIS) and the
inventory control system in each ,'EC store need to be upgraded to provide
accurate information on operations and on the availability of spare parts and
materials (paras. 5.05 and 6.18). Map, IBRD 19446 shows the location of
offices, workshops and stores of the PECs.
TV. APPROACH FOR CHANNEL NAINTENANCE
A. Bae
4.01     With the completion of the HAD, weed control has replaced sediment
removal as the dominant maintenance problem (paras. 1.02 and 3.16). Despite
this change, the system of channel maintenance is still based on removing
large quantities of silt at a frequency of 3-6 years for canals and 2-4 years



- 14 -
for drains. This is an ineffective method of keeping channels free of weeds;
in addition, it results in unstable channel sections causing poor flowing
conditions and loss of agricultural land.
4.02     Recognizing this, the MOI, with assistance from FAO/CP, has prepared
a 12-Year Action Plan to improve the maintenance of canals and drains.
throughout the old lands (para. 1.03). The proposed project would finance the
first time-slice of the plan.  The project implementation period, six and a
half years, represents the transition period between current practices and the
proposed future maintenance system (see Annex 2, Tables 1 and-2).
B. Maintenance Consideration
4.03     Silt Removal Requirements.  The total amount of silt estimated to be
deposited in the channels is about. 10 to 12 Wm3/year, which is only 10X of
the "pay quantity" of 100 Mm3 in 1983/84 (para. 3.18).
4.04     Aquatic Weeds and Their Distribution.  In Table 4.1, the distribution
of aquatic weeds is summarized according to habitat, and to the total length
of channels affected.

1/  Emersed weeds have their roots submersed, but their foliage is above the
water level and, like floating weeds, can be sprayed; submersed weeds are
entirely below the water, and must be treated by injection of herbicides
into the water.
Source:  MOI.
4.05     Submersed weeds (mainly pond weeds and coontails) constitute the
major aquatic problem in irrigation canals.  They reduce the carrying
capacity, particularly in large canals. Mixed weeds, usually a combination of
floating, emersed and ditchbank weeds, comprise the most serious infestation
problem in drains. Ditchbank and emersed weeds (mainly Phragmites mixed with
Echinochloa) combined encroach on canals and drains, causing capacity loss.
Floating species (mainly water hyacinth) comprise the least amount of the
total distance infested.



- 15 -
C. Evaluation of Technical Alternatives for Channel Maintenance
4.06     The following technieal alternatives which could be used to improve
channel maintenance were considered and assessed:
(a) Lining of canals is prohibitively expensive unless other benefits,
such as reduced seepage or higher discharge are important.
Furthermore, this solution cannot be applied to drains.
(b) Biological control is an attractive method of weed control.- For
submersed weeds, few biological agents are known other than grass
carp. The present effort of the WRI to devise ways of using carp
under Egyptian conditions is progressing, but is a long-term
program. The rotational operation of distribution canals (para.
3.04), and control of Bilharzia by spraying Baylujscide in canals and
drains are incompatible with weed control by fish because there is no
water in canals during the off-period and Bayluscide kills fish.
(c) Mechanical control involves continually removing bio-mass. This has
no influence on reducing re-growth of aquatic weeds, and in fact
stimulates growth. Weed control based exclusively on continual
mechanical removal of bio-mass would be excessively costly, requiring
a very large number of excavators equipped with mowing attachments.
(d) Chemical weed control might be a less costly solution. After a first
removal of bio-mass from the cai.als and drains, control could be
assured through frequent applications of herbicides. However, under
the Egyptian conditions, intensive use of herbicides presents serious
environmental hazards and risks for crops, animals and humans.
D. Establikshing Integrated Channel Maintenance
4.07     On the basis of experience available in Egypt and elsewhere,
maintenance cycles have been established for each category of canals and
drains for which the MOI is responsible (para. 3.08 and Annex 4, Table 1).
The proposed system of mainteuance for each channel type is based on an
integrpted cycle of desilting, weed mowing and, for channels of more than 2m
bed-wiath, application of herbicides (Annex 2, Table 1). Together, these
techniques allow cheaper, more effective maintenance than presently practised
(para. 5.21), while limiting the use of hazardous herbicides. In addition,
the project would support continued efforts to develop biological controls.
4.08     Small channels of up to 2 m bed-width will be maintained without the
use of herbicides. The maintenance cycle for these channels would include
periodical desilting and frequent mechanical weed mowing. Maintenance works
would be awarded to private or public contractors on the basis of LCB
procedures acceptable to tne Bank, with award of contracts at the Directorate
level (paras. 3.10, 3.11 and 3.15). Assurances to this effect were obtained
at negotiations (para. 8.01 (a)(i)).
4.09     While the maintenance of mesgas is at present the responsibility of
farmers (para. 3.09), decisive steps should be taken by the Government to
improve their condition.  Poor maintenance leads to shortages at the



- 16 -
tail-ends, and, consequently, to requests for extension of the irrigation
cycle, disrupting schedules, and increasing the return flows to the drains.
The Irrigation Directorates of MOI (para. 3.10) would closely monitor, in
collaboration with the concerned agricultural cooperatives, the maintenance of
mesqas serving more than 200 fed (in total, about 12,000 km) and, where
necessary, carry out required maintenance works at the cost of beneficiaries
para (3.09).  Such works would be carried out by private or public sector
contractors under the supervision of MOI. Also, the Irrigation Directorates
working in close cooperation with the concerned agricultural cooperatives
would ensure-maintenance of smaller-niesqas by farmers and, zhould they fail to
do so properly, would undertake such maintenance at their cost (para. 3.09).
Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations (para. 8.01(b)).
4.10     For channels of more than 2 m bed-width, the cycle would include
periodical desilting, mechanical weed mowing followed by herbicide spraying of
re-growth and subsequent spot mowing and spot application of herbicides for
the control of ditchbank weeds. Submersed aquatic weeds will continue to be
managed with the use of Acrolein applied in the early summer followed by
mechanical excavation and underwater weed mowing in spot locations. Utilizing
the PECs to accomplish all maintenance activities, including herbicide
applications, will place the responsibility on a narrower group of personnel.
Training of such personnel will be accomplished by equipment suppliers'
technicians (para. 5.04) and WRI specialists (paras. 6.10 and 6.15) and this
arrangement will provide for more skilled applications and greater control.
Because of their low mammalian toxities when properly applied, effectiveness
and wide acceptability, the chemicals recommended for spraying are Dalapon,
Glysophate, Diquat and Ametrine (para. 5.17 and Annex 5). The use of this
limited number of herbicides for spraying makes implementation simpler.
Submerged weed treatment with Acrolein will be made by the same spraying
crews, thus better utilizing resources and reducing the number of personnel
requiring technical training. Health risks of Acrolein can be reduced to
acceptable levels only if all transport, storage, and application techniques
specified by the herbicide manufacturer and the MOI directives are followed.
Also, this herbicide should be transported and stored in heavy-walled steel
containers rather than the present 55 gallon steel barrels. Assurances on
these matters were obtained at negotiations (paras. 8.01(a)(ii) and (iii),
8.01(c) and 8.02).
4.11     Various benefits will follow from introducing maintenance based on
the proposed approach. First, and most important, maintenance will be better,
and more efficient functioning of the canals and drains will help improve
agricultural production. Secondly, the use of mowing and chemical methods to
control ditchbank weeds will allow stabilization of the banks because the root
systems will be left in place, and damage caused by using excavators to remove
weeds will be avoided (para. 4.01). Thirdly, an integrated plan of
maintenance will be more economical than the present system (see para. 5,21
and Annex 1, Tables 7 and 8, for cost comparison).
4.12     Proposed Actions.  Introduction of the new system will take some
time, and must be phased in a way which is consistent with readjustment of
working practices, the availability of equipment and training of personnel.
The proposed transition is based on usir.g the existing equipment as far as
possible, while introducing the new-equipment primarily as a substitute for
worn out machinery. In this way, the financial burden will be minimized, and
the economic benefits maximized.



- 17
4.13     For the introduction of the proposed integrated maintenance system,
the major changes would be the replacement of draglines with hydraulic
excavators equipped with mowing and silt buckets, the use of wheel tractors
with side-mounted booms for removal of weeds from small canals, and the
introduction of self-propelled sprayers for application of herbicides. The
assessment of the new equipment required takes account of the .xisting
equipment which would be at or nearing the end of its economic life during the
project implementation period (para. 3.24). While the quantities of new
equipment to be procured are substantial, their cost is less than the cost of
replacing the existing fleet with similar equipment to continue with the
present system (see Annex 1, Table 7).
4.14     The general scheduling of maintenance will remain the responsibility
of [OI, but the introduction of a cycle-based system of maintenance will mean
that the contractors will have responsibility for planning the execution of
works during the cycle. To allow for this, contracts to both private
contractors and PECs should be structured on the duration of the maintenance
cycle. In addition, it is recommended that contracts be based on areas,
rather than canal reaches. This will enable the companies to improve
efficiency in machine utilization. Assurances on the above were obtained at
negotiations (para. 8.01(a)(iv)).
4.15     Equipment required will be procured under International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures and both public and private contractors awarded
channel maintenance contracts will have access to such equipment under similar
terms. Assurances to this effect will be obtaiaed at negotiations (para.
8.0l(a)(v)). The increased opportunities for private sector participation
represented by the access to bidding for small channels amount to about 0S of
the total length of public channels to be maintained annually.
4.16     Also, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that MOI would
strictly follow the Bank guidelines, as contained in OPN 11.01, the MOI's
existing directives, and the manufacturers' recommendations to ensure the safe
transport, storage, handling and application of herbicides, including Acrolein
(para. 8.01 (c)). Assurances were also obtained that: (a) Acrolein would be
handled in heavy-walled steel containers (para. 8.02); (b) iECs' personnel
handling herbicides would continue to be trained by equipment suppliers'
technicians and WRI specialists (para. 8.0l(iii)), and (c) a testing and
monitoring program would be established by December 31, 1987 to monitor
Acrolein in critical locations in channels (para. 8.02). In addition,
evidence of handling, storage and aklication safety of Acrolein according to
the Government Guidelines will be a condition of Loan effectiveness (para.
8.02). A time-bound action plan to meet this target was agreed at
negotiations for: (a) upgrading and rationalizing all existing stores for safe
storage of herb4cides; (b) improving safety of inland transportation; (c)
providing personal and mechanical equipment needed for safe application, and
(d) strengthening supervision to ensure that all safety devices are
operational and hygienic working procedures are strictly followed (para. 8.02).

V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale and Obiectives
Proiect Rationale
5.01     Two factors are of major significance in any consideration of
agricultural development in Egypt.  First, the main source of growth, at least
in the short run, will have to be from the old lands (para. 2.03),  Second,
any strategy for increasing agricultural production in these lands must give
high priority to removing major coustraints on the performance of installed
irrigation and drainage facilities. By aiming at improvement-of the -
maintenance of canals and drains throughout the old lands, the project would
make an important contribution--to removing an increasingly severe constraint
to the reliability and-equity of water distribution as well as to the adequate
functioning of drainage and be fully consistent with the recommendations made
for improved channel maintenance in many reports, such as: (a) ARE: Irrigation
and Drainage Subsector, Report No. 3371-EGT (May 1982); (b) ARE: Issues of
Trade Strategy and Investment Planning, Report No. 4136-EGT (January 1983);
(c) ARE: Selected Issues in Agriculture, Irrigation and Land Reclamation,
Report No. 4133-EGT (May 1983), and (d) ARE: Review of Medium-Term Investment
Program, Report No. 5269-EGT (October 1984).
Project Objectives
5.02     Project components would support the Government's objectives of:
(a) increasing agricultural production by more efficient functioning of canals
and drains; (b) minimizing the need to undertake major investments for the
rehabilitation of these channels, and (c) containing or reducing maintenance
costs. Tu achieve these, the project would: (a) assist MOI in introducing
maintenance methods appropriate to current needs; (b) strengthen the existing
institutional capacity of the agencies concerned with project implementation,
and (c) increase the productivity of the staff and equipment of the PECs
involved in channel maintenance.
B. Summary Deseription of Project Comn
5.03     The project would include the following components:
(a) An Investment Component to modernize Egypt's channel maintenance
capabilities, including: (i) procurement of heavy equipment, workshop
machinery, vehicles, machine tools and spare parts for contracting
agencies; (ii) purchase of vehicles, office, laboratory and field-
equipment for the IS and WRI; (iii) import of herbicides for weed
control, and (iv) construction and/or improvement of residential
buildings, workshops and stores.
(b)  Incremental Recurrent Costs for Institutiona  Development aimed at:
(i) strengthening the IS for improved efficiency in the planning,
coordination and control of channel maintenance operations, and (ii)
enhancing the resources of the WRI for more effective participatioon
in weed control and for setting-up a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)



- 19 -
system.  In addition, the project would assist each PEC to adjust to
the new system of maintenance through establishing a work evaluation
unit together with an efficient MIS.
(c) Technical Assistance and Training Component, includintg: (i) 75
person-months of suitably qualified and experienced experts to
strengthen channel maintenance programs and procedures by the IS, WRI
and EPADP as well as 27 person-months of such specialists to assist
PECs in improving planning, manpower development and equipment
operation and maintenance; (ii) 51 person-months of local consultants
to bring about improvements in PECs' accounting, financial and
inventory control areas, and (iii)-appropriate in-service training
programs for professional and technical staff of the PECs and
agencies concerned with project implementation.
C. Detailed Features
EqWipment and Spsre Parts for Maintenance (Base Cost US$67.8 MO
5.04     The project would provide for phased replacement of the existing
heavy equipment by a balanced mix of mowers, excavators, and self-propelled
herbicide sprayers as well as of the support equipment and vehicles
(paras. 3.24 and 4.13). The existing equipment would also require investments
in spare parts and assemblies for limited rehabilitation (para. 3.24).
Draglines would be replaced by more efficient, hydraulically operated
excavators and wheel tractors with side mounted booms, each type having both
mowing and mud buckets. The spare parts for new equipment are estimated at
5-lOs of their purchase value for each operating year. The contracts for the
procurement of heavy equipment and herbicide sprayers would include provision
of training aids as well as the services of equipment suppliers' technicians
during the guarantee period of one year to assist in maintenance and
operational training. A detailed description of proposed heavy equipment and
estimated foreign costs are given in Annex 2, Table 3, and those of vehicles
produced locally in Annex 2, Table 5.
5.05     The project would provide minimum necessary new equipment and machine
tools for strengthening the existing workshops to cater for the needs of new
machinery, as well as data processing equipment for the upgrading of PECs'
operational and inventory control systems (paras. 3.25 and 6.18). Mobile
workshops and testing equipment would also be provided. A list of equipment
and tools to be purchased for the base workshops under the project with
estimated foreign costs are shown in Annex 2, Table 4.
Equipment and Vehicles for the IS and WRI (Base Cost US$3.6 M)
5.06     The efficiency of both the IS and WRI is hampered by lack of vehicles
and office equipment. The project would finance the upgrading of these
facilities as necessary for project implementation. Office equipment for the
WRI would include computer facilities for data processing and recording,
statistical analysis and monitoring studies. In addition, WRI would need
specialized field and laboratory equipment to conduct aquatic weed studies and
monitor herbicide residue. The estimated foreign costs of required equipment
and goods are presented in Annex 2, Table 5.



- 20 -
Chemieals for Weed Control (Base Cost US$13.5 M)
5.07     To restrict the use of herbicides to the minimum necessary, the
proposed plan relies upon an integrated weed control scheme for channels of
more than 2 m bed-width (para. 4.10).  Based on lengths of canals and drains
to be treated annually for the various weed types, corresponding areas and the
manufacturers' recommended rates of application, the estimated quantities and
foreign costs of chemical herbicides to be provided under the project are
swumarized in Annex 2, Table 6.
Civi Works (Base Cost US$2.2 M-
5.08     The project would provide for the construction of: (a) four stores
for storage of herbicides in accordance with the guidelines of the Government
and two stores for spare parts; (b) a building for EDC to expqnd its repair
facilities, and (c) one 4-flat building in each of the 19 Irrigation
Directorates for essential additional housing for field staff (paras. 3.10 and
6.07). About US$200,000 would also be provided for the rehabilitation of
existing stores. The IS would be responsible for .he construction of new
stores for herbicides and residential flats.  Following completion, the IS
would hand over, free of cost, the stores for herbicides to PECs.
Institutonal Reforms (Base Cost US$2.8 MI)
5.09     The project would introduce a number of measures to improve the
effectiveness of both the IS and WRI. First, at the central level, the office
of the Undersecretary Maintenance would be strengthened to perform a key role
in project implementation (para. 6.05). Secondly, at the field level, two
staff members devoted only to maintenance would be added in each Irrigation
Directorate/District (para. 6.06). Thirdly, the WRI would be strengthened for
providing adequate support to the IS and EPADP in weed control and M&E,
including training of field staff in the-use of herbicides and monitoring
related aspects (paras. 6.10 and 6.11). The project would finance the
incremental staff and related O&M costs.  A detailed description of these
costs is given in Annex 3, Table 1.
Technieal Assistance, Tnn and Study Tours (Base Cost US$2.5 BO
5.10     The intensification of channel maintenance, particularly using the
mechanical and chemical modes in the correct magnitude and order, the
upgrading of work quality and the general improvement of the productivity of
the equipment and personnel involved would require considerable skills
development. This would concern most staff involved in project activities in
the IS and WRI, in the EPADP and also within the four PECs. Project proposals
in this regard have been based on the information available about local
expertise and facilities, while keeping expatriate technical assistance and
overseas study tours to the minimum.
5.11     Management Agencies.  The project would provide the following
technical assistance and training: (a) a specialist in channel maintenance (36
person-months in resident status and 3 in short-term assignments) and an
expert in equipment evaluation (7 person- months in short-term assignments) to



- 21 -
strengthen programs and procedures by concerned organizations as well as to
assist in manpower planning and development (para. 6.13); (b) three experts in
chemical, biological and botanical weed control, one analytical chemist and
one hydraulic engineer (a total of about 29 person-months in short-term
assignments) to strengthen WRI's work in both chemical and biological weed
control (para. 6.13), and (c) about 30 study tours for ser.ior officials and
in-country and on-the-job training on maintenance programs and procedures for
about 270 officials with the rank of junior engineer and above (para. 6.14).
5.12     tPSA and PECs.  The project would finance the following consultancy
services and training: (a) two specialists in corporate planning and MIS as
well as one each in manpower development, workshop management and'equipment
operations (a'total of about 27 person-months in short-term assignments) to
strengthen PECs in the respective areas (para. 6.17); (b) local consultants to
be provided by a local firm specializing in financial management (a total of
about 51 person-months) to define improved budgetary, cost accounting and
inventory control procedures as well as to carry out the necessary training
programs (para. 6.17), and (c) 14 study tours and ia-country and on-the-job
training of about 245 engineers and 1,325 foremen, wechanics and operators
(para. 6.22).
5.13     Annex 3, Table 2 gives the details and timetable for technical
assistance and training for the IS/WRI, and Annex 6, Table 3 for PECs.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the MOI would promptly carry out
plans for manpower development by concerned agencies (particularly, the IS,
WRI and PECs) and that, for assistance as necessary in project implementation,
would contract suitably qualified expatriate and local consultants on terms,
conditions and schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 8.01(d)).
D. Other Features of the Eroject
Status of Engineering
5.14     No engineering design is involved with the proposed project since all
activities relate to the maintenance of existing channels. Maintenance works
will be planned annually on the basis of maintenance cycle established for
each category of channels (para. 4.07). Priorities will be determined
according to the condition of each channel by MOI at the Directorate level.
The work schedule for the first year of the project was presented by MOI, and
agreed upon, during negotiations (paras. 6.25 and 8.01(n)).
5.15     Specifications and tender documents for the procurement through ICB
of equipment and materials will be prepared by the IS in collaboration with
EPADP and the PECs. The PECs (in particular EDC) and EPADP have considerable
experience in preparing such tenders. Documents for the first bids for
equipment and herbicides will be prepared by November 30, 1986 and tenders
will be issued by January 31, 1987.  Subsequent tenders will be issued at
two-year intervals. Design for minor civil works for construction of stores
and workshops, as well as for staff houses, will be prepared as needed by the
IS and civil engineering sections of the PECs.

Environmena Issues
5.16     Improved maintenance of canals and drains would have positive effects
on the general environment and rural health. The decline in desilting would
reduce a potential environmental problem caused at present by large-scale
excavation and resulting spoil which could be polluted with other wastes.
Improved weed control would help in destroying a favorable habitat for Bulinus
trancatus snails and thus would contribute to a reduction in incidence of
urinary schistosomiasis, constituting a major health benefit. Improved drain
and canal flows will reduce the incidence of disease-bearing stagnant water.
5.17     However, the project also has features that could have an unfavorable
impact on the environment if not carefully planned and implemented. For
aquatic weed control, the use of herbicides to control regrowth following
mechanical removal of weed biomass is critical to the success of the project.
The four herbicides (Dalapon, Glysophate, Diquat and Ametrine) proposed for
the control of emergent and floating weeds have low mammalian toxities (para.
4.10) and are recommended and approved for similar use in many areas of the
world. However, it is necessary that herbicide label recommendations on the
handling and application are strictly followed to avoid any significant
adverse impacts (Annex 5).
5.18     Submersed weed management by the use of Acrolein has been extensively
practiced in Egypt since 1975 with no reported adverse effects on people
(para. 3.22). However, it is classified as a restricted use herbicide
requiring strict adherence to regulations concerning transport, storage and
application by trained, experienced and designated authorities. It can safely
be used for irrigation channel maintenance provided the MOI Guidelines for
handling and storage as well as label recommendations are strictly followed.
Because there are no known effective and acceptable alternatives, its
.continued use in the project is proposed.
5.19     While assurances were obtained from GOE at negotiations that MOI
field staff would strictly follow MOI directives, the Bank Guidelines, as
contained in OPN 11.01, and label recommendations on the transport, storage
and application safety of herbicides (paras. 4.16 and 8.01 (c)), the project
would promote adherence by: (a) handling of Acrolein in heavy-walled steel
containers and upgrading of all existing stores (paras. 4.10 and 4.16); (b)
providing four new stores to be built in accordance with MOI Guidelines for
safe keeping of herbicides and proper equipment for their application (paras.
5.04 and 5.08); (c) placing the responsibility for storage and use of
herbicides with PECs' crews to be trained by the guarantee technicians of
equipment suppliers and weed botanists/extension agents of WRI (paras. 4.10,
4.16 and 6.10); (d) improving supervision by the IS and EPADI through training
of their staff members by the WRI and MOI Training Center (paras. 6.10 and
6.14); (e) establishing a testing and monitoring program to monitor Acrolein
in critical locations in channels and application safety of all herbicides
(paras. 4.16, 6.11 and 6.28), and (f) carrying out adequate supervision and a
mid-term review for the success of proposed measures in controlling any
adverse impact (para. 6.26).

E. Cost Estimates
5.20         Total  cost  of  the project  is  estimated at about  US$126.9 M
(EE  168.8 M),  including  US$15.7 M  (ER 20.9.M)  import  duties  and  taxes  and
US$29.5 M (EE 39.2 M) for inflation. The foreign exchange cost would be about
US$78.8 M  (EE 104.8 M)  or  62% of  total  cost.   The  cost estimates  for
equipment, vehicles, herbicides and civil works are based on unit prices taken
from recent contracts Issued for similar items in Egypt and on quotations from
suppliers, appropriately adjusted to early 1986 estimated baseline price
levels. Consultant services under the project total 102 person-months for
experts in various fields and 51 person-months for loc-al experts specializing
in financial management The average costs/person-month for both expatriate
and local experts are based on the prevailing rates in the country. Staff
salaries and trainee allowances are based on wage rates within the PECs and
EPADP. Physical contingencies equivalent to 10% of the baseline costs have
been allowed for civil works, technical assistance and staffing, as well as 52
for all other items. Price contingencies are based on increases in Local
costs of 14% in 1986 and 132 per annum thereafter and in foreign exchange
costs of 7.22t 6.8%, 6.8%, 7.02, 7.1X in the years 1986-90, respectively and
42 per annum for the following two years. Cost estimates for the proposed
project are summarized in Table 5.1 below and detailed in Annex 1, Tables 1 to
6.

5.21     Recurrent Costs. Annex 1, Table 8 presents an estimate of annual
recurrent funds required from Government's general budget for the routine
maintenance of channels (para. 3.13). Based on analysis of the costs of
operation of the PECs in terms of equipment costs, overheads and costs for
supporting services, the annual cost of executing maintenance works for public
channels would decline in constant prices from EE 44.6 M (US$33.5 M) in
1985/86 to £E 34.7 M (US$26.1 M) in 1992193. During each year of project
implementation, Government would need to provide about £E 1.3 H (US$1.0 M),
duly adjusted for inflation, for the import of currently used quantity of
Acrolein for the control of submersed weeds (paras. 4.07 and 4.11).
F.        g PLm
5.22     The proposed Bank loan of US$70.0 M would finance 89% of the
project's foreign exchange cost, or about 55X of total project costs. The
Bank loan would be repayable over 20 years, including 5 years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate and would finance: (a) procurement of
maintenance, support and workshop equipment as well as spare parts required
for new equips_nt and for the limited rehabilitation of existing equipment;
(b) purchase of office, field and laboratory equipment for the IS and WRI;
(c) procurement of herbicides, and (d) foreign costs of technical assistance
and training. GOE would finance: (a) US$48.1 M equivalent in local costs,
including taxes and duties of US$15.7 M, and (b) US$8.8 M to cover the foreign
costs involved in locally produced vehicles such as cars, buses, lorries and
one-ton pick-ups and spare parts for such vehicles as well as locally
available office, field hnd laboratory equipment. During negotiations, an
assurance was obtained that GOE would provide promptly, as needed, the funds,
facilities, services, and other resources required for the project (para.
8.01(e)). MOI presented in negotiations a proposed work program for the first
year of implementation, which was agreed upon during negotiations (para.
6.25). A financing plan would be prepared for each year of project
implementation based on the annual work program (AWP) and, following review by
the CMB, would be furnished to the Bank, by June 30 each year, for its
comments (paras. 6.02, 6.25 and 8.01(n)). Table 5.2 summarizes the proposed
financing plan for project costs.

5.23     Also, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that the Government,
through suitable budgetary provisions, would make available to MOI, during
each year of project implementation, sufficient funds based upon the estimated
costs (para. 5.21) and taking into account the effects of inflation, or agreed
target in line with AWPs (para. 6.25) to meet recurrent expenditures for the
appropriate maintenance of irrigation and drainage channels and facilities
(para, 8.01(f)).
G. Procurement
5.24     Procurement for all items under the project would be carried out
under the responsibility of the First Undersecretary, IS, who will be assisted
for this purpose by EPADP and PECs (pars. 5.15). Table 5.3 lists the methods
proposed to be used for procurement of equipment, herbicides, civil works and
consultant services for the project. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained from MOI on all the procurement arrangements noted below (para.
8.01(g)).

- 26 -
5.25     Equipment/Goods.  Maintenance equipment (including-spare parts
amounting to 20% value of all such equipment), laboratory equipment and goods
for MOI and herbicides would be grouped into appropriate packages and procured
under ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines, published in May 1985 (see Annex
2, Tables 3 to 6). The total value of these items (excluding local costs)
will be about US$ 55.8 M, representing about 71% of the foreign cost of the
project, or 80% of the Bank loan. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would
receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is
lower. Additional spare parts amounting to about US$ 10.1 M or 14% of the
Bank loan will be required for the repair of new equipment during the life of
the project and limited rehabilitation of existing equipment. They will be
procured directly from-the manufacturer of each type of equipment on the basis
of .egotiated prices, or by quotations if there is more than one established
supplier.
..26     Exempted from ICB procedures would-be transport vehicles such as
cars, pick-ups (3/4 or 1 ton), lorries and buses which are produced/assembled
locally. Such vehicles will be procured locally with financing by GOE (see
Annex 2, Table 5) following local procedures acceptable to the Bank.  Also,
exempted from ICB procedures would be small items costing less than
US$100,000, to be procured following LCB procedures in ace_rdance with the
Bank Guidelines. The total value to be disbursed on items procured in this
manner would not exceed US$1.5 M. Small contracts of up to US$50,000
equivalent for office, laboratory and field equipment may be awarded on a
competitive basis to reliable suppliers after quotations.have been obtained
from at least three such suppliers. The aggregate amount of such procured
goods would not exceed US$500,000 equivalent. WB procedures are generally
consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the
project. However, in order to make LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) representatives of foreign
bidders would be allowed to bid; (b) all bidders would be treated equally in
terms of eligibility for any preferences or the requirement of furnishing bids
or performance bonds, and (c) all bids received after the time stipulated
should not be considered and be returned unopened (para. 8.01(g)).
5.27    Civil Works.  Civil works for stores, workshop building and staff
houses of an estimated total value of US$ 3.35 million (including
contingencies) as well as for routine maintenance of channels up to 2 m
bed-width and, as needed, of mesaas (paras. 4.08 and 4.09) will be let out to
private and public contractors following LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank
(para. 5.26). These works are not suitable for ICB because they are small and
scattered throughout the country.
5.28     Contract Review.  All bidding packages for goods and works to cost
over US$0.5 M equivalent would be subject to prior Bank Review of procurement
documentation. This would result in a coverage of about 0B value of the
contracts. The balance of contracts would be subject to random post review by
the Bank after contract award.
5.29    Consultant Services.  Consultants for the various project activities,
including 102 person-months of suitably qualified and experienced experts in
various fields (paras 6.13 and 6.20) and 51 person-months of local experts in
financial management (para. 6.20), will be engaged in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (issued in August 1981).

H. Disbumsements
5.30     Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made for:
(a) lOOZ of the foreign exchange cost or the domestic ex-factory
cost of equipment, spare parts, double cabin pick-ups and
herbicides. Disbursement for locally procured items would be at
the rate of 50% (US$67.5 M';
(b) 1007e of the foreign exchange costs of Technical Assistance and
overseas training (US$0.5 M), and
(c)  Unallocated (US$2.0 H).
5.31     Disbursement under category (a) would be made against full
documentation except for teinbursevients against contracts valued at US$10,000,
or under, which would be presented on the basis of statement of expenditures.
Category (b) disbursements would be made against certified statements of
expenditure; supporting documents would be retained by the IS for review by
the Bank. Existing controls over this procedure which have been found to be
satisfactory under ongoing projects will also apply to this project.
5.32     It is anticipated that disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1994, about one year after scheduled project complePion.  The disbursement
schedule is marginally faster than the country average (eight years versus
nine), but the nature of the expenditures to be financed-primarily
procurement of equipment-together with the fact that maintenance is an
ongoing activity, with an existing system already in place for planning,
execution, and budgetary provision for works which would not be radically
altered under the project, justify a slightly shorter period of disbursement.
Based on the project implementation timetable (Annex 2, Chart 1, World Bank
30166:1,), the disbursement schedule for Bank financing is shown in Annex 1,
Table 9 and summarized in Table 5.4 below:

5.33     Special Account.  A special account would be set up to finance
eligible expenditures of the items to be financed by the Bank (paras. 5.22 and
5.30). Bank financing would be channelled through a commerical bank to be
nominated by the Central Bank of Egypt. The special account, to be
administered by the First Undersecretary IS, would be operated as follows: (a)
the Bank, as requested by GOE immediately following loan effectiveness, would
deposit initially a sum of US$3 M in the special account corresponding to the
Bank's share of the average four months' projected eligible expenditures;
(b) subsequently, the special account would be replenished based on the



- 28 -
reimbursement applications received from the IS for the various eligible items
financed under the loan; (c) a replenishment request would normally be sent to
the Bank when US$2.0 M were utilized, or once a month, whichever is sooner;
(d) should the Bank determine at any time that any payment out of the special
account was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible, the
Government would promptly, upon notice from the Bank, deposit the
corresponding ineligible amount into the special account, or Xf the Bank so
requests, refund to the Bank an amount equal to the sum not eligible, and
(e) if it is determined by the Bank that any amount outstanding in the special
account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Government woi4d refund to the Bank such outstanding
artmunt.  Although most withdrawals from the proceeds of the proposed loan
would be handled through the special account, the Bank would continue to
accept, in appropriate cases, but for a minimum of US$100,000, withdrawal
applications for direct payment in accordance with agreements to reimburse.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would, for the
purposes of the project, open and-maintain in dollars a special account on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 8.01(h)). The closing
date of the Loan would be June 30, 1994.
1. Auditing and Accounts
5.34     All agencies involved id channel maintenance would be subject to GOE
expenditure control and auditing-procedures, which are considered
satisfactory. Project accounts would be maintained separately, and in a
readily identifiable form, by the IS, EPADP and WRI. The IS would consolidate
the accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices the
operations, resources and expenditures related to the project.  Also, to allow
a better understanding of their-operations, the PECs would prepare annual
budgets and annual accounts in a form clearly identifying channel maintenance
related functions. The Central Audit Organization (CAO)-an independent
auditing agency currently responsible for auditing accounts of all MOI's
agencies--would continue to audit project accounts of the concerned
organizations on a timely basis. Generally, the CAO performs continuous
audit, prepares two or three interim reports each year, and consolidates its
findings in an annual report. The CAO, which is auditing the
IDA/Bank-financed ongoing projects, and also carried out the audits of the two
completed drainage projects was favorably commented upon in the completion
reports (paras. 2.17 and 3.07). -.During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government and MOI on the above accounting and auditing procedures,
and that: (a) certified copies of the audited accounts of the project and
special account for each fiscal year audited, and of the auditors' final
report would be furnished to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case
not later than six months after the end of such fiscal year, and (b) the
auditor's report will be of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall
have reasonably requested, and, that it would include, inter alia, a statement
that the funds advanced by the Bank for the special account and disbursed'
against statements of expenditure had been used for the purposes for which
they were provided (para. 8.01(i)).

VI. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Pkoet MNageMent
General
6.01     The project would be implemented through existing institutions of the
MOI, namely, the IS, the EPADP and the WRI, with the First Undersecretary of
the IS providing-the key role of Project Director (paras. 3.09 and 3.10).
Policy direction and project coordination would be provided by establishing a
Channel Maintenance Board (CMB) and a Technical Committee (TC) in the MOI by a
Miaisterial Decree.  The proposed strengthening of the concerned agencies and
the coordination between them would maintain the present relationships of
responsibility and authority.  The establishment of the CMB (para. 6.02) and
TC (para 6.03) by a Ministerial Decree as well as the assignment of the key
staff comprising a General Director and a senior engi eer in the IS (para.
6.05) and one weed research scientist, two chemical analysts, and one system
analyst in the WRI (paras. 6.10 and 6.11) would be conditions of Loan
effectiveness (para. 8.02). The remaining staff required for the
strengthening of the IS (para. 6.05), its field directorates (para. 6.06) and
the WRI (paras. 6.10 and 6.11) would be assigned during the second half of
1987. (See Annex 3, Chart 2, World Bank 30166:3, for Project Organizational
Flow Chart).
Central Level
6.02     Channel. Mintenance Board.  Through CMB, the MOI would ensure the
effective implementation, coordination and monitoring of the project. A
suitably qualified and high ranking official nominated by the Minister of
Irrigation would be Chairman of the CMB, and the First Undersecretaries of the
IS and Planning and Follow-up Department as well as the Chairmen of EPADP, WRC
and IPSA would be its members. The CMB would meet, as required, to:
(a) ensure the coordination in implementation and in performance among the
implementing agencies; (b) review and approve consolidated AWPs and financing :
plans which would be submitted to the Bank for its comments by June 30 of each
year (paras. 5.22, 6.25 and 8.01(n)), and (c) monitor the'status of project
execution.  In the performance of its functions, the Board .ould be assisted
by the TC and a permanent secretariat headed by the Undersecretary Maintenance
of the IS (paras. 6.03 and 6.05).
6.03     Technical Committee.  The TC would be chaired by the First
Undersecretary, IS, and have the Undersecretary, Maintenance as its Executive
Secretary. Other members would include the Undersecretary, Maintenance of
EPADP, and the representatives of IPSA, the four PECs, and the Director of the
WRI. The TC would meet at least once every three months to: (a) monitor
project activities in relation to project objectives; (b) ensure that the AWPs
for project implementation are consistent with project targets (Annex 2, Chart
1, World Bank 30166:1); (c) review specifications for all project related
goods and ensure their procurement in accordance with planned packages and
time schedules; (d) evaluate equipment performance and recommend to the CMB
payment rates of various types of channel maintenance activities, including
weed control; (e) monitor training programs of participating agencies, and (f)
carry out all other work or studies which the CMB may assign.

Iritation Sector
-6.04    Proposals to strengthen tt. IS are summarized in the following
paragraphs. Also, technical assistance would be provided to reinforce the IS
to effectively implement the project (para. 6.12).
6.05     Office of the Undersecretary Maintenance.  At present, the primary
responsiblities of the office are procurement of herbicides and consolidation
of maintenance statistics.  The staff consists of only the Undersecretary and
clerical personnel. It would be strengthened by the addition of a Director
General and a senior engineer for planning and follow-up, a manpower
coordinator and -his assistant, two accountants, and necessary support staff
(para. 5.09). The expanded office would act as a secretariat for the CMB and
;TC, providing-assistance in the functions described in para. 6.03. In
addition, the secretariat would be responsible to: (a) process procurement of
goods and herbicides; (b) monitor and maintain statistics on channel
maintenance expenditures; (c) prepare and submit Bank loan reimbursement
applications; (d) prepare consolidated quarterly progress reports in a format
satsifactory to the Bank and, following review by the CMB, furnish the same to
the Bank within 90 days from the end of the period covered by each report, and
(e) prepare a Project Completion Report and submit it to the Bank within six
months of the completion date of the project. GOE assurances with respect to
reporting requirements were obtained at negotiations (para. 8.01(j)).
6.06     Field Units.  To strengthen the existing structure for channel
maintenance activities, a position of chief engineer maintenance would be
established in each Irrigation Directorate and a maintenance assistant in each
District (paras. 3.10 and 5.09). These staff members would be exclusively
meant for the maintenance of channels.
6.07     Staffing Status.  The MOI is very conscious of the importance of the
IS and, at present, all key positions (General Directors, Inspectors and
District Engineers) are filled by qualified engineers despite general staff
shortages due to low salaries and poor working conditions. While the proposed
project cannot address the problem of Government wages, it would,
nevertheless, provide additicual housing for field units in order to meet a
crucial need for attracting and retaining staff (para. 5-.08) During
negotiations, an assurance was obtained from M0I that, until the completion of
the project, the above key positions and those of chief engineers maintenance
and maintenance-assistants would be kept filled with adequately qualified
personnel (para. 8.01(k)).
Eyptian Public Authority for Drainae Projects
6.08     The Maintenance Department in EPADP currently employs 96 civil
engineers, 85 agricultural engineers and over 300 technicians.  This level of
technical staff is adequate to plan and implement drain maintenance works
proposed under the project. Also, an assurance was obtained under Drainage V
Project (Loan 2652-EGT) that EPADP would review with the Bank the technical
staff requirements for each year of project implementation, and would provide
the required additional staff, including civil and agricultural engineers on a
timely basis; however, this was reiterated during negotiations (para. 8.01(1)).



- 31 -
Weed Research Institute
6.09     The WRI is responsible for conducting applied research to evaluate
different methods of aquatic weed management and the O&M of open channels.
The present professional staff totals 13. consisting of a Director, 4 fishery
biologists, 2 agricultur4t engineers and 6 civil engineers.  The proposed
project would strengthen the WRI as indicated in the following paragraphs.
6.10     Weed Control Unit.  This unit would be strengthened by the addition
of one senior botanist, two weed research scientists, two laboratory
technicians and five botanically trained weed scientists and technicians.
These staff members would be trained-using existing facilities of COE, and
short-term consultancies (paras. 5.*09 and 6.12). The unit would also be
responsible for continuing demonstration and assistance in the traini-ng and
guidance of the herbicide application crews of the PECs and selected MOI
maintenance staff (paras. 4.10, 5.04-and 6.15).
6.11     Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.  A unit would be established in WRI
to monitor the effectiveness of the proposed maintenance cycles, particularly
the use of chemical herbicides and their residues. This unit would require
addition of two analytical chemists, two computer system analysts, five data
coders, a senior monitoring engineer and five field monitoring assistants. -
These staff members would be provided training through existing facilities of
MOI, and other agencies of GOE. Also, short-term consultancies would be
required to strengthen capabilities in M&E and chemical residue analysis
(paras. 5.09 and 6.12). The unit staff would provide training to, and receive
assistance from, the field staff of. both the IS and EPADP in establishing and
conducting monitoring activities. .The maintenance assistants in Districts and
Centers will be trained in weed control and monitoring and assigned these
tasks as additional duties.
Technical Asistance and Taining
6.12     Technical Assistance.  In order to support transition to-cycle-based,
integrated maintenance, technical assistance would be provided to the IS and
EPADP in the planning and scheduling of maintenance cycles, manpower
development, and machinery evaluation techniques (para. 6.04). WRI would also
receive assistance in specialized areas of botanical, chemical and biological
weed control.
6.13     A channel maintenance specialist (36 person-months in resident
status) would be recruited by the IS so as to be in position not later than
July 1, 1987.  The programs and procedures developed, with the assistance of
the channel maintenance specialist, to administer, control and monitor the
project would also be applied by the EEADP and the WRI. Follow-up support by
this specialist is aimed at ensuring continued improvement. The equiPment
specialist would assist in carrying out evaluation of the performance of new
machinery and of related cost aspects, in particular, of weed control
operations. Short-term consultancies by chemical and botanical weed control
specialists throughout the project implementation period would strengthen the
capabilities of the WRI in this crucial area, and those of a biological weed
control specialist, together with a hydraulic engineer specializing in screen
design, would further the ongoing work in developing methodology for utilizing



- 32 -
grass carp for submersed weed control.  The analytical chemist would, inter,
alia, assist in developing a water sampling network for in-channel monitoring
of Acrolein subsequent to applications, and train WRI personnel in appropriate
methods of sampling and analysis of Acrolein. Proposed short-term
consultancies would initially assist in upgrading existing methods and
procedures in respective fields, with follow-up visits to help in the
improvement of such methods and procedures. The program of technical
assistance is summarized in Table 6.1 below:

6.14     Training.  The training coordinator in the IS (para. 6.05), assisted
by the channel maintenance specialist (para. 6.13), would design the training
program in detail. Most training of civil engineers and irrigation
technicians would be performed through the MOI's Manpower and Development
Center which was established under the WRC in 1982 with assistance from USAID
(para. 2.18(b)). Encouraged by the results so far, the MOI has requested



- 33 -
further support from USAID for upgrading the Training Center into a national
institute.  About 104 person-months of training is planned over the life of
the project.   Where training cannot be provided through Egyptian facilities,
training and study tours are currently arranged by MOI through bilateral
arrangements. A total of 18 person-months of such training tours would be
financed by the project. The present level of EPADP training under the Dutch
Program (para. 2.18(a)) and the opportunities offered by the MOI's Trainiing
Center are nearing the maximum levels that can be assimilaLed. Consequently,
project. assistance would be focussed on in-service training through the
channel maintenance specialist (para. 6.13).  The training program for the IS,
EPADP and WRI is summarized in Annex 3, Table 2.
6.15     As a supplement to the proposed training, the WRI would develop and
implement an on-the-job training program in the use of herbicides (para.
6.10). It would be directed mostly to the herbicide application crews of the
PECs as well as to the supervisory District/Center engineers and technicians
to enhance skills in this vital area.
B. Public Excavation Companies
6.16     The organizational structure and facilities of the PECs have
developed to meet their traditional pattern of work. The MEC organization
(Annex 6, Chart 1, World Bank 30166:7) is typical of all the PECs involved in
channel maintenance.  They are adequately staffed, with an average of over 4
technical persons/production machine (see staffing details by company in Annex
6, Table 2). The liquidity position of the main PEC8 is sound, and their
repair and store facilities are generally successful in ensuring low down-time
of equipment, despite the high average life of the equipment (para. 3.24).
6.17     However, with the introduction of new machines, and the proposed
cycle-based maintenance system, improvements to the management information and
inventory control systems of the PECs would be required (para. 3.25). Other
aspects of PECs' management requiring improvement include corporate planning,
financial management, workshop operations, and preventive maintenance of the
equipment fleet (para. 5.12).
6.18     Establishina Cor orate Plannin  Unit and Mana ement Information
System. A planning and monitoring unit would be established, by July 1, 1987,
in each PEC involved in carrying out the project (paras. 3.18, 3.25 and
5.05). GOE assurance to this effect was obtained at negotiations (para.
8.01(m)). In 1987/88, the corporate planning and MIS specialists recruited by
IPSA would .ssist in making these units functional and effective (para.
6.20). Follow-up support by these specialists would help in strengthening
these units (para. 6.20). Each company would also procure a computer to
establish an MIS (para. 5.05).
6.19     Establishing Financial Management Systems.  Local consultants
specializing in financial management would be contracted by IPSA in July 1987
to assist PECs in developing and setting-up financial management and inventory
control systems, including support for introducing computer facilities for
both these systems (paras. 5.05 and 6.20). Beginning in October 1987,
financial management and inventory control personnel in each PEC would be
trained on-the-job.



-34-
6.20     Improvements to Workshop Operations and Equipment Management.
Specialists in these fields would initially assist in introducing appropriate
technologies and methods for workshop operations as well as in setting up
procedures for preventive maintenance, and monitoring of equipment
performance.  Table 6.2 below summarizes the schedule of Technical Assistance
to be provided to IPSA and the PECs.

Associated Training
6.21     Staff Training.  The EDC and MEC have satisfactory off-site training
facilities, including class rooms, training aids, and materials. Short
courses are given in the training centers for engireers, mechanics and
equipment operators. In addition, on-site training for mechanics and heavy
equipment operators is provided by the four PECs.
6.22     The proposed project would provide: (a) 10 person-months of study
tours to advanced countries having comparable mechanized operations in channel
maintenance; (b) the services of a suitably qualified and experienced manpower
development specialist to assist PECs in defining improved on-site and
off-site training programs (paras. 5.12 and 6.17); (c) necessary training aids
as part of equipment supply contracts to strengthen the existing facilities
(para. 5.04), and (d) 475 person-months of local off-site training of
engineers, mechanics and operators. Local off-site training would be
standardized for various categories of staff, with uniform course content.
Training for mechanics and operators would be on the modular system whereby



-  35 -
trainees can progress via a series of short courses interspersed with periods
of job experience under supervision on site. The PECs would use their
facilities and the services of guarantee technicians from equipment suppliers
for providing on-site training to mechanics and machine operators (para.
5.04). Special emphasis in this regard would be given to training of PECs'
crews in operating self-propelled sprayers for application of herbicides. The
training program for IPSA and the PECs is summarized in Annex 6, Table 3.
C. Priect Implementation
6.23     Project implementation is scheduled for six and a half years (see
Implementation Schedule, Annex 2, Chart 1, World Bank 30166:1). The
introduction of the proposed integrated channel maintenance system would start
during the second half of the fiscal year 1986/87 and progress gradually to
cover the total number of channels (para. 3.08). The cumulative application
of the proposed maintenance system to public channels is planned to be as
follows: 1987/88, 20X; 1988/89, 39%; 1989/90, 631; 1990/91, 922; 1991/92,
98S; and 1992/93, 1001 (see details by channel type in Annex 2, Table 2).
Accordingly, by July 1992, the new system will be applied to all public
irrigation and drainage chznnels.
6.24     Most of the equipment and herbicides procurement will be completed by
December 31, 1991. Civil works for new stores for chemicals would commence in
July 1987 and be completed during fiscal year 1989. Construction of staff
houses and repairs of workshop buildings would commuence in July 1987 and be
completed by June 1990. Overseas training of senior staff from MOI and PECs
would be carried ontt during fiscal years 1988 to 1990 while training of local
staff would commenre. in July 1987 and continue throughout the project.
Experts in various fields would be engaged first during the fiscal year 1988
and would continue short-term services until the end of the project. Local
consultants in financial management would complete their task by December 1990.
6.25     Annual Work Programs.  The AWPs, covering all project components and
channel maintenance works, would be a key project implementation mechanism
(paras. 5.14, 5.22 and 6.03). Each AWP would include: (a) a review of
progress achieved, in light of targeted objectives, in project execution in
the preceding year, including manpower development and training of field
personnel in the use of herbicides; (b) a brief description of all activities
to be tudfttaken in the following fiscal year, including maintenance works,
training of personnel, deployment of equipment and staff, and requirements for
the purchase of equipment, herbicides and spare parts, and (c) an estimate of
funding requirements for such activities, together with a financing plan to
secure the funds required in local and foreign currencies (para. 5.22). The
AWPs would enable GOE to review progress, scrutinize forthcoming program and
provide the necessary budgetary and other support needed for the project. All
implementing agencies would submit AWPs to the IS by April 30 each year. The
consolidated AWP would be reviewed by the CMB, and furnished to the Bank, by
June 30 in each year, for its comments (paras. 5.22 and 6.02). Assurances on
the above arrangements were obtained during negotiations and, for the first
year of implementation, the MOI work program was discussed and agreed upon at
negotiations (para. 8.01(n)).
6.26     Mid-Term Review.  GOE and the Bank would undertake, at the end of the



-36-
year 1989, a mid-term review of the project. The primary aim will be a review
of the physical implementation of the project and of the progress accomplished
in meeting its objectives (para. 5.19). Emphasis would be given to: (a)
progress on the introduction of integrated maintenance and its impact on
keeping channels clean; (b) the efficiency in the storage, handling and
application safety of herbicides; (c) evaluation of weed control systems and
of equipment; (d) progress with manpower development programs, and (e) the
impact of reforms in PECs on upgrading their operations. As an input to such
reviews, each consultant financed-by the project during 1989/90 would prepare
a report outlining his findings (paras. 6.14 and 6.17).  Based on the mid-term
review, and other supporting work, project components may be modified if and
where required, and project funds reallocated. GOE agreement on these matters
was obtained at negotiations (para. 8.01(o)).
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
6.27     Monitoring.  The IS, assisted by the WRI and the channel maintenance
specialist (first three years), would have the responsibility of collecting,
reviewing and monitoring information regarding the physical and financial
aspects of the project. Monitoring would be carried out principally through
periodic progress reports (para. 6.05), the AWP mechanism (para. 6.25) and the
proposed mid-term review (para. 6.26). This program would provide the CMB
with early warning signals regarding current and/or potential implementation
problems and the status and progress of the project as related to the proposed
schedule (Annex 2, Chart 1, World Bank 30166:1).
6.28     With the assistance of the experts to be employed under the project,
the IS and WRI would prepare a M&E program for the project, to be furnished to
the Bank for its comment, by September 30, 1987. Such program would include:
(a) the standard procedures to be followed by the implementing agencies;
(b) the forms for data collection, and (e) the computerized procedures for
data manipulation and analysis. Collection of field data would be the primary
responsibility of the staff members of the Irrigation Districts and Drainage
Centers (paras. 3.10 and 3.11) who would receive training and assistance from
the WRI (para. 6.11). Emphasis with regard to field data would be put on: (a)
surveys for weed occurrence in September and October each year, and
subjectively quantifying (light, moderate, heavy) in each canal and drain by
reaches;-(b) pre/post-excavation surveys to determine hydraulic condition of
the channels and quantities of silt to be removed; (c) assessment of the area
for weed mowing; (d) chemical weed treatments, including location, type of
herbicide and quantity used, type of equipment used and, subsequent to
application, a visual survey to ascertain effectiveness of the treatment, and
(e) proper application practices for Acrolein, including sampling and analysis
for its presence at water intakes and other critical locations as specified in
the water sampling network and techniques to be established by WRI with
assistance from a qualified chemist (para. 6.13). The Directorates would
submit field information, together with valid cost data to their Head Offices
and the WRI within 30 days from the end of each reporting period. After
consolidation, the WRI would provide data to the IS for the preparation of
quarterly reports and for review by the CMB/TC. Also, with assistance of
experts, IPSA/PECs would develop standardized criteria, procedures and forms
for monitoring equipment performance and workshop operations.
6.29     Evaluation would concentrate on assessing: (a) the effectiveness of



- 37 -
the integrated maintenance system; (b) the cost of the proposed methods; (c)
the improvement in the use of herbicides; (d) efficiency in equipment
maintenance, availability and usage, and (e) the possibility in reducing the
use of herbicides. Also, evaluation of field data would develop information
on specific channel reaches in order to determine trends in condition,
treatment effectiveness, weed problems, proper procedures for application of
Acrolein are being implemented, etc.
6.30     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the MOI would: (i)
prepare a M&E program to be furnished to the Bank, for its comments, by
September 30, 1987; (ii) implement the agreed M&E program, and (iii) inelude
the findings and analysis of the agreed program in the quarterly progress
reports for the project (paras. 6.05 and 8.01(p)).
ViI. PROJECT JUSIIFICATION. BENEFITS AND RLSK
A. P>roject Justification
7.01     Egyptian agriculture depends on both irrigation and drainage, and
thus, also, on the proper maintenance of the channel system. Since the
completion of the HAD in 1968, the need for maintenance has both increased,
and changed.  The increase in the volume of water diverted for irrigation, and
the fact that irrigation is now perennial, has sharply augmented the quantity
of the drainable surplus. More intensive cropping has increased the peak
irrigation demand.
7.02     To meet these requirements, GOE has invested heavily in subsurface
drainage, and has also begun renovation of the irrigation system.  Mai tenance
methods, however, have remained essentially unchanged and are now quite
unsuited to current needs. Excavation, which was the main requirement to keep
the channels free of the annual silt load, is an expensive and ineffecti-ve
means of dealing with the problem of weed infestation which has increased
since the completion of the RAD.
B. Project Benefits'and Risks
7.03     The modern maintenance practices are both cheaper and more effective
in controlling weeds than the current system of excavation. The expenditures
to upgrade the existing fleet would be lower than the cost of providing
replacement equipment (see Annex-1, Table 7). The operating costs of the new
equipment would be lower than the cost of operating the heavy draglines and
excavators now used, and thus the project would lead to a reduction in the
costs of maintenance, together with an increase in the quality of
maintenance. At full development, the total annual cost of maintaining public
channels would decline from EE 44.6 M to EE 34.7 M in 1986 prices (see Annex
1, Table 8). With positive benefits and negative incremental costs in every
year except--marginally- year 2, the conventional rate of return calculation
is not applicable. The Net Present Value of the project over 30 years at 122
discount rate is EE 44 M.  Switching values for major components, at which the
Net Present Value would become negative, would be: capital costs of machinery
+50%, and operating costs of machinery +30%.  These values are based solely on
the cost savings, and would be higher if the benefits of improved maintenance
were included.

7.04     Analytically, since the precise relationship between water table
levels, irrigation deliveries and yields is not well enough defined to allow
precise calculation of the variation of agricultural production with
alternative levels of maintenance, the objective is to minimize the costs of
keeping the channels functional. The cost of annual maintenance is less than
the cost of bi-annual maintenance because weeds rapidly become more difficult
to r;mnove and inhibit.- Given the annual cycle of weed growth, it is rarely
necessary to clear canals more than once a year, and thus the proposed annual
cycles are close to the optimum. Experience may indicate the need for minor
modifications due to. local conditions, but similar methods have been used
successfully elsewhere (and on a pilot basis in Egypt), and thus the risks of
failure are negligible.
C. Land Tax in the Proiect Area
7.05     While there is no direct recovery of the costs of channel maintenance
in Egypt, the agricultural sector is subjected to a variety of taxes. The
basic annual land tax currently averages about EE 6-10/fed: the tax is levied
on owners of holdings in excess of 3 feddans, and on smaller holdings if the
owner has non-agricultural sources of income. The basic land tax is augmented
by a variety of additional taxes, including the Governorate (15% of land tax),
and the National Security Tax (66% of land tax) which are levied on the user
of the land. "Additional tax" at 50% of the land tax is paid by the owner, as
is the Municipality tax (2% of land tax). In addition to these direct taxes
on land, there is substantial indirect taxation of agriculture through the
pricing and procurement system, partially offset by subsidies on inputs.
7.06     Of the various taxes levied on agriculture, the basic land tax is the
most appropriate means to recover maintenance costs: it is proportional to the
area served, it is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in productivity or
additional infrastructural investments, and it does not distort incentives in
the way that crop taxes and controls do. Recovery rates for land tax are very
high. Basic revenues from agricultural land over the past 5 years are
detailed in Table 7.1 below:

7.07      The cost of maintaining the mesgas serving the farms is the direct
responsibility of the farmers (para. 3.09). At full development, the annual
maintenance costs for public channels borne by the GOE (in 1986 prices) will



- 39-
be about EE 35 M (para. 5.21), whereas current collections of land tax
together with Governorate duties amount to EE 32.7 M.  Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that: (a) during the period of project
implementation, GOE atid the Bank will from time to time exchange views and
reach an understanding on the specific targets and measures for recovery of
the maintenance costs of irrigation and drainage channels, and (b) such
measures will be discussed in the context of an action plan formulated by GOE,
by December 1987, in accordance with its regulations in force and which will
aim at aLhieving such cost recovery in the t-ime frame of the Project (para.
8.01 (q)).
Vm. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMENDATION
8.01      At negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOE and/or MOI that:
(a)   maintenance would be executed according to the following guidelines:
(i) channels of up to 2 m bed-width would be maintained without the
use of herbicides, with works awarded to private or public sector
contractors on the basis of LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank
(para. 4.08); (ii) channels of more than 2 m bed-width would be
maintained by PECs according to agreed maintenance cycles (para
4.10); (iii) PECs personnel handling herbicides would be trained by
equipment suppliers' technicians and WRI specialists and that
application of herbicides would be by such trained and certified
crews using proper equipment (para. 4.10), and (iv) contracts to
private and public contractors would be structured on areas and the
duration of the maintenance cycle for each channel type so as to
ensure the most efficieAt use of equipment (par4s. 4.08, 4.10 and
4.14), and (v) contractors awarded channel maintenance contracts
would have access to required equipment on similar terms (para.
4.15);
(b)   in collaboration with the concerned Agriculturai Cooperatives,-the
Irrigation Directorates of MOI would: (i) monitor the maintenance of
the mesgas serving more than 200 fed and, where necessary, carry out
required maintenance at the cost of beneficiaries, and (ii) ensure
maintenance of smaller mesqas by farmers and, should they fail to do
so properly, to undertake such maintenance at their cost (para.
4.09);
(c)   the Bank guidelines as stated in OPN 11.01, the MOI's existing
directives, and the manufacturers' recommendations for the handling,
storage, and application safety of all herbicides, including
Acrolein, would be strictly followed (paras. 4.10 and 4.16);
(d)   MOI would promptly carry out plans for manpower development and
would contract suitably qualified and experienced expatriate and
local consultants on terms, conditions and schedule satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 5.13);
(e)   GOE would provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities,
services and other resources required for the project (para. 5.22);
(f)   GOE, through suitable budgetary provisions, would make available to
MOI sufficient funds based upon the estimated costs and taking into



40 -
account the effects of inflation (para. 5.21) or the agreed target
in line with AWPs (para. 6.25) to meet recurrent expenditures for
the appropriate maintenance of irrigation and drainage channels and
facilities (para. 5.23);
(g)   MOI would procure equipment and goods in accordance with the
procedures consistent with those set forth in the Bank Guidelines of
May 1985 and details prescribed for the project (paras. 5424 to
5.28) and hire consultants' services in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines of August 1981 (para. 5.29);
(h)   GOE would, for-the purposes of the project, open and maintain in
dollars a special account on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 5.33);
(i)   maintenance of project accounts, special account ind routine
maintenance related expenditures, preparation an' use of statements
of expenditures, and the carrying out of financ-A1 reporting and
auditing will be as set forth in para. 5.34;
(j)   the IS would prepare quarterly progress reports in a format
satisfactory to the Bank and, following review by the CMB, furnish
the same to the Bank within 90 days from the end of the period
covered by each report, and would also prepare a Project Completion
Report for submission to the Bank within six months of the
completion date of the project (pata. 6.05);
(k)   MOI would ensure that, until the completion of the project, all key
positions in the Irrigation Directorates are filled with adequately
qualified personnel; such positions to include the General
Directors, Inspectors, District Engineers, Chief Engineers for
Maintenance and Maintenance Assistants(para. 6.07);
(1)  as envisaged under Drainage V Project, EPADP would continue to
review with the Bank the technical staff requirements for each year
of project implementation, and would provide the required additional
staff, including civil and agricultural engineers, on a timely basis
(para. 6.08);
(m)  a planning and monitor:-g unit would be established, by July 1,
1987, in each PEC involved in carrying out the project (paras. 3.18,
3.25 and 6.18);
(n)   the project AWP, prepared in accordance wi-th content and detail set
forth in para. 6.25, would be reviewed by the CMB and furnished to
the Bank, by June 30 in each year, for its comments, and, for the
first year of implementation, the MOI work program was discussed and
agreed upon at negotiations (paras. 5.22, 6.02 and 6.25);
(o)   GOE and the Bank would undertake, at the end of the year 1989, a
mid-term review of the project, and, based on such review, project
components may be modified if and where required, and project funds
reallocated (para. 6.26);



- 41 -
(p)  MOI would prepare, with the assistance of the IS, WRI and the
experts to be employed under the project, a M&E program for the
project, to be furnished to the Bank for its comments, by
September 30, 1987, implement the agreed program and include
findings and analysis of the M&E program in the quarterly progress
reports for the project (paras. 6.05 and 6.30).
(q)  during the period of project implementation, GOE and the Bank will
from time to time exchange views and reach an understanding on the
specific targets and measures for recovery of the maintenance costs
of irrigation and drainage channels, and that such measures will be
discussed in the context of an action plan formulated by.GOE, by
December 1987, in accordance with its regulations in force and which
will aim at achieving such cost recovery in the time frame of the
Project (para. 8.01(q)).
8.02      A principal issue involved in the project is the present poor
handling and use by MOI of Acrolein or Magnacide H for the control of
submersed weeds (paras. 3.22 and 5.18). During negotiations, an agreement was
reached with MOI on a time-bound action plan for: (a) upgrading and
rationalizing all existing stores in accordance with the MOI Guidelines for
safe storage of Acrolein and other herbicides; (b) improving safety of inland
transportation; (c) providing personal and mechanical equipment required for
safe applications, and (d) strengthening supervision to ensure that all safety
devices are operational and hygienic working procedures are strictly folloaed
(para. 4.16).  Evidence of meeting agreed targets for handling, storage and
application safety of Acrolein according to the Government directives will be
a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 4.16). Agreement was also reached
with MOI that: (a) Acrolein would be handled in heavy-walled steel containers
rather than the present 55 gallons barrels (paras. 4.10 and 4.16), and (b) a
testing and monitoring program would be established by qualified chemists by
December 31, 1987 to monitor Acrolein in critical locations in channels
(paras. 6.13 and 6.28). Additional conditions of loan effectiveness would be:
(a) establishing the CMB and TC by a Ministerial Decree (paras. 6.01 to 6.03),
and (b) formal action required for the assignment of key staff comprising a
General Director and a senior engineer in the IS (paras. 6.01 and 6.05) and
one weed research scientist, two chemical analysts, and one system analyst in
the WRI (paras. 6.01, 6.10 and 6.11). Also, an assurance was obtained at
negotiations that the remaining staff required to strengthen the IS (para.
6.05), its field Directorates (para. 6.06) and the WRI (paras. 6.10 and 6.11)
would be assigned during the second half of 1987.
8.03      The above agreements having been obtained, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$70.0 M for 20 years, including 5 years
grace, at the variable interest rate. The Borrower would be the Government of
Arab Republic of Egypt.

ARAB REPUBIlC OF EGYPT
CHANNEL MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Chemical Weed Control
1.       The Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) has used herbicides--mainly Acrolein
and Ametrine-for aquatic weed management in channel maintenance for many
years.  Total use of these chemicals in 1984 amounted respectively to 307 tons
and 91 tons.  The Drainage Authority reports relatively minor use of the
herbicides Dalapon, Ametrole, and `2,4-D" on a few channel banks. In 1985,
the newer herbicide, Glysophate (Lancer) has also been used on an experimental
basis for the control of ditchbank weeds.
2.       Herbicides proposed for use in the project include Ametrine and
Diquat for a directed spray for water hyacinth control and other floating
aquatics. Ametrine, although less effective than herbicides such as 2,4-D has
low levels of animal toxicity. Diquat, also a contact herbicide, is proposed
as an alternate for water hyacinth control. Restrictions apply for use of
both herbicides near potable water intakes. Neither herbicide would be
applied directly into the water, but only sprayed on the floating plants
resulting in negligible residues.
3.       Acrolein, or Magnacide H, would continue to be introduced into the
water 2-4 times per year for submersed weed control in channels of 5 m
bed-width and larger. Routine use of this material was established by the MOI
in 1975, with restrictions against application near potable water intakes, and
against human contact with treated water. Fish are killed by the material,
but because of the use of molluscicides for Bilharzia control and irrigation
rotation, fish resources are already very limited in the irrigation and drain
systems.
4.       Emersed and ditchbank weeds are considered as one type tor the
purposes of herbicide use proposed in this project. Both types of plants are
represented as growing mainly from the channel banks and encroach into the
wetted perimeter of the canals and drains reducing carrying capacity.
5.       Two herbicides are proposed for application following mowing cycles
to control re-growth and causing an eventual reduction in the couLlnued
extensive need for mechanical removal. These herbicides will be used for spot
spraying of re-growth in the integrated maintenance plan. Glysophate, or
Lancer, is outstandingly effective on terrestrial and emersed aquatic weeds.
It is suitable for use on ditchbanks, has low levels of animal toxicities, and
has no restrictions on use in or around water. Although very active on
plants-and care must be taken in application near crops-it is considered to
be one of the safer available herbicides. Dalapon is the second herbicide

ANNEX 5
Page 2
proposed for use on emersed/ditchbank weeds. It too is approved for use on
ditchbanks and has very few restrictions around water. Dalapon is selective
for grass plants and. consequently, has no effectiveness on broad-leaf
species, hence the need for two different products.
6.       For maximum effectiveness, herbicide application to floating, emersed
and ditchbank weeds requires additives that improve wetting of leaves and
herbicide penetration. The additive proposed for Diquat and Glysophate is
Ortho X-77, and for Dalapon, a non-ionic emulsifier similar to Morax. These
products are considered environmentally safe.
7.      Herbicide application equipment will be made by-hand held boom
sprayers calibrated to apply high volume, low pressure delivery to ensure good
wetting of plants,-with minimal spray drift. The spray tractors will be
self-contained, equipped to provide uniform forward speed to ensure good
coverage. All ditchbank spraying will be made up-stream with no more than 1/2
meter over spray of the surface of a canal to reduce herbicide residues
concentration in canal and drain water. Spraying from boats is to be
discouraged except for access to large floating aquatic weed mats in the river
or larger channels. All spray crews must be adequately trained and routinely
supervised in handling of herbicides, spraying and disposal of unused
materials and empty containers. All of the herbicides, with the exception of
Acrolein, are approved for use in and around irrigation water in many West
European countries, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. Acrolein is
approved for use in canals of the Western U.S. and Australia, and has been
used since 1960s.
