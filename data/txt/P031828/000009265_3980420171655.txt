MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DECTORS
ON A PROPOSED EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY CEDrr
IN THE AMOUNT OF SDR26.8 MILLION
(EQUIVALENT TO US$40 MILLION)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI
1.    I submit for your approval this memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC) in the amount of SDR26.8 million (US$40
million equivalent) to the Republic of Haiti. The EERC would be on standard IDA terms, and
is designed as a quick-disbursing emergency operation which will fimance a positive list of
imports identified as necessary to a comprehensive Emergency Economic Recovery Program (the
Program). Parallel financing is expected from various multilateral and bilateral donors.
A. EMERGENCY AND GOVLRNMENT RESPONSE
2.    Background. In the aftermath of a coup d'etat in September 1991, in which elected
President Jean Bertrand Aristide was forced from office and into exile, Haiti has experienced
a dramatic deterioration in economic and social conditions. Three years of military dictatorship
led to increased economic mismanagement and an international embargo, resulting in a dramatic
decline in living standards, particularly for the most vulnerable sectors of society. During this
period, Haiti did not service its external debt and IDA suspended its operations. In late May
1993, in the context of negotiations to reinstate a constitutional Govermment, President Aristide
invited a multi-agency mission to Haiti to assist in the preparation of the Program to address
Haiti's economic crisis. In July 1993, the Governor's Island Agreement was signed t pave the
way to a political resolution of Haiti's constitutional crisis. The breakdown of this agreement
in October 1993 led to a renewed period of unconsttutional rule in Haid. On September 18,
1994, following United Nations Resolution 940, a negotiated solution was reached which finally
allowed President Aristide to return to Haiti on October 16, 1994. On November 7, 1994,
Parliament confirmed the appointment of a new constitutional Government. Haiti's arrears to
the multilateral agencies are expected to be cleared by mid-December, allowing IDA, IDB and
the IMF to resume their operations. These developments have created the conditions to
effectively address the emergency.
3.    The Emergency. Today, Haiti is in a state of economic and social emergency. Over
the last three years, the country's economic performance and social indicators have worsened
dramatically, accentmting the downward trend of the 1980s. Haiti is characterized by debilitated
institutions, large macroeconomic imbalances, a severely dilapidated infrastructure, depleted
productive assets, alarming social indicators, and pervasive poverty. Already during 1980-91,
the population had suffered a continuing decline in its standard of living, with real GNP per
capita falling by about 2 percent per year. Between 1992-94, Haiti's real per capita income



- 2 -
declined at a multiple of thig rate, and is currently estimated to be well below US$250 --
making Haiti by far the poorest country in the western hemisphere.
4.    Preliminary data indicate that real GDP fell by over 20 percent during 1992-93, and by
a further 10 percent in 1994. All sectors were affected, and the situation has been further
aggravated by the tropical storm Gordon which hit Haiti on November 12, 1994. Agricultural
production and exports decreased considerably, and the sector is now heavily decapitalized.
Many farmers switched from coffee cultvation for exports to the production of domestic crops,
for which prices rose markedly under the embargo. As this development affected marginal lands
with steep slopes, it will likely contribute further to the already high degree of soil erosion.
Exr-rt oriented industries have been devastated under the embargo. By May 1994, related
employment had fallen to 8,000, compared to 44,000 in September 1991 - a job loss of 81
percent of the labor force, compared to about 40 percent in the rest of the industrial sector.
Value-added in the services sector decreased in line with GDP, and construction activities came
to a virual standstill reflectng the low level of public investment and the sharp increase in the
price of cement.
5.    Iflation increased rapidly, from 10 percent during 1991 to an estidrated 52 percent by
1994. Inflation has been fueled by the embargo, together with rapid growth in the money supply
(M2) of about 30 percent per year. In this enviroment, real interest rates, which historically
have been positive, turned highly negative. Against this background, the nominal exchange rate
depreciated by about 50 percent durir. 1991-94.
6.   Fiscal performance also deteriorated, mainly due to a sharp fail in tax revenues,
combined with some increases in the wage bill due to increased public employment. The cental
govermment accounts indicate that the overall deficit of the Central Government increased from
less than I percent of GDP in 1991 to almost 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Over the entire period
the deficit was financed by credit from the Central Bank and by an accumulation of domestic
and external arrears.
7.    Total cental government revenue declined from some 8 percent of GDP in 1991 to about
3 percent in 1994, on account of the decline in economic activity, lower taxable imports, and
a further weakening of tax administration. Total central government expendiure increased from
about 8 percent of GDP in 1991 to over 9 percent in 1993, mainly because of increases in the
wage bill and accned interest payments. Operating and maintenance expenditures declined in
terms of GDP and capital expenditre remaied broadly unchanged. In 1994, total expenditure
declined somewhat to 8 percent of GDP as the growth in public sector employment slowed, and
operating, maintenance and capital investment, already extremely low, remained depressed. The
decline in expenditure appears to reflect a general disarray in governmental arangements rather
than a deliberate policy of contnment, as spending increased sharply in the second half of
1994. This increase was largely recorded in the ministerial discretionary accounts, thereby
masking the precise naure of the expenditure. By end-September 1994, the public secLor is
estimated to have had domestic arrears of about US$11 million equivalent and external arrears



of US$122 million, of which US$77 million was due to the multilateral agencies IDA (US$15
million), IDB (US$28 mi}lion) and IMF (US$34 million).
8.   In the face of a growing fiscal deficit, Central Bank net credit to the public sector rose
by 65 percent per year on average in 1992-94, fmanced by a sizable increase in currency issue,
a decline in the Bank's net foreign assets reflecting the accumulation of external arrears, and an
increase in commercial banks' reserve balances at the Central Bank. Over the same period, the
commercial banks built up substantial net foreign assets reflecting strong growth in their deposit
liabilities, and sluggish credit expansion to the private sector. Also, net lending to the private
sector was restricted by the imposition of a freeze on commercial bank lending during the period
July 1993 to October 1993. To facilitate the financinig of the fisc deficit the legal limit on the
Central Bank's issue of currency was abolished by Parliament in July 1994.
9.   International tade has been severely affected by the embargo. Haiti's external current
account deficit excluding grants increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1991 to 5 percent in 1993,
and to over 7 percent of GDP in 1994 following the tightening of the trade embargo. With
usable foreign exchange reserves virtually depleted since 1992, the deficit has been financed
largely by humanitarian assistance and the accumulation of extnal arrears. Estimated exports
of goods declined from US$163 million in 1991 to an estimated US$47 million in 1994, and
imports from US$300 million to US$139 million during the same period. The main sources of
export revenues were light manufacturing goods and coffee. To a large exten, imports reflected
humanitarian assistance, which amouned to about US$112 million in 1994.
10.   The health and nutritional status of the Haitian population has worsened since 1991. In
1993, an estimated 50 percent of the population had a caloric intake of below 75 percent of
requirements, and over 20 percent of the children weighed in the USAID monitoring network
suffered from some form of malnutrtion. Low birthweight births increased from 5 percent in
1992 to 11 percent in 1993, and the infant mortality rate is estimated to have exceeded 100 per
1,000 live births. If it were not for the extensive humanitarian assistance, the affering of
Haiti's population would have been far worse.
11.   The Goverment's Response. To address the economic crisis, in mid-1993, the
constitutional Govermnent had: (i) prepared the Program which would provide for basic
emergency needs through import finance, civil works and technical assistance (see panas. 19-27);
and (ii) committed itself to initiate critical policy reforms in the areas of public finces, public
sector management and privatization, iteres and exchange rate deregulation, and trade
liberalization. The Program and policy commitments were recenty re-validated by the newly
re-established consttutional Government, in close collaboration with IDA, IDB, IMF,
specialized agencies of the United Nadons, and USAID. The proposed EERC will be an
important contribution to the implementation of the Program. In parallel, the '3overnment has
also prepared a program (Annex 2), which outlines an economic policy framework designed to
address the key structural problems of the Haitian economy and to ensure the sustainability of
the recovery. Finally, the Government hopes to agree with the IMF on a Stand-by Arrangement
by early 1995.

B. IDA'S EMERGENCY ASSISYANCE STRATEGY
12.   IDA's assistance strategy for Haiti for the next twelve to eighteen months aims to
support the Government in: (i) providing basic goods and services to meet urgent needs; (ii)
rehabilitating priority social and economic infrastructure; (iii) establishing the context for an
adequate macroeconomic and incentive framework; (iv) initiating medium-term reforms with
emphasis on public sector modernization, poverty alleviation and environmental restoration; and
(v) coordinating the efforts of the international donor community to ensure adequate fmancing
with an appropriate focus on Haiti's priority needs. To implement this strategy, IDA will: (i)
provide finance for critical imports through the EERC; (ii) modify its ongoing portfolio and
redesign a roads project currently under preparation, with substantial support for technical
assistance; (iii) pursue an intensive policy dialogue, to be supported by a proposed Structural
Adjustment Credit in FY96; (iv) prepare selected economic and sector work and lending
operations; and (v) support donor coordination.
13.  The EERC. The EERC of US$40 million equivalent is a key component of IDA's
assistance strategy for Haiti. The credit will fmance emergency unports to help reactivate the
economy and to give an immediate stimulus to economic growth. It will be essential to provide
the funds required to supply basic goods and services under the umbrella of the Program.
Preparation of the EERC has been supported by a Japanese PHRD Fund Grant of US$502,000
equivalent. The EERC will be complemented by modifications of IDA's portfolio.
14.   Portfolio Modifications. IDA is in
the process of modifying its ongoing project      Box I; IAsu
portfolio to target resources to essential
recovery activities (Annex 1). Since the coup    App edC     U" O A         t
d'etat and Haiti's falling into arrears in            .              million

and project activities have by and large    s  Recovery               11.

ndustrial Recovery and Development,
designed to provide technical and financial
assistance to private, mosdy small- and medium-sized industrial enterprises; Power V, designed
to rehabilitate generation, tranmssion and distribution services; Plort-au-Prince Water Supply,
designed to increase water production and delivery capacity; and Transport VII, designed to



- 5 -
address seleced bottlenecks in road and water transport.  The focus of the portfolio
modifications will be to advance and strengthen those project components which address
emergency needs identified under the Program. The modifications will also include substntl
provision of technical assstance to strengthen the very limited absorptive capacity of Haitian
instituions. Supervision missions have initiated discussions with the Government to reactivate
the six projects and assess the extent to which they require adjustments. It is expected that all
projects will resume implementation in early 1995. No further legislative approval will likely
be required to reactivate the six projects.
15. Redesign of the Roads Project Under Preparation. IDA will also redesign one project
under preparation at the time of the coup d'etat. The Roads Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Credit of about US$38 million was designed to rehabilitate and support maintenance of the main
road network. It is being reappraised and is expected to be presented to the Board this fiscal
year. Co-financing from the EC, IDB and KfVW is anticipated. The project is expected to have
a significant employment generating impact, and thus forms an integral part of the emergency
recovery effort.
16.   Medium-term Assstace Program. IDA is also in the process of formulating its
medium-term assistance program. It envisages that above interventions will be followed-up
during FY96-98 by selected economic and sector work and lending operations with emphasis on
policy reform and poverty alleviation. IDA's proposed economic and sector work includes:
support to the Govermnent for the preparation of a Policy Framework outlining the county's
development strategy; and a basic Poverty Asment. From the onset, IDA has been engaged
in an intensive policy dialogue with the Haitian authorites and it is assistig in the formulation
of short- and medium-term policy reforms.
17.   Subject to further consultation with the Govermnent, IDA's proposed lending operations
include a Structural Adjustment Credit in FY96 to support the implementation of medium-term
policy reforms identified in the policy letter; a follow-up adjustment operation in FY97-98
with focus on public sector reform; and selected sector investment operations, addressing
poverty and enviromental concerns. Projects will be selective in recognition of Haiti's limited
absorptive capacity and of the fact that other donors, in parcular the IDB, are expected to
deploy signficant financial and technical assistance resources over the coming years. The initial
allocations requested to carry out IDA's proposed lending program amount to US$75 million per
year on average during FY95-98. Finally, the Government has requested IFC assistance for the
privatization or restructuring of public enwprises. The World Bank Group's medium-term
Country Assistance Strategy, which will elaborate on these points, will be presented in the
context of the proposed Strucural Adjustment Credit.
18.   Donor Coordination. Donor coordination continues to be an essendal component of
IDA's assistance strategy. A principal forum for donor coordination is the Consultative Group
(CG) meeting. A first, informal donors meeting took place in August 1994, in Paris, to plan
for donor activities in view of the anticipated resoludon of Haiti's politcal crisis. As a result
of this meeing, a multi-agency mission visited Haiti in November 1994, to assist the



-6 -
Government in up-dating the Program. The mission concluded with a local donor meeting
sponsored by IDB. A CG meeting to discuss the technical assistance and financing requirements
and sources for the Program is scheduled for end-Janup i 1995 in Paris. At the same time, local
donor meetings will be held on a regular basis in Haiti.
C. THE PROGRAM
19.   Program    Objectives  and
Description. The Program supported by the    Box 2: Program Finadng Requirezms
EERC aims to provide urgently needed

assessed. In particular, the Program has not yet taken into account the needs arising from the
damage caused by the recent tropical storm Gordon. In addition to the Program, Haiti is
seeking assistance amounting to about US$261 million for: governance ($79 million),
humanitarian relief ($100 million), and clearance of arrears to the multilateral agencies (US$82
million by end-1994).
20.   Balance of Payments Support. General balance of payments and budgetary support is
required to finance debt service payments, oil imports, and other goods and services required



- 7 -
to restore basic Government functions. The initial support is estimated to amount to US$10-15
million per month, and is expected to decrease as exports pick up and the Government's capacity
to mobilize revenue increases.
21. Sector Rehabilitation. A large number of activities to rehabilitate the various sectors
of the economy have been identified, including the following key areas:
(a) Agriculture: (i) rehabilitation of productive infrastructure (feeder roads and
irrigation); (ii) anti-erosion measures; (iii) recapitalization of farmers through a revolving
fund; and (iv) seed production and distribution, and supply of other critical inputs.
(b) Industry and Fiance: fimancing of working capital and equipment.
(c) Power: (i) rehabilitation of generation and distribution facilities; (ii) supply of
emergency energy; and (iii) private management for the power company, EdH;
(d) Roads and Bridges: rehabilitation and deferred maintenance of key roads aud
bridges.
(e) Ports: (i) rehabilitation of port structures; (ii) upgrading of equipment; (iii) dredging;
and (iv) private management for the port authority, APN.
(f) Urban In cture: (i) rehabilitation of roads; and (ii) renovation of markets.
(g) Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste: (i) protection of water supply intakes; (ii)
rehabilitation of main reservoirs, water supply facilities and distribution networks; (iii)
construction of emergency potable water systems; (iv) rehabilitation of main sewers; (v)
construction of garbage dumps; and (vi) equipment for garbage collection.
(h) Health and Nutrition: (i) pharmaceutical procurement and distribution; (ii)
prevention of cholera and other tansmittable diseases; (iii) rehabilitation of health care
facilities; (iv) provision of health services; and (v) nutritional assistance.
(i) Education: (i) school rehabilitation; (ii) provision of text books; (iii) teacher training;
and (iv) stipends for students.
(I) Environment: restoration of protected areas and of green areas in cities.
Sector strategies and inter entions are described in detail in the October 1993 Joint Mission
Report on an Emergency Economic Recovery Program and the November 1994 Draft Up-date
of the Emergency Economic Recovery Program (available upon request). As the Program is
implemented, the proposed activities will have to be reviewed and possibly modified in view of
changing needs and the country's absorptive capacity.



-8 -
22. Technical Assistance. The provision of technical assistance will be an integral part of
the Program, to address the severe weakness of Haitian institutions and increase the country's
very limited absorptive capacity. In addition to project-specific technical assistance, support will
be required to: (I) facilitate implementation of the Program; (ii) strengthen macroeconomic
management; and (iii) design policy reforms to ensure the sustainability of the recovery.
Support for Program implementation will be targeted toward financing an emergency
implementation unit and institutional strengthening of key sector ministries. Support for
strengthening macroeconomic management will focus on key positions and tasks in: the Ministry
of Finance (fiscal policy, budgeting, and revenue collection), the Ministry of Planning (public
sector investment program), and the Central Bank (monetary policies and instruments, and bank
supervision). Finally, technical assistance will also serve to design policy reforms, particularly
in the areas of public sector refonm and privatization.
23.   Pogram Implementation. The Program will be implemented over a twelve to eighteen-
month period through existing channels, the revitalized Economic and Social Fund, and an
Emergency Implementtion Unit (EliU) linked to the Prime Minister's office. The EIU consists
of a Stering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and a Cental Coordination Unit (CCU)
comprising a Directorate and three units for financial administration, procurement and
disbursement, and sector issu, reectively. Independent auditors will be recruited. A
Presidential decree to establish the EIU has already been drafted and is currently being
processed.
24. The Prime Minister, supported by the other members of the Steering Committee, will
provide general oversight of the Program. The Steerng Committee will also include the
Ministers of Finance and Planning and the Governor of the Central Bank. It will lay out broad
policy guidelines for the implementation of the Program and also lay the ground for a medium-
term policy framework. It will invite sector ministers to participate in its deliberations as issues
arise. The Steering Committee, the CCU, and donors will meet periodically to review progress.
A mid-term review of the Program will be carried out in June 1995.
25.   Within the EIU, the CCU will be responsible for day-o-day management of Program
activities. The CCU will: (i) be granted technical, administrative, economic, and financial
autonomy satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) be exempt from the mles normally applicable to public
administation, particularly in matters regarding personnel recruitment, procurement, and
budgetary management. It will be headed by a Director General appointed by the Prime
Minister in consultation with IDA and IDB. The Director General will be assisted by a foreign
advisor who will also liaise with donors. The Directorate will be able to draw on the services
of experts in fmancial admintration, prourement and disbursement, and of specialized staff
for key sectors. The CCU will also be able to draw on technical assistance including
environmental advisory services funded by UNDP and other donors.
26.   To the extent possible, activities will be executed through exising channels. To facilitate
execution, technical assistance will be provided to key sector ministries and the public electricity
and water authorities.  In most rehabilitation activities, NGOs and community-based



-9 -
organizations are expected to play an important role in the implementation. In particular, small
scale social sector and poverty alleviation projects related to the Program will be channeled
primarily through the Energency and Social Fund for execution by NGOs and community-based
organizations. Execution of some minor works will -also be entrusted to municipalities.
Humanitarian aid will continue to be provided through the existing channels, that is mainly
through NGOs.

subject to final agency approval (Box 3). Program costs by sector and sources of funding are
shown in more detail in Schedule A.
D. THE PROPOSED CREDIT
28.   Project Objective and Description. The objective of the EERC is to provide urgently
needed balance of payments support to reactivate Haiti's economy and initiate the economic
recovery process in the context of the overall Program. Specifically, the US$40 million EERC
is designed as a quick-disbursing emergency operation which wil finance the CIF value of
imports based on a positive list identified as necessary to the Program (Schedule B). The
imports will support emergency activities in all sectors covered by the Program, as described
in paras. 19-22 above. Within the confines of the positive list, EERC funding will not be
earmarked for specific sectors or activities, and wil fmance imports of consumable or capital
goods by both public and private entities.



- 10-
29.   Project Implemientation. The EERC will be executed by the CCU under supervision
of the Steering Committee, as described in paras. 23-27 above. Imports of eligible goods will
be undertaken by public and private entities according to their demand for such goods and
following the procedures set out below.
30.   Prociurement and Disbursement. The EERC will fmance 100 percent of direct imports;
covering the CIF value of goods imported from IDA member countries based on the positive list
of imports identified as necessary to the Program. A procurement and disbursement expert,
responsible for gathering documentation for eligible imports, has already been hired to work
within the CCU.
31.   As discussed in pam. 19 above, the Program was originally identified in June 1993.
Program implementaton was then stalled by the collapse of the Governor's Island Agreement
which resulted in the United Nations Embargo effected on October 18, 1993. During that four-
month period, a significant volume of imports were brought into the country which met the
eligibility criteria for financing under the EERC. In view of these circumstances, the EERC will
permit exceptional retroactive financing of US$20 million (50 percent of the credit amount) for
eligible imports effected: (i) during the period of June 4, 1993 to October 18, 1993 (from the
identification of the Program to the taking effect of the United Nations Embargo); and (ii) after
October 17, 1994 (the date of the lifting of the United Nations Embargo). Imports effected
during the period of the embargo and imports financed through other development assistane
programs will not be eligible for finacing.
32. The following procurement procedures, agreed upon with the Borrower during
negotiations, will be applied:
(a) goods imported by public and private sector entities valued at US$3 million
equivalent or more would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures, using IDA's standard bidding documents, in accordance with IDA guidelines.
For petroleum and commodity imports, competitive procedures satisfactory to IDA will
apply. For petroleum imports being supplied under existng contracts, relevant
expenditures would qualify for reimbursement under the credit in an amount not to
exceed on a per unit basis the reference average FOB price published in the Platt's
Oilgram for the US Gulf Coast or the Caribbean, as applicable, on the date of loading
and adjused for the type and quality of crude or product. In some cases, direct
contracting will be acceptable, pursuant to the guidelines; and
(b) imports valued at below US$3 million equivalent would be procured as follows: (i)
by public sector entities, in accordance with the procedures applicable to them as
govemed by local legislation, provided that such procedures are acceptable to IDA; and
(ii) by private importers, in accordance with established commercial practices, including
price quotations from at least two eligible suppliers, except where direct contacting may
be appropriate under IDA procurement guidelines.



- 11 -
33.   Disbursements of the EERC for contracts valued in excess of US$1 million equivalent
will be based on full documentation (contracts, orders, invoices, bills receipts) where available,
or simplified documentation (customs certificates). The appraisal mission determined that
customs certificates in Haiti are acceptable to IDA. For contracts of US$1 million equivalent
or below, disbursements will be based on statement of expenditures (SOE) to be prepared from
-the documentation as described above. These documents will be stored in Haiti and made
available for fuure inspection by IDA supervision missions as well as for audit purposes.
34. Audits. The CCU will maintain records and accounts of all transactions relating to the
EERC. The CCU will hire independent auditing services to assist in the preparation and
execution of annual audits, to be furnished to IDA within four months after the end of Haiti's
fiscal year.
35.   Reporting and Monitoring. The CCU will be responsible for monitoring project
progress and for preparing quarterly progress reports, satisfactory to IDA, based on the
submissions from the sector staff and the Economic and Social Fund. The reports will be
reviewed by the Steering Committee, submitted to IDA and other donors within 30 days after
the end of each quarter, and subsequently discussed and reviewed at joint meetings. The
progress reports will be issued starting April 30, 1995. A mid-term review will be carried out
in June 1995. A project completion report for the EERC will be prepared within six months
after the closing of the Credit.
36.   Lessons Learned from Other Emergency Operations. The current crisis in Haiti is
comparable to other emergency situations involving war or civil distutbances for which the
World Bank Group has provided support through emergency recovery operations following
Operational Directive 8.50. The lessons learned from these operations suggest the need for: (i)
simple project design; (ii) strong govermment commitment; (iii) very close communication
between tie Borrower and the World Bank Group; (iv) simplified procurement and disbursement
procedures; and (v) maximum use of exisfing functioning institutions. Although emergency
recovery operations should be designed with some view to long-term development objectives,
reconstruction itself should not be seen as a mechanism to achieve those objectives. Countries
suffering from disasters have limited insttutional and absorptive capacity, and the focus needs
to be on the most immediate needs. These lessons are incorporated in the design of the
proposed operation, complemented by rstrucrig of the existng portfolio to address basic
emergency needs in ifstucture rehabilitation, social sectrs, and employment creation.
Medim-term development issues would be addressed in follow-up operations, once the most
critical emergency needs are met.
37.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The restoration of the constitutional Govemment
provides Haiti with a unique opportmity to reconstuct its economy, but the country will depend
heavily on external assistance in this effort. In this context, IDA involvement will facilitate
rapid donor assistance. Apart from providing an important financial contribution through the
EERC, IDA involvement would: (i) bring to bear the World Bank Groups' experience in other
emergency operations in the implementation of the Program; (ii) provide necessary technical



- 12 -
expertise; (iii) provide a framework for donor coordination; and (iv) serve as a catalyst for other
donor contributions.
38.   Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to critical actions prior to Credit
effectiveness. These relate to project management to ensure that the EERC achieves its objective
in the context of a successful Program. Specifically, the Government will:
(a) establish the CCU and the cabinet-level Steering Committee chaired by the Prime
Minister (see para. 24); and
(b) appoint a Director General and key staff for the CCU (see para. 25).
The Govermnent also agreed to:
(c) grant the CCU technical, administative and financial autonomy, and certain
exemptions from the rules normally applicable to the public administration; and
(d) conduct a mid-term review of the Program in June 1995 based upon the quarterly
progress reports.
The Government has expressed its commitment to ensure the sustainability of the recovery effort
supported by the Program through sound economic management.
39.   Environmental Aspects.  As a quick-disbursing operation, the EERC has an
environmental rating of C and requires no special environmental assessment. In line with
standard IDA practices, eligible imports exclude enviromnentally hazardous materials.
Environmental arrangements under ongoing IDA operations supporting the Program remain in
effect, and the Program will be able to draw on environmental advisory services funded by
UNDP as needs arise.
40.   Project Benefits. The benefits of the EERC, in the context of the Program, include
providing timely finance for critical imports for the reconstruction effort and for restoring basic
Govermnent services. Because of its flexible, quick-disbursing natre, it will complement
assistance earmarked for specific investment projects, supporting imports of consumable or
capital goods by both public and private entities. Thus, the EERC will contibute to Haiti's
stability, and help to halt the decline in economic growth and the deterioration of social
indicators. In addition, through this operation, IDA will coordinate with other donors, thus
enhancing the overall impact of the reconstruetion effort. While the benefits of the operation
cannot be quantified, they are expected to be substantial.
41.   Project Risks. The risks for the EERC center on political instability in Haiti. These
risks must be judged as high at this time. While the expectations of the population regarding
the improvement of the living conditions are understandably high, the financial and institional
capacity of the Govermment to bring about these improvements is extremely weak. More



- 13 -
specifically, there are three main risks to consider. First, donor assistance for the Program may
not be forthcoming on the scale expected or in a dmely manner. Second, the overall assistance
program may not be managed effectively due to the country's debilitated institutional capacity.
Third, in some areas, policy reforms necessitated by the country's severe fiscal constraints after
three years of economic mismanagement could have high social costs and undermine the
Government's popular support. IDA will attempt to address these risks in the context of the
Program through: (i) close coordination with the donor community; (ii) substantial technical
assistance; and (iii) speedy processing of the proposed operation and restructuring of its existing
project portfolio to address the population's basic emergency needs. In the event of any shortfall
in expcted technical assistance from other donors, IDA will further seek to assist the
Government through reallocation of funds under ongoing sector operations. Finally, since the
sustinability of the Program will ultmtely depend on the speed with which a medium-term
economic program can be put in place, IDA will assist the Government in the design of such a
program wbich would then be supported by the proposed follow-up Structural Adjustment Credit
and future investment projects.
E. RECOMMENDATION
42.    1 am satisfied that the proposed Credit of SDR26.8 million (US$40 million equivalent)
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.

Executing Agency  Electricite de Haiti (EdH)
Beneficiaries     The cities of Hinche and Thomonde, through supplying electricity; and the
general population, through improving the efficiency of EdH.
Project Objectives The objective of the project is to provide power investments which are
urgently needed to ensre a reliable supply of power necessary for
economic growth, and in particular, for industdal and commercial
activities. The additional capacity to be provided will avoid the rationing
of power that would otherwise become severe.   Further, by
interconnecting the cities of Hinche and Thomonde to the main grid, it
would substitute for expensive local diesel generation and thus lower
operating costs. The project would also reduce non-technical losses, and
improve EdH's managerial financial and techical capacity.
Project Description The project includes: (a) insallation of two 20-MW gas turbine generating
units in Port-au-Prince; (b) constuction of a single-circuit, 42 kn-long
sub-transmission line of 23 kv from the Peligre hydro plmt to Hinche; (c)
procurement of equipment and tools for maitnance of distribution
systems and the loss-reduction program; (d) preparation of feasiilitr
studies for future medium-speed diesel units; (e) a pre-investment study
to assess the economic merits of a frequency conversion (from 50 Hz to
60 Hz) of the Ciment d'Haiti plant, to serve this plant from EdH's main
grid; (f) s h g  of an on-going program to reduce non-technical
losses; and (g) carrying out a program  for EdH's insdtional
development, including the implementation of a taning program.

Beneficiaries     The project's main benefit would be to extend health service coverage and
improve the health status of up to 2.1 million people in the western health
region, particularly of mothers and children, and control the spread of two
major epidemics (AIDS and tuberculosis) nationwide.
Project Objectives The project aims at assisting the Government in improving the countiyA
health status through selected investments linked to increased efficiency
and effectiveness of expenditures in health. Its specific objectives are: (a)
reducing ministerial central administration expenditures by about 359% in
real terms; (b) changing the ratio of salaries to operating expenses from
87.5/12.5 to 70/30; (c) implementing improved cost-recovery mechanisms
for medical services and drugs; (d) developing a more coherent
institutional framework involving the selective strengtening of key
management and technical functions, and the development and
enforcement of personnel norms and standards; (e) for the population of
the western health region, reducing maternal and child mortality rates by
15% by the end of the third year of the project, and by 40% by the end
of the sixth year of the project; and (f) countering the potentially
devastating effects of the AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics.
Project Description The project activities include to: (a) rationalize the allocation of resources
for primary health care within a more coherent institonal framework;
(b) implement, in the western health region, a Basic Health Services
Delivery Model conceived as a framework for all health activities; and (c)
support the AIDS medium-term prevention and control program, and the
national tuberculosis control program. The corresponding three key
measures are: (a) restucturing of the Ministry budget over the project
implementation period; (b) improving coordination, dialogue and
integration between the private and public sectors; and (c) impleming
recruitment and retirement policies as provided by legal regulations.

A FRAMEWORK FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY
Dear Mr. Preston
1.   The Republic of Haiti has suffered through a long period of economic decline and
political instability. This period was marked by high inflation, rising poverty and a critical
deterioration in the ability of the state to provide basic services. On the occasion of the
return of President Aristide and the restoration of a constitutional government, we have the
opportunity to begin anew. Our first and fundamental objective is the restoration of law and
order within the country, the amelioration of social conditions, and the resuscitation of the
economy in the context of the Emergency Economic Recovery Program (EERP). Once this
has been assured, our economic objectives will focus on policies that will improve the
functioning of the state, achieve sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic context and
reduce poverty and social inequalities. I would like to take the occasion of this letter to
outline an economic policy framework for the next twelve to eighteen months, designed to
ensure the sustainability of the economic recovery process supported by the EERP.
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
2.   In 1993, a multi-agency task force, including participation by the Intemational
Development Association (IDA), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other
multilateral organizations, laid out the basis of our EERP which we are beginning to
implement, taking into account the findings of the recent up-dating mission. This program
has identified about US$394 million of budgetary/balance of payments support, technical
assistance and emergency measures to be carried out over the next twelve to eighteen
months. It focuses on social programs directed at poverty alleviation, repair of basic



infrastructure, protection of the environment, support for private sector development and
restoration of key central government functions. We estimate quick-disbursing funds of at
least US$130 million will be required during the first year, in order to restore the functions
and services of the central government. A small part of the program, amounting to about
US$28 million, is aimed at providing technical assistance to help reorganize the public sector,
strengthen economic management and assist in carrying out the EERP. Of the remaining
US$236 million for sectoral programs, nearly two-thirds involve expenditures for labor
intensive works. In the social sectors, our activities will be aimed at improving the supply
of basic supplies, such as drugs and school books, increased staff training, and targeted
programs of nutrition and maternal and child health. In infrastructure, our objective is to
rehabilitate existing infrastructure which has been neglected in the past, including roads,
water supply, ports and electric power. In order to carry out the EERP as expeditiously as
possible, an emergency implementation unit (EIU) will be established linked to the office
of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister wil provide general oversight of the EERP,
supported by a Steering Committee including the Ministers of Finance and Planning, and
the Governor of the Central Bank. Also, existing sectoral implementation arrangements will
be utilized, and all sectors of the Civil Society will be invited to participate in the
implementation process.
3.    We hope that this program will attract support of multilateral and bilateral donors.
The proposed Emergency Economic Recovery Credits of IDA and IDB will be important
contributions which will permit us to finance critical imports for the private and public sector
under the umbrella of the EERP. We intend to make a full report on progress on the
EERP, and discuss additional financing needs, during the forthcoming Consultative Group
meeting in early 1995.
4.   In addition to the emergency measures described above, the Government will need
external support in the areas of governance and humanitarian assistance, as well as funds
to clear Haiti's arrears. To clear arrears with the multilateral lenders, a support group
meeting chaired by the U.S. Treasury has been convened, and a financing plan for the
clearance of these arrears has been established. The Govemment of Haiti has allocated
US$13 million of its own funds to this effort, and we expect the clearance of arrears to be
effected soon.
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
5.   In order to ensure a stable and productive environment for the private sector, we are
taking steps necessary to stabilize the economy. Working with the IMF, we are identifying
measures necessary to contain the overall public sector defici. We are also taking steps to
reduce monetary growth based on credit by the Central Bank, and expect overall inflation
to be substantially reduced in 1995. Ceilings on interest rates will be abolished so as to
effect market determined interest rates on loans. The Government will at the same time
explore ways to revitalize the system of credit unions and broaden access to credit. We hope
to finalize our overall macroeconomic program in the next few weeks and reach agreement
with the IMF on a new Stand-by Arrangement by early 1995. This agreement will outline



-3.
our objectives for monetary growth, the public sector deficit, and external accounts, within
the objective of reducing inflation and laying the basis for economic recovery.
THE ROLE OF THE STATE
6.    The past decade has seen a marked deterioration in the ability of the state to provide
basic services. While public sector employment increased considerably, government revenues
declined, resulting in a deterioration of services, particularly in the social sectors. At the
same time, the Government expanded its reach into the productive sectors through public
enterprises, which preempted private investors. We are committed to refocus the role of
the state on its legitimate functions of prwiding security, justice, basic economic
infrastructure and essential social services targeted at the poor. To do this, we must make
some fundamental changes in the way the state operates.
7.    Revenues. Tax evasion, avoidance and corruption have become endemic, and we
estimate that the tax to GDP ratio has fallen to 4 percent in 1994, one of the lowest in the
world. We intend to raise this ratio at least to the level of 8 percent of GDP attained in
1991. The primary focus will be on tax administration and compliance. First, overdue
payments to the Treasury will be collected and steps taken to reduce tax delinquency.
Second, the high cost of tax collection, relative to revenues generated, will be reduced
through budget reallocations, administrative reforms and staff training. Third, in view of the
high concentration of tax payments on a few entities, we will immediately establish a unit
specializing on the largest taxpayers. This will improve the ability to cross-check fiscal
information with the customs administration as well as within the internal revenue
administration. Fourth, we want to broaden our tax base, specifically through including
professionals. Finally, steps will be taken to eliminate bribery and corruption in tax and
customs administration.
8.    Expenditures. The level of public expenditures has been so eroded by inflation that
the Government is unable to adequately discharge most of the basic functions that are the
proper responsibility of the public sector. Furthermore, the current pattem of public
expenditures is inappropriate in view of the urgent needs of the social sectors. The
Government intends to make major steps to improve delivery of health, nutrition and
education services. Particular focus will be given to increasing non-salary operating and
maintenance expenditures, including medical supplies and equipment, school textbooks and
supplies, and targeted nutrition programs. High priority will be extended to augmenting
allocations throughout the public sector for maintenance and operating expenditures, so as
to prevent further deterioration in the stock of infrastructure. We will also undertake a
major review of the public sector ir.vestment program, focusing on high priority rehabilitation
investments in infrastructure. Our overall objective is to have a significant increase in public
sector investment in fiscal year 1995, consistent with our overall macroeconomic targets
which will be outlined in the IMF Stand-by Arrangement. At the same time, the
Government will eliminate unnecessary and wasteful expenditures, particularly by eliminating



-4-
spending from discretionary accounts and fraudulent employment practices, and by
introducing procurement procedures that ensure accountability.
9.    Clvil Service Reform. We intend to transform the civil service to make it an efficient
instrument for the delivery of services to society. To this end, civil service management will
be improved, the size of the civil service reduced, and the level of professional competence
increased.  Personnel management practices will be revamped to make processes
transparent, clear criteria and qualifications for employment will be established, and more
up-to-date personnel records will be assembled. Voluntary separation and early retirement
schemes will serve as a means to eliminating redundant employment. The phasing of the
civil service retrenchment will depend critically on the financial means available to the
Governmnent to cover up-front costs. In order to attract qualified people to the civil
service, part of the medium-term savings realized from the above programs will be used to
increase key salaries. On a pilot basis, and to improve the effectiveness of government
services, we will start decentralizing some positions and functions to the local authorities.
10.   Democratization of Asset Ownership. State control of substantial productive assets
has resulted in mismanagement and corruption and imposed serious political, economic and
financial costs on Haiti's society and economy. The consolidation of a democratic order and
the desire to foster economic growth and efficiency compels the Government to dispose of
these assets.
11.   The intended comprehensive divestiture needs to be accompanied by the
implementation of an appropriate regulatory framework and anti-trust legislation. To
prevent undue concentration of wealth within the country, the Government will seek out
foreign investors, members of the Haitian Diaspora, and small domestic savers. Additionally,
arrangement will be made to ultimately transfer part of the ownership to traditionally
excluded segments of society, including the victims of the unconstitutional rule. To further
support the redistribution objectives, the Government will give priority to investing proceeds
from the divestiture so as to benefit the poor, including in infrastructure, low-cost housing,
and a permanent trust fund for education and health.
12.  International Trade. The country's exchange system is free of restrictions and
transactions are taking place at the free (Interbank) market rate. The Government is
committed to continue this policy and to allow the Central Bank to purchase foreign
exchange only for its operations.
13.   While steps have been taken in the past to reduce effective protection, our trade
regime compares unfavorably to that of many other countries, and thwarts our goal of
achieving a competitive and open economy. In addition to having many different rates and
exemptions, the import duty structure is too high and encourages contraband and corruption,
and benefits domestic monopolists. High tariffs on agricultural products particularly raise
the price of food for the poor. To correct this situation and promote economic efficiency,
the Government plans to eliminate the remaining quantitative restrictions and move towards



-5-
the elimination of all tariffs except for those on a small number of sensitive goods including
rice, corn, beans and sorghum. The tariff reform will be phased so as to facilitate the
transition to a free trade regime with a view to a concurrent reduction in the relative tariff
dispersion. In conjunction with the tariff reform, the system of import valuation will be
modified and moved to the free market exchange rate, and the duty-free franchise system
will be reviewed to eliminate abuses. To reduce uncertainty, the respective legislation will
be submitted to Parliament by early 1995. We will ensure that these reforms take place in
the context of a viable fiscal regime. To this end, we already revised taxes for petroleum
products and eliminated the implicit subsidy by making sales to the private sector at the
market exchange rate.
14.   Any revenue losses from the trade reform will further be offset by implementing
higher excise duties on luxury consumer goods, alcohol, tobacco, and automobiles. As we
undertake the liberalization process, we will also negotiate with our major trading partners
better access to their markets, including maximum favorable treatment with respect to
quantitative restrictions and tariffs for the next ten years. In addition, the Government
intends to mobilize international assistance to improve the competitiveness of the agricultural
sector, particularly focusing on rice production. The legislation incorporating the tariff
reductions for agricultural products would be introduced concurrently with measures to
support this sector.
15.   Poverty and the Social Sectors. Regretfully, Haiti remains the poorest country in the
western hemisphere. While a strong and sustained recovery of growth will do much to raise
incomes and provide employment for the poor, this must be complemented with effective
programs in health, nutrition and other social services that will eliminate the worst
manifestations of poverty, and provide a safety net for those most affected by the current
severe recession in the Haitian economy. As stated above, we will make a major
reallocation within our budget to increase the funding for health, education, nutrition and
other social programs, although we hope that some of these expenditures will be financed
by foreign grants as well. We intend to revitalize the Economic and Social Fund, instituting
more flexible procedures and seeking additional external financing. We appreciate the role
of grass roots organizations and NGOs in delivering essential services, and will continue to
count on their support. To more effectively integrate these organizations in our effort to
alleviate poverty, we would like to request that IDA and IDB undertake a Poverty
Assessment, to assist in the formulation of social development and poverty alleviation
policies and programs.
AID COORDINATION
16.   We sincerely appreciate the support of IDA and IDB, as well as other multilateral
and bilateral agencies during the recent transition period. We recognize, however, that steps
are necessary to improve our aid coordination efforts, in order to ensure that aid funds are
used to maximum effect and that aid projects are consistent with implementation capacities



6 -
and available counterpart funds. We look forward to the forthcoming Consultative Group
Meeting for Haiti in early 1995 as an opportunity to further explain our program and
objectives, and to elicit support from the donor community. In addition, we intend to
develop, with the staff of the relevant multilateral agencies, a Policy Framework Paper (PEP)
which will lay out in more detail our policy objectives described here and a timetable for
their implementation. We hope that the PFP would provide the basis for a future dialogue
on adjustment lending from IDA, IDB, the IMF and other donors.
