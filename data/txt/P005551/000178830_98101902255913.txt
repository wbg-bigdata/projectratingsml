REPORT AliD RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE D)IRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SYRIAN
ARAB REPUBLIC FOR THE SECOND DAMASCUS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Syrian Arab Republic for the equivalent of US$35 million to help fi-
nance the Second Damascus Water Supply Project. The loan would have a term
of twenty-five years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 per-
cent per annum and would be relent to the Etablissement Public des Eaux de
Figeh (EPEF), the Damascus Water Authority, on the same terms and conditions.
It is proposed that partly joint, partly parallel financing for the project be
provided by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development in the form of a
loan to the Government of $40 million equivalent, with a term of 25 years
including 5 years of grace, at 6 percent per annum, to be utilized as Govern-
ment's contribution to EPEF's equity.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects for
Syria" (No. 806-SYR, October 31, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors on November 12, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since attaining independence in 1946, Syria has had several changes
in regime which resultedl in a shift of power from groups of landowners, traders,
and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians, and civil
servants, as well as a shift of the economy from an essential laissez-faire
system to a largely publicly-owned and regulated one. The Baath Socialist
Party, the ruling party since 1963, provided substantial continuity of emphasis
on economic and social development policies which have, by and large, prevailed
in spite of internal Government changes and tensions within the Middle East.
During the 1960's an agrarian reform was completed, with redistribution of land
to large number of formerly landless peasants. In November 1970 General Assad
became President of the Republic, and his regime has since been characterized
by a balance of firmness and conciliation in domestic policies, economic
pragmatism, a concerted. search for a better defined role for the private
sector in a centrally regulated economy, as well as diversification of foreign
economic relations. These aims have been pursued gradually and, in spite of
continued political uncertaintity in the Middle East, substantial reorienta-
tion of economic policies and diversification of production have been achieved.
4.        Developments in the second half of the 1960s had far-reaching effects
on economic performance as private initiative and investment declined while
public sector investment gained momentum only slowly. However, economic per-
formance since 1970 has improved significantly, partly as a result of favor-
able weather conditions which led to a substantial increase in agricultural

- 2 -
production, and partly because the newly-introduced economic policy measures
which aimed at stimulating the private sector began to take effect. The ris-
ing trend in output, however, was interrupted by the severe drought in 1973
and the aftermath of the October war. Nevertheless, by 1974 the Syrian econ-
omy had almost completely recovered both from the dislocation caused by the
war and from the relative stagnation of the agricultural sector brought about
by the drought. As a result, GDP in 1974 increased by almost 13 percent in
real terms compared to just over 2 percent in the previous year. Overall,
real per capita income increased by over 5 percent per year between 1970 and
1974. Economic growth in 1975 is believed to have been close to that achieved
in 1974, and prospects for continued growth in 1976 are good.
5.        Because of the size and importance of the agricultural sector, the
Syrian economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in agricultural out-
put brought about by variations in the amount and timing of rainfall. How-
ever, the share of industry in GDP has grown substantially in recent years
and industry is emerging as a leading sector in the economy. National ac-
counts estimates for 1974 indicate that both agriculture and industry ac-
counted for about 22 percent of GDP in constant 1963 prices, but because of
the relative increases in industrial prices, value added in industry at cur-
rent prices amounted to 30 percent of GDP while that for agriculture reached
22 percent. With the expected growth in extractive industries, the share of
the industrial sector relative to that of agriculture is expected to rise
further in the near future.
6.        Total investment continues to increase both in absolute and relative
terms. Gross fixed investment increased from about LS 1.2 billion (about 16.7
percent of GDP) in 1971 to about LS 3.0 billion in 1974 (about 20.5 percent
of GDP), with the public sector accounting for about two-thirds of the total.
Though its share in total investment has remained about constant, private
investment in absolute terms increased threefold between 1970 and 1974. By
far the larger part of investment was in industry and construction. At the
same time, domestic savings continued to grow and on average financed some 70
percent of total investment with net imports accounting for the remaining
30 percent. However, with the growth of current transfers from abroad, na-
tional savings, which averaged about 29 percent of GNP over the past two years,
have substantially exceeded current domestic investment in recent years.
7.         Recently, there have been significant changes in absolute and rela-
tive prices. The GDP deflator indicates a 37 percent increase in prices in
1974 compared to under 6 percent average growth per year during 1970-1973.
Indices of wholesale and retail prices, though less reliable, confirm the
rapidly emerging inflationary pressures in the economy as increased ag-
gregate demand continues to generate pressures on domestic resources. In
spite of an improved external balance situation import liberalization poli-
cies have so far not been used effectively to increase the total supply
of resources. Growing inflationary pressures may pose serious problems for
the Syrian economy in future and, if unchecked, may reflect adversely on
future growth prospects of the economy. A favorable balance of payments



position and a relatively high level of foreign exchange reserves would
warrant a further liberalization of import regulations to increase the supply
of goods and services in an attempt to dampen inflationary pressure in the
economy.
8.         Continued overall deficits have been the main characteristic of
the Syrian Government budget in recent years. Domestic revenues have been
slightly higher than current expenditures, so that a large part of development
expenditures has been financed through external project loans or through bor-
rowing from the banking system. Since 1973, however, the situation has sub-
stantially changed as grants and aid from other Arab countries increased
to such a level that Government recourse to the banking system t:o finance
the overall deficits was unnecessary.     With an even higher level of public
expenditures, the overall budgetary deficit in 1974 was twice as large as
that for the previous year, yet it was more than covered by an etven larger
amount of Arab grants and other aid.
9.        The substantial increase in domestic revenues in 1973 and 1974,
mainly as a result of the rapid growth of oil revenues, is expected to con-
tinue in 1975. To the extent that the past increase in income was not a
result of higher taxes, their use in financing an even higher level of public
expenditure on domestic goods and services results in a net injection of extra
liquidity in the economy which might lead to an intensification of the infla-
tionary impact of the budget. This is even more so since the share of tax and
other non-oil revenues in total revenues has been declining.
10.       Government development expenditures are carried out in accordance
with the Third Five-Year Plan (1971-75). During the first three years of the
Plan, there were considerable shortfalls in total planned expenditures, mainly
due to weaknesses in project preparation and follow up procedures, as well as
severe shortages of foreign exchange. More recently, however, a heightened
concern with development issues, new procedures and reporting systems, as well
as a considerable easing of the foreign exchange situation, have led to a
considerably higher public sector investment, particularly for 1974, with an
even stronger performarLce anticipated for 1975. However, these improvements
might have come too late to substantially increase the implementation rates
of the current Plan, which at the end of 1975 probably did not exceed 55-60
percent.
11.       Syria's balance of payments, which had been in substantial deficit
since 1968, improved in 1971 when the deficit was reduced sharply, registered
a small surplus in 1972, very substantial surpluses in 1973 and 1974, and is
expected to have been in surplus again in 1975. The improvement initially
reflected increased oil transit dues, current transfers from abroad, and
private capital inflow. In the last two years, large transfers from Arab
countries have offset the widening trade deficit and resulted in overall pay-
ment surpluses of LS 1.2 billion in 1973 and an estimated LS 641 million in
1974. As a result, gross foreign international reserves increased from the
equivalent of US$135 million at the end of 1972 to US$481 million at the end
of 1973, $528 million at the end of 1974, and an estimated $770 million as of



- 4 -
September 30, 1975, equivalent to about six months imports at 1974 levels.
With a satisfactory foreign exchange position and increasing inflationary
pressures, further liberalization of import policies is warranted and can be
expected.
12.       Work on the Fourth Development Plan 1976-80 has been nearly com-
pleted. Preliminary indications are that the strategy of the forthcoming Plan
may not differ substantially from that of the previous Plan with heavy con-
centration of public sector investment on the development of agriculture, in-
cluding irrigation, as well as extractive industries, particularly oil and
phosphates. The investment rate is to be stepped up considerably, although
skilled manpower and domestic resources may be increasingly-felt constraints
on the growth of investment,, particularly in the public sector. Taking these
factors into account, future prospects for the Syrian economy are favorable
and would be greatly enhanced if peace is restored to the area. The pragmatic
outlook of the present Government and the recent changes in the direction of
economic policies are likely to make it possible for the private sector to
contribute effectively to the future development and diversification of the
Syrian economy. Syria's oil output in 1975 was about 10 million tons worth
about $700 million, which makes it eligible for membership in OPEC. Oil ex-
ports for 1975 provided foreign exchange for about one-half of imports and
export prospects are quite favorable. Syria has also substantial though low
quality phosphate reserves and while export prospects also look favorable,
revenues will depend on the fluctuation of the price level on the world
markets. Assuming that the Syrian authorities can keep current inflationary
pressures under control, real growth could exceed 9 percent per year between
1975 and 1980, with an assumed acceleration of the growth of investment and
exports by comparison with 1970-74 results. This would create substantial
import and external borrowing requirements.
13.       The country will, therefore, continue to need to borrow abroad to
finance development projects, particularly in the public sector. Excluding
external obligations contracted for military purposes, Syria's external public
debt amounted to $702 million by the end of 1974, and debt service payment on
external public debt (excluding military) were estimated at about $52 million,
equivalent to 5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services at 1974
level. Although investment and growth targets of the Five-Year Plan (1976-
80) are uncertain, preliminary Bank projections estimate that on average, the
resource gap may be about $445 million during 1976-80 with an implied gross
borrowing requirement of some $340 million per year over this period. Beyond
1980, however, capital requirements may be substantially larger as grant in-
flows may be reduced. Nevertheless, the debt service ratio is likely to be
well under 15 percent over the next decade and beyond.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
14.       Syria has to date received four IDA credits totalling $47.3 million
and four loans totalling $168.6 million, both net of cancellations. All loans
were made in 1974 and 1975. Although Syria is a member of the Corporation, IFC



- 5 -
has made no investments. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and Bank loans as of February 29, 1976 together with notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
15.       Project implementation has generally suffered substantial delays
due in large part to circumstances beyond Syria's control. The 1973 hostil-
ities brought works to a standstill and diverted the country's resources
first to military, then to reconstruction tasks although recovery was quite
rapid (see above paragraph 3). Continued unsettled conditions in the region
compounded the high rate of world inflation and combined with local bottle-
necks in the administrative system and the construction industry and the need
for expensive expatriate skilled labor to generate considerable cost overruns.
Three projects were most -severely affected, the First Water Supply Project
(Credit 401-SYR), the Ealikh Irrigation Project (Credit 469-SYR and Loan 975-SYR),
and the first Mehardeh Power Project (Loan 986-SYR). As a result:, composition
of the water supply and the power projects had to be revised and additional
financing secured. In the case of the Balikh project, another cause of delays
was the difficulty in agreeing on bidding documents and procedures acceptable
to the Syrian authorities and the Bank; however,this question has now been
resolved satisfactorily.
16.       Following the priorities assigned to investment under the Third De-
velopment Plan, past Bank Group lending concentrated on infrastructure (about
two-thirds) and irrigation (one-third). Lending to infrastructure, with power
accounting for about 50 percent of overall lending, highways about 10 percent
and water supply 7 percent, aimed to improve sector policies and strengthen
various public institutions in charge. The objective of improving irrigation
and soils in the Euphrates Basin was to increase agricultural employment, pro-
duction and exports whiLe reducing food imports, and the dependency on weather
fluctuations. A number of ambitious programs in water supply, electricity,
telecommunications, and highways are planned in 1976-1980, while Syria will
step up its effort to become self sufficient in and even an exporter of food
resources.
17.       The Bank envisages further support to the Government's strategy of
improving infrastructure. Preparation of the third highway project is under-
way and studies for a sewerage project which are financed from proceeds of the
first water supply project will commence shortly. A telecommunications project
which involves the expansion of the telephone system by 129,000 lines has been
appraised and is scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors later in
the current fiscal year. This project is aimed at eliminating major communica-
tions deficiencies in Syria which are hampering productivity in many sectors of
the economy. Continued support is also envisaged to the Government's-strategy
of developing productive capacity in the agricultural sector. While in the
past, lending for agriculture has been for irrigation, more emphasis will now
be given to projects increasing the productivity of Syria's 2.8 million ha of
rainfed land. To assist the Government in improving the living st:andards of
the rural population, the Bank has also incorporated in its lending program
and is now helping to prepare a project for rural electrification. A livestock
project involving credit for animal feed requirements during dry years, which
would benefit about 17,000 semi-nomadic families among the poorest in the
country, has been appraised and is scheduled to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the course of the current fiscal year.



18.       Together with continued support of infrastructure and agriculture,
a degree of diversification is contemplated for future lending. In view of
Syria's drive to develop manufacturing industries, which will be accelerated
in the Fourth Development Plan, the Bank plans to assist the development of
Syrian industry possibly through a DFC project. Projects in education and
tourism are also planned.
19.       Through the lending activities described above, the Bank proposes
to put more emphasis in Syria on project preparation and implementation.
While in the short-term this may lead to increased utilization of expatriate
consultants, the longer term objective is to build up local expertise in these
field.
20.       As of the end of 1974, the Bank Group's share in Syria external
public debt (excluding military) was estimated at 4 percent on a disbursement
basis. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was nil in 1974. By 1980,
the Bank's Group shares in debt outstanding and in debt service are expected
to rise to about 17 percent and 11 percent respectively.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN SYRIA
21.       Generally, because of its semi-arid climate, its geology and geograph-
ical location, Syria's water resources are scarce. Economic growth and the
rapid expansion of the urban population to almost one-half of total population
are creating an increasing demand for water for domestic and industrial uses
which strains traditional sources of supply. Most of the existing urban water
transmission and distribution systems, notably that of Damascus, have not been
rehabilitated or expanded for a long time and are becoming overburdened. Water
pollution problems also exist in the large cities, none of which has a treatment
plant.
22.       The situation in Damascus is becoming increasingly difficult.    The
city has experienced dry season water shortages and restrictions since 1972,
with no improvement in sight since the growing population remains dependent on
one single source of supply--the Figeh Spring--and a transmission system of
limited capacity. In addition, there are substantial losses from the distri-
bution system which is in serious need of rehabilitation. As a result, per
capita consumption has fallen from 174 1. per day in 1972 to 163 1. in 1975
and is expected to fall to 145 1. in 1979. Also, the number of individual
water connections is not keeping pace with the increasing population.
23.       At the central level, the responsibility for water supply and sew-
erage both in rural and urban areas is shared between the Ministry of Local
Affairs (MLA) and the Ministry of Housing and Utilities (MHU). Generally,
water supply and distribution as well as other urban services are managed by
units within the municipal administrative structure with assistance from MHU
for project design and implementation. Damascus and four other large cities
(Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Lattakia) have independent authorities in charge of
potable water supply. These authorities are subject to close control from
Government on all important mattters such as tariffs, personnel, budgets,



accounts and major contracts; in addition, they are required to transfer any
current surplus to the Treasury. Generally, central services and authorities
suffer from a shortage of qualified staff.
24.       The supply of water in Syria is traditionally considered as a basic
public service, the price of which should be kept low, if need be, through
subsidization. In most parts of the country, water tariffs have not been
changed for several years and a nation-wide ceiling of LS 0.40 per m3 (USJ 41
per 1,000 gal.) was imposed by the Government in 1969.    In the absence of a
pricing system reflecting actual cost, the sector is incapable of generating
the financing necessary for new investments, and authorities and municipali-
ties are dependent upon Government contributions for capital works.
25.       Under the Third Development Plan (1971-1975) the Government aimed
at expanding the supply and distribution systems of Damascus and of a number
of villages in all parts of the country with a total population of 300,000
people. However, a large part of the proposed works were not executed due to
lack of qualified personnel and the cumbersome administrative system. Pro-
posals have been made by MHU to improve project implementation in the water
supply sector through establishment of new agencies, coordination of studies,
and  the reorganization and expansion of local construction industries.    It
is unlikely that these proposals can be implemented without profound changes
within the public sector to attract the needed professional staff and skilled
manpower. Even more important, because of the magnitude of investments con-
templated, considerable efforts will be necessary to find adequate sources
of financing. Overall investment in water supply and sewerage for 1976-1980
has been estimated at over $1.2 billion in January 1975 prices. In addition
to substantial borrowing, such level of investment, even if only partly at-
tained, would require a measure of cash generation by the sector institu-
tions to supplement Government contributions. The Government has now recog-
nized the need for an increase in the average price of water expected to be
implemented in the near future (Project Agreement, Section 4.04 and Loan
Agreement, Section 4.02).
26.       Urbanization and industrial activity have created serious pollution
problems affecting the populated areas of Syria, and gastrointestinal diseases
related to polluted water resources and lack of sanitation are considered the
most prevalent causes oE sickness and death. Fairly adequate sewer networks
exist in the cities of Aleppo, Homs, and Hama, but the centuries-old system of
Damascus is inadequate. None of these cities nor any large industries have
sewerage treatment plancs, and their discharge into rivers, with relatively
small dry water flow, causes pollution of water used for irrigation, indus-
tries, and towns. Pollution problems are especially serious in the Orontes
River basin where almost: one million people live and where the industrial
towns of Homs and Hama are located and in the basin of the Barada River which
receives sewerage from Damascus.



- 8 -
27.       The Government has become increasingly aware of these problems and
has created a pollution control department within MHU. The department has
prepared draft legislation for regulating discharge of industrial waste and
is considering measures to control waste discharges. However, progress is
hampered by shortage of financial resources and the scarcity of engineering
skills. It has been agreed with the Government that a Bank mission would
carry out a survey of the water supply and sewerage sector before the end
of FY 1976.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Damascus Water Supply
Project" (No. 938-SYR, dated March 24, 1976) is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The main features of the proposed loan and proj-
ect are summarized in Annex III.
Background
29.       Although for many years Damascus has had an abundant supply of
cheap and high quality water from the Figeh spring in the neighboring hills
above the city, peak demand has now overtaken maximum production capacity.
Following studies commissioned at the end of the 1960's by "Etablissement
Public des Eaux de Figeh" (EPEF, the Damascus Water Supply Authority), IDA
agreed in 1973 to assist in financing a project with a $15 million Credit
(401-SYR). The project included the expansion of the supply (through con-
struction of an underground cutoff wall and tunnel) and distribution works
(through construction of 530 km of mains); provision of equipment to assist
in the operation and maintenance of the distribution system; engineering and
management consulting assistance; training for EPEF staff in management and
engineering; and studies of sewerage and pollution control.
30.       The outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East in October 1973
delayed project implementation. When in January 1975, the first tenders for
the project (tunnel and underground work and first phase of distribution works)
were received, it became evident that costs would greatly exceed appraisal es-
timates. The increase was due to a number of factors including delays, steeper
than expected international inflation, change in currency parities, the strained
capacity of local construction industry, and a premium charged by foreign con-
tractors and suppliers because of unsettled conditions in the region.
31.       This led to a thorough review of the composition of the project.
Additional studies were requested by the Association to determine whether an
underground tunnel remained the least cost means of supply. At the same time
the Government was compelled to revise its financing plan for the project. On
May 12, 1975, at the request of the Syrian Government, the Executive Directors
agreed to a revision of the original project description and to utilize the
proceeds of the credit only for urgently required distribution rehabilitation
works and sewerage studies.     In June 1975, the United States Agency for



- 9 -
International Developm,snt (USAID) agreed to lend Syria $48 million to help
finance the foreign exchange component of the remainder of the distribution
works needed to serve che city until 1980.
32.       The additional feasibility studies requested by IDA confirmed that
an underground tunnel was the least cost solution for supply. Subsequently,
the proposed water supply project was appraised in August/September 1975.
At negotiations in Washington in March 1976, the Syrian Government was repre-
sented by Mr. H.E. Abdul Baki, Minister of Housing and Utilities, and EPEF
by Mr. Rida Mourtada, President and General Manager of EPEF.
Project Description
33.       The main purpose of the project is to increase the supply of water
from the Figeh Spring to serve the population of Damascus until about 1987
through the distribution works which now exist or are under construction and
through expected extensions and new connections to the system. The project
consists of:
(i) An underground cutoff wall to increase and regulate the
flow from the Figeh Spring;
(ii)  A pumping station to increase low season flows;
(iii) A 15 km tunnel to the main storage reservoirs;
(iv)  The main storage reservoir (60,000 m3);
(v) Distribution reservoirs (44,800 m3 in total);
(vi)  Pumping stations;
(vii)  Dispatching equipment for data transmission and flow control;
(viii)  Related engineering studies;
(ix)  Training of EPEF staff.
Project execution is scheduled to be completed by end-1979.
Project Management
34.       EPEF was established as an independent water authority in 1958 to
take over a communal water supply syndicate which had existed since 1924.
EPEF is autonomous in its day-to-day operations, but the Ministry of Housing
and in some cases the CabLnet of Ministers are involved in all major decisions.
The General Manager is appointed by the Government and is responsible for the
execution of managerial and administrative functions.



- 10 -
35.       EPEF's senior management is of high quality and dedication, but the
institution suffers from an acute shortage of staff. Measures were taken in
October 1974 in accordance with the terms of Credit 401-SYR to improve employ-
ment conditions for the staff of the Project unit established under the first
project and several additional engineers have been hired. However, EPEF's
current staff still needs strengthening for its ongoing operations and more
emphasis is being put on the use of consultants. USAID is now considering a
Government request to provide EPEF with technical assistance and SONEDE
(Tunisia's Water Authority) has agreed to help train EPEF's technicians.
EPEF has agreed to employ engineering consultants to provide technical assis-
tance for ongoing works (Project Agreement, Section 2.02). A technical assis-
tance and training program for intermediate technicians is to be agreed upon
and implemented (Project Agreement, Sections 2.10 and 3.06). In addition,
EPEF has commissioned with consultants a study of its organization and operat-
ing procedures as provided for under Credit 401-SYR; the study would cover,
among others, EPEF's cost accounting and cost control systems to produce
adequate data for management and the billing and collection procedures whose
length and inaccuracy cause substantial losses in revenues.
36.       Project implementation itself will be carried out under the author-
ity of a special commission created by Presidential decree, in charge of EPEF
water supply projects. The commission which is chaired by the Minister of
Housing and Utilities has full powers to take any action required for project
execution and to this end has been exempted from existing laws and regulations.
Day-to-day project management and supervision is the responsibility of EPEF's
project unit created under Credit 401-SYR. The unit has recently been substan-
tially reinforced through the hiring of consultants and additional staff so as
to enable it to control works both under Credit 401-SYR and under the proposed
project.

Cost estimates are based on actual contract prices (underground cutoff, tunnel,
and reservoir) under bids received in January 1975 and on unit prices for con-
tracts under Credit 401-SYR. All costs are expressed in January 1976 prices.
38.       Cost estimates greatly exceed those for comparable worlks tendered
under ICB but are considered realistic for Syria under present conditions. The
Bank and the Syrian authorities have discussed possible ways of reducing costs,
in particular through calling new tenders, but have agreed that t:here was no
assurance that any alternative would succeed in this while all of them would
result in delays. Faced with the urgency of supplying water to the city of
Damascus, the Government decided that contracts be awarded at tendered prices.
39.       Physical contingencies are relatively low (10 percent of base cost)
because extensive drilling and analysis have already been carried out by
consultants. Price increases totalling 23.7 percent of base costs over the
construction period have been assumed; this figure reflects the projected
trend of international prices as well as price increases for cement and fuel
recently implemented in Syria and estimated future costs of wages and local
construction materials in accordance with Government policies. Price escala-
tion clauses, covering 100 percent of price changes, are included in all
contracts already concluded.
Financing Plan
40.       External financing for the project would be provided by the Bank and
the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. The proposed Bank loan of



- 12 -
$35 million would cover 38.5 percent of the project's foreign exchange require-
ments. The Arab Fund would make a loan of $40 million, and the two external
loans together would cover about 70 percent of the project's foreign exchange
costs and 55 percent of total costs. The balance of financing required would
be provided through a Government contribution to EPEF and cash generation. The
proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government for 25 years and 5 years of
grace and be relent to EPEF on the same terms and conditions through a sub-
sidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank. The Arab Fund loan would be
made to the Government for the same term and grace period at 6 percent per an-
num and utilized as Government's contribution to EPEF's equity; signature of
the Loan Agreement between the Government and Arab Fund would be a condition
of effectiveness of the Bank loan (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(c)). It has
been agreed that the already awarded contract for the underground cutoff, the
tunnel, and supply reservoir (contract no. 1) whose cost would constitute more
than 70 percent of project costs would be financed jointly by the Arab Fund
and the Bank. It is proposed that the remainder of the Arab Fund loan would
be used for financing of the Wali pumping station, the reservoirs west, and
the Barada overflow (contract no. 2) under the regulations of the Arab Fund
for international competitive bidding and that the Bank would contribute to-
ward financing of the remaining contracts. All foreign exchange cost of the
technical services will be financed by the Bank (see paragraph 46).
Financial Situation
41.        For 1972-74, EPEF's operating ratio was about 60 percent and the re-
turn an averaged fixed assets about 10 percent. These figures reflect EPEF's
relatively low operating expenses since personnel is paid according to the
Government's low salary scale, and EPEF's low depreciation charges since it
acquired most of its present assets in the 1930's. EPEF does not have an
adequate physical inventory of its assets or a system for the integration of
newly acquired extensions or renewal into assets. Conditions of the loan
would, therefore, be that within 6 months of effectiveness EPEF complete an
inventory and within one year of effectiveness a revaluation of its assets
(Project Agreement, Section 4.03).
42.        Over the next 5 years EPEF is to embark on an ambitious program of
works of which the proposed project is only a part. Total envisaged invest-
ments have been estimated at $279 million with a foreign exchange cost of
$171.5 million. Already secured and anticipated foreign borrowings would cover
the latter, except for the equivalent of $35 million to be provided by Govern-
ment. About 12 percent of local financing requirements ($107.5 million equiva-
lent) would be provided by EPEF's internal cash generation, the remainder being
provided by the Government mostly as equity to avoid burdening EPEF with heavy
debt service payments.
43.       However, the envisioned EPEF contribution would require tariff in-
creases. Were present tariffs to remain unchanged, EPEF would be unable to
participate in the financing of this investment program and would even suffer



- 13 -
increasing cash deficits starting in 1977. The present system of water
charges in Damascus results in very low rates as compared to most developing
countries, leaving ample scope for increases. Under Credit 401-SYR, EPEF was
committed to set and maintain its tariffs at such level as shall be required
to produce an annual rate of return of 7.5 percent in 1982 and thereafter on
average net fixed assets in operation. This covenant was appropriate in view
of the then expected gradual build-up of EPEF's assets. However, because of
the abnormally high con,truction costs in Syria, it is now expected that the
rate base will increase by 1980 to 27 times the 1975 level. Therefore, to
provide a substantial contribution of EPEF to its investment program, while
avoiding an undue impacz of the rate increase on consumers, the rate of re-
turn covenant was replaced by a cash generation covenant (Project Agreement,
Section 4.04). Accordingly, the Government has agreed to take all necessary
action to enable EPEF to set its rates so as to generate not less than 10 per-
cent for 1977-80 and 35 percent thereafter of its average capital expenditure
during any consecutive three years, comprising one actual and two forecast
years; this result should be achieved after covering all operating expenses,
debt service, and working capital requirements. An increase of the average
rate from LS 0.2 to about LS 0.5 is expected shortly and on the basis of the
above requirements would be necessary early in 1977. The Government has
agreed to the principle of introducing, on the occasion of the increase, a
progressive tariff in order to lessen the financial impact on low income
groups and encourage the conservation of water.
Procurement
44.       Major civil works and equipment contracts financed by the Bank loan
would be let under international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines for procurement. However, minor equipment contracts of less
than LS 100,000 (US$27,000 equivalent) for works financed by the Bank would be
awarded on the basis of ILocal procurement procedures which are acceptable to
the Bank, up to an aggregate amount of LS 1 million (US$270,000 equivalent).
Retroactive Financing
45.       Because of the urgency of the project, works for the tunnel, the
underground cutoff, and the supply reservoir were contracted in advance. A
contract of $70.8 million plus contingencies and price escalation was signed
in December 1975 following international competitive bidding procedures ac-
ceptable to the Bank. Retroactive financing of not more than $3 miLlion is
proposed for this contract.
Disbursement
46.       The proposed Bank loan of US$35.0 million would be disbursed as
follows:
(i)  40 percent of the foreign exchange costs indicated in the
contract for civil works construction, equipment supply and
installation of the underground cutoff wall, tunnel and supply
reservoir (contract no. 1).



- 14 -
(ii) 40 percent of the foreign exchange costs indicated in the
contractors' bids for civil works construction, equipment
supply and installation of reservoirs, pumping stations and
dispatching (contracts nos. 3, 4, 5).
(iii) 100 percent of the total cost of consultants for design, super-
vision, technical assistance, and training of EPEF staff.
The estimated schedule of disbursement is shown in Annex III.
Justification
47.        The proposed project, together with related projects forming the
Damascus five year water supply investment program, is the first major expan-
sion of the city's water supply and distribution system in more than 40 years;
it is unavoidable if Damascus is to avert serious water shortages and related
health hazards as well as serious constraints in the city's expansion and in
the improvement of its inhabitants' living conditions. The major elements of
the program represent the least-cost solution, chosen from among several
alternatives.
48.       The economic benefits of the project cannot be separated from those
of the remainder of the program of works required to meet the needs of Damascus.
Using incremental water supply revenues from the investment program as a minimal
measure of economic benefits, on the basis of the charges the consumers are cur-
rently (1975) paying for water, the program has a negative internal economic re-
turn (about -2 percent). This calculation merely demonstrates the total in-
adequacy of present tariffs relative to the very high costs of EPEF's expansion.
On the basis of revenues derived from the first tariff increase (see paragraph
43 above), the internal economic return would rise to 3 percent; it has been
calculated that the return would rise to 8.5 percent on the basis of revenues
derived from subsequent tariff increases as required in keeping with the pro-
visions of the cash generation covenant. In the long run, the tariff would
thus approach the average incremental cost of water.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Etablissement Public
des Eaux de Figeh, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
50.       The draft agreements conform to the usual patterns for water supply
projects. Features of the Loan and Project Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 35, 40, 41, 43 of the Report. The signing of
the Arab Fund Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Arab Fund, and the
signing of the subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and EPEF (Loan
Agreement, Section 6.01) would be additional conditions of effectiveness.



- 15 -
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit 290 - Second Highway Project; US$13.8 Million Credit of April 17, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: February 2, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This project includes improvement and construction of 153 km of
roads linking Damascus with the Lebanese and Jordanian borders, and improve-
ment of the road Tartous-Homs. It also includes feasibility studies and
detailed engineering for bypasses for the cities of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and
Deraa and the Aleppo-Tall Kojak Road (about 470 km). Project implementation
started in 1975 after an initial delay due to the unsettled conditions in
the region. In the meantime, the Government decided to upgrade the project
roads to four-lane standards for which it has undertaken to provide additional
funds.   A consultant's study to assess the economic viability of the new
designs is expected shortly.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Pro-ject; US$15 Million Credit of June 22,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: February 24, 1974: Closing Date: December 31,
1978
This projct consisted of five main elements: (i) rehabilitation and
renewal of existing distribution system; (ii) expansion of distribution system
with 370 km of watermains; (iii) construction of a 15 km tunnel to improve the
supply of water to the city; (iv) pumping and storage facilities; and (v) stud-
ies of pollution and sewerage problems in Damascus, Homs, and Hama. Delay in
the execution of the project and high cost overruns prompted the Syrians to
split the works of this project, and on May 12, 1975 the Association agreed
that IDA credit would be used only for the urgent phase of the distribution
works (item i) and for pollution and sewerage studies (item v). It was
deemed important to move ahead quickly with the rehabilitation and renewal
of existing distribution system in order to reduce the amount of water, cur-
rently not accounted for due to leakages in the mains and malfunctioning of
the water meters. The work on the urgent phase of the distribution system
is in progress.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to correct them. They should be read in this sense and with under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 469/Loan 975 - Balikh Irrigation Projects; US$10 Million Credit and
US$63 Million Loan of April 6, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 12,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project provides for the development of irrigated agriculture
in a net area recently increased, as a result of detailed surveys, from
41,000 ha to 45,000 ha in the Balikh River Basin, including the resettlement
of farmers displaced by the filling of Lake Assad. The project includes use
of consultants' services for the preparation of a master plan for the rehabil-
itation of agriculture in the Lower Euphrates Valley, for the preparation of
a feasibility study of a rehabilitation project on the right bank of the river
in the valley, and for the preparation of detailed designs and contract docu-
ments for the said area. Bids received for a first development stage, which
would construct an 18 km main canal headreach and provide pumped irrigation
supplies for a 10,000 ha area, were much higher than expected at the time
of the appraisal in February 1974 chiefly is a result of the impact of the
October 1973 hostilities and of inflation. It was decided in August, after
improving the bid docunmentation, that new tenders for the works would be in-
vited. New bids were received on November 25 and recommendations for award
of the first two contracts at substantially lower prices than the earlier
bids have been received.. The Government will have to arrange for the mobil-
ization of substantial additional financial resources to meet the project's
likely increase in foreign exchange requirements. Total project cost is now
estimated to be US$673 million--a fourfold increase over the appraisal esti-
mate. Adequate technical solutions now seem to have been found to the prob-
lems of canal construction in gypsiferous soils which had beset works in
pilot areas, provided that supervision is sufficient to ensure the observance
of high standards of construction by contractors. The ambitious timetable
for completion of the project, coupled with Government's intention to develop
240,000 ha in the Euphrates Basin by 1980, will severely strain the limited
resources of supervisory personnel and should be carefully monitored. Pro-
curement for the next two irrigation areas is expected to be initiated soon.
Loan 986 - Mehardeh Power Project; US$25 Million Loan of May 23, 1974 and
Supplementary Loan of $B.6 Million of April 29; Date of Effectiveness:
February 28, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project consists of the first 150 kw unit of a new steam
electrical power station at Mehardeh, eight 230 kw substations, consultant
services, and training. This project is co-financed by a US$33 million loan
by the Kuwait Fund, which includes a second portion of $15 million to cover
the considerable cost overrun of this project due to the increased level of
world prices. The Bank has amended this loan on April 29, 1975 to increase
it by $8.6 million in order to finance the foreign exchange cost of the in-
crease in capacity of the first power unit from 125 mw to 150 mw. Site work
has started, but overalL progress has been slow because main contracts were
amended in October-November 1974, about 5 months late. Management consultants
were appointed in March 1975, and consultants for tariff studies were recently
engaged.

Loan 1114 - Second Mehardeh Power Project; US$72 Million Loan of June 17,

This project consists of the second 150 mw unit of the new steam
electric power station of Mehardeh; construction of 6 new and extension of
2 existing substations; new headquarters building of Damascus; engineering
consultant services and training. Progress of the project is as per sched-
