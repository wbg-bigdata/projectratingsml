COMBINED PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the combined Completion Report of the First and Second
Damascus Water Supplv Projects for which Credit 401-SYR and Loan 1241-SYR
were approved in May 1973 and April 1976 for US$15 million and US035
million respectivelv. These became effective in February 1974 and January
1977 and were closed in December 1980 and May 1983 respectively when US0.1
million and ITS3.1 million were cancelled.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
Fast and North Africa Region Office on the basis of the findings of a
project completion mission which visited Syria in April 1981, and a review
of the President's Report, the Development Credit, Loan and Project
Agreements and other reports related to project implementation.
Following normal procedures, a draft copy of the report was sent
to the Borrower, the Executing Agency (Etablissement Public des Eaux de
Damas (FIGEH) and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development for
their comments. Comments were received only from FIGEH, which is in con-
currence with the findings of the PCR, and they are reproduced in the
Appendix to the report.
The above projects have not been subjected to an audit by the
Operations Evaluation Department.

FTRS1' AND SECOND DAMASCUS WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
CREI)T 40-iSYR AND LOAN 1241-SYR
COMBINED PROJECT COMPLETrON REPORT
HIGHLTGHTS
Tri Au;eust 1971, the Svrian Government requested the Association's
assistance to finance a project whose objectives consisted of (i) augmenting
the water stipplv of Damascus through improvement to the existing groundwater
source at Figeh sonte 15 km from the city, increase of the transmission
capacity from Figeh to Damascus and improvement and extension of the
distribuition svstem; and (ii) carrying out wgater pollution control. studies for
the Barada and Orontes rivers (para. 2.02).
Develnpment Credit 40l.-'YR was approved in May 1973 for an amount of
UTS919.0 million. With the conditions which prevailed in the Middle East from
173 onwards, EPEV had difficulty recruiting qualified personnel for its
Project (Tnit and the project was very slow starting (para 2.04). This
situation was compotunded bh  the magnitude of the bids received for major
components in late 1974 and early 1975 which showed prices as much as five
times appraisal estimates. The major contributing factors (para. 2.05) were
mostlv bevond the control of  EFP  and tFe Government.
In order to overcome the staffing problems of the Project Unit and
more importantlv to address the severe cost overrun problems, the Government
rapidly created a Commission with extraordinary powers in early 1975 (para.
2.n6). A thorough review of the project composition and a reassessment of the
economic viability of the proposed underground tunnel were under nken. Thus
in May 1975, the Association agreed to the Syrian Government's    Jest to
amend the project description and to restrict the use of Credit  _,ceeds to
urRently required distribution rehabilitation work and to pollution control
studies (para 2.07).
Tn June 1975, the United States Agency for International Development
(USATD) agreed to lend to the Syrian Arab Republic US$48.0 million to help
finanee the foreign exchange component of the remainder of the distribution
works (para. 2.08). The Government then requested the Bank to help finance
the remaining components of the original project. These constituted the
elements of the Second namascus Water Supplv Project for which Loan 1241-SYR
for US035.O million was approved in June 1976. Co-financing amounting to
ITS40.0 million was provided by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (para. 2.09).



- viii -
nnce the nroject had been amended, implementation progress was good
(para. 3.01).  The distribution works incltded in the First Project was
completed in 34 months, within the titne foreseen in thr conLract (para.
3.03). Completion of the pollution control studies were delayed hecause of
staff shortage. Final draFts were submitted to the Government in December
1975, about two vears behind appraisal estimates (para. 3.04).  Construction
work on the source development, tunnel and tnrminal reservoir contract -- all
part of the Second Project -- started in Julv 1976 with retroactive financing
and was completed in April 1980 with about four months delay due to poorer
than anticipated lock conditions (para. 3.05).
The actual cost of the water supply infrastrucLure of the First and
Second Projects was slightly less than the cost reestimated during the 1976
appraisal of the Second Project, while the cost of the studies was about 44%
higher than original estimates due to slow start-tp and additions to their
scope (para. 3.06).
Disbursement of proceeds from Development Credit 401-SYR took eight
instead of five vears mainly hecause of long start-up delays and late release
ni retention monev for the pipeline contract due to a dispute on additional
services provided (para. 3.07). Disbursements of proceeds from Loan 1241-SYR
were on schedule until June 1979 when the major civil works contractor
presented a substantial claim which took two years to settle. As the Bank
Loan financed consultants' services for the entire project, final disbursement
had to await completion in mid-1983 of the components financed by the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development (para. 3.08).
ITnaccounted-for water which in 1973 amounted to over 50% of water
produced has been dramatically reduced through measures introduced during
prolect implempntation. It is now estimated at about 26% of total water
produced (pares. 4.02 and 4.03).
EF.l,'s financia. performance has been mixed.  EPEF in effect met its
financial objectives (para. 5.02) up to 1979. Thereafter, delay by Government
in ratifying tariff increases left EPEF with a tight cash position (para.
5.03). EPEF's current organization structure which dates from 1981 is
satisfactory (para. 6.03). Its 1982 staff totalled 965, or the equivalent of
5.3 per thousand connections. It was short of mid-level qualified personnel
and somewhat overstaffed at the lower levels (para. 6.04). Its accounting
system and procedures have imnproved and are mostiv computerized (para. 6.06).
The major project objectives have been met (pares. 7.01 and 7.02) and
EPEF has been strengthened. Conditions seemed rather unpromising in early
1q75. The projects illustrate particularly well that solutions can Pten be
found to apparently desperate situations.  Decisive and timely action  n the
part of the Government in 1975 was crucial in keeping the project alive. The
resolve, dedication and cooperation of the Borrower, EPEF and the Bank were
also essential in ensuring that the original project objectives would be
maintained (para. 9.02).



SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
FIRST AND SECOND DAMASCUS WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
(CREDIT 401-SYR AND LOAN 1241-SYR)
COMBINED PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
T. INTRfDTJCTInN
1.01     For centuries Damaqscus had an abundant supply of cheap and high
quality water from the FiReh Spring in the neighboring hills above the city.
In the earlv nineteen seventi.-s, about 80% of the population was served by
house connections and the remainder by public taps, but the average per capita
consumption was modest at 110 litres per day. The yield of the Figeh Spring
had fallen to alarmingl.y low levels during drought years while the capacity of
the transmission svstem had been barelv sufficient to meet the peak demand.
Another cause for concern had been rising pollution problems especially in the
Barada river basin which received the sewage from Damascus, and in the Orontes
river basin where the industrial towns of Horns and Hama are located.
1.02     During the nineteen sixties, Etablissement Public des Eaux de Figeh
(EPEP) had commissioned studies for the expansion of the Damascus water stupply
system from two French consulting firms. The first had studied the hydrology
and possible development of the Figeh spring. The second had prepared a
master plan for the expansion of the Damascus water supply distribution system
and a feasibilitv studv for distribution works.
1.03     Tn AuRust 1971, the Government requested IDA's assistance to help
finance a water supply proiect for Damascus and water pollution control
studies.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION
Preparation of First Damascus W2ter Supply Project
2.01     The project was identified in August 1971, and preparation work was
carrIed out without special difficulties during the remainder of 1971 and part
of 1Q72. Appraisal took place in November/December 1972, negotiations were
held in late April 1973 and the Board of Directors approved Development Credit
401-SYR on Mav 17, 1973.
2.02     The objectives of the project were: (i) to augment the water supply
of Damascus bv improving the groundwater source, increasing the transmission
capacity to the city and improving and extending the distribution system; and
(ii) to carry out water pollution control studies for the Barada and Orontes
rivers and sewerage studies for Damascus.
OiriRinal Project Description
2.03     The project originally consisted oft (i) the construction of an
underground cut-off wall and the installation of pumps at the Figeh Spring to
improve its yield; (ii) the construction of a 15 km tunnel from the spring to
Damascus; (iii) the construction of storage reservoirs; (iv) the installation
of 530 km of water mains in the Damascus water distribution system, including
supporting equipment, training and consultant services; and (v) pollution
control studies for Damascus, Mloms and Hama and related equipment and training.
Imolementation Start-up of First Damascus Water Supply Project
2.04     Project implementation was very slow starting.  This stemmed mainly
from the conditions which prevailed in the Middle East from 1973 onwards and
from the difficulty for the Project Unit (PU) -- which had been created within
EPEF to supervise project implementation -- to recruit qualified staff.  The
situation was compounded by the result of the bids received in late 1974 and
earlv l975 for the major water source, conveyance works and distribution works
which showed prices as much as five times those of the appraisal estimates.
2.09     The major factors having contributed to these cost increases were:
(a) a delay of about two years in the start of project construction in
the period of rapidly rising inflation I, which followed the 1973
increase in oil prices;
1/ According to the World Bank November 12, 1980 issue of International Index
- Commoditv Price Forecasts Updating, the prices of foreign manufactured
goods increased by 19.3% and 24.0% respectivelv during 1973 and 1974,
while according to the Syrian Central Bureau of Statistics the Wholesale
Price Index showed increases of 32.5% and 14.0% respectively for the same
vears.



-3-
(h)  a sharp increase in construction activity in the Middle East between
1q7'3 and lq76 resulting in keen competition for foreign as well as
domestic goods and services, with attendant pressure on construction
Drices;
(c)  dppp concern for renpwed hostilities in the Middle East in the
aftermath of the 1973 war; and
(d)  underpstimation in the 1973 cost figures due to insufficient cost
data pertaining to actual working conditions, and the fact that
estimates were based on preliminarv designs.
Amendment to the First Damascus Water Supplv Project
?2.,     Tn order to address PIT's staffing difficulties and to expedite action
to resolve cost overrun pro'olems, a five-member Commission was created by
Presidential Decree on Januarv 5, 1.975. The Commission's extraordinary powers
enabled it as need-ed to cause the hiring of expatriates, the detachment of
Qualified personnel From other Government Departments, and the establishment
of sufficient incentives for PI) to attract and retain staff. It also enabled
the Commiss;   to react rapidlv to implementation problems, the most severe
being thr inabilitv of the flovernment to carrv out the project with the then
avai'sh½e financing.
2.07     The cost overruns vrompted a thorough review of the composition of
the proiect. Additional studies were requested bv the Association to
determine whether an underground tunnel remained the least cost means of
supplv.  At the same time, EPFF was compelled to revise its financing plan for
the proiect.  Thus on Mav 17, 1975, at the request of the Syrian Government,
TnA agreed to a revision of the oriRinal project description and to
restricting the use of nevelopment Credit proceeds to urgently required
distribution rehabi'litation work and to pollution control studies.
?.OR     Tn June 1975, the llnited States ARencv for International Development
(TTSATDT) agreed to lend Svria TTSt48.0 million to help finance the foreign
exchange component of the remainder of the distribution works. At about the
same time, the additional studies requested bv IDA (para. 2.07) confirmed that
an underRround tunnel was st-1l the least cost solution for supply.
PreDaration of Second Damascus Water Supplv Project
?.09     The Major components of the Second Damascus Water Supply Project had
thus been Drepared and bids received when the Government requested further
assistance from the Bank.  The second project. which covered the remaining
comDonents of the origiial project, was appraised in August/September 1975,
and Loan 1241-SYR for uS$35.0 million was approved in June 1976.  Co-financing
amounting to T71S40.0 million was provided bv the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social flevelopment (APESD). The two Bank Group and the USAID projects would
enstire that the original proiect obiectives (para. 2.02) would be achieved.



-4-
Revised Project Description
2.10     The revised projects to be carried out with the Bank Group assistance
consisted of:
(a) The First Damascus Water Supply Project;
(i) installing 130 kilometers of pipeline in the old town of
Damascus as an turgent measure to improve the undersized and
hadlv leaking distribution svstem; and
(ii) conducting pollution control studies for the Barada and Orontes
rivers and preparing master plans and preliminary design for
seweraze and sewaRe treatment facilities in Damascus and along
the nrontes river, and detailed engineering design and bid
documents for the proposed svstems in the cities of Homs and
Hama; and
(b)  The Second Damascus Water Supply Project;
(i) im roving facilities at Figeh Spring to augment yield from
3m 'second to about 5m3/second;
(ii) constructing a pumping station at Figeh Spring to increase low
season flows;
(Qii) constructinz a 15 kilometer long tunnel from Figeh to Damascus
with a flow capacity of 5m3/second;
(iv) constructing a 60,000 m3 underground storage reservoir at the
receiving end of the tunnel;
(v)  constructing distribution system reservoirs with a combined
capacity of about 44,800 n3';
(vi) constructing a new pumping station and renovating existing
pumping stations;
(vii) installing a telecommunications system for data transmission,
water flow control and leak detection; and
(viii) instituting a training program.
Special Conditions
2.11     The following special conditions were specified in the legal
agreements:
(a)  the Government would establish a Special Unit (SU) to direct and
coordinate the water control pollution and sewerage studies
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.02). This was done;



-5-
(b)  FPEF would establish a Project Unit (PU) to administer the
implementation of the water supply component of the project (Project
Agreement, Section 2.02). This was done;
(c)  the Government and EPEF would employ consultants satisfactory to the
Bank for carrying out the project (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.03 and Project Agreement, Section 2,03). Consultants were
emploved;
(d)  EPEF would undertake a program to reduce the quantity of
unaccounted-for water (Project Agreement, Section 2.10). Such a
program was successfullv carried out (para. 4.02);
(e) EPEF would studv its organization, operating procedures and
accouinting Svstems (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). This study was
carried out and its recommendations implemented (paras. 6.02 and
6.06);
(f)  EPEF would have its accounts audited and submitted to the Bank within
four months after the end of its fiscal year (Project Agreement,
Section 4.02). This has been done;
(g) EPEF would record all extensions and renewals in its fixed assets and
would inventorv and establish the value of its physical assets.
(Project Agreement, Section 4.03). This was done (para. 6.06); and
(h) EPEF would operate within the bounds of the two financial covenants
described in para. 5.02 of this report (Project Agreement, Sections
4.04 and 4.05). EPEF's financial performance was mixed (para. 5.03).



TII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-llp
3.01     The first proiect was slow starting (para. 2.04).  However, once the
oroiect had been amended (para. 2.07) progress was good. Effectiveness of
Loan 1241-SYR was delaved about five months while the Loan Agreement between
the Government and AFESI) which co-financed the second project was being
ratified. Retroactive financing had been provided in the Bank Loan and
implementation was therefore not held up.
Procurement
3.02     Contracts financed under the Development Credit and the Loan were
procured through international competitive bidding, according to World Bank
procurement guidelines. All contracts were awarded to foreign firms.
Implementation of FPirst Damascus Water Supply Project
1 (I     The contractor for the distribution pipeline started work in August
1975.  The actual length of pipe laid was 160 km instead of 130 km as
originallv estimated and about 15% more water consumption meters were
installed.  The work was completed in 34 months, within the time allowed for
in the contract.
3.n4     Shortage of staff in the Special UJnit set up to supervise the
nolliution control studies, caused severe delays in their implementation. Work
on the studies actuallv started onlv in January 1977. To remedy the situation
an Advisor Co5mmittee composed of representatives from various ministries
interested in pollution control was set up in mid 1977 to review and
coordinate the progress of the studies. A panel of international experts was
also invited with the Association's help at Government request to advise the
Committee on the consultant's work. Final drafts of the study (35 volumes)
were submitted to the Government in December 1978, about two years behind
appraisal estimate. The reports were approved and printing authorized in
necember 1980 and the final payment to the consultant was made in June 1981.
Implementation of Second Damascus Water Supply Project
3.05     Construction work on the source development, tunnel and terminal
reservoirs contract started in Julv 1976, with retroactive financing. The
entire work was completed in April 1980 only about four months behind original
contract schedule despite the fact that rock conditions were much poorer t.an
anticipated. Because of the horing machine used bv the contractor, the tunnel
was about 407% larger in carrving capacity than foreseen in the original
design. The configuration and location of the terminal reservoirs were also
changed to facilitate cuttinR and to provide easier egress of excavated
material. The tunnel was put into operation in July 1980. Work to augment
spring flows at Figeh was also completed satisfactorily. Additional pumping



-7-
equipment has heen installed to carrv out tests to determine the optimum yield
of the improved sources. The qualitv of workmanship of the contractor was
good throughouit.
Costs and Disbursements
3.06     The actual cost of the urgently required distribution works amounted
to LS 93.Q million, or R.7% less than the LS 102.8 million cost reestimated
durine the IP76 appraisal of the Second Damascus Water Supply Project.
Likewise, the actual cost of the source and transmission works totalled LS
493.9 million, or 2.97 less than the 1976 appraisal estimates of LS 506.4
million.  The actual cost of the studies amounted to LS 5.R million, or 44.2%
higher than the 1973 appraisal.  This increase stemmed from execution delays
associated with the slow start up, the factors described in paras. 2.04 and
2.05, and from additional work requested by SU. This overrun was financed by
the C,overnment.
3.n7     Dishursements of proceeds from Development Credit 401-SYR took eight
instead of five vears, although over 75% was disbursed at the end of five
vears. The major reasons include the start-up delays and related project
amendment (paras 2.04 and 2.07), and the late release of the retention money
for the pipeline contract due to a dispute concerning additional services.
3.08     Dishursements of proceeds from Loan 1241-SYR were on schedule until
about June lq79, when the maior civil works such as the tunnel and the
underground reservoirs were nearlv completed. This was the time when the
maior contractor presented a substantial claim to cover additional costs
resulting from design changes and working conditions. It took about two years
to settle the dispute satisfactorilv. The Bank Loan also financed the
consultants' services for the reservoirs financed bv AFESD.  Construction of
these reservoirs proRressed more slowly than the components financed by the
Bank, and were only completed in mid-Iq83.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.0     EPEF's consultants did a satisfactory job on the design of work in
the two major contracts. They also provided valuable assistance to EPEF in
the implementation and supervision of the Project.  The difficulties which
arose as a result of cost underestimating cannot be imputed to the
consultants, as the major causes of price increases were beyond normal
expectation at the time. EPEF's staff has benefitted from its association
with experienced consultants.
3.10     Considering the very difficult working conditions inside the old
district of Damascus, the successful completion of the work for the Urgent
Phase of the distribution pipeline without serious problems and within the
contract schedule is commendable.  EPEF maintained an excellent working
relationship with the contractor.
3.11     The tunnel contractor had good experience in his field and the work
force and construction equipment emploved were adequate and efficient.



nualitv of the workmanship was excellent and despite difficult rock
conditions, work completion was only delayed by about four months. A
substantial claim raised bv the contractor was settled to mutual satisfaction
(para. 3.0P).
3.12     The staff of the Special Unit consider the quality of the work
performed by the consultant for the pollution control studies to be
sat is factorv.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
WaLer Consumption and State of Water Supply
4.01     Water consumption i' Damascus (Annex 1, Page 1) has increased faster
than anticipated in the first appraisal report (1973), and the estimates were
revised during the second appraisal (1975). Despite delays in completing the
new system, water supplv conditions in Damascus did not deteriorate too
badly. This was made possible by a general improvement in the distribution
svstem, several successive venrs of good yield at the Figeh Spring, and
additional water from about one hundred wells which the municipality and EPEF
have constructed. With the completion in 1980 of the source improvement works
at Figeh and the construction of the new Figeh-Damascus tunnel and reservoirs
under the Second Proje t the threat of water supply shortages within the city
itself has been remove. for a number of years, and except in a few areas where
the distribution svstem still requires strengthening, Damascus enjoys
uninterrupted water supplv. The present sources will enable the water demand
of Damascus to be me't up to 1985. Additional development to utilize the
Barada river flow at Figeh is already in EPEF's development plans.  This
should increase the capacitv of the svstem to about 7m  per sec., which
would be sufficient to meet the demand up to about 1991 (Annex 6).
Unaccounted-for Water
4.02     In 1973, unaccounted-for water was over 50% of water produced.
During Project execution, EPEF launched a major effort to reduce
unaccounted-for water. Increased effort was made to detect leaks,
particularlv in the older parts of the city. Leakage was also reduced when
manv old mains wece replaced under the urgent phase of distribution system
improvements. From 1975 to date over 88,000 defective meters and 22,000
defective connections were replaced. Meters were also installed at all public
hydrants and administration buildings. Purthermore, in 1981, electronic leak
detection equipment was purchased and a systematic leak detection program was
set up.
4.03     EPEF's unaccounted-for water -- before taking into account the volune
of water consumed through illegal connections -- currently stands at 34%
(Annex 1, page 1. Since 1980 the rapid growth of palestinian refugees and
the presence of military personnel with their families in the suburbs of
Damascus caused the Government to build 26 new wells in the vicinity of the
city limits to serve this additional population. Nevertheless, water remained
in short supplv in these areas and some of the inhabitants have connected
illicitlv to EPEF's distribution system. Their annual water consumption is
currentlv estimated at 10.8 million cubic meter or about 8% of EPEF's water
production, so that unaccounted-for water is really only about 26% of total
production. In order to address this problem the Government has given to EPEF
the responsibilitv for supplying these outlying areas, and EPEF is preparing a
program to extend its distribution system to those parts and to make house
connections.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
S.fl     EPEF's appraisal forecast and actual income statements, sources and
applications of funds statements and balance sheets for the period 1973-82
appear in Annex l. In view of the amnendment of the First Damascus Water
Supplv Project in May 1975 (para. 2.07) and of the updating of EPEF's
financial projections during the appraisal of the Second Damascus Water Supply
Project in August/September 1975 (para. 2.09), the appraisal forecast of the
first project has been shown for 1973 and 1974 and that of the second project
for 1975 through 1982.  However, as the implementation of both projects was
carried out virttuallv entirely in the years 1975-1982 (paras. 303 to 305), the
review which follows covers only this period.
RPEF's Financill Objectives
5.n2     EPEF's financial objectives were mainly embodied in two financial
covenants: (i) EPEF was to set its water charges so that its net revenues
would finance at least 10% of its investments during 1977-80, and not less
than 35% in years thereafter (Proiect Agreement, Section 4.04); and (ii) EPEF
was not to incur debt, other than for carrying out the projects, unless its
net operatinR revenues covered its maximum future debt service at least 1.5
times (Proiect ARreement, Section 4.05).
5.03     The above objectives were met until 1979.  Indeed in the period
197i-79 (Annex 1, page 4), EPEF contributed about 13.8% (appraisal 9.4%) of
its investment financing requirements from internally generated funds and was
able to borrow normally under existing agreements. However, in the 1980-82
period, the covenanted 35% contribution was not met. Instead there was an
apparent cash generation shortfall equivalent to about 2.7% of investments.
The question of EPEF's financial performance has been intimately linked to the
magnitude of its debt service which in turn depends on the relative shares of
borrowings and equity contributions in the total financing package. The
Government can thus at its discretion greatly influence the financial ratios
bv which EPEP's performance is judged. This is basically what happened when
the Government decided contrary to what had been foreseen at appraisal, to
make a total of LS 117.7 million of its contributions by way of loans instead
of equitv. In the event, EPEF has not been servicing this debt and has been
seeking clarification from the Government on how it should be treated.
Concurrently, together with the Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities, EPEF
is in the process of formulating a long-term financial policy. EPEF's
Pronosal aims at avoiding a recurrence of the recent situation. Details of
EPEF's financial performance in the period 1980-82 are presented below.
Revenues
5.n4     In the period 1980-82, gross revenues amounted to LS 130.4 million,
or slightlv less than 60% of the level forecast at appraisal (Annex 1, Page
2). This stemmed from the fact that new connections and water rights were



- 11 -
onlv ahonit 90W/ of appraisal estimates and that average revenue3 per m3 of
*      water hilled were on.v about 70n  of appraisal projections.
s.0n)    The connection rate was mainly affected by unexpected difficulties in
implementing th- general phase for distribution works financed by USAID (para.
9.8). Arrangements with UJSATTl to recruit two advisors to coordinate project
imnlementation and te select an acceptable contractor for pipe laying took
about two and ore-half years. Tn the period 1975-82 only about 221 thousand
people were connected (appraisal, 460 thousand), the remainder of about 239
thouisand beinR served through standpipes (Annex 2).
9.06     The lower than forecast average revenues per m3 of water hilled
restilted from delays on the part of the Government to approve increases in the
water charges. Proposals of EPEF and the Ministry of Housing and Public
Titilities for an immediate doubling, followed by gradual increases, of water
charges have been in abeyance since 1980.
nperating Expenses
5.07     In the period 1980-82, operating expenses other than depreciation
amounted to LS 58.8 million, or about 81% of appraisal estimates (Annex 1,
PaRe 2). however, because unbilled water (i.e., the sum of free metered water
at mosques and public taps and unaccounted-for water) was about 43% of water
produced (appraisal, 28%), average expenses other than depreciation per m3
of water billed was only 1.1% lower than appraisal.
Net OperatinR Reventues and Contribution to Investments
C,.Oq    TIn the period 1980-1982, EPEF's net operating ravenues before
depreciation combined with consumers' contributions amounted to LS 73.3
million (appraisal LS 158.9 million) and would have been insufficient to cover
the debt service which totalled LS 80.8 million (appraisal LS 48.2 million),
had EPEF been obliged to service existing Government loans (para. 5.03)
Financing Plan
5).(c)    ,PFF's financinR plan for 1980-82 (Annex 1, page 4) may be summarized
as follows (in LS millions):
Appraisal            Actual
Requirements:                      Amount    %          Amount    %
Investments and WorkinR Capital   263.0    84           347.2     81
Debt Service                         48.2    16          80.8      19
311.2   100        428.0    100
Financed by:
Internallv Cenerated Funds          158.9    51          73.3     17
Government Contributions            134.2    43         219.5      51
Borrowings                           18.1      6        135.2     32
311.2   100        428.0    100



- 12 -
5.10     From the above it can he seen that while financing requirements
increased a heftv 37.5% From LS 311.2 million to LS 428.0 million, internally
generated funds dropped bv 53.9% from T.S 158.9 million to LS 73.3 million
which resulted in substantially higher than anticipated borrowings and
Government contrihutions.  About 44.7% of the borrowings were from thie Bank
Group (20.1%), USAID (7.8%) and AFESD (1.6.8%), and the remainder from the
Government. All major horrowings having either originated before Loan
1241-SYR or heen made in conjunction with the projects, no exceptions have had
to he invoked tinder the debt service coverage covenant (pari, .i.02).
Water Charges
5.11     Tn May 1477, the first tariff increase since 1940 was approved.  The
flat rate of LS. 0.20 per m3 was raised tf  LS 0.50 per O3.  However, in
light of massive public opposition, the increase was suspended for further
studv. In September, 1977, the existing two-step tariff for domestic
consumption was introduced. It consisted of a first 15 m3 per month at LS
0.20 per m3 with additional consumption at LS 0.50 per O3. At the same
time, Government and industries were charged LS 0.75 per m3 and the value of
the water rights was doubled, i.e., from LS 2,000 to LS 4,000 for the right to
consume up to one m3 per day in perpetuity.  These new tariffs coupled with
annual fees tacked on to water rights and other fees tor new services have
enabled EPEF to meet its financial objectives through 1979 (para. 5.03).  In
March 198O, the Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities supported EPEF's
proposal for substantial tariff increases.  However, the Prime Minister's
office held up the final approval of EPEF's proposal until a national water
tariff review is completed by the Government. EPEF's cash shortfall has in
the meantime been financed by the Government (para. 5.03).
Financial Position
5.12     EPFF's financial position was uneven during the period 1975-82 (Annex
1, page 5). EPEF started out with no debt and ended up with a reasonable
debt/equity ratio of 43:57 as compared with an appraisal forecast of from 5:95
to less than 20:80, which appears abnormally low for this t,pe of
undertaking. Its current ratio oscillated between a high of 4.8 and a low of
1.3 (appraisal, 5.2 and 1.3). Receivables have been too high, arrears
representing 3.2 months of billing after taking into account a backlog of
roughly nine months in bills distribution. Corrective actions taken by EPEF
include the reorganization of its customers files in 1.981 and the creation of
17 collection centers throughout Damascus during 1982. It is estimated it
will take about one year to clear up the backlog of bills to be distributed
for paynent. Inventories are excessive at the equivalent of 5.5% of net fixed
assets Ln operation. A large part is considered obsolete. EPEF has
computerized its inventories in mid-1982 and has created a committee to
implement consultants' proposals for an inventory management system and to
dispose of obsolete material.

VT. TNSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization nnd Management
6.CE.    EPFF was created as n. stnte enterprise bv Ministerial Decree in 1958
to replace the previous communal syndicate.  The General Manager was a member
of the Board of Directors.  Four Department Managers, namely. Financial,
Administrative, Statistics and Planning, and Technical reported to him. The
top management group was dedicated but its effectiveness was impaired by
extcessive paperwork.  Under Development Credit 401-SYR EPEF agreed to
commissioni a study of its organization and operating procedures and to
implement mutually agreed recommendations.
6.02      In March 1977, the consultants recommended an organization structure
in which the four previous Departments no longer reported directly to the
General Manager hut to two Deputy General. Managers, one for technical matters
and one for administration and finance. Furthermore, the consultants
recommendied the creation of three new Divisions (Data Processing, Internal
Audit, and Planning and Economic Studies) reporting directly to the General
Manager. A shortage of candidates and insufficient incentives resulted in
some of these positions not being filled. This impaired the implementation of
these recommendations.
6.03     In early 1980, a Presidential Decree prohibited the use of more than
one Deputy Director General in public enterprises and as a result, in March
1980, EPEF commissioned the University of Damascus to review the consultant's
studv and come up with a detailed implementation program with staff
reauirements and job descriptions. The organization which ensued in 1981 is
still in place (Annex 3). It is superior to any of the previous ones in that
each of the important functions, namely: Planning, Studies and New Works,
Operations, Customer Service, Finance and Accounting, and Administrative,
Legal and Personnel report directly to the General Manager. The number is
neither too large nor too small, and the number of reporting levels has been
kept to a minimum.
Staffing
6.04     EPEF's number of employees grew at an average of about 5% per year in
the period 1975 and 1982 while the number of connections increased by only
about 2.8t per year. By 1982, EPEF's staff totalled 965, which was equivalent
to 5.3 employees per thousand connections.  Of this total about 14% were
engineers and qualified technicians, 13% had secondary education, and the
remaining 73% had received primary or lower education. There was a shortagte
of qualified operating staff at the mid-level while some overstaffing existed
at the lower levels.

Tr ining
6.0';    From the inception of the project, EPEF recognized the importance of
trnining its personnel in waterworiks operations. This is reflected in the
efforts it has been putting into its in-house training activities which
include two to four week familiarization courses for newly recruited staff and
A training program for mechanics.  The skills of the technical personnel at
the intermediate level were also substantially increased through on-the-job
training bv the contractor's expatriate staff during project implementation.
Some staff also wont abroad for training. Three engineers were sent to France
for various courses, two engineers went to Holland for six-month courses, and
the chief accotintant went to the IISA for one year to study cost accounting and
computer proRramming. Finally, the Division Chief for operations visited the
water stipplv companv of the citv of Marseilles to learn about its operations.
Accounting and Auditing
E.06     EPEFP's accounting system and procedures and more generall, its
internal control have improved substantially since appraisal. A Cost
Accounting Division and an Internal Audit Section were set up in March 1980,
and the computerization of the accounting work was completed by the end of
148l. Extensions or renewals of distribution mains which hitherto had not
been recorded, have been inventoried. Existing fixed assets records had also
been computerized by the end of June 1982. However, additional work is still
needed to update these records. EPEF's Accounting Department is still short
of personnel at the mid-level of the skills spectrum. Progress in staffing
the required positions has been slow.
6.n7     EPEF has employed the same local firm of external auditors since
q175.  Both the quality of their work and the time spent on the audit have
been acceptable.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Proiect Achievements
7.01.    The first objective of the Projects of increasing the productivity of
the Figeh Spring and of conveying the additional water to Damascus was
accomplished. In the 1975-82 period the quantity of water produced was about
3% higher than forecast et appraisal (Annex 1, page 2). However, the
population was about 14.5% higher than anticipated (Annex 2), while only about
60% of the total. population was served through house connections (appraisal
80%), and the average effective consumption per capita was about 147 lcd l/
(appraisal 164 lcd).
7.02     ThŽ second objective of the Projects of carrying out pollution
control studies has also been accomplished. The studies for the Crontes river
basin led to the preparation of a sewerage project for the cities of Homs and
Hama.  The project was shelved, however, after it had been appraised in 1978,
because of the insufficient commitment of the Government to the cost recovery
and institutional aspects of the project. For similar reasons, the
preparation of detailed engineering designs for a Damascus Sewerage Project
(Barada river basin) has been held up. It is believed these issues can be
resol,ed and the Bank is maintaining its sector dialogue with the Government
in the hope a mutually acceptable solution will be found.
Least Cost Solution
7.03     The proiects constitute the least cost solution for achieving the
obiectives contemplated.
Reevaluation of Projeqt,Costs and Benefits
7.04     The reevaluation of the costs and benefits of the projects has been
done using the methodology employed at appraisal. The costs necessary to
obtain full benefits include pro5ect expenditures, the investments related to
the distribution system, and the cot- of other future investments needed to
fully utilize the system constructed by the project.  The benefits consist of
the incremental wnter sales deriving from the projects (Annex 4).  On this
basis the rate of return is 5. If, however, credit is taken for the quantity
of water delivered free at mosques and public taps or as explained in
oaragraph 4.03 for the substantial quantity consumed illicitly until regular
connections are provided, th- rate of return is 6.
7.05     Annex 5 shows the average incremental cost of water computed at
various discount rates compared with the appraisal estimates of the Second
Damascus Water Supplv Project of 1975. A reasonable agreement can be observed
between the two estimates.

VITI. ASSOCIATION AND BANK PERFORMANCE,
R.O1     The Association and the Bank responded rapidly to the needs of the
Borrower and provided valuable assistance particularly in the early stages of
project implementation when the need arose to reshape the project and to
provide additional financing along with other lenders to ensure the original
project objectives would be met.
S.02     Supervision missions averaged about two a year.  This appears to have
been adequate. The working relationship of the Association and the Bank with
the Covernment and RPEF were excellent throughout the preparation and
implementation of the projects.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
9.01     The major proiect objectives which consisted in augmenting the water
supply of Damascus and in carrying out water pollution control studies (para.
2.02) have been met, albeit at substantially higher cost than originally
envisaged (para. 2.04). However, the bulk of the cost increases between the
1973 original and the 1975 revised estimates was beyond the control of EPEF
and the Government (para. 2.05). Institutionally, EPEF has been strengthened
as a result of the projects (paras. 6.03, 6.05 and 6.06), although its
financial performance has seriously deteriorated since 1980 due to the Prime
Minister's office delay in ratifying new tariffs (paras. 5.03 and 5.11).
Lessons Learned
Q.02     The situation looked pretty grim and the odds that the original
project would be carried out appeared very low in early 1975 when bids as much
as five times appraisal estimates were received (para. 2.04). The projects
illustrate particularly well that solutions can be found to apparently
desperate situations by cooperative efforts. 'The resolve, dedication and
cooperation of the Borrower, EPEF and the Bank were essential in ensuring that
the original proiect objectives would be maintained. In this respect also,
the appointment bv the Government of a Commission with extraordinary powers
(para. 2.06) was crucial and decisive in keeping the project alive.
9.03     Finally, the project confirms the importance of the practice now
generally used to appraise only on the basis of advanced engineering studies
(para. 2.05 (d)).
