B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)

The CAS aims to reduce infrastructure bottlenecks, while focusing investment in inland areas. Urumqi is
the capital city of the inland Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The project addresses rapid
-2 -



urban development challenges by promoting a cost-effective and environmentally balanced framework for
urban transport development. The project will add needed urban transport infrastructure, promote safer
and more efficient use of existing road capacity via area traffic management and improved public transport,
and ameliorate the environment through vehicle emissions control and landscaping programs. In addition,
the project will strengthen the capacity of local institutions to better manage the sector.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Issues
The main issues facing China's urban transport sector stem from the pace of urbanization (from 30.2% of
the population in 1995 to 49.1% by 2020)/I, combined with the anticipated motorization rate as
summarized below (from an average of 10 cars per 1000 residents in 1995 to 120-130 per 1000 in 2020)/2.
Increasing urban traffic congestion. Urban traffic congestion is jeopardizing the productivity of large
cities in China, through increased travel times, higher vehicle operating costs, and a high rate of road
accidents.
Inadequate facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. The bicycle is the traditional mode of transport in
many medium-sized cities in China. Its role is increasingly threatened by rapid motorization. Current
designs for pedestrian facilities favor underpasses, overbridges and other formns of physically separate
facilities that overlook the convenience of pedestrians.
Poor management and maintenance of urban roads. Traffic management experience is limited in most
cities. Measures that would improve traffic flow, reduce conflicts between road users, protect pedestrians
and cyclists and give needed priority to buses are generally lacking. Responsibility for various aspects of
traffic management remains fragmented among various institutions.
Increasing numbers and severity of road accidents. Due to poor driver behavior and poor road sense of
pedestrians, traffic accidents are increasing. More objective assessment of the causes of accidents is
hampered by lack of adequate data collection and analysis techniques.
Inadequate supply of roadspace. The road network density in China's cities is typically lower than that
found in cities with comparable population densities elsewhere. As intemational experience attests, in the
absence of a balanced transport policy the supply of new capacity quickly succumbs to motorization.
Simply increasing road capacity will not solve the problem; measures to enhance the efficient use of road
space and to manage motorized travel demand are also needed.
Inadequate public transport services. Public transport, a potentially more efficient mode in terms of
passenger carrying capacity, is hindered by slow operating speeds, outdated operating practices, old
vehicles, and inefficient management. Service provision by private operators is constrained by inadequate
regulatory arrangements, un-economic fare levels, and unclear subsidy policies.
Increasing air pollution. Vehicle emissions are posing serious health threats to the urban population,
although lead-free fuel is being introduced nationally to reduce the impacts.

Institutional weaknesses. In most Chinese cities there are multiple agencies responsible for urban
transport policy, planning, regulation, and operations. Coordination between these agencies remains
inadequate. There is generally no single agency for the formulation and implementation of urban transport
policy, programs and budgets.
Government Strategy
In late 1995, broad policies and actions for the urban transport sector were identified at a national
symposium (sponsored by the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank/3), (see Annex 1). The project builds on these, in
conjunction with the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for China and local development plans.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Sector issues to be addressed by the project
Urbanization. Urumqi Municipality is the political, economic and cultural hub of the XUAR. With a total
population of 1.89 million residents (of whom 1.59 million are registered permanent and 0.3 million are
"floating" or non-resident population), the formal population of the Urumqi Municipality accounts for 8.8%
of the population of XUAR, but contributes 21% to its Gross Regional Product. Minority populations
account for 27.3% of the Urumqi Municipality, with 12.7% Uygur, 9.5% Hui, 3.2% Kazak, and the
remainder being Man, Mongol, Xibe, Russ and Uzbek.
Projections of economic and population growth for Urumqi over the next 20 years have been made by
Urumqi Municipal Government (UMG) planners as a step in the updating of the 1985 Master Plan for the
municipality. These suggest that by 2020, Urumnqi is expected to have a population of 2.27 million. These
projections were reviewed during project preparation, and provide a reasonable basis for forecasting travel
demand. Annex 4 presents basic planning data for the project, including data for the study area, an area
smaller than the entire municipality defined for the purposes of travel demand forecasting.
Motorization. Urumqi has seen rapid increases in motor vehicle ownership and use during recent years.
By 1997, the motor vehicle fleet totaled 79,100 vehicles, (52 vehicles per 1000 population) of which 54%
were trucks and 46% were passenger vehicles (including taxis and minibuses). Based on UMG projections
of economic and population growth, the motor vehicle fleet is projected to increase to 300,000 vehicles in
2020 (132 vehicles per 1000 population). While it is not feasible to reduce the level of motorization, it is
possible to reduce the use of cars, by making altematives, principally walking and public transport, more
attractive. This is the objective of several components of the project.
Travel Demand. Travel demand by all modes is projected to increase by 55% from 1999 to 2020. Most
(85%) of the projected increase results from the projected increase in population. The

remainder results from an increase in the number of trips per person, with the expected increase in incomes.
General projections of travel demand are presented below with estimates of mode share. Additional
planning background is presented in Annex 4.

Average trips/nerson/day  2.74       2.97

Total                   100.0%     100.0%
Average motorized trip length  10.9 km.    12.3 km.
Much of the increase in travel demand will be between the existing Central Business District (CBD) area in
the south east of the city and new mixed use development areas in the north west. The project includes
several components to cater for this projected increase in travel demand in an integrated and sustainable
manner. Together, the road network, traffic management and public transport components are designed to
provide the capacity needed to meet future travel demand. In particular, the public transport component is
designed to enable buses to at least retain their present market share of travel demand.
Facilities for Pedestrians and Cyclists. Weather conditions (harsh winters and hot summers) and
geography (hilly terrain) do not favor bicycle use in Urumqi. As a result, travel demand for cycle use in
Ururnqi is lower-than-average for a Chinese city. Bicycle travel is concentrated in short-distance work
trips in outlying industrial areas. Within the city center, bicycle traffic volumes are low (2%-5% of trips),
resulting in excess capacity on city center non-motorized transport (NMT) facilities. With declining mode
share, daily trips by bicycle will increase by only 10% in the future. However, walk trips will continue to
make up a large share of the total travel demand, increasing by 20%. The project's NMT program
therefore focuses on improvements to pedestrian facilities.
Urban Traffic Congestion. While traffic conditions are not yet severe in Urumqi, there is evidence of
emerging congestion in the CBD and along north-south routes, particularly at junctions. Data collected
from moving car surveys in October 1997 recorded a network peak hour average journey speed of 21.7
km/h. Delays account for approximately 35% of total journey times, and are attributed primarily to
waiting time at traffic signals. While Urumqi clearly does not yet experience sustained congested
conditions, traffic flow is nearing capacity with instability at key locations. Without increases in road
capacity, the forecast increases in car and taxi travel demand would result in severe increases in congestion
along key north-south corridors. The ring road component of the project will attract a high proportion of
trips from the CBD area. As a result, speeds within the area of the Ring Road are forecast to increase to
about 28 km/h.
Traffic Management. Existing traffic management concentrates on physically segregating pedestrians and
vehicles by barriers and grade-separation, vehicle bans and a limited number of uncoordinated traffic
signals. Road user behavior and the road sense of drivers and pedestrians is poor, despite road user
education campaigns. The result is an inefficient use of roadspace. The project provides complementary
packages of measures to increase network productivity, including traffic signals and Area Traffic Control
- 5 -



(ATC), junction channelization, bus priority, and institutional strengthening.
Road Safety. The incidence and severity of accidents in Urumqi appears uncommonly high compared with
other cities of similar population and motorization within China. In 1997 there were 222 fatalities per
million population. A more objective assessment of numbers of road accidents and design of targeted
remedial measures will be possible with the computer based data collection and analysis techniques
proposed in the project.
Road Maintenance. The extremes of hot dry summers and cold snowy winters pose specific problems for
road maintenance units. Between November and March no periodic maintenance can be carried out, only
snow clearing. Maintenance work programs are labor intensive and based on engineering judgment as there
is no maintenance management system or equipment to measure road condition. Since there is no local
program budgeting system, there is no mechanism to provide for maintenance expenses on a long-term
basis. The project supports local goals to modemize maintenance methods and planning systems and will
provide technical assistance to review sector organization and finance.
Road Network. Urumqi's road network is essentially a NW-SE linear grid, with a limited access
expressway forming a central spine. It is constrained in the south by an 800 meter gap between two hills. It
is deficient in providing capacity for N-S cross town movements, and protecting the established CBD from
congestion. Without additional major investment in new capacity (to be provided by the project), the city's
attractiveness to commercial development will be reduced. This in tum will be detrimental to the city's
economic growth and its ability to increase the living standards of its population.
Public Transport. If public transport is to retain or increase its share of demand, the financial constraints
on the main supplier (Urumqi Public Transport Company (UPTC) with 1,831 buses) need to be reduced
and operational strategies need to be clarified and more forcefully implemented. UPTC's main
shortcomings of overcrowding, poor geographic coverage of routes and low quality of service to users
result from a severe financial constraint. These derive from the combination of a low-priced fare structure
mandated by the XUAR, a capped-level of subsidy provided by UMG, and an inability (due to national
regulations) to shed surplus labor. Its ability to implement other operating efficiencies are hampered by a
lack of computer based tools and information systems. If these constraints were lifted, UPTC would be
better placed to acquire new buses, provide extra capacity, and improve and expand services, while at the
samne time reducing its operating costs and approaching financial viability. An attempt to overcome the
consequences to users of its deficiencies came from permitting the operation of competing, mostly private,
minibuses. These have higher fares and lower costs and their operations are commercially viable. But the
lack of a clear policy framework for the role of minibuses now results in large numbers of them operating
on UPTC's most profitable routes, giving rise to minibus-induced traffic congestion, which detracts further
from UPTC's operational efficiency while reducing its revenues.
The project includes technical assistance and some investment to improve the operating efficiency of
UPTC, to provide bus priority on-street over other traffic, to review the role of minibuses, and to
strengthen the regulatory framework.
Air Pollution. Industrial activity is presently the main contributor to poor ambient air quality in Urumqi,
especially in the winter months. Motor vehicles are the main source of pollution in summer. Increasing
motorization and traffic congestion will significantly increase the contribution of mobile source pollution.
As part of a national pilot program in 10 cities, Urumqi has undertaken conversion of 1,500 buses from
gasoline to compressed natural gas (CNG). The taxi fleet is being converted to liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG). National and local laws and regulations to govern emissions are under development. The project
- 6-



will support further development of the local initiatives and identify other appropriate actions to address air
pollution from motor vehicles as part of the Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy (MVECS).
Institutions. The institutional arrangements for the planning, design and management of urban transport
infrastructure and services in Urumqi are similar to other cities in China. Responsibility for urban
transport is distributed across a wide array of institutions, with limited coordination across agencies. Local
technical capacity is limited and unevenly distributed between agencies. Institutional reform and
development is proposed within the project to improve the coordinated formulation and implementation of
transport policy, planning, and budgeting, and the regulation and imnplementation of transport services and
facilities.
Strategic Choices
During the project preparation phase, the UMG leadership and transport agencies made several strategic
choices to address the above sector issues.
Road capacity. The need to invest in the expansion of road capacity, particularly in a ring road, was
examined in depth given that the North-South Hetan expressway was recently built. The analysis showed
that extra capacity is required but a full ring road with standards as originally proposed could not be
justified, particularly in the NE quadrant. A lower-capacity partial ring-road (together with complementary
limited improvements to the arterial road network) is supported on the basis of an economic analysis.
Public transport. Given the high levels of existing and projected future public transport use, high priority
was attached to improving the quantity, quality and efficiency of bus services. As the public sector
operator is already raising some capital for buses from local financial institutions, investment in buses and
depots was considered unnecessary.
The project also considered the extent of reforms which was feasible in the public transport sector. The
UPTC is not an independent business entity, hence the planned reforms aim at commercialization of its
management and operations. Current financial and regulatory arrangements make the operation of public
transport in Urumqi unsustainable. Both UMG and XUAR have agreed to address this issue though a
Public Service Obligation (PSO) payment, based on level of service requirements and route coverage, as
well as further commercialization of the UPTC. They have also agreed to create a new regulatory agency
for public transport separate from UPTC. The project supports these initiatives. An annual review of
implementation of the reform program, including possible modifications to the program itself and its
targets was agreed at negotiations.
Investments in light rail and busways were found unjustifiable. However, it was agreed that possible future
investment will be examined in the proposed Network Development Study.
Traffic management. The project team evaluated the timing and extent of institutional development and
training prior to any major investments. It was agreed that knowledge transfer and institutional
strengthening would be best achieved with training and investment taking place in parallel.
Environmental Management. Direct environmental impacts of motor vehicles will be mitigated through
measures incorporated in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). However, this plan only deals with
the local visual intrusion, noise and air pollution from motor vehicles. City wide mitigation of air pollution
from motor vehicles would require a comprehensive stand alone project with actions to be undertaken at
national and local levels. Therefore, a choice was made regarding the scope of activities to be included
- 7 -



under the project. An outline MVECS, building on the ongoing city initiatives, was prepared as part of the
EMP. The project supports the implementation of Stage 2 of this Strategy. A Bank/UMG annual review
of the MVECS was agreed at negotiations.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
A.    Road Network Development. To maintain and improve the road network, this component will
provide a 31.25 km "Ring Road", 29 km. of which is financed under the project. The proposed road will
link the old CBD to new development areas of the city, protect the CBD from extraneous traffic, and
distribute regional traffic to the urban trunk road network (see Annex 4 for traffic projections).
B.    Traffic Management and Road Safety. This component is designed to enhance the efficiency in
the use of the existing road space and improve traffic safety. It contains five programns focusing on
investment and technical assistance.
C.    Public Transport. This component is designed to develop public transport as a viable and
sustainable travel alternative to the car by improving the level of existing bus services, and to support the
ongoing reforms towards the strengthening of the regulatory and planning capabilities of the Urban
Construction Commission (UCC), and the comrnercial viability of UPTC.
D.    Environmental Management. Urumqi's leadership is very active in promoting and implementing
environmental protection and improvement initiatives. This component is designed to support them and
fuirther develop a MVECS.
E.    Institutional Development. This component is designed to strengthen local capacity and
processes for urban transport, planning, programming and budgeting, and system management.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
Key policy and institutional reforms to be sought include:
2.1    Strengthened coordination of municipal urban transport sector policies and programs: An
Urban Transport Sector Leading group has been established by the UMG. The Sector Leading Group will
be maintained as the decision making body for policy making, medium-term planning and development of
rolling investment programs. This group shall oversee all project studies and be supported by a permanent
group of technical experts.
2.2    Measurable progress on a strategy for public transport reform: This entails further
commercialization of UPTC, transferring the regulatory functions of UPTC to a separate office of the
UCC, and development of a policy framework to provide for sustainable finance for public transport
development. UMG's policy statement on the reform and development of public transport (approved
January 2000), serves as a basis for the strategy. Progress on the implementation of the strategy, together
with performance targets, will be monitored via annual review between UMG and the Bank.
2.3    Continued progress on implementation of a MVECS: Under the project, UMG will establish a
division of the Urumqi Environment Protection Bureau (UJEPB) that will be responsible for the
management of the implementation of the MVECS in Urumqi. The division will coordinate existing
programs, develop and monitor performance measures for the MVECS, and develop implementation plans.
The division will assess the current emission targets and assess the need to modify the MVECS. The
assessment and recommendations will be contained in the annual report to the municipal government, which
will serve as the basis for the annual BankIUMG review.
2.4    Development and implementation of a systematic road maintenance management system: The
computerized road maintenance management system (covering pavement, bridges and drainage) will
provide the basis for needs-based planning and budgeting. Budget targets for road maintenance will be
discussed during the annual UMG/Bank review of the project.
3. Benefits and target population:
Successful implementation of the project will generate immediate and longer-term benefits to the residents
and enterprises of Urumqi. Benefits flow from the improved operation of the urban transport system and
the longer-term economic development this facilitates. Particular benefits expected and their target
populations are summarized in the following table:

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Oversight
An Urumqi Municipal Government Project Leading Group (consisting of the heads of implementing
agencies and headed by a vice-mayor) with responsibility for overall project coordination (during both
preparation and implementation) was established at the start of project preparation. Currently, the Mayor
and a Vice Mayor are overseeing project preparation. The UMG Leading Group will coordinate with a
Provincial Project Leading Group (consisting of leaders of concerned provincial agencies and headed by the
- 10-



XUAR deputy chairnan) which has been established to coordinate project matters among national, regional
and municipal governments. An Urban Transport Sector Leading Group has been established to formulate
policy, undertake planning and guide implementation of urban transport activities for the city, including
traffic management policies and operations. This group will oversee all studies.
Project Implementation
UMG will be responsible for project implementation, counterpart funds arrangement, loan repayment, and
ensuring compliance with World Bank policies. UMG will sign the Project Agreement with the World
Bank. The estimated completion date of the project is June 30, 2005, with a projected closing date of
December 31, 2005.
Project Management
The already established Project Executive Office (PEO), reporting to the UMG Project Leading Group, has
overall responsibility for project management and coordination with respect to implementation. The PEO
will be responsible for coordinating the procurement activities for all components. The PEO will be
responsible for day-to-day management of TA and other activities included in the Institutional
Strengthening Component.
Implementing agencies are:
*   Urumqi Municipal Ring Road Construction Company which will directly manage the
implementation of the Ring Road construction (component Al).
*  Urumqi Municipal Engineering Bureau (UMEB) will be responsible for other road network
and road maintenance sub-components A2 & A3.
*  Urumqi Public Security Bureau (UPSB) will be the project manager for the implementation of
the traffic management component B.
*   UPTC will implement, together with the Urumqi Passenger Transport Management Office, the
institutional reform and the investment program for sub-component C I. UPTC will work
together with UPSB and PEO for the bus network improvement sub component C2. The PEO
will manage the TA for sub-component C3 on behalf of UMG.
*   IJEPB will be responsible for the environmental improvement component D and
implementation of the environmental protection measures identified in the EMP.
*   Urumqi Planning Bureau (UPB) transportation planning and modeling sub-unit will participate
in the Transport Network Development Program Study in sub-component El.
*   District Resettlement Offices will have the responsibility for implementation of resettlement in
accordance with the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) under the guidance of and with funding
arranged by the PEO.
Finance. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will on-lend World Bank loan fimds to the XUAR (through the
Finance Bureau), which will in turn on-lend funds to Urumqi Municipality. The loan type will be
LIBOR-based floating rate Single Currency (US$) Loan (SCL). On-lending terms from MOF to XUAR
and from XUAR to UMG will be the same as the World Bank's to the Borrower. The 1% front-end fee will
be financed from the loan. Civil works were initiated in the second quarter of 2000 which will be
retro-actively financed by the loan in the amount of $9 million.
Financial Management and Disbursement. The financial management aspects of the Project are to be
handled by the PEO and Regional Finance Bureau (RFB). The RFB's Finance Division will be responsible
for the monitoring, maintenance and reconciliation of the Special Account, checking and monitoring
- 11 -



withdrawal applications, and verifying that payment requests meet World Bank requirements. The
Financial Department of the PEO (FDPEO), has been set up and will report both to the Directors of the
PEO and the Municipal Finance Bureau (MFB). The FDPEO will be responsible for collecting all the
supporting documents, monitoring contract payments, and preparing payment requests before submitting to
the RFB. The RFB will further verify, approve and process these documents before submitting to the Bank
for disbursement.
In terms of disbursement technique, the project will be utilizing traditional disbursement techniques as
opposed to using the Project Management Report (PMR)-based disbursement system.
Procurement. The Procurement Division of the PEO will have overall responsibility for procurement,
while the Project Management Division will be responsible for subsequent contract management.
Implementing agencies will participate in procurement under the guidance, coordination and supervision of
the PEO.
The use of a procurement agent (tendering company) is mandatory for all International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) contracts in the Bank financed China lending program, according to government
requirements. One of the state-approved and controlled International Tendering Companies (ITC) who are
certified by the Ministry Of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) as being proficient in
international procurement, has to be retained as the procurement agent for all aspects of bidding for civil
works, electrical and mechanical equipment under ICB procedures. CMC has been appointed as the ITC
for the project.
The Project Implementation Plan (PIP). The PEO and all implementing agencies jointly prepared the
PIP. It will be used as a working document to guide the implementation of the project. A copy of the draft
PIP is available in the Project File. An updated PIP will be prepared at the Project Launch Workshop.
Progress Reporting and Annual Review. The PEO will be responsible for preparing quarterly and
annual progress reports and annual work programs based on the PIP. The progress reports will summarize
physical and financial progress, address major problems and propose corrective actions to be taken. The
annual progress report will review the progress achieved in the preceding year, revise the annual work
program (AWP) for the following year, and confirm the availability of counterpart funds. The AWP will
be the subject of a joint Bank/UMG review.
World Bank Supervision Arrangements. The Project has been prepared by a joint Beijing and
Washington based team led from Washington. The same team will supervise the project. It is anticipated
that there will be three supervision missions a year led from the Beijing office. The fourth mission each
year will be the annual review mission led from Washington.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatives considered related to the scope and design of the five components listed in section B.
Road network Prior to project identification, the PEO solicited alternative design concepts from seven
domestic design institutes, which together developed 24 alternatives for the proposed Ring Road. During
project preparation, the Bank team and the PEO considered alternatives to the Ring Road for the provision
of primary road capacity, as well as alternative alignments (shown on Map 30808R) and design standards
- 12-



for the Ring Road, and alternate junction locations and types. A number of these alternatives were tested
and costed. Based on traffic projections and costs the solution chosen fulfills the project objective most
cost effectively.
Traffic management. As originally proposed by UPSB this component included a major investment in a
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Monitoring System and Command Center. Though CCTV monitoring
assists the operation of an ATC scheme, the amount proposed for Urumqi was not cost-effective. In its
place, UPSB were encouraged to develop a broader program of traffic management engineering measures
which will have a greater and more direct benefit in reducing traffic congestion.
Public transport. Altematives considered included investment in vehicles, in a new bus depot, and more
extensive bus priority measures, including a possible busway. There is a need for more buses to meet
market demand. However, as UPTC is already obtaining finance for some vehicles from local banks, there
appeared little justification for inclusion of these in the project. The depot was intended for the creation of a
fifth bus company under the umbrella of UPTC. The Project considered financing a depot if it could serve
as a pilot for a company operating on strictly commercial basis. However, such a reforrned company
should also be capable of obtaining a commercial loan for the depot. Therefore, the Project focused on
creating the framework for financially sustainable services. UPTC were guided to focus on improving
operating efficiency and service levels of the existing companies. UMG were encouraged to examine
sustainable fare, PSO and regulatory arrangements.
At the present time, bus delays due to traffic congestion occur at isolated locations and corridors. There is
little justification for an extensive network of bus lanes or a busway on the main NW-SE axis of travel
demand. To prevent a future decline in bus operating speeds with increasing traffic levels, the project
includes a pilot for bus priority measures and a feasibility study for a bus priority network.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The Bank has financed four urban transport projects in China: Shanghai (two projects), Guangzhou, and
Liaoning. The main lesson from these projects is that participation of all agencies with responsibilities for
urban transport is key to developing a balanced, integrated and sustainable project. Of particular
importance is the need to include agencies not involved with road construction.
A sustainable solution needs more than a ring road. Due to the strong preference for major investment
in road infrastructure in these cities, the Bank team discussed in depth the value of complementing the Ring
Road investment with traffic management, improved public transport, and pedestrian facilities. UMG
recognized the lessons of past Bank projects in China and agreed to use this knowledge to develop the
- 14 -



project.
Good communication is vital. Key lessons in improving communication of ideas, knowledge and
experience are the benefits of mounting a team comprising Beijing office staff, technical specialists who
speak Chinese, and technical specialists with experience in China.
Integration of land use and transport is essential for network design. There is a need to check the
quality of the Master Plan, particularly whether the growth forecasts have an analytical base, whether there
is adequate integration between the land use plan and the road network, and whether the road network
design adequately reflects future travel demand. Experience also underlines the need to develop traffic
forecasts based on robust assumptions of future growth so that alternative designs can be adequately
reviewed. The approach of considering options and iteratively improving designs is still new to China.
Recognize and address the institutional gap into which traffic management falls. Design and
engineering aspects are beyond the experience of the traffic police but are too small scale for local
municipal engineers. The project aims to strengthen traffic management design capability in the traffic
police and to link it to the design and implementation of the ATC system. The other key lesson is that time
lapse between design and implementation of traffic management measures should be kept short due to rapid
changes in traffic flow conditions.
Pace of reform is governed by local agencies and national political conditions. Urban public transport
experience favors assistance with the formulation and implementation of reform. Wholesale privatization of
companies, cost based competitive tendering for service supply, reducing labor surplus to benchmarked
operational requirements, and major private sector participation are not politically acceptable at the present
time. Thus provision of public transport continues to be largely a public sector activity. The initial thrust
therefore should be to make public sector activity more efficient through the separation of
regulatory/service planning functions from the supply function in the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) bus
companies, the commercialization and corporatization of operating SOE companies, the development of the
regulatory agencies in govermment, and facilitating private sector participation to the extent possible. This
support draws not just on experience in China, but also in countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and
more generally in the industry. The key is to adapt this knowledge to local conditions.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The various implementing agencies in the project are new to the Bank, and in some cases, to the sector.
Project preparation started in eamest only in May 1998. The basic ideas for all sub-components were
generated by the Borrower's agencies and refined with advice from the Borrower's consultants and the Bank
team. Throughout project preparation, the PEO and other agencies have been extremely cooperative and
have sought and taken advice from the Bank team on technical matters of project design. Staff from these
agencies have also visited other cities in China with current Bank projects. Two senior members of UMG
and the Vice Director (Technical) of the PEO actively participated in a 10 day training program on urban
transport in Paris organized jointly by the World Bank and the French Government in September 1999.
UMG has taken all necessary steps to ensure that initial construction can begin at the start of the project.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank's value-added to the project is provided in the form of integrated technical knowledge and policy
advice in all aspects of urban transport, and the transfer of worldwide technical good practice in project
design and implementation. The project will build on the Bank's experience from the five other urban
- 15-



transport projects in China. The UMG team has greatly benefited from this knowledge transfer during
project preparation.
The Bank support has resulted in broadening the scope of the project, the development of inter-agency
teams for component design, and the integration of transport planning into the Master Plan process. UMG
has agreed to create new institutions that will ensure inter-agency policy and planning coordination. The
project will support the strengthening of these institutions.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
* Cost benefit    NPV=US$179.4 million; ERR = 20.2 % (see Annex 4)
* Cost effectiveness
o Other (specify)
Traditional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to evaluate the major investment in the project in the
Ring Road. Simplified CBA was used to evaluate specific investment items in the Traffic Management and
Public Transport Components.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
The financial analysis covered three aspects:
(1) fiscal impact and counterpart funding arrangements,
(2) user charges and expenditures for road maintenance and public transport, and
(3) financial management system (see Annex 13).
Fiscal Impact:
2.1 Fiscal Impact and Counterpart Funding Arrangements:
UMG resources between 1999 and 2004 were found to adequately cover counterpart funds for
implementation, and debt service costs thereafter. Counterpart funds required peak at 18.6% of effective
fiscal capacity in 2002. Table I of Annex 5 shows a summary of the fiscal capacity analyses.
In 1999, the UMG established a World Bank loan repayment fund using two sources: budget for new road
investment and the housing budget. In the next four years, budget allocations for new road investment will
be the main source of the counterpart funds. Because of the government's housing reform policy, UMG
will no longer provide housing to employees starting in 2000. Thus, half of the budget previously allocated
to housing will be transferred to the counterpart funds for the project. The revenue sources for these
budgetary expenditures have been reviewed in detail and are discussed below and summarized in Table 2 of
Annex 5.
2.2 Road User Charges:
Road user charges are collected by different levels of government. The main municipal user charges are
taxi and minibus license bidding fees (from tendering of operating rights) and annual vehicle license fees.
The national governnent collects fuel taxes.
Public Transport Funding. UMG currently provides UPTC funding for capital investment (including
some bus purchases), and operating subsidies. Cost recovery (excluding subsidies) on the operating
- 16 -



account (including depreciation, but excluding interest charges on UMG capital investment) is currently
around 90%. UMG plans to phase out the operating subsidies over time. The timing of the phase out of
subsidies and the amount of funding required in the future for capital investment are dependent on the
reform efforts to be supported by component C of the project. The public transport sector studies in
sub-components Cl, C2 (a) and C3 (a) will permit more detailed financial estimates to be made of UPTC
future requirements. Actual budget allocations based on these estimates will be the subject of discussion
during the annual reviews of the implementation of the public transport sector strategy.
Road Maintenance. Current funding from UMG budgets for road maintenance is less than expenditure
with the balance made up from ad hoc urban construction funding and commercial activities of the road
maintenance units. With the present methods of maintenance planning and programming, it is not possible
to make meaningful estimates of the future funding requirements. The project will develop a more rational
and sustainable approach to road maintenance operations and budgeting (sub-component A3). The annual
review of road maintenance will permit the Bank to influence future budgets. Further analysis of road
maintenance methods, budgets and expenditures is provided in Annex 16.
3. Technical:
A thorough technical review of each component was carried out by the project team. Detailed summaries
are provided in Annex 16. Overall, the analysis showed that the quality of the technical work has been
adequate, in line with experience in other cities. A detailed engineering design review of the year 1 Ring
Road civil works contracts has confirmed the adopted design approach and standards. Costs are based on
third quarter 1999 prices, with physical contingencies at 10% of the base cost of civil works.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
While the implementing agencies generally have adequate technical capability for basic activities, most will
require support or training to undertake and implement the results of the technical studies proposed. As a
result, each component includes Technical Assistance (TA) elements. The interagency cooperation initiated
during project preparation will also need to be continued through implementation. Longer term procedures
and regulations for inter-agency coordination, expert review and policy formulation will be prepared during
project implementation.
4.2 Project management:
The PEO which has successfully managed project preparation is being expanded to manage project
implementation. Provision is made in the project for TA support and training to the PEO for its expanded
role. UMG agencies have had limited exposure to construction supervision associated with Bank-funded
civil works contracts. International consultant services are included to support domestic consultants in this
task.
4.3 Procurement issues:
A procurement assessment was performed during project preparation, a summary of which is presented in
Annex 6. The procurement agency is the PEO. An ITC has been appointed by the PEO to handle the
commercial aspects of ICB. With the assistance of the ITC, the PEO is expected to fulfill its procurement
function and administer procurement in an efficient and transparent way over time. The risks in the
procurement process are considered average.
- 17-



In the regulations and administrative procedures issued by the central and local governments for National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) using local funds, there are some inconsistencies with Bank requirements. The
main inconsistencies are the use of bracketing and the merit point system in prequalification, bid evaluation
and contract award for locally funded NCB civil works contracts. They will be waived in favor of Bank
NCB procedures in a supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement, further details of which are provided in
Annex 6.
4.4 Financial management issues:
A review of the adequacy of the project financial management system was performed during project
preparation. The review concluded that this project meets minimum Bank financial management
requirements. Some training of PEO and implementing agencies staff is needed which will be given at
project launch. Annex 13 contains an edited version of the Review of the Financial Management System
(FMS).
The status of the Borrower's and the XUAR compliance with audit covenants in existing Bank-financed
projects is satisfactory. No outstanding audits or audit issues exist with any of the prior projects involving
the Regional Finance Bureau of XUAR.
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: A (Full Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosture) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The project complies with the requirements of O.D. 4.01. The project is classified category A since it
involves involuntary resettlement, major road construction (partly on new alignment), and increased air
pollution and noise, particularly adjacent to the Ring Road.
The Xinjiang Environmental Techniques and Assessment Center (XETAC), part of the Xinjiang
Environmental Monitoring Center (XEMC), was engaged by the PEO in mid 1998 to undertake the
Environmental Assessment (EA) and to prepare the EAP (Environmental Action Plan) and EA Summary
Report. International consultants funded under the Canadian Intemational Development Agency (CIDA)
offered technical assistance in preparing the EA, EAP and EA Summnary. The international consultants
ensured that these documents provided an independent technical assessment.
Surveys of ambient air quality were made during the non-heating season in October 1998 and the heating
season in January 1999. A first round of public consultation took place during the period August 1998 to
June 1999, and a second round between June and September 1999. The second round of consultations
were based on a preliminary draft EA Summary Report in Chinese and Uygur (Uygur being the language
of the largest ethnic minority and the second official language in this Uygur Autonomous Region). Details
of the consultation process are described in section 5.4 below. The main concems of the public related to
relocation and resettlement (including one mosque), noise, local pedestrian and vehicular access, and
surface runoff. Resettlement concerns were addressed by design changes to the Ring Road and in the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Four alternative sites were offered for a new mosque, to be constructed
before demolition of the existing mosque. A site for a new mosque, to be constructed before demolition of
the existing mosque, has been agreed. Noise barriers and sound absorbent pavement are included in civil
works contracts to reduce noise, with double glazing and mechanical ventilation for the properties adjacent
to the road. Storm water sewers are included in the project to handle run off.
The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) reviewed and approved the Chinese language version
of the draft lEA in September 1999. Draft English versions of the reports were submitted to the Bank in
- 18 -



October 1999, and final versions in December 1999. The final EA Summary Report (and the RAP
Summary Report) were made available to the public in Chinese and Uygur in early September 1999. The
final versions of the EA, EAP and EA Summary documents in Chinese and the EA Summary Report in
Uygur were made available in the Urumqi Public Library on December 5, 1999. A corresponding fall set
of EA, EAP and EA Summary documents in English was sent to the World Bank Public Information
Center (PIC) in Washington, D.C. with-authorization from UMG, on December 29, 1999. The appraisal
mission confirned the availability of the EA in Chinese and EA Summary in Chinese and Uygur in
Urumqi. A summary of the assessment is presented in Annex 11.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
Separate mitigation measures are proposed for the design, construction and operation phases of the
project.
Design Phase
Noise, vibration, sunshine and severance were all considered in the design phase of the project. Mitigation
measures proposed are set out in Annex 11. Planting on an area equivalent to 15% of the land area of the
Ring Road is included as a mitigation measure. Additional planting on a similar sized area is included in
Project Component D: Environmental Management.
Construction Phase
Mitigation measures for air and water quality, vibration, noise and construction materials are included in
the civil works construction contracts. Proposals for traffic management (including facilities for
pedestrians) during construction will be developed by the PEO before award of contracts. The contracts
require the contractors to design and implement detailed measures in consultation with the traffic police and
the construction supervision consultants.
Operation Phase
Air Quality. The MVECS included in Component D of the project is designed to provide city-wide longer
term mitigation measures for air pollution from motor vehicles. It was agreed at negotiations that progress
in implementation of the MVECS will be subject to annual review by UMG and the Bank.
The EMP has been approved by SEPA and the Bank and is considered adequate.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: December 7, 1999
The EA, EMP and EA Summary were placed in the PIC in Washington, D.C. on December 29, 1999. The
updated Environmental Data Sheet and updated Project Information Document (PID) were sent to the PIC
in Washington, D.C. on January 14, 2000. (The PID was first provided to the PIC in Washington, D.C. in
November 1998).
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
- 19-



First Round of Public Participation (August, 1998 - June, 1999)
On both sides of the Ring Road, 57 institutions, 10 residential committees, 6 mosques, including 162
people, were surveyed during site visits. In addition, telephone interviews and questionnaire surveys were
undertaken. A public meeting was held. The main contents of the project were introduced at the meeting.
Public concerns from the meetings as well as from the questionnaires and interviews are summarized in
section 5.1.
Second Round of Public Participation (June - September 1999)
Two hotlines for public input, one available in PEO and the other in EIA team, were set up in this stage for
public inquiries. A preliminary EIA Summary in both Chinese and Uygur was distributed in each of the 26
affected residents' committees for public review. At the same time, more than 800 pamphlets were
distributed along the Ring Road introducing the project in both Chinese and Uygur.
The second stage public meeting was held in the UCC on September 24, 1999. Representatives of the local
press and over 140 representatives from sensitive receptors, the resettlement department, the District
People's Congress and the govenmment agencies attended this meeting.
Future Consultation
Future public consultation will be held at the district level. These meetings will focus on ensuring that the
people most affected by the project are fully aware of the mnitigation measures. It has been agreed that
these meetings will be held annually, at least two months in advance of construction, in the areas where
construction is to take place each year.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
XETAC and Urumqi Environment Monitoring Center have been appointed to undertake independent
monitoring and reporting on environmental impacts. The reports of these consultants will be considered as
part of the annual review of the project.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement applies to this project. The PEO commissioned the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences who undertook baseline social analyses and resettlement planning to ensure
that incomes and living standards are improved, or at least restored, for all persons adversely affected by
the project. Annex 12 reviews adverse impacts related to land acquisition or changes in land use for the
project, and the arrangements proposed in the RAP to mitigate them. Related public consultation and
disclosure activities are also summarized.
With respect to impacts, the project will require 510 mu (34 hectares) of land (along with use of 2,013 mu,
or 134 hectares, of existing right-of-way). This includes acquisition of 197.5 mu (about 13 hectares) of
rural land, of which 100.8 mu (about 7 hectares) is cultivated, and transfer of 312.5 mu (about 21 hectares)
of urban land-use rights. Acquisition of cultivated land will directly affect 53 households (218 individuals).
Structural demolition is expected to total 151,207 square meters, including 57,615 square meters of
residential housing. A total of 854 households (3,492 individuals) will need to be relocated. A total of 835
- 20 -



enterprises or work units will be affected by non-residential demolition or loss of land. Of the 854
households to be relocated, 261 (or 30.6%) are members of ethnic minorities. The project also will require
relocation of one mosque.
The draft RAP in English was received by the Bank prior to appraisal and discussed with UMG during the
appraisal mission in January 2000. The appraisal mission confirmed the availability of the RAP in Chinese
and Uygur in Ururnqi. The final RAP in Chinese and Uygur, with an Annex summarizing Minority Issues,
was placed in the Urumqi Public Library on January 20 2000. The final RAP in English was received by
the Bank, (together with a letter from UMG authorizing its disclosure to the PIC), on February 4, 2000.
The RAP was cleared on February 14, 2000, and made available to the public (through the PIC) on March
1, 2000. A revised RAP, which clarifies and elaborates on RAP arrangements as they relate to ethnic
minorities is being prepared.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Socio-Economic Survey
Because of the presence of ethnic minorities in the project area, in addition to the Public Consultation
programs related to environmental and resettlement issues, (described in sections 5.4 and 6.1 above), a
series of focus groups, household interviews and transit passenger surveys were conducted as part of a
Socio-Economic Survey (Study). The Xinjiang Social Science Research Institute (XSSRI), a leading local
social science research institute specializing in ethnic minority issues undertook the study. XSSRI
developed the research design, executed surveys and produced Study reports with a view to assessing the
transport-related needs, opinions and attitudes of ethnic minorities and three other potentially vulnerable
groups (floating/non resident population, women and the poor). XSSRI organized and conducted all
surveys. No governnent officials participated in consultations with survey participants. Some
neighborhood committee members assisted XSSRI with translation for interviews with ethnic minority
households.
The scope of study encompassed public transport services and a proposed fare increase as well as
participants' views on the project in general. Surveys indicate that the public is supportive of the project
and the proposals to reform public transport. The surveyed groups believe that the Ring Road will address
traffic congestion problems. Public transport reform is also expected to result in more choices for the
public and more routes covering a larger area. With respect to key research concems about the
affordability of bus fares, respondents from each group, except the poor, indicated that they were willing to
pay somewhat more than current fares for service improvements. The Study also identified the need for
public transport service improvements for under-served areas. The results of the surveys will be
incorporated into the route network study in sub-component C2(a) of the project, and the development of
the public transport strategy. These activities will be monitored as part of the annual review of the project.
Further details are provided in Annex 14: Socio-Economic Survey.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
Separate stakeholder meetings were held with leaders of community and religious groups and private
minibus operators to obtain their views on project impacts, mitigation and design. Additionally, a
stakeholder group of vehicle operators will be convened under the MVECS component to provide technical
guidance on vehicle emission policies.
- 21 -



6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences has been appointed to monitor and report on social
development. The reports of these consultants will be considered as part of the annual review of the
project.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences has been appointed to monitor and report on social
development. The reports of these consultants will be considered as part of the annual review of the
project.
7. Safeguard Policies:
7.1 Do any of the following safeguard policies apply to the proiect?
PQlliy                                    Applicability
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)           0 Yes 0 No
Natural habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)                   0 Yes * No
Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36)                                    0 Yes * No
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                      0 Yes * No
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)                                  0 Yes 0 No
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)                                   0 Yes 0 No
Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30)                             0 Yes 0 No
Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP 4.37)                              0 Yes * No
Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50)   0 Yes * No
l_Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)          0 Yes 0 No
7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
OD 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement apply. For provisions made to
ensure compliance with these policies, see section E6 above. During preparation, the social scientist in the
task team took the view that OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples should not apply, given that the minorities had
migrated to an urban area and the project does not make them vulnerable to group specific impacts.
Nevertheless, consistent with good transport planning practice, the task team, sensitive to the ethnic and
community issues, took substantive steps to review and mitigate potential impacts to ethnic minorities. The
applicability of OD 4.20 was discussed in depth by Bank management. After reviewing a range of
opinions on this subject, the ultimate decision of management was based on the professional judgment of
social scientists with the requisite qualifications, expertise and project related experience. They concluded
that the ethnic minorities who will be affected by the project are not covered by the provisions of OD 4.20
and that therefore the policy does not apply. Annex 15 provides further details.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainable benefits will depend upon several factors including:
Creation and retention of new institutional structures including for formulation and implementation of
urban transport policies, regulation in the passenger transport sector and the reformed public transport
company.
- 22 -



Professional development of local technical staff through a combination of formal training, study tours
and other means of technical assistance and mentoring by international and domestic experts and "learning
by doing". The Urban Transport Sector Leading Group within UMG will play a key role in this respect.
Sustainable financing for public transport and road maintenance. UMG plans to revise the regulatory
and financial framework for public transport to ensure the sustainability of public transport operations, but
lacks the experience in making the necessary changes. Budgets for road maintenance need to be set at
levels which provide adequate funding to manage the asset. TA and training in the Public Transport and
Road Network components are designed to address these issues. Annual reviews will permit an active role
for the Bank in monitoring the progress.
Integrated transport and urban development. Urban development visions will need to be supported by
regulations on land use development (and procedures for enforcing them) integrated with supportive
transport investments and policies. UMG has agreed to maintain a continuing dialogue with the Bank on
these aspects. The proposed Transport Network Development study will further the integrated approach
advocated during project preparation.
Implementation and enforcement of the MVECS. The MVECS should be flexible enough to develop
and apply additional measures as emission levels increase and new approaches are developed worldwide.
Annual reviews of the MVECS are designed to permit an active role for the Bank in the design of these
measures.
Maintenance of traffic management measures. The ongoing maintenance of any Area Traffic Control
system and its associated vehicle detection equipment is cmcial in obtaining the full benefits of reduced
congestion and delay. Maintenance of a proactive interagency Traffic Management Group is necessary to
ensure that measures are adjusted to changing circumstances.
Maintenance of high public transport mode share. Public transport share of travel demand is high and
efforts will be needed to maintain that mode share through service improvements. Annual reviews of the
reform program are designed to permit an active role for the Bank in guiding these efforts.

Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is ethnically diverse. In addition to
Uygurs, persons from 44 other minorities reside in the city, with the minority population comprising 27%
of the total. Ethnic relations are sensitive. From the beginning, the task team has been aware of the need
for careful preparation particularly in two components that pose potential issues of inter-ethnic equity. In
Component - A Road Network, there are resettlement-related impacts associated with ring road
construction. These resettlement-related issues have been subject to repeated scrutiny, as explained in the
RAP and summarized in Annex 12. In Component C - Public Transport, the issues relate to changes in bus
fares and services associated with public transport reforrn. Through social assessment, travel preferences
and patterns of minority nationalities have been examined, as summarized in Annex 14. The results are to
be factored into reform strategies to be detailed during project implementation. Annex 15 provides an
overview of issues relating to minority nationalities.

Urban Transport Strategy:
Concluding statement from Urban Transport Symposium (see Stares and Zhi, China's Urban Transport
Development Strategy: Proceedings of a Svmposium in Beijing, November 8-10, 1995, World Bank
Discussion Paper No. 352, Washington, D.C., 1996):
"Two to three years ago, only the very largest municipalities were concemed about urban
transport. Water supply and sewage disposal seemed more urgent problems. This has changed for
one very clear reason: the rising number of motor vehicles - cars, trucks, taxis and motorcycles -
has resulted in a sharp increase in traffic congestion. What can be done about it? Urban transport
is complex. Action is needed in many areas at the same time - policy, institutions, management,
prices, infrastructure construction and other investments. It does not help to solve one problem if
others are ignored."
There was considerable agreement among the delegates on the general lines of actions to be taken. These
were brought together as five principles, four criteria and eight actions.
The five principles represent themes that should guide urban transport planning and
operations at this time in China's development:
I. Transport is about moving people and goods, not vehicles;
2. Transport prices should reflect full social costs;
3. Transport reformns should deepen to align with socialist market principles so as to increase
efficiency;
4. The role of government should be to guide transport development;
5. The role of the private sector in providing transport services should be encouraged.
City plans and policies for managing transport should meetfour criteria:
1. Environmental sustainability
2. Economic viability
3. Financial affordability
4. Social acceptability
Consistent with these principles and criteria, eight actions are recommended:
1. Reform urban transport administration
2. Upgrade the status of traffic management
3. Prepare a strategy to mitigate motor vehicle air and noise pollution
4. Develop policies to manage traffic demand
5. Develop a strategy for mass transit
6. Reform public transport management and operations
7. Develop a financing strategy for the transport sector
8. Strengthen the framework for transport planning and capacity building

A.    Road Network Development (See Map 30808R)
Al.   Ring Road Construction ($216.3 million). This sub-component includes ring road construction,
road maintenance equipment for the ring road, ring road traffic control equipment, environment impact
mitigation measures, consultant services for construction supervision and environment monitoring, and land
acquisition and reseftlement (including monitoring activities). The civil works are divided into four sections
which correspond generally with the annual construction staging, except for the tunnel in section 2 which is
to be constructed over two years. Two-thirds of the new construction (19.4 kin) will be to expressway
standards, with urban arterial standards adopted for the remaining 9.6 km in the north-east, where traffic
demand is lower. Over 70 percent of the Ring Road will be built at-grade, with elevated construction for
8.3 km in the inner areas, close to the CBD. A total of 18 pedestrian facilities (16 overpasses and 2
underpasses) and a number of at-grade pedestrian crossings will be constructed to ensure pedestrian access
and safety.
It is proposed to construct the Ring Road in four phases, corresponding approximately to the four year
construction program and involving a total of 21 contract packages. These are described below:
*   Year I (Contracts 1-6) WuChang Interchange - Xi Shan Interchange (7.45kim), plus
preliminary works on the tunnel in Contract 7. This section involves the upgrading of an existing
2-lane road to a 6-lane at-grade expressway, with two 2-lane frontage service roads. The section
starts at a new grade-separated interchange at WuChang Highway/Altay Road to be built by the
Xinjiang Highway Bureau as part of the Airport Expressway. Near Hangjin Hospital, a vehicle
overbridge with associated slip roads is proposed to provide access to adjacent development land
and to allow traffic to make U-turns. A grade-separated flyover is proposed at Karamay Road
West. A fully grade-separated interchange is proposed at the junction with Xishan
Road/Nanliangpo Road. With the exception of small areas at the interchanges, the new road is
constructed within the existing planning line (red line).
This section of the Ring Road will relieve the existing heavily trafficked routes of Altay Road and
Beijing Road/Yuhua Road which carry substantial volumes of bus traffic. Coupled with the second
year package, it will provide an improved high standard route for traffic from the expanding areas
of the city in the north-west and the external expressway system (including the new airport
expressway) to the central and southern areas of the city.
*   Year 2 (Contracts 7-11) XiShan Interchange - TuanJie Road (5.71 kim), including the
completion of the tunnel (Contract 7). This section will be built as a 4-lane expressway and
includes two parallel 450 m long tunnels through Hongshan mountain. No service roads are
proposed on the tunnel section. Alternative provision for local traffic is made via Xishan
Road/Nanliangpo Road which will be reconstructed over a 2.48 km. section as a local service road
(Contract 10), including a new flyover. South of the tunnel, most of the section is elevated 4-lane
expressway, constructed above the line of existing roads, which are retained for local access.
- 34 -



Access ramps to and from the expressway are proposed at Xishan Road, Baoshan Road, the
Railway Station, QianTangJiang Road and Tuanjie Road. The alignment past the Railway Station
includes a new flyover and makes partial use of the existing grade-separation. Along
Qiantangjiang Road, the route makes use of an existing interchange at the junction with Hetan
Road, together with a 540 m section of 4-lane flyover.
This section of the Ring Road will improve access to the Central Business District (CBD) from all
sectors of the city and will also provide an alternative route for through (or non-essential) traffic
wishing to by-pass the inner areas. This should lead to a reduction of traffic volumes on CBD
streets with resultant environmental gains and opportunities to provide priorities for public
transport.
Part of the section south of the tunnel (near the Guanmin Mosque) is constructed in deep cut. Use
of a box-culvert section is to be considered for one of the slip roads to reduce the height of the cut
and to provide additional eiivironmental protection.
*   Year 3 (Contracts 12-17) Tuanjie Road - Karamay Road East Interchange (6.20 km). This
section contains 3.2 km of elevated 6-lane expressway, 1.7 km of elevated 4-lane expressway, and
two sections totaling 1.3 km of at-grade 6-lane expressway. An elevated solution is adopted to
avoid severing the large number of local roads which cross the alignmnent, to ease pedestrian
movement, and to minimize the extent of land-take. Two sections are proposed at-grade due to
topographical considerations and the need to reduce the gradient of the expressway.
The alignment follows existing roads throughout: these are retained as at-grade frontage roads for
local traffic. Eight sets of signals, to be linked into the proposed Area Traffic Control (ATC)
system, are provided at junctions with the local road network. In total, seven sets of on and off
ramps link the expressway with the local frontage roads.
This section of the Ring Road will provide additional north-south capacity to the east of the city
center and will relieve the parallel competing routes which pass through the heart of the
commercial core. Traffic demand on this section can be expected to increase further with the
subsequent development of sites to the north-east of the city.
*   Year 4 (Contracts 18-21) Karamay East - Altay Road (9.645 km). This section will be
constructed as a 6-lane urban arterial, generally with at-grade signalized junctions, as part of the
arterial road network in the area. In addition to the Karamay East flyover, two simple fly-overs will
be provided at Beijing Road and Altay Road. Traffic forecasts on this section are significantly
lower than elsewhere, due to the limited extent of development, and do not justify expressway
standards.
The alignment in the north-east quadrant is determined by the extent of potential mining
subsidence, which also constrains development in the area. In the longer-term, when the mining
area becomes available for development, it is envisaged in the Master Plan that the Ring Road
could be completed - as an expressway - further north in conjunction with the overall urban
development.
A 2.15 km section between Liudaowan Road and NanhulXinYi Road will be built on a new
alignrment, which has been selected to minimize property impact and follow the southern boundary
- 35 -



of potential subsidence: elsewhere the Ring Road involves the upgrading of existing roads - Nanhu
Road, Suzhou Road and Altay Road.
In addition to the two fly-overs, there is an existing interchange with Hetan Road and there will be
six sets of at-grade signals. Allowance in the engineering design has be made for the possible
construction, at a later date beyond project completion, of a one-way flyover at Nanhu/XinYi
junction.
A1.2  Road Maintenance Equipment. In order to ensure the road condition after the ring road opens,
the project will provide road maintenance equipment for the ring road. The major equipment will include:
road maintenance monitoring vehicles, snow cleaning vehicles, road cleaning vehicles, a tipper truck, road
comprehensive maintenance equipment, cement and concrete road pavement equipment, cement and
concrete road maintenance equipment, bridge check and maintenance equipment, road rollers, bitumen
pavement, road check, road maintenance lift, underground pipe check equipment, bitumen and concrete
mixer, road crack fixed equipment, and other maintenance equipment.
A1.3  Traffic control and monitoring facilities. The project will provide traffic control facilities for the
expressway sections of the ring road.
A1.4   Environmental impact mitigation building works. In order to mitigate noise impacts, the
project will provide mechanical ventilation and cooling units to about 5700 households to permit them to
keep their windows closed. This is in addition to other mitigation measures including noise barriers which
are included in the civil works contracts.
A1.5  Consulting services for construction supervision and environmental monitoring. The project
will finance both local and international consultants to provide construction supervision services for the
construction of the ring road according to international contract practice. Provision is also made for
extemal monitoring in accordance with the EMP.
At.6  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The construction of the ring road in the city center area will
involve land acquisition and the resettlement of people, units, and enterprises. The resettlement action plan
(RAP) for the project will guide the implementation and monitoring of the annual land acquisition and
resettlement for all phases of the project. The project will finance costs related to resettlement activities
and monitoring. (Land acquisition is not Bank financed).
A2.   Other Road Network Improvements ($2.8 million)

Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
CHINA: Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project
Planning Background
The rate of development of the local economy, resident and floating (non-resident) population and the
registered vehicle fleet from 1985 to 1997 is shown in Table 4.1 (historical). Historically, Urumqi GDP
growth for the period (219 percent) outpaced national growth (188 percent). Resident population in
Urumqi Municipality grew by 30 percent, while employment increased by 25 percent. Although the
increase in the vehicle fleet was (at 135 percent) well below growth in GDP, the growth in the passenger
vehicle fleet from a relatively low base was 475 percent. In spite of this rapid growth, there were still only
24 passenger vehicles per thousand residents in 1997. The potential for further growth in the fleet is great.
Table 4.1 (projected) also presents the forecasts for future population growth, economic growth and the
development of the vehicle fleet. Future planning horizon years corresponding with travel demand model
forecast years are 2004 (the assumed first year of operation for the whole Ring Road), 2010 and 2020.
Over the period 1997 - 2020, Urumqi's GDP is forecast to increase by 347 percent with both population
and employment increases of 49 percent. The fleet is forecast to increase by 279 percent to a total of
300,000 vehicles in 2020. The passenger vehicle fleet is forecast to increase by 470 percent to 210,000 or
93 per thousand residents.

Study Area
For the purposes of travel demand forecasting, a study area smaller than the municipality was defined.
This study area is known as the built-up urban area surrounding the city proper and covers approximately
139.5 sq. kilometers. Table 4.2 presents the study area population and employment data and growth rates
which were used in traffic analysis. (Municipal employment is located entirely in the study area and thus is
identical to citywide employment reported in Table 4.1 above.) The figures below suggest a population
density of 10,100 persons/sq.km. in the study area in 1997.

Modeling
The economic evaluation for the Project utilizes a standard cost-benefit approach. The evaluation includes
the Project's major investment in the Ring Road which accounts for some 86 percent of the project's
financial cost. Benefits from the Ring Road investment were estimated using a newly-developed transport
model of the Urumqi urban area. Using data from surveys undertaken in 1998, an Emme/2 model of the
Urumqi urban area was calibrated by domestic consultants Shanghai Comprehensive City and
Transportation Planning Institute (SCCTPI). Data collection activities included the following surveys:
o   extemal stations (surveyed 18/19 August 1998)
*   vehicle travel and screen line traffic counts (31 August)
*   home interviews (14-19 September)
*   major trip production points (21 September)
-   intersection traffic volume (22 September)
-   transit ridership (30 September/7 October)
The results of the surveys are presented in "Urumqi Travel Survey Analysis Final Report" January 1999,
SCCTPI. Following calibration of the model, projections of travel demand were performed in two stages
corresponding to the use of a vehicle-trip based model to undertake Strategic Planning and Analysis and
subsequent expansion of the vehicle-trip model into an integrated person-trip model for Economic
Evaluation.
Strategic Planning and Analysis
Using the Emme/2 model, two strategic planning exercises were undertaken using a fixed matrix vehicle
trip model, and forecast volumes in 2004, 2010 and 2020. These are described as follows:
1.) Strategic Network Analysis was undertaken to identify the need for a major investment and compare
altemative investnent programs to meet future demand. Five networks modeled were:
A. The existing road network plus new links and upgrading planned to be in service in each
modeled year as per the Master Plan, but excluding the Ring Road.
B. Network A plus the whole Ring Road.
C. Network A plus limited upgrading of existing roads on the Ring Road alignment, together with
complementary improvements to other parts of the network, as a lower cost altemative to the
Ring Road.
D. Network A plus infrastructure to support bus priority measures on major arteries.
-45 -



E. Network A plus a north-south light rail transit (LRT) line and feeder bus services with bus
priority measures on other corridors.
The results of Strategic Network Analysis derived in August 1999, are shown in Table 4.3. The average
speed over the whole network for Network A ("do minimnum") is projected to be 30.8 kph in 2010.
Estimated volume/capacity ratios on key north-south corridors and CBD streets indicate congested
conditions under this scenario. The major investment in the Ring Road (Network B) improves this
substantially to 37.6 kph, with the greatest increase as expected on the Ring Road corridor, from 25.4 to
47.7 kph. A significant improvement is also obtained in the CBD, from 17.2 to 21.4 kph. The major public
transport network E (LRT) produces small savings in vehicle krn over Network B while improving speeds
in the CBD over those of Network A, however the specification of this alternative network was not ideal.
The lower-cost alternative road network (Network C) and bus-oriented public transport (Network D)
scenarios also improved on Network A, but did not perform as well on system performance indicators as
Network B (Ring Road), due in part to the lower investment costs associated with those options.

This exercise demonstrated the usefulness of Strategic Network Analysis as a planning tool, and will
continue under planning activities identified in Component E: Institutional Development (Transport
Network Program Development Study). For the purposes of economic evaluation, modeling of these
network alternatives was carried forward for an ernhanced Network A (A* to represent a more realistic "do
minimum") and Network B (Ring Road) only.

Alternatives Analysis (Alignment and Standards)
The use of the vehicle model to test alternative junction layout and design standards was continuous
throughout the preliminary design process. A major outcome of demand analyses was the reduction of
roadway standards for the eastern and northern sections of the ring road alignrnent. Traffic figures also
informed decisions relating to the need for elevated sections, number of lanes, and interchange layout and
scale. Design changes are documented in the various Ring Road feasibility and modeling reports as listed
in Annex 8. Final traffic volumes (2-way, 24-hour) assigned to the Ring Road and to the local roads on the
alignment in 2004, 2010 and 2020 are given in Table 4.4 by homogeneous section. Volumes on the Ring
Road in 2004 range between 22.5 and 47.4 thousand vehicles per day. The range for 2020 is between 38.0
and 90.9 thousand. Local road volumes refer to auxiliary roads for at-grade sections or surface roads
where the Ring Road alignment is elevated.

Economic Evaluation
For the economnic evaluation, the vehicle-trip model was developed into an integrated person-trip model
which had enhanced capabilities including use of a non-fixed trip matrix (reflecting features to capture
generated demand and mode share function based on generalized cost). The evaluation focused on a
comparison of the costs and benefits of the above mentioned Networks A* (do minimum/no project) and B
(Ring Road). The augmented Network A* assumes that the Ring Road corridor would be widened to
- 48 -



6-lanes in 2007 and that the Hetan Road/Karamay Road Interchange (a key interchange located at the
intersection of two highways within the Ring Road) would be added to the Master Plan program. The cost
of widening the Ring Road corridor in Network A* would be avoided by the construction of the Ring Road
and is a benefit to the project. This benefit is conservatively assumed to be 10 percent of the cost of the
Ring Road project and appears as a negative cost in year 2007 of the evaluation.
To analyze traffic benefits against ring road investment and maintenance costs, a spreadsheet model was
developed to calculate three cost-benefit indicators: EIRR; net present value (NPV) at 12 percent and
modified economic rate of return (MERR). The MERR assumes that project benefits would be reinvested
to yield only the marginal rate of return on public sector investment, which is assumed to be the test
discount rate of 12 percent. The development of the person trip model, calibration data and the results of
the network modeling are presented and discussed in the report "Second-Phase Model of Urumqi
Transport Planning - Person Trip Model" SCCTPI, August 1999, which is available in the project files.
Economic Evaluation Results
The cost and revenue streams for the analysis of Network B compared with Network A' are summarized in
the tables below. The project EIRR is 20.2 percent and the MERR is 15.0 percent. The NPV for the total
project (net benefits) is RMB 1.49 billion.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
Ring Road Benefits
The principal economic benefits of the Ring Road accrue to road users in the form of vehicle operating cost
(VOC) savings from reduced traffic congestion and from journey time savings. These benefits are
distributed over the whole of the urban road network, as traffic will re-route in response to the additional
capacity provided, increasing speeds in other areas.
Benefits from the Ring Road project will accrue from 2001, as some sections enter service, and will
increase significantly in both 2002 and 2003. However, as construction is primarily on existing alignment,
substantial disbenefits during construction will need to be mitigated through traffic plans, as road capacity
will be lost and re-routings will have an impact on other parts of the network. Thus, the net benefit prior to
full opening in 2004 is likely to be small and benefits for 2001-2003 have been disregarded for the
economic analysis.

Distribution of Benefits
The Net Present Value of Benefits is RMB 2.70 billion and within this vehicle operating cost savings are
2.5 times greater than travel time savings. The distribution of vehicle-trip based VOC benefits by class of
vehicle in 2004, 2010 and 2020 is given in Table 4.6-1 and the equivalent data for person-trip based travel
time benefits by mode is given in Table 4.6-2.
In 2004, 66 percent of VOC benefits are estimated to accmre to passenger vehicles, rising to 73 percent by
2020. The majority of benefits accrue to cars and taxis as these modes account for 58 percent of VOC
benefits. It is assumed that transit vehicle VOC benefits (8.1 percent) accrue to transit operators (producer
surplus). Travel-time benefits for individual person-trips are summed by mode in Table 4.5-2. While the
majority of benefits is projected to accrue to car users (43%), almost a third of benefits is projected to be
realized by public transport users (31%) in 2004. The higher shares of person-trip based public transport
travel time benefits compared with vehicle owner/operator based VOC benefits are attributable to the high
passenger vehicle occupancies of buses compared with other types of vehicles. Benefits to pedestrians and
cyclists were not estimated quantitatively for the Ring Road investment, but were evaluated separately
under complementary traffic management investments (see below).
The annual rate of increase in VOC benefits is 4.3 percent for the period 2004 - 2010, rising to 10.9
percent for 2010 - 2020, as congestion worsens on Network A*. Time benefits grow more quickly as the
value of time savings is also increasing. Benefits increase at annual rates of 17.3 percent from 2004 - 2010
and 16.9 percent from 2010 - 2020.

Ring Road Costs
The financial costs for each component of the project and main sub-components (estimates as of 20
October 1999) and their percentages of total cost are given in Table 4.7. Costs are shown in both RMB
and US dollars, at an assumed exchange rate of US$1.00 = RMB8.30. Costs are at estimated out turn
prices, including price contingency from the 1999 base prices. Interest during the construction period is
also included in the costs. For the Ring Road, interest is allocated to each section.

The cost estimate for the whole Ring Road has been reduced by RMB 44.5 million, (the cost of the
Wuchang Interchange which was withdrawn from the project), to be funded as part of the Airport
Expressway link. This interchange represents 2.3 percent of the total cost of the Ring Road and its benefits
cannot easily be evaluated separately, it was therefore decided that the cost and benefits would be included
in the Ring Road econornic analysis.
Economic costs have been derived from financial costs by excluding the following:
*   interest payable during the construction period
*   price contingency
*   working capital during the construction period
- 52 -



No shadow price has been applied to labor costs, as the skill levels required for this project are not
considered to be in surplus supply in Urumqi, which has a relatively isolated labor market. Local market
prices have been used to estimate materials costs. In accordance with Government regulations for
developing the financial costs for public sector projects, value added tax and all other taxes are excluded
from these cost estimates and no adjustment is required to develop the economic costs. For the isolated
market of Urumqi, materials costs are considered to represent economic costs. The land acquisition costs
reflect resettlement costs only and are used unadjusted to represent economic costs.
Construction of the Ring Road was originally planned to be phased over the period 1999 to 2003.
However, actual start of construction was delayed until April 2000, and the economic analysis reflects this
schedule. Apart from this adjustment, costs by year have been allocated in accordance with the planned
construction schedule.
The economic costs (in RMB 1999 million) and the construction segments in each year are as follows:
Economic      As %          Construction

The economic cost, excluding Wuchang Interchange, is RMB 1664 million, representing 87.5 percent of
the financial cost of RMB 1902 million.
Traffic Results
Traffic congestion on the main roads will decrease following construction of the project, to the benefit of
buses and other road users. Table 4.8 presents motorized traffic conditions (traffic volumes and

Main Assumptions:
Benefits
Vehicle Operating Costs. The modeled link traffic volumes, speeds and volume/capacity (v/c) ratios were
used to calculate the total VOC of each network. This was calculated for vehicle types: car, light goods
vehicle (LGV), heavy goods vehicle (HGV) and bus. The World Bank's HDM-3 VOC modei was applied,
calibrated by the World Bank on 1999 base cost data representative of the Urumqi vehicle fleet. Operating
cost was related to operating speed (s) and to the link v/c ratio by the following equation:
C = a + b(l/s)(1+0.2(v/c))2 where:
a and b are estimated parameters and
s = link speed and v/c = link vehicle/capacity ratio
Value of Time. The economic value of travel time savings comparing networks was calculated,
differentiating between time on work trips and non-work trips in order to apply an "equity value of time"
- 54 -



based on national figures to the valuation of non-work trips. Work trips were valued at the Urumqi hourly
wage rate, increased by 33 percent to allow for overhead costs. Non-work trips (including commute trips)
were valued in relation to national urban household income per employed person per hour, with trips by
adults valued at 30 percent of this figure and trips by children at 15 percent. Child trips were estimated to
account for 20 percent of non-work trips. The time values for 1997 (the latest available data) were
increased to modeled years by forecast national real GDP per capita growth over the period.
The proportion of work trips was developed from the modeled trip purpose distribution for 2010. It was
assumed that half of non home-based trips would be for work. The proportion of non home-based trips
varies significantly between bus and non-bus modes; for bus, it was 10 percent of trips while for cars and
taxis combined, it was 25 percent of trips. Separate time values were therefore calculated for each of these
categories. The time values in modeled years for bus trips and other trips are given below:

Time savings for bus passengers were based on buses achieving 60 percent of the increase in link speeds
resulting from the project.
Expansion Factor. The daily VOC and time benefits as modeled represent typical summer weekdays.
Urumqi has a quite severe winter, with the mean temperature falling to -15C in February, when traffic
volumes and project benefits will be lower than in summer. The typical expansion factor from weekday to
annual benefits of around 330 is thus considered too high. A figure of 290 has been assumed, based on
100% valuation of traffic levels during the summer months (330 x 50% x 100%=165) and approximately
75% valuation of traffic during the winter months (330 x 50% x 75% = approximately 125 days).
Costs
Terminal Value. The Ring Road investment will have a continuing economic value after the end of the
analysis period in 2023. This has been represented by including a benefit in the final year equal to
one-third of the total initial investment.
Maintenance Costs. The Ring Road is being constructed predominantly on existing alignment. The only
exceptions are the tunnel section and the new eastern link. The whole alignment will be brought up to "as
new" standard, including existing road sections at-grade and beneath elevated sections. These sections
would otherwise have required maintenance based on their pre-existing conditions. A model of
maintenance expenditure on the Urumqi urban network (by class of road) was used to establish average
expenditures based on the pre-existing condition for the alignment compared with "as new" expenditures,
including work required on new Ring Road sections. This shows that total network maintenance
expenditure will be slightly reduced by construction of the Ring Road, except in years when major
maintenance is programmed for the Ring Road. This is assumed to be required in years 2013 and 2023 at

an economic cost of RMB 60 million per year.
Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
Ring Road Sensitivity Analysis. Reflecting possible risks in accuracy of valuations, implementation and
policy, five sensitivity tests were applied to the Ring Road analysis to confirm the robustness of the project:
Test 1: increasing construction costs by 20 percent
Test 2: reducing VOC and time benefits by 20 percent
Test 3: both increasing costs and reducing benefits by 20 percent
Test 4: disregarding all time benefits
Test 5: slower economic growth, with forecast GDP in 2015 not achieved until 2020 (average
annual growth in Urumqi GDP for 2004-2020 falls from 6.2 to 4.4 percent)
For Test 5 the benefits in the base case in 2015 were assumed not to be attained until 2020, with the loss of
benefit phased in over the period 2004 - 2020. The results of all the sensitivity tests are given below:
RMB billion
Test          EIRR          MIERR         NPV
Base          20.2          15.0          1.49
1             18.1          14.1          1.25
2             17.6          13.9          0.95
3             15.7          13.1          0.71
4             16.8          13.4          0.73
5             17.5          13.6          0.79
Ring Road Switching Values. Switching values and the probability of the switching values applying in
practice have been determined. A switching value is defined as that which would reduce the NPV at 12
percent to zero and result in an EIRR of 12 percent. The switching value for Ring Road construction cost
is +130 percent. The probability of such a cost increase is considered to be negligible and certainly well
below 5 percent. The switching value for VOC benefits is -78 percent. Again, the probability of benefits
falling so far short of the modeled level is considered to be slight and under 10 percent. The EIRR is above
12 percent with time benefits reduced to zero and there is no positive switching value for time benefits.
Negative time benefits have a zero probability.
Economic Analysis of Other Project Components. The Ring Road accounts for approximately 85
percent of the project's economic cost. The institutional development and environmental components
together account for approximately 5 percent and 3 percent is accounted for by maintenance measures and
funds held in reserve pending the results of the bus network optimization study. Remaining items account
for 7 percent. Of these, the benefits of ATC and signalization, junction channelization, the one-way
system, and public transport wireless communication system have been estimated. Insufficient data are
available on the benefits of bus priority, pedestrian improvement, enforcement and road user education, and
other safety measures for reliable cost benefit analysis.

Traffic Management
ATC and Signalization Benefits. These will reduce wasted green time at traffic lights, reducing the
number of stops and delays. It is assumed that on average the proportion of vehicles stopping will be
reduced from 50 to 45 percent, with an average time saving per set of lights of 2 seconds per vehicle.
Corresponding savings in VOC are estimated at RMB 0.1. The project measures are also assumed to
reduce vehicle accidents by 1.5 percent and pedestrian accidents by 0.75 percent. The initial year's
benefits from the investment of RMB 23.5 million based on 2004 traffic volumes are as follows:
RMB million
Item                         Benefit
Passenger time               2.52
VOC savings                  1.95
Accident reduction           0.04
Total                        4.51
Accident reduction benefits are based on local valuation reflecting property damage only, although
non-quantifiable personal safety benefits (including reduced fatality rate) will accrue to pedestrians and
other road users. The first year rate of return is a relatively high 19 percent.
Junction Channelization Benefits. Channelization will result in more disciplined traffic flow at
intersections. The average benefit per vehicle per site is assumed to be the same as for ATC and
signalization. The initial year's benefits from the investment of RMB 10.0 million at 21 intersections are
as follows:
RMB million
Item                         Benefit
Passenger time              0.84
VOC savings                  1.29
Accident reduction           0.04
Total                        2.17
The first year rate of return is 22 percent.
One-Way System Benefits. A one-way system in the central area will increase capacity at intersections
and improve the operating performance of the network in the area. The pairs of roads evaluated are:
Jiefang/Jiankang-Heping/Minzhu and Zhongshan. It is assumed that journey times would be reduced by 50
percent on the affected sections, with VOC reduced by 5 percent. One-way systems may increase
accidents, particularly in the initial period of operation, unless measures are taken to provide alternative
crossing facilities for pedestrians. However, the economic cost of additional accidents would be relatively
slight compared with the benefits. The first year's benefits from the investment of RMB 10.2 million are
estimated to be as follows:
- 57 -



RMB million
Item                        Benefit
Passenger time              2.60
VOC savings                 0.35
Total                       2.95
The first year rate of return is 29 percent.
Increase in Benefits 2004-2010. The combined impact of the above three measures was modeled for
2004 and 2010. The annual growth rate of economic benefits over the period was 5.7 percent.
Public Transport
Computerized Information System. The UPTC has relatively few computers, and most are old 386
models. Most tasks are still handled manually. A computerized information management system is
proposed which would include vehicle inventories and maintenance records, spare parts inventories,
equipment inventories, vehicle maintenance scheduling, and accounting, payroll, and financial reporting.
The system should also allow for capability to include centralized vehicle scheduling and dispatch at a
future date. Workstations would be provided at each bus company unit, linked via an on-line network to a
main server at headquarters. Software would be required for database management, statistical analysis,
finance management, vehicle technical management, material supply & warehouse management, and
personnel management. At an estimated cost of RMB 1.94 million, the proposed system would consist of
network severs, PCs including a laptop, and other equipment including scanners, printers, and fax
machines.
Comprehensive training will be required to ensure appropriate use of the system, including feedback into
improving management methods. Current annual administration wage costs total some RMB 7 million and
materials inventories are estimated at RMB 5 to 10 million (based on a tumover of RMB 30 million). A
5% reduction in these costs would yield an intemal rate of return of 22%, assuming a 5-year economic life.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
CHINA: Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project
Procurement
Procurement Capacity Assessment of Implementing Agencies
I .    The already established Project Executive Office (PEO) will be responsible for the procurement
activities of all components. The Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (WUTIP) is the first
World Bank financed project to be implemented by the PEO. The regional and municipal governments will
provide full support to the project through the Urban Construction Commission. Thus far, the procurement
of consultant services under the project is satisfactory. The PEO has gradually accumulated experience in
World Bank financed projects through project preparation and through procurement activities associated
with early construction of a section of the Ring Road under retroactive financing. As a govermnent
organization, the PEO has been fully authorized to implement the project. The responsibility and ethics
code for each level of the agency and its staff has been spelled out in their job description.
2.    With the assistance of an experienced procurement agent and of the regional highway agency,
regional and municipal constnrction commissions, foreign and local consultants and design institutes, the
PEO is expected to fulfill its procurement function and administer procurement in an efficient and
transparent manner. The PEO has given a commitment that the World Bank's procurement policies, rules
and guidelines will be strictly followed. In cases where there are discrepancies between local policy and
World Bank's requirement, the World Bank's policy will govern for the World Bank financed contracts.
Tlhere is no integrated national procurement law in China and the bidding law is effective from January 1,
2000. Overall, the risks in the procurement process are rated as average.
3.    In the regulations and administrative procedures issued by the central and local governments for
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using local funds, there are some inconsistencies with World Bank
requirements. The main inconsistencies are the use of bracketing and the merit point system in
prequalification, bid evaluation and contract award for locally funded NCB civil works contracts. They
will be waived in favor of World Bank NCB procedures in a supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement. In
this letter, Urumqi agrees to pay particular attention to ensure that the following procedures are followed
with respect to NCB procurement:
(a) all invitations to pre-qualify or to bid shall be advertised in a newspaper of national circulation
in the Borrower's country;
(b) such advertisement shall be made in sufficient time for prospective bidders to obtain
prequalification or bidding documents and prepare and submit their responses; and in any event a
minimum of 30 days shall be given to bidders between the date of advertisement in such newspaper
and the deadline for submission of bids, and the advertisement and bidding documents shall specify
the deadline for such submission;
(c) qualification requirements of bidders and the method of evaluating the qualification of each
bidder shall be specified in detail in the bidding documents;
(d) all bidders shall be required to provide security in an amount sufficient to protect Urumqi in
case of breach of contract by the contractor, and the bidding documents shall specify the required
form and amount of such security;
- 61 -



(e) the time for opening of all bids shall be the same as the deadline for receipt of such bids;
(f) all bids shall be opened in public; all bidders shall be afforded an opportunity to be present
(either in person or through their representatives) at the time of bid opening, but bidders shall not
be required to be present at the bid opening;
(g) no bid may be rejected solely on the basis that the bid price falls outside any standard contract
estimate, or margin or bracket of average bids established by Urumqi; and
(h) each contract shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder, that is to say, the bidder who
meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources and whose bid has been determined (i)
to be substantially responsive to the bidding documents and (ii) to offer the lowest evaluated cost.
The winning bidder shall not be required, as a condition of award, to undertake responsibilities for
work not stipulated in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as originally
submitted.
Procurement methods (Table A)
4.     Procurement will be carried out as shown in Table A. Arrangements have taken into account the
World Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit" (January 1995, and
revised in January, August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999) and Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, and revised in September 1997
and January 1999) as well as the experience gained from previous World Bank-financed urban
transportation projects. The documentation for procurement, which covers International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods was standardized for
Chinese conditions by the Chinese government and the World Bank on the basis of model documents which
will be used for all relevant procurement processes under the project. Where no model documents exist,
World Bank standard documents, such as the Standard Prequalification Document (SPD) for
pre-qualification of contractors (September 1999, revised March 2000) and the Standard Request for
Proposals for the selection of consultants, etc. would be used. As noted above, inconsistencies with World
Bank requirements in domestic NCB procedures will be waived in favor of World Bank NCB procedures in
a supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement.
Works (US$160 million)
5.     Civil works for the Ring Road are divided into 21 contracts, with an average size of US$8.3
million for ICB contracts, and US$4.4 million for NCB contracts. Pre-qualification of contractors is
required for ICB works contracts, but is not mandatory for NCB contracts.
6.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) (US$116.3 million). Fourteen contracts out of 21 civil
works contracts for the Ring Road will be procured with ICB procedures with an estimated cost of
US$116.3 million. These contracts will be bid on a slice and package basis; qualified firms will be allowed
to bid for more than one contract so as to attract international and large Chinese contractors. Contractors
for ICB contracts for civil works will be pre-qualified. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the
project was published in UN Development Business No. 518 on September 16, 1999. Specific
Procurement Notices (SPN) for the initial civil works contracts for the Ring Road and consulting services
required to supervise these contracts were published in UN Development Business No. 522 on November
16 and No. 523 on November 30, 1999, respectively. For the remaining civil works contracts for Ring
- 62 -



Road, invitations to bid will be advertised as specific procurement notices in UN Development Business
and well-known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide international circulation.
7.    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) (US$39.8 million). Other works, including 7 Ring Road
packages (US$30.6 mnillion), road network improvements (US$2.8 million), and the traffic management
program (US$2.9 million) and bus priority lanes (US$3.5 million) will be awarded following NCB
procedures acceptable to the World Bank. These works will involve contracts estimated to cost less than
US$10 million each. Since these contracts will be small, scattered throughout the city and implemented
over four years, ICB would neither be justified nor practical, but foreign firms will not be precluded from
bidding.
8.    Other - Force Account (US$3.9 million). Junction channelization (US$1.2 million) and Ring
Road greening (US$2.7 million) will be implemented by force account. For junction channelization, the
works are small and scattered in location and timing, and the works have to be constructed outside peak
travel times so as not to disrupt traffic. For Ring Road greening, the quantities of work involved cannot be
defined in advance. The works are small and scattered, and the works have to be done by special local
greening teams who know both the local climate and tree-planting in this special dry area. All items in
these two sets of works will be financed on an output basis, that is contracts will be paid against result of
works carried out.
Equipment (US$26.5 million)
9.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) (US$19 million). Contracts for goods and equipment
of more than US$200,000 equivalent up to a total amount of US$19 million will be awarded under ICB.
Domestic manufacturers competing under ICB will be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison
of bids of 15% for goods, or the prevailing customs duties, whichever is lower. ICB goods contracts are
mainly for: road maintenance equipment for both the Ring Road and other roads, pavement management
equipment, ATC facilities, other non Ring Road junction signal control facilities, and equipment for the
traffic command center, driver/vehicle management system, bus computer information system, vehicle
monitoring system, and the Inspection/Maintenance system.
10.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) (US$200,000). Items or groups of items estimated to cost
between US$50,000 and US$200,000 per contract package, with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$
200,000 would be procured following NCB. NCB will be used to procure equipment for a wireless
communication system, the vehicle pollution research center, and offices.
11.   International Shopping (IS) (US$400,000). Items or groups of items estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 per contract package, with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$0.4 million will be
procured following international shopping procedures on the basis of comparison of price quotations

Prior review thresholds (Table B)
15.   Prior review procedures will be used for:
(a) civil works contracts with an estimated cost of US$2 million or more (a total of
US$46.9 million); and
(b) equipment with an estimated cost of more than US$200,000 per contract (a total of US $19
million).
16.   This will apply to 92% and 89% of the total contract values of works and goods financed by the
World Bank, respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-review procedures would
be followed. All consultant contracts, terms of reference and single-source selections, regardless of the
value of the contract, will be subject to prior review. The sampling ratio for contracts not subject to prior
review is 14% for goods contracts.

Environmental Assessment and Action Plan
Background:
1.    O.D. 4.01 Environmental Assessment applies to this project since the meeting on the Project
Concept Document (PCD) was held on November 23, 1998. The project is classified category A since it
involves resettlement, major ring road construction partly on new alignment and increased air pollution and
noise, particularly adjacent to the ring road. As required by OD 4.01 for Category A projects, the
Environmental Assessment (EA) Report, Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and EA Summary report were
prepared by the Xinjiang Environmental Assessment and Techniques Center (XETAC), part of the
Xinjiang Environmental Monitoring Center (XEMC). The development and review of these documents
involved inputs from various local units, including the Urunmqi Environmental Monitoring Center (UJEMC).
Advice and support during preparation was provided by consultants funded from the Canadian Trust Fund
who participated in the Bank missions throughout 1999.
Disclosure
2.    The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) reviewed and approved the Chinese language
version of the draft EA in September 1999. Draft English versions of the reports were submitted to the
Bank in October 1999, and final versions in December 1999. The final EA Summary Report (and the RAP
Sunmmary Report) were made available to the public in Chinese and Uygur in early September 1999. The
final versions of the EA, EAP and EA Summary documents in Chinese and the EA Summary Report in
Uygur were made available in the Urumqi Public Library on December 5, 1999. A corresponding full set
of EA, EAP and EA Summary documents in English was sent to the World Bank Public Information
Center (PIC) in Washington, D.C. with authorization from UMG, on December 29, 1999. The appraisal
mission confirmed the availability of the EA in Chinese and EA Summary in Chinese and Uygur in
Urumqi. Tables 1-5 provide details of consultation and disclosure.
Brief Project Description:
3.    The major investment in the project is the creation of a 31.25 km urban ring road (involving 29
kilometers of new construction), including 8.3 km of elevated viaduct, 10.5 km of ground expressway, 9.6
km of urban arterial, a 450 m tunnel, and 9 interchanges (including Wuchang Interchange to be built by
Xinjiang Highway Bureau). The existing road will be widened from 16-50 m to 24-60 m and will have 4-6
lanes for motor vehicles in the main carriageways. With the exception of small areas at the interchanges,
the new road is constructed within the existing planning line (red line). The design driving speed is 60-80
km/hr. In the Road Network Improvement sub-component, sections (totaling 1.2 km) of Heilongjiang Road
and Tuanjie Road will be reconstructed with 4 lanes.
4.    Additional components of the project include: road maintenance equipment and studies, public
transport priority measures including improvements to existing bus terminals and market areas; traffic
management and road safety programs including development of pedestrian footpaths and crossings; public
transport operating systems including modemization of bus maintenance facilities and re-construction of a
communications and training center on an existing site; motor vehicle emissions control program including
a vehicle research center and improvement of existing inspection and maintenance facilities; systematic
management of urban transport; and technical assistance and training. Several investment items under the
- 78 -



public transport route network sub-component will be identified in detail following completion of proposed
route network studies.
Baseline Environmental Description:
5.     Based on air quality monitoring completed in October of 1998 (non-heating season) and January of
1999 (heating season), the existing air quality in Urumqi is poor. During the non-heating season, air
pollution results mainly from air-borne dust and motor vehicle emissions. The pollution allocation (or the
proportion of total pollution attributable to a specific parameter) of TSP, NOx, S02 and lead is 31%, 28%,
15% and 4%, respectively. These levels exceed standards for TSP and NOx but not S02 (levels of S02
are 33.3% of the standard). During the heating season, air pollution results primarily from coal
combustion. The pollution allocation of S02, TSP, NOx, CO and lead is 34%, 22%, 19%, 15% and 2%,
respectively. The rate of exceeding the standard for each is 100%. One chronic cause for the poor air
quality in Urunqi is the persistent inversion layer above the Urumqi City.
6.    Based on noise monitoring and modeling estimates, within 30 m of the roadside, the current rate of
exceeding the noise standards during the day and at night is 25% and 75%, with average excess of
0.1-0.8dB(A) and 2.6-10.2 dB(A), respectively. The exceedance at sensitive receptors such as schools,
hospitals and kindergartens is higher due to the more stringent standards, with the average of 5.1-14.4
dB(A) during the day and 2.8-16.1 dB(A) at night, respectively.
7.     Land use adjacent to the project is variable and includes agricultural areas in the west, the railway
station and business district in the south and a coal mining area in the northeast. The Ring Road is
basically a city main road; fauna is simple and the number and variety of wild animal and plant species are
low. Shade trees are present but sparsely distributed along the Ring Road and the area of public green
space and treed land is also low.
8.    The resident population is 252,900 within 300 m of the Ring Road. There are no important
cultural ruins or traditional cultural resources (other than mosques) within 300 m of the Ring Road. There
are a total of 339 units, including cultural and educational institutions, medical and health departments,
government organizations and recreational facilities along the alignment. Of these, 46 units are classified
as sensitive receptors including hospitals, schools, markets, dense residential areas and mosques.
Analysis of Alternatives:
Strategic Options
9.     Prior to project identification, the Project Executive Office (PEO) of the Urumqi Municipal
Govemrnment (UMG) solicited alternative design concepts from seven domestic design institutes, which
together developed 24 design concepts for the proposed Ring Road. These concepts provided background
material for the later preliminary design work.
10.   During the project preparation phase, the UMG leadership and transport agencies discussed
strategic choices to address the key sector issues of road capacity, public transport, traffic management and
management of the environmental impacts of motor vehicles. The need to invest in the expansion of road
capacity, particularly in a ring road, was examined in depth given that the North-South Hetan expressway
was recently built. Public transport altematives considered included investment in vehicles, in a new bus
depot, and more extensive bus priority measures, including a possible busway.
- 79 -



11.    Strategic Network Analysis (using a computer based transport model) was undertaken to identify
the need for a major investment and compare alternative investment programs to meet future demand. Five
networks modeled were:
A. The existing road network plus new links and upgrading planned to be in service in each
modeled year as per the Master Plan, but excluding the Ring Road (the "do nothing" or "do
minimum" base case).
B. Network A plus the whole Ring Road.
C. Network A plus limited upgrading of existing roads on the Ring Road alignment, together with
complementary improvements to other parts of the network, as a lower cost alternative to the
Ring Road.
D. Network A plus infrastructure to support bus priority measures on major arteries.
E. Network A plus a north-south light rail transit (LRT) line and feeder bus services with bus
priority measures on other corridors.
12.    Strategic Network Analysis results are detailed in Annex 4. For Network A ("do minimumn") in
2010, estimated volume/capacity ratios on key north-south corridors and CBD streets indicate congested
conditions under this scenario. The major investment in the Ring Road (Network B) improves this
substantially with the greatest increase as expected on the Ring Road corridor and the CBD. The major
public transport network E (LRT) produces small savings in vehicle kmn over Network B while improving
speeds in the CBD over those of Network A. Lower-cost alternative road network (Network C) and
bus-oriented public transport (Network D) scenarios also improved on Network A, but did not perform as
well on system performance indicators as Network B (Ring Road), due in part to the lower investment costs
associated with those options.
13.   Based on these tests, the network with the Ring Road (Option B) was selected for preliminary
design. For the purposes of economic evaluation, modeling was carried forward for an enhanced Network
A and Network B (Ring Road) only.
Ring Road Alternative Alignments and Design Standard Options
14.   In this context, the word "alternative" is used only to refer different alignments for a given segment
of road, while the word "option" is used to refer different road configurations or designs on the same
general alignment.
15.   Use of the transport model to test alternative junction layout and design standards was continuous
throughout the preliminary design process. A major outcome of the analyses of travel demand was the
reduction of roadway standards for the eastern and northern sections of the ring road alignment. Traffic
figures also informed decisions relating to the need for elevated sections, number of lanes, and interchange
layout and scale. Design changes are documented in the various Ring Road feasibility and modeling
reports as listed in Annex 8.
16.   Based on the engineering and environmental analysis, five segments of the Ring Road consist of
alignment alternatives (see Map 30808R). The alternatives for each segment are as follows:
- 80 -



Segmnent 1: Qiantangjiang Road - Tuanjie Road (south Ring)
A. Alignment of Qiantangjiang Road - Tuanjie Road (preferred)
B. Alignment in the south of Qitanjiang Road
Segment 2: Liudaowan-Wuchang Road (North Ring)
A. Alignment of Suzhou Road - Altay Road (preferred)
B. Alignment of Henan Road
Segment 3: East Karamay Road - Nanhu Road (Northeast Ring)
A. Alignment of Nanhu Road (preferred)
B. Alignment of crossing the coal mine area (surface road)
C. Alignment of crossing the coal mine area (elevated viaduct)
Segment 4: Altay Road - Wuming Road (northwest ring)
A .Alignment of crossing Heishantou by tunnel
B. Alignment of detouring Heishantou to the south
C. Alignment of detouring Heishantou to the north (preferred)
Segment 5: Xishan Road - Heilongjiang Road (Hongshanzui section)
A. Alignment of crossing Hongshanzui by tunnel (preferred)
B. Alignment of detouring Hongshanzui along Baoshan Road
17.   The preferred alignments were selected in each segment based on comparisons of environmental,
socio-economic and relocation and resettlement impacts. A full analysis of the altematives is presented in
the EIA report. In general, the alignment with the least impacts compared with other altematives in the
same segment was considered as preferred and incorporated in the project. Engineering related factors
were also evaluated during the comparison. The alignment of Segment 3 passes through the Liudaowan
community, and the alignment of Segment 5 through the Yamalike community. In both areas, and in order
to minimize impacts on the communities, refinements to the preferred alignment continued to be made when
preparing design options.
18.   On the basis of the comparison and selection of altematives and traffic volume forecast, four
design options related to the configuration, scale and complexity of the ring road were proposed on the
preferred alignment. One option, (referred to as option 4 in the project documents) had the least amount of
viaduct and expressway and was also the simplest in terms of engineering design. It was also considered to
have the least potential adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts. When all factors were
considered, including engineering considerations and traffic forecasts, Option 4 was selected as the
preferred design for the ring road. The ETA covers the detailed assessment for this option.
Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures:
19.   The major potential environmental impacts associated with the project and the mitigation measures
are outlined in both the EA Report and in the EAP. The EA Report concluded that the proposed project
would address emerging and projected traffic congestion in the city center, improve the quality of urban life
and stimulate economic development, resulting in both social and economic benefits. The report also
indicated there would be both positive and negative impacts on the environment.
- 81 -



20.    The EAP stipulates how the environmental protection measures identified in the EA Report will be
incorporated into the design, and implemented during the design, construction and operation phases of the
project and what institutional arrangements have been made to ensure their effective implementation. The
key elements of the EAP are sumrmarized below:
Key elements of the EAP:
Design Phase
21.    As described above, an analysis of two or three alternate aligmnents was undertaken on each of
five sections of the Ring Road by the project team including the EA team. Major alternative alignments are
shown on Map 30808R. A number of criteria were considered in the evaluation for each section including
length, road condition, planning width, as well as technical, socioeconomic, resettlement, implementation
and environmental factors and engineering costs. As well, four different design options were evaluated in
greater detail in order to select the final design configuration. During this process a variety of potential
environmental effects were avoided or minimized.
22.    A number of features to minimize noise effects have been incorporated into the design. These
measures include limiting construction of elevated viaduct to locations where road widening is not possible.
Construction materials for road surface structure with effective sound absorption will be applied in certain
areas to reduce traffic noise. In order to ensure traffic safety and minimize the traffic noise, green spaces
will be created to separate motor vehicles, non-motorized vehicles and sidewalks. Protection of some
residential buildings and sensitive receptors adjacent to the road will be accomplished with the use of sound
barriers. In order to minimize the sunshine obstruction by the barriers in certain locations, they will be
made of transparent materials and easily assembled and disassembled for regular cleaning. Double-glazed
windows will be utilized at special sensitive receptors, e.g. school, hospital and kindergarten, affected by
traffic noise. Comprehensive sound insulation will be implemented for the housing of the first row of
residential buildings affected by traffic noise, e.g., double-glazed windows in combination with cooling
systems.
23.    Structures and materials effective for vibration mitigation will be put into the joints between
pre-fabricated structures and bridge piers. Application of flexible supports, such as rubber and bowl
shaped supports for viaduct and interchanges will buffer vibration of structure and reduce noise. Road
surface quality also has a direct impact on vibration. The use of high quality materials for surface
smoothness and regular maintenance and repairs will be required.
24.    The shape of the elevated viaduct will be unified, harmonious and homogeneous so as to blend in
as much as possible with the existing visual environment. The existing dumpsite adjacent to Liudaowan
Road-Nanhu Road section will be landscaped to enhance its visual appearance from the road.
25.    The total greening area within the right of way (red line) is 227,600 m'. An additional 212,750 m
of trees will be provided as part of the Environmental Management Component of the project, meeting the
greening target of 30% of the area for new construction projects. The width of the treed area along the
sections in urban area will not be less than 2 m. In the farmland section of the West Guojin Road, the
width of shade trees will be at least 5 m with more than three rows, to meet the effect of a farmland shelter
belt.
- 82 -



26.    To ensure access, 18 pedestrian facilities are to be constructed along the Ring Road including 16
pedestrian overpasses. Two additional underpasses are also provided on the west side of Changjiang Road
and at the entrances of western Henan Road and Altay Road. At other intersections and the sections
adjacent schools, residential and commercial areas, signalized and unsignalized zebra pedestrian crossings
will be provided.
27.    Construction of a replacement for the Lanzhou Mosque will be completed prior to the demolition of
the existing mosque. Additional details related to resettlement along the entire project are provided in the
Resettlement Action Plan.
Construction Phase
28.    Dust will be generated during the course of demolition and large-scale excavation. Full-time
environmental protection staff will be inspecting sites and will be implementing dust control measures such
as the use of water or the enclosure of construction sites. Asphalt plants and concrete-mixing stations will
be located in designated areas only to minimize impacts. Vehicles transporting building materials (e.g.
cement, earth and stone) will be covered with tarpaulin. At construction sites where dust easily created by
mixing, loading and unloading of building materials, effective measures such as watering will be taken to
prevent or mitigate dust. The rubbish of workers will be stored in a closed site and will be disposed of
regularly. The location of temporary roads for construction will be kept away from residential areas and
other sensitive receptors. Proper operations, maintenance and repair of power generators and construction
machinery will be carried out to minimize emissions.
29.    The use of noisy machinery, such as percussion hammers, pneumatic drills and rock drills during
the night (00:00-08:00), will be strictly prohibited. Machinery with low noise and machinery with noise
shielding and/or sound absorption materials will be used as much as possible, e.g. on-site generator with
mufflers or silencer. Contractors will rationalize work timetable, keep noisy operations away from
sensitive points, carry out regular maintenance and repairs, and enforce strict implementation of operation
procedures. Where sites are seriously affected during construction, temporary enclosure with noise
shielding and /or sound absorption will be set up. Steam and diesel pile drivers are prohibited for use in
areas where sensitive receptors are within 50 m of construction sites. The construction components for
viaducts and interchanges will be prefabricated and transported to the construction sites. If on-site
monitoring results exceed standards, environmental inspectors or the Xinjiang Enviromnent Monitoring
Center will report this to the PEO, and the PEO will stop the construction for rectification. Contractors
must abide by the provisions for construction noise (vibration) prevention and control in Urumqi. It is
prohibited to use steam and diesel pile drivers as well as monkey driver at the project site. Except for
emergency engineering, the operation of strong vibration machinery is limited to 08:00-00:00. Low-level
vibration machinery will be used as much as possible and a system of regular maintenance and repairs is to
be employed. UMG has undertaken to place all mitigation requirements in the contractual documents for
construction contracts.
30.    At construction sites where public toilets are not available, temporary toilets and sewage collection
and appropriate disposal will be provided. Restoration of the sites will be carried out once the construction
is finished.
31.    Environmental inspectors will ensure the irrigation and flood-relief canals will not be affected.
Construction vehicles will be driven on the designated temporary roads. In areas near cultivated land and
orchards, dust-proof measures will be implemented. Surplus earth and stone will be collected and disposed
of at designated sites only. In the Yamalike hills section, abandoned earth and stone generated during
- 83 -



tunneling will be relocated and not stored on slopes. Surplus earth and stone will be will be used as much
as possible for fill. If the contract sections can not be constructed simultaneously, surplus earth and stone
will be temporarily stored at designated sites and ultimately disposed of in the coal mine. Retaining walls
and drainage ditches will be established on hills on both sides along cut and fill sections. Erosion control
measures will be implemented.
32.    Feasible measures for traffic management will be determined prior to construction by the PEO in
consultation with the traffic police. Project supervisors will cooperate to avoid traffic congestion due to
construction. As well, the public will be notified in advance. When carrying out construction in front of
schools, the contractor will appoint specific persons to guide the pupils safely through the construction site.
Overhead safety shelters will be installed when the construction is in residential and/or commercial areas.
Separate roadside construction will be adopted for road widening in order to provide safety to both
pedestrians and vehicles.
Operational Phase
33.    Relative to the without-Project case, the project will result in the degradation of the air quality
within 200-300 m of the alignment, but will make a positive contribution to the overall air quality in the
urban area, particularly in the city center. Since it is not feasible to mitigate the deterioration in air quality
only along the alignment, a Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy has been incorporated into the project
(see Component D Environmental Management). The objective is to build on existing initiatives being
undertaken in Urumqi, and to develop strategies and provide a strong foundation for a program to address
the problem of increasing air pollution from mobile sources. The program will integrate a number of
initiatives including the ban on leaded fuel; an enhancement of the existing vehicle Inspection and
Maintenance (I/M) system; increased use of altemate fuels; improvement of laws and regulations related to
vehicle emissions and their more rigorous enforcement; accelerated retirement of older vehicles; further
development of public transit and traffic management and the expansion of the automated monitoring
network to monitor air pollution.
34.    The control plan and objectives for vehicle noise will be formulated by Urumqi Environment
Protection Bureau (UEPB) and the standard for motor vehicle noise will be gradually increased. The
system of regularly inspecting motor vehicles for noise will be undertaken by UEPB in cooperation with
traffic police. Vehicles exceeding the standard will have to be repaired. Driving speed will be strictly
enforced, particularly at night. Pavement and noise barriers will be maintained regularly. The Municipal
Land Administration and the Municipal Planning Bureau will implement proper planning and land use
along the road. The distance between the first row of buildings and the Ring Road red line must not be
less than 20 m and must incorporate a vegetation buffer in the newly developed and redeveloped areas.
Sensitive uses such as schools, hospitals and kindergartens will not be pennitted in the first row of
buildings along the Ring Road. Within 100 m of the red line, land use will be restricted to commercial
facilities, parking lots and other insensitive uses. Land use sensitive to vibration, e.g., hospitals and
institutions using precise instrumentation will not be permitted within 40 m of the road.
35.    With respect to the impacts on sunshine, home owners on the first floors of the four buildings
affected by elevated viaduct will have priority access to municipal programs designed to convert the
residences to commercial enterprises. Reasonable and proper land use planing will be implemented to
gradually adjust the function of affected buildings. For newly constructed buildings distance from the
viaduct must be a minimum of 14.7 m.
- 84 -



36.    As required by local regulations, proper licenses must be obtained from the municipal transport
administration for the carriage of dangerous goods. When transporting explosives or dangerous chemicals,
the carrier must obtain a transport license from the police. The State Law of Environmental Protection
stipulates that when accidents occur, the responsible organization must take measures at once, notify the
affected organization and residents, report to local environmnent department and related departments and
undertake an investigation. According to the stipulations in laws combating water and air pollution, spills
of dangerous goods are handled by the police, the municipal environment department and the traffic
management department. Vehicles for transporting dangerous goods must be driven on specially
designated routes rather than on the Ring Road unless they have obtained a special permit.
Environmental Monitoring:
37.    The EAP identifies requirements related to the environmental inspection and monitoring program.
Environmental inspectors will be assigned for each civil works contract to respond to unanticipated
environmental concems and will ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures and compliance with
established standards (e.g., noise and dust). Environmental monitoring will also be undertaken by XEMC
during both the construction and operation phases to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation measures and to
determine the accuracy of impact predictions. Parameters to be monitored include air quality, dust, noise
and vibration. The project includes an environmental training component for contractors and inspectors.
The staffing and training plan is presented in the EAP.
Public Consultation:
38.    Public Consultation was implemented in two stages: the first between August 1998 and June 1999
and the second between June and September 1999. A variety of techniques were utilized including: site
visits; surveys (including the distribution of questionnaires, letters, and phone interviews); public meetings;
the distribution of pamphlets (in Chinese and Uygur) giving an overview of the project and indicating the
availability for review of the draft EA Summary in both languages, and the announcement of the second
public meeting. Advertisements were also provided in both languages in local newspapers and on radio.
As well, a phone hot line was established for telephone inquiries in Chinese and Uygur related to the
project. Table 4 provides further details.
First Round (August 1998 - June 1999)
39.    During the initial phase of consultation 57 institutions, 10 residential committees and 6 mosques
were surveyed by site visits (including 162 people), and 72 phone interviews were conducted. In all more
than 200 questionnaires were distributed and 145 responses were received. In addition, 3 official letters, 2
documents with official seals and 187 telephone responses were received. The initial public meeting of the
first stage was held in Urumqi Construction Commission on Dec. 28, 1998. The meeting was attended by
40 representatives from the environmentally sensitive receptors (schools, hospitals etc.), residential areas,
villages, sub-district offices, residential committees, enterprises and institutions (such as Transport
Company and Liudaowan coal mining area). Two reporters took part in this public meeting. In the public
meeting, the objectives and proposals for the project were presented. Potential environmental impacts
(including resettlement) and the related mitigation measures were discussed in general.

Second Round (June - September 1999)
40.    Starting in May 1999, the availability of the preliminary EIA reports was announced both in
Chinese and in Uygur in Metropolitan Consumer Morning and Urumqi Evening papers. Two telephone hot
lines were established and also announced to the public. The public was invited to make inquiries related to
the EIA by telephoning or visiting either the PEO or the EIA team. In addition, the EIA Summary report,
in both Chinese and in Uygur was distributed to each residents' committee. More than 800 pamphlets
summarizing the project were distributed along the Ring Road. The project team made 17 site visits in
total along the Ring Road and visited sensitive receptors to review options for environmental protection.
The project content, alignment and its environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures were
introduced to local residents during on-the-spot meetings.
41.   A second public meeting was organized by the Urumqi Construction Committee on September 24,
1999. Over 140 representatives of the sensitive receptors, the resettlement department, the District People'
s Congress and the government agencies attended this meeting. In this meeting, the alignment, construction
scale and schedule of the Ring Road were reviewed. Issues related to both resettlement and the
environmental impacts and protection measures along the Ring Road, particularly at the residential area
and sensitive locations, were discussed in detail.
Future Consultation
42.   Future public consultation will also be held at the district level. These meetings will be focused on
ensuring the people most affected by the project are made aware of the mitigation measures to be
implemented. It has been agreed that these meetings will be held annually, at least two months in advance
of construction, in the areas where construction is to take place each year. The results of these meetings
will be documented in the annual monitoring reports. There will also be signage posted at each
construction site, which will provide phone numbers for information or inquiries related to the construction.

Additional
Annex No.: 12
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Introduction:
1.    This annex reviews adverse impacts related to land acquisition or changes in land use for the
Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (WUTIP), and the arrangements proposed in the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to mitigate them. Consistent with World Bank Operational Directive 4.30
on Involuntary Resettlement, the objective of resettlement planning is to ensure that incomes and living
standards are improved, or at least restored, for all persons adversely affected by the project.
Project Composition:
2.    The proposed UUTIP consists of five components:
A.    Road Network Development, mainly of an urban ring road;
B.    Traffic Management and Road Safety;
C.    Public Transport - reform and development;
D.    Environmental Management; and
E.    Institutional Development - Urban Transport System Management.
Only the road network development component will involve land acquisition and resettlement. The road
network development component includes creation of a 31.25 km. urban ring road and improvements to
several connecting roads in Urumqi. All of the resettlement-related impacts in the project will be caused by
construction of the ring road.
Resettlement Impacts:
3.    UUTIP will require 510 mu (34 hectares) of new land area (along with use of 2,013 mu, or 134
hectares, of existing right-of-way). This includes acquisition of 197.5 mu (about 13 hectares) of rural land,
of which 100.8 mu (about 7 hectares) is cultivated, and transfer of 312.5 mu (about 21 hectares) of urban
land-use rights. Acquisition of cultivated land will directly affect 53 households (218 individuals).
Structural demolition is expected to total 151,207 square meters, including 57,615 square meters of
residential housing. A total of 854 households (3,492 individuals) will need to be relocated. A total of 835
enterprises or work units will be affected by non-residential demolition or loss of land, but no one will
permanently lose employment. In terms of community irnpacts, one mosque will require relocation and
road construction will temporarily disrupt access to comnuunity facilities in some locations.
4.    Urumqi is ethnically diverse. About 31% of the households to be relocated are members of
minority nationalities, and road construction will affect iwo predominantly minority areas - Yamalike and
Liudaowan. Measures have been taken to ensure that is$sues of potential concem to minority households
have been addressed (see Annex 15 for additional details).
Legal and Policy Framework:
5.    The legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement planning includes national, provincial and
local laws and regulations. Relevant national laws or regulations include the Land Administration Law
(1998), City Planning Law (1990), and The Administrative Regulation on Urban Building Demolition and
- 90 -



Relocation (1991). The State Land Administration Law was revised in 1998 and became effective January
1, 1999. Revisions to the XUAR Implementation Regulation of the State Land Administration Law to
accord with the new State Law are still in draft form. The RAP devised for this project will therefore be
implemented in accordance with the prevailing 1989 XUAR regulation. The most relevant municipal
regulation is the Urumqi Municipality Administration Regulation on Urban Building Demolition (1995).
6.    In China, all land officially designated as urban is owned by the state, and all cultivated rural land
is owned by village collectives. As a result, there are two types of land acquisition for this project. One is
to acquire collectively owned rural land, with compensation and other forms of assistance provided to the
collectives losing the land. The other type of land acquisition is to acquire land use rights within the urban
built-up area. In this case, the acquiring agency or unit must provide adequate compensation or
resettlement housing for the displaced families and affected enterprises. For UUTIP, both types of land
acquisition are involved.
7.    When collectively owned farmland is acquired, the future land user pays compensation for land,
loss of crops and attached properties, and a resettlement subsidy for the rehabilitation of affected persons.
Following the revised Land Administration Law, the land compensation will be 6 - 10 times the average
annual output value per mu for the three years before land acquisition. The resettlement subsidy,
determined according to the number of agricultural population to be resettled, is usually an additional 4-6
times (but is not to exceed 15 times) the average annual output.
8.    Young crop compensation and compensation for affected structures or other fixed assets are paid
directly to individuals. The land compensation and resettlement subsidy is to be paid to the collectives
losing the land. This compensation is to be used for production development, non-farm employment and
income generating activities for the affected people. With village members' prior approval, it can also be
used for improving community facilities or services. By law, separate accounts on resettlement
compensation are to be kept at each affected village, with financial reports provided annually to the next
higher level of government.
9.     Those affected by urban demolition are to be compensated through property rights exchange, direct
asset replacement, cash compensation, or some combination of such compensatory measures. While no one
is expected to lose employment permanently, some persons will lose wages or profits for a transitional
period. They are entitled to transitional wage or profit support. Additionally, the project affects renters of
residential or commercial space as well as owners. They also will be provided with transitional support
and other forms of assistance necessary for them to re-establish themselves.
Compensation Standards:
10.   Based on analysis of replacement value for various categories of affected assets, a set of
compensation standards have been adopted for WUTIP.
11.   For cultivated land, the compensation rate (including both land compensation and resettlement
subsidy) is set at 24 times the average annual output value for the past three years. Specifically, the
compensation rates are to be 36,000 RMB per mu (or about US$66,000 per hectare) for vegetable land,
33,000 RMB per mu (or about US$60,400 per hectare) for irrigated land, and 39,000 RMB per mu (or
about US$71,300 per hectare) for orchard. For non-cultivated land, including housing plot and wasteland,
a flat rate of 15,000 RMB per mu (or about US$27,400 per hectare) will be paid to the affected villages.
- 91 -



12.    For affected structures and facilities, compensation standards are as follows:
Items                        Unit           Compensation Rate (RMB)
1. concrete frame structures    (mi)               670
2. brick /concrete structures    (mn)              530
3. brick /wood structures   (mi)                   500
4. wood/tile structures      (in)                  460
5. simple structures         (mi)                  180
6. wall                      (m)                   50
7. standing crop             mu                    1,500
8. residential moving subsidy   household          200-250
9. unit moving assistance   (mi)                    10
10. temporary transfer      per person/month       50
Rehabilitation and Relocation Planning:
13.    Because WJTIP is situated primarily in an urban area, major project-related impacts are associated
with structural demolition, meaning that the major mitigation measures are associated with relocation. No
one is expected to lose employment permanently in urban areas affected by the project, so rehabilitative
efforts are focused primarily upon the relative few households affected by acquisition of cultivated land.
As is common in China, those losing land will be accommodated through collective land redistribution.
The affected villages will use compensation to identify and pursue productive investment opportunities.
Initial investment plans made by affected collectives emphasize agricultural intensification and bringing
wasteland into production.
14.    Relocating rural households (55 households) will be given house compensation at replacement cost
with no depreciation, and salvageable materials will belong to them. They also will be provided with
alternative housing plots by their villages. Relocating urban households living in public rental units (278
households) will be provided with replacement rental housing units of similar size and improved quality.
Urban private house owners (480 households) will be provided with three options, including replacement
housing with ownership right, full compensation for lost housing plus the right to rent replacement housing
at low rates, or double the compensation rate for lost housing if the affected household accepts full
responsibility for its own relocation. Those renting private houses (41 households) can continue lease
agreements with their current landlord after resettlement, or the project will assist them in locating another
place.
15.    The project will affect 181 households lacking legal residency status or living in illegal structures.
In local practice, such households are not considered eligible for compensation or other forms of assistance.
To meet Bank policy requirements, however, the Uruimqi municipal government adopted a special policy to
provide such households with eligibility for modem public rental housing at highly subsidized rates. In
addition, they will receive 50% of compensation rates for illegal structures.
16.    For affected enterprises or work units subject to structural demolition, three options will be
provided. They can choose to receive replacement space with ownership, rental space plus full
compensation for lost structures, or double compensation if they choose to make their own relocation
arrangements. Affected work units using rented space can continue present arrangements if the landlord is
able to rebuild the lost commercial space, or they are to be provided equivalent replacement rental space at
equivalent rates by the project.
- 92 -



17.    The project also will affect public infrastructure. Compensation based on replacement value will
be paid to the relevant government agencies or local governments to restore the affected infrastructure and
services.
Institutional Arrangements:
18.   Implementation responsibilities are shared between the UUTIP Project Executive Office (PEO) and
the local district or county governments. A Resettlement Leading Group has been formed to bring together
leaders from relevant municipal departments, districts or county governments, and the PEO. This group is
responsible for making policy decisions, coordinating implementation, and resolving any issues that arise.
19.    Under the leading group, a 5-6 person Project Resettlement Office (PRO) is to carry out routine
resettlement activities. Their responsibilities range from organizing the census of affected persons, and
training local field staff, to supervising disbursement of compensation and monitoring resettlement
progress. The PRO will supervise the activities of district-level workers involved in resettlement
implementation.
Community Participation and Public Disclosure:
20.    Municipal and district officials, as well as project design staff, have consulted with potentially
affected communities in identifying resettlement impacts, formulating resettlement policies, and preparing
resettlement plans. In addition to numerous informal consultations during site selection and other aspects
of project preparation, preparation of the RAP included a census-survey of 100% of potentially affected
households, a supplemental sample survey of households lacking residency permits, and other consultative
activities. Additional opportunities for residents to voice concerns regarding project impacts and
resettlement arrangements occurred as a result of the environmental assessment process. Consultations
have contributed to minimization of impacts and identification of mitigation measures acceptable to the
affected persons. Major shifts in alignment, alteration of arrangements for pedestrian or non-motorized
vehicle access and other changes in project design have been made at least in part as a response to
residents' concerns.
21.    Additional consultations will be undertaken as resettlement arrangements are finalized in the
Liudaowan area prior to initiation of civil works. Road construction in this area is not scheduled to occur
until 2003. The proposed road alignment remains subject to review because of technical siting constraints
in an area under use for coal mining. Additional consultations also will be undertaken in other areas if
warranted by other significant changes in project design.
22.    Detailed information regarding the project and the resettlement program has been published in local
newspapers, in both Uygur and Chinese. As required by Bank policy, an earlier draft RAP was made
available in September 1999. The draft RAP in English was received by the Bank prior to appraisal, and
discussed with UMG during the appraisal mission in January 2000. Uygur, Chinese, and English versions
of the project RAP were made available to the public at the Urumqi Public Library in January 2000 (and
any future revisions will be disclosed in a similar manner). The RAP in English was received by the Bank
on February 4, 2000, and after clearance, was sent to the PIC on March 1. In addition to formal RAP
disclosure to the Urumqi public, the project office will provide separate resettlement information booklets,
in Uygur and Chinese, to households to be affected in each year's construction season. The booklets
provide information regarding the projected timetable, compensation standards, rehabilitation measures,
and other aspects of implementation of direct relevance to affected persons. Grievance procedures also
- 93 -



have been established.
Resettlement Cost and Implementation Schedule:
23.   Based on preliminary data, the U'UTIP resettlement budget is estimated at US$44.2 million,
including monitoring costs and contingency allowances. Estimated resettlement costs are included in the
project budget. The project owner has agreed to bear all resettlement costs, even if they exceed budget
estimates.
24.   Based on the proposed project timetable, resettlement implementation for UUTIP will be carried
out in five years between 1999 and 2003. To ensure effective resettlement implementation, all
resettlement-related activities are to be accomplished at least one month prior to commencement of
construction in any given area.
Monitoring and Evaluation:
25.   Resettlement implementation will be subject to both intemal and extemal monitoring. The PRO
will be responsible for submitting intemal monitoring reports to the Bank every six months. External
monitoring will be conducted by a team that is to function independently of the project owner. External
reports, to be submitted to the PEO and the Bank every six months, will review whether implementation is
in compliance with RAP terms, and will evaluate the adequacy of resettlement measures in improving or
restoring incomes and living standards.

Annex No.: 13
Review of Financial Management System
(This Annex is an edited and updated version of the Review in the Project Files, less Attachments 2 -4)
I.    Background
1.    Scope/Objective of Review of Financial Management System. This report is the result of a
financial management review and analysis of the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (the
Project) to determine whether the Project has in place an adequate financial management system as required
by the Bank OP/BP 10.02. The review was perforned in accordance with the Guide for Review and
Design of Accounting and Reporting System for World Bank Projects (Prepared by COSU in December,
1997) and the Review of Financial Management System as stipulated in Annex II of LACI (Loan
Administration Change Initiative) Implementation Handbook. The task team has discussed and reviewed
with Regional and Municipal Finance Bureaus, Project Executive Office and participating agencies of the
Project, procedures and guidelines for establishing a sound project financial management system, including
staff/training, accounting, internal control, reporting requirements, auditing and budgeting.
2.    Project Objective. The objective of the proposed Project is to develop Urumqi's urban transport
system as a means to facilitate the future growth, economic development and expansion of the city, and
serve the development needs of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, while improving the quality of life within
the city.
3.    Project Status/Schedule. The Project was appraised in January 2000. The implementation period
of the Project is scheduled to run approximately 5 years.
II.    Organizational Structure/Institutional Arrangements
4.    Organizational Structure/Institutional Arrangements. The overall responsible agency for the
Project is Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project Executive Office (PEO). The PEO will report to
a 'Leading Group', headed by the Vice Mayor of the Urumqi Municipal Government, and comprised of 21
persons representing 18 agencies (Vice Secretary of Urumqi Municipal Government, Municipal
Construction Commissions, Municipal Planning Commissions, Director of PEO, Governor of Urumqi
County, General Manager of Urumqi Public Transportation Company, Vice leader of Urumqi Transport
Police Sub-Department; and the following 1 1 Municipal Bureaus: Finance, Planning, Land, Public
Security, Urban Construction, Transportation, Horticulture, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Statistic,
and Environment Protection). The Project implementation will be undertaken at the Urumqi municipal
level, involving five agencies; Urumqi Municipal Engineering Bureau, Urumqi Public Security Bureau,
Urumqi Public Transport Company, Urumqi Public Environment Bureau, and Urumqi Planning Bureau.
In terms of project administration support, Project Management Offices (PMOs) will be established at each
of these agencies.
5.    The financial accounting and reporting aspects of the Project are to be handled by the PEO and
Regional Finance Bureaus (RFB). The Regional Finance Bureau's Finance Division will be responsible for
the monitoring, maintenance and reconciliation of the Special Account, for checking and monitoring
withdrawal applications and verifying that payment requests meet Bank requirements. Funds will flow
from the Bank to RFB/PEO through on-lend arrangements and then onto vendor/contractors or PMOs.
- 96 -



The Financial Department of the PEO has been set up and will report both to the Directors of the PEO and
the Municipal Finance Bureau (MFB). The Financial Department of the PEO will be responsible for
collecting all the supporting documents, monitoring contract payments, and preparing payment requests
before submitting to the RFB. The RFB will further verify, approve and process these documents before
submitting to the Bank for disbursements. (See Attachment 1 for Project Organization Chart)
6.    Institutional Experience with Bank-Financed Projects. The RFB has had substantial previous
experience with Bank-financed projects and is familiar with existing disbursement, procurement, financial
reporting and auditing requirements. However, the PEO and participating agencies are new to working
with Bank projects. Therefore, training on financial management will be arranged for staff from the PEO
and implementing agencies (see Section VII for details). To date, the RFB has managed about 5
Bank-financed projects (e.g. Tarim Basin Agricultural Development, Tarim Basin II, Xinjiang Agricultural
Development, Xinjiang Provincial Highways, Xinjiang Highway II).
IIL    Project Structure and Costing
7.    Financing and Cost Sharing. The financing of the project will be supported by IBRD (US$ 100
million) and Government financing (US$ 150 million) for a total estimated project cost of US$ 250 million.
The government financing is to be provided through municipal finance budgeting.
8.    Loan Agreement Categories. These will include: civil works, goods, consultant services and
training. The amounts and percentages of loan allocation will be discussed during appraisal and finalized
during negotiations.
9.    Project Components. The Project is comprised of the following five components:
A. Road Network Development, mainly of an urban ring road;
B. Traffic Management and Road Safety;
C. Public Transport - reform and development;
D. Environmental Management; and
E. Institutional Development - Urban Transport System Management.
IV.   Internal and Other Controls
10.   Project Financial Management Systems Manual (FMS Manual). The objective of the FMS
Manual is to document the operational procedures and guidelines for project financial management
encompassing all levels of project management (i.e. RFB, MFB, PEO and implementing agencies). The
scope of the manual will encompass project financial management structure and staffing (e.g. organization
chart and job descriptions), identification of the accounting standards to be used by the Project and all
implementing entities, project reporting formats and procedures for cash management, asset management,
procurement and disbursements, counterpart fund management, budgeting and auditing. A draft FMS
Manual as been prepared and provided to the Bank. A final version will be agreed by project launch and
issued to all relevant staff who are involved with accounting and financial management.
11.   Laws/Regulations. The administration, accounting and reporting of the Project are required to be
set up in accordance with the following regulations/circulars as issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF):
a. Circular #12: "Regulation for the Submission of Withdrawal Applications" issued Dec. 1996 -
includes detailed procedures for preparing and submitting withdrawal applications and retention of
supporting documentation.
- 97 -



b. Circular #127: "Temporary Regulations on Financial and Accounting Management for Projects
Financed by the World Bank" issued in 1993 - provides the basis of accounting treatment for
project activities and guidelines for project financial management.
c. Accounting Law issued January 1985 with subsequent amendments - includes job
responsibilities for cashiers and accountants and financial management recording and reporting
requirements.
d. MOF Agreement - An agreement has been reached with MOF on a standard set of financial
statements to be used by World Bank projects. This agreement supersedes the previous MOF
Circular #6: "Temporary Regulations on Financial Management Reporting for Projects Financed
by the World Bank" issued January 1997. The format of the financial statements included in this
MOF Agreement package is primarily based on the Construction Accounting Standard noted in 12
below.
12.   Standards. The Construction Accounting Standard issued by Construction Department, MOF for
construction oriented projects dictates the format of financial statements, chart of accounts and related
instructions which would therefore affect project accounting and reporting requirements.
V.    Project Accounting Standards, Financial and Management Reporting
13.   Accounting Standards. The accounts will be prepared in accordance with the Circulars and laws
noted in section IV above on an accrual accounting, double entry bookkeeping basis in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards. The Chinese accounting standard applied to infrastructure projects is very
close to, and in some areas more demanding than the International Accounting Standard (IAS). Circular
# 127 issued by the Ministry of Finance and referred to above is modeled after the principles of the IAS.
The Circular provides more in depth instiuctions to assist in keeping detailed records of project accounting
activities.
14.   Project Reporting. Clearance has been received from MOF on a standard set of project financial
statements which will be utilized by this project. hi terms of reporting cycle, the Project financial
statements (see Attachment 2 in the Project File for formats) will be submitted to the Bank bi-annually and
include the following five statements:
I.     Statement 1:  Balance Sheet;
2.     Statement 2-1: Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds by Project Component;
3.     Statement 2-2: Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds by Project Component;
4.     Statement 3:   Statement of Implementation of Loan Agreement; and
5.     Statement 4:   Special Account Statement.
Each of the implementing agencies will be managing, monitoring and maintaining their respective
financial reports. Project accounting and reporting will be done by the Financial Department of the PEO.
Discussions with Financial Department of the PEO staff have indicated that bi-annual financial statements
will be submitted to the Bank before April 15 and October 15 each year.
- 98 -



15.   Counterpart Funding. Counterpart funding is to be provided by the following:
(a) Urban construction and maintenance tax;
(b) Land use surcharge;
(c) Water resources fee;
(d) Drainage fee;
(e) Urban public facility surcharge;
(f) Tax/minibus operating bid charge;
(g) Additional urban population fee;
(h) Urban surcharge;
(i) Road donation fee; and
() Urban construction fee.
Each year, the Municipal Construction Commission will prepare a budget and send it to the Municipal
Government for approval before being submitted to the MFB. The MFB will provide their contribution to
the Project, based on the budget submission, and deposit these funds into accounts managed by the
Financial Department of the PEO. Procedures used in the budgeting process are detailed in the FMS
Manual and will be used as a guide for all parties involved.
VI.   Special Account, Disbursements and Supporting Documentation
16.   Special Account. The one Special Account under the Project, to be held in U.S. dollars, will be
managed by the Project Officer, Finance Division, Regional Finance Bureau. The Project Officer will
check and monitor withdrawal applications and verify payment requests to ensure that they meet Bank
requirements. Corresponding RMB bank accounts for Special Account related transactions will be held at
the Financial Department of the PEO and will be managed by the Accountant to review and prepare
payment requests. (See Attachment 3 in the Project File for a Flowchart of Receipts of Bank Funding.)
17.   Disbursements and Supporting Documentation. The originals of the support documentation and
copies of each withdrawal application will be maintained by the Financial Department of the PEO. In
addition, necessary copies are maintained at the RFB. (In terms of disbursement application processing
and clearance procedures, please refer to Attachment 4 in the Project File.)
VII.  Staffing and Training
18.   Staffing. As noted in Section II, the financial/accounting staff at PEO and implementing agencies
do not have experience with prior Bank projects and accordingly are not familiar with the Bank's
procedures and requirements. Consequently, well-designed and focused training will be arranged by the
RFB to provide training to all relevant staff to ensure personnel of quality commensurate with job
responsibilities. In addition, the Bank will provide as and when needed training in project financial
management. In terms of experience, the PEO has enrolled a Chief Accountant, (who has a Chinese CPA
and has worked in a Accounting Firm for about 5 years), another CPA who will be responsible for
accounting and four other staff who are licensed accountants. Furthermore, as all accountants operating in
China are required to be licensed by the Financial Bureaus based on years of experience, performance and
uniform examination, this requirement will be met by all implementing Accountants and Cashiers. (This
requirement is documented in the FMS Manual.)
- 99 -



19.   Training. It is suggested that training should be arranged for all relevant staff at the PEO, and the
PMOs on the following:
(a) Bank procedures and requirements on the withdrawal of Bank funds;
(b) Project financial statement formats;
(c) Project Financial Management Systems Manual; and
(d) Project audit requirements.
This training should be arranged by the Regional Finance Bureau and the PEO before project
implementation. In addition, the Bank will provide as and when needed training in project financial
management.
VIII. Audit Arrangements
20.   It is the Bank's requirement that annual project financial statements be audited in accordance with
standards acceptable to the Bank. In line with other Bank financed projects in China, the Project will be
audited in accordance with Govemmental Auditing Standards of the People's Republic of China (1997
edition). The Regional Audit Bureau will be responsible for auditing both the Project and implementing
Agencies. The audit will be scheduled for submission to the Bank within 6 months after the end of the
calendar year.
IX.   Budgeting
21.   Project level budgeting will be incorporated with the preparation of the counterpart fund budget, as
noted in Section V.
X.    Issues/Proposed Actions
22.   Financial Management Systems Manual. As noted in Section IV, a draft Manual has been
prepared and reviewed by the Bank. Before project implementation, this Manual should agreed and be
issued to all relevant staff who are involved with accounting and financial management.
23.   Training. As noted in Section VII above, staff at the PEO and implementing agencies should
receive training on the following:
(a) Bank procedures and requirements on the withdrawal of Bank funds;
(b) Project financial statement formats;
(c) Project Financial Management Systems Manual; and
(d) Project audit requirements.
This training should be rendered at the Project Launch Workshop and/or before project effectiveness. (See
Attachment 5 in the Project Files for Proposed Action Plan.)
XI.   Conclusion
24.   The financial management team has determined that the Project will satisfy the Bank's financial
management requirements as required by OP/BP 10.02. In terms of disbursement procedures, the Project
will be disbursing based on the traditional disbursement techniques and will not be using PMR-based
disbursements, in accordance with the agreement reached between the Bank and the China Ministry of
Finance.

Annex No.: 14
Socio-Economic Survey
Introduction:
1.    As its name indicates, the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (WUTIP) includes a set
of activities to improve traffic and transport management in Urumqi, a city of about 1.9 million people and
capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
2.    Urumqi has an ethnically diverse population. While local ethnic minorities constitute a substantial
portion of the population in many areas throughout the region, they represent only about 27% of the
population of Urumqi. Of this population, Uygurs account for 12.7% of the total, Hui account for 9.5%,
Kazak account for 3.2%, Man account for 0.5%, Mongol account for 0.4%, Xibe account for 0.2%, Russ
account for 0.2% and Uzbek account for 0.1%. The local ethnic minorities defined as "minority
nationalities" in the Chinese administrative and legal system - are predominantly Muslim, and most speak
one or more Central Asian languages.
3.     Since project inception, the UUTIP task team has been mindful that special efforts may be
necessary to ensure that project activities do not impose cultural-specific hardships on one or more ethnic
minorities, and otherwise do not aggravate ethnic relations. The task team has undertaken a consultative
social assessment process and other measures to review potential adverse impacts (and opportunities for
improved service) as a result of proposed public transport reform activities. This annex reviews the results
of the socio-economic survey for public transport.
Objectives:
4.     The consultative social assessment was intended to supplement separate social and economic
analyses during project preparation. The objectives were:
a)     To assess the differential travel characteristics (pattems, needs and attitudes) of vulnerable
group populations compared with the general population. The purpose of this analysis is to
identify the potential ways in which these groups may disproportionately benefit or suffer
disbenefits from the project. The study should also identify strategies as needed to ensure
distributional equity within the broader project design.
b)     To the extent that vulnerable groups are more dependent on public transport, study the
affordability of existing public transport (defined as articulated, regular and mini-bus) services for
these groups, and explore their willingness-to-pay for improved services. This analysis will assist
in analyzing the fare increase issues and service improvement proposals in order to support the
design of the public transport reform and development component.
5.     The Study's Draft Final Report was completed in October, 1999 and the report was finalized in
April 2000. Preliminary results are presented below:
- 103-



Geographical Distribution:
6.     The main centers of minority population are concentrated in Tianshan District, Uraumqi County and
Saybagh District:
(% share of total minority population in District, % share of District population which is Minority)
1. Tianshan District (28.7%, 30.3%)     2. Saybagh District (19.9%, 23.3%)
3. Xinshiqu District (12.6%, 17.8%)            4. Shuimogou District (6.5%, 24.2%)
J. Toutunhe District (7.4%, 28.5%)      6. Nanshan Mining District (0.3%, 7.2%)
7. D)ongshan District (4.0%, 19.0%)     8. Urumqi County (20.6%, 55.4%)
7.     Transient populations are concentrated in Saybagh (long-stay transients) and Tianshan
(short-stay), (the railway station and bus stations are also situated in these districts). The analysis of the
poorest (persons who receive the "Lowest Life Guarantee" fund) show their concentrations in Saybagh
District and Tianshan District. The poor also reside in Nanshan Mining District and Shuimogou District.
- 104 -



Income and Expenditure:
8.     Household economic status is closely related to household size:
Notes:
1. The household population and household income of transient population in different categories are
calculated based on the population living in Urumqi City.
2. "General" refers to permanent and non-poor population.
3. "Han" refers to permanent, non-poor Han population.
Transit Demand (by group):
9.     Apart from minorities, where usage of public transport is generally in line with the general
population, it appears that there is higher usage of public transport amongst women, the transient
(especially the labor contingent) and the poor. The majority of people are satisfied with current public
transport services. In fact, compared with the general population, it appears that vulnerable groups
surveyed are more satisfied with existing public transport. However, they feel that bilingual services are
limited and need improvement.
10.    However, public transport coverage, choices and services appear to be worse in outlying areas
where there are higher concentrations of vulnerable group populations, e.g. Yamalike (minority, transient)
and Dongshan (poor) districts. Specific issues relating to on-street operations of buses were also cited as
needing improvement.
Minorities: Minority usage of public transport is generally in line with the broader population,
though there are variations in usage patterns amongst minority groups. Service coverage is low for
some Uygur neighborhoods (Yamalike area). Minority transport expenditures are likely to be more
burdensome (due to larger family sizes for a given income among Uygurs and longer than average
bus trips taken by Huizu) but not prohibitive. Cultural factors appear to be a more significant
factor in the choice of public transport modes (cheap bus vs. higher-priced minibuses) than
economic status. About half of the minorities surveyed are willing to pay more for improved
services, in particular for comfort and more access to seats.
Transient Population: The transient population should be analyzed as two groups: laborers and
other non-permanent populations (business travelers). Laborers are more likely to take buses and
walk than the general population. The ratio of transport expenditure to income is highest for
- 105 -



transient populations, reflecting the importance of transportation to their livelihood activities. In
interviews, 60% of respondents were willing to pay more for improvements such as speed, comfort
and seats.
Women: Women's average income and access to cars and motorcycles is lower than men's; among
the poorest, there is a higher proportion of women than men. For all trips, women are more likely
to walk or take buses than men, while men are more likely to use taxis, bicycles and company
minibuses. Women also have a higher transfer rate and travel with children more frequently than
men. In terms of public transport usage, women are more likely to take cheaper regular and
articulated buses than men. They also appear to have less on-board access to seats than men.
Controlling for income and sex, cultural factors appear to influence the choice of public transport
vehicles. Minority women are more willing to pay for higher-priced (minibus) services than Han
women; the opposite is true for Han and minority men. Overall, about 50% of women were willing
to pay for improved services.
Poor: It is difficult to identify the poor. The approach of using social safety net welfare rolls is
too narrow, even for identifying the poorest (less than 1%). From the limited data collected in this
study, there was evidence of measurable relationships amongst the vulnerable groups: e.g. high
share of labor portion of non-resident populations is poor; women represent a higher proportion of
the poorest; minority households earn lower than average incomes. In general, the poor have a
lower trip rate and are more captive to walking than the general population. They depend on the
cheapest buses (articulated or unit-owned) and are more likely to experience longer wait times.
The poor seldom use bicycles. Few of the poor are willing to pay more (for both existing and
improved transit services); however if there were no choice, they would want shorter wait times.
Affordability of Public Transport Fare Increase:
11.   Almost a third (28%) of the groups surveyed would accept a fare increase today (without
accompanying service improvement), but the majority (65%) would oppose a fare increase alone, as they
feel current fares are a fair price for the services offered. Amongst minorities, women and transients, there
is some willingness to pay for improved services (see above) although respondents were skeptical about
that improvements would actually be made. Thus, any fare increase should be modest and should be
implemented in tandem with comprehensive network improvements and reform of the organization of the
public transport sector, taking into account relative differences in the pricing of services in different
markets (and resulting likely mode shifts).
12.    Generally, the poor are not willing to pay more for public transport services. If fares are raised, it
is recommended that subsidies to the poor should be given directly to users (rather than to operators) and in
a measurable form in order to prevent discrimination. These recommendations will be further studied and
incorporated into TA on public transport reform and finance.
Conclusion:
13.   These findings confirm the importance of public transport and traffic management measures to
ensuring equity in project design. To the extent that improvements are made to pedestrian and public
transport systems, surveyed groups will benefit as much as or greater than the general population. Public
transport fare increases should continue to be considered in conjunction with meaningful reform and service
improvement proposals.

14.   The design of project components is consistent with Study findings (including proposed TA on
urban transport policy, road user safety and public transport network improvements). Sub-projects to
improve public transport access and facilities at the Railway Station and Hongshan Market will
particularly address the needs of all surveyed groups whose residential patterns appear to be highly
concentrated and overlapping in the Yamalike area (Tianshan and Saybagh Districts).
15.   The Study was completed in April 2000. Follow-on studies are proposed to further investigate
gender and poverty issues. Some funding has been obtained.

Additional
Annex No.: 15
Ethnic Minorities
Introduction:
1 .    Urumqi, a city of about 1.9 million people and capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
(XUAR), is ethnically diverse. Since project inception, the UUTIP task team has been mindful that special
efforts would be necessary to ensure that project activities do not impose cultural-specific hardships on one
or more ethnic minorities, and do not lead to ethnic tensions. This annex reviews steps taken during project
preparation to assess whether any ethnic minority would be subjected to any group-specific hardships, to
consult with potentially affected members of minority groups regarding their concerns, and to ensure that
adequate attention is paid to treatment of ethnic minorities during project implementation.
Ethnic Minorities in Urumqi:
2.     While ethnic minorities constitute a majority of the population in many areas of XUAR, they
represent only about 27% of the population of Urunmqi. Of this population, Uygurs account for 12.7% of
the total, Hui account for 9.5%, and Kazakh account for 3.2%, with smaller proportions of 42 other
minorities also living within the city.
3.     Statistical diversity only presents part of the complexities of the multi-ethnic city. The Uygur, Hui,
Kazakh, and other ethnic minorities are officially designated as "minority nationalities" according to the
Chinese administrative and legal system. But there are many differences among minority nationalities.
Many minority nationalities are Muslim while others are not. In some areas, minority nationalities live in
concentrated communities while residential patterns in other areas of the city are more interspersed. Some
groups, notably the Uygur, have a different language and script. The Hui, by contrast, speak standard
Chinese and use Chinese script.
4.     The vast majority of city residents have one thing in common, however: they or their parents have
migrated to Uruniqi over the last few generations, and have adapted in many ways to Urumqi urban life. In
this Urumqi context, members of ethnic minorities do not participate in the full range of customary social
and political institutions that they have elsewhere in Xinjiang or China. As urban residents, moreover, they
would be expected to share in the benefits derived from public infrastructure or public service
improvements.
5.     Minorities such as the Uygur, Hui and Kazakh are officially designated as "minority nationalities"
in the Chinese administrative and legal systems, and are afforded special protections and privileges under
Chinese law where they live in "concentrated communities." Because OD 4.20 suggests that country
legislation can provide a prelimninary basis for determining groups to which the policy is targeted, the Bank
has tended to view all of the 55 officially designated "minority nationalities" in China to be "indigenous
peoples" for initial identification purposes.
Sequential process to determine the applicability of OD 4.20:
6.     Because of the presence of Uygurs and other groups that are treated as minority nationalities under
Chinese law, the task team was aware that it would need to consider whether the safeguard provisions
contemplated under OD 4.20 should apply to the project. The following sequential process was used to
determine the applicability of OD 4.20 on a project specific basis.
- 108 -



7.     First an examination was made as to the degree to which the people potentially affected have the
characteristics set forth in paragraph 5 of OD 4.20. The OD acknowledges that no single definition can
capture the diversity of indigenous peoples, but suggests use of five identifying characteristics. Reviewing
these in the Urumqi context results as follows:
(a)    "Close attach'ment to ancestral territories and to the natural resources in these areas." The
Urumqi urban area was never ancestral to the Uygurs, the Kazakh or the Hui. Most minority
residents affected by the project have migrated to the city during the last half-century, rather than
historically inhabiting the area.
(b)    "Self-identification and identification by others as members of a distinct cultural group."
Without doubt, the Uygur, Kazakh and the Hui so identify and are identified.
(c)    "An indigenous language, often different from the national language." This is true for the
Uygurs and Kazakhs, but not for the Mandarin-speaking Hui.
(d)    "Presence of customary social and political institutions." For the Uygurs and others, many
social institutions retain their customary strength (kinship, communal associations, etc.) but not
their political institutions.
(e)    "Primarily subsistence-oriented production." Clearly not. Furthermore, in the two Uygur
ethnic neighborhoods most directly impacted by the project (specifically the ring road), the majority
are migrants from agricultural areas of southern Xinjiang currently working as miners, petty
entrepreneurs, and wage laborers.
8.     While the minorities of Urumqi are clearly ethnic, the above review of the defining characteristics
gives only an equivocal answer. While these ethnic minorities display some of the required characteristics,
other characteristics are missing. However, the OD also enjoins the exercise of "judgment in determiining
the populations to which this directive applies." Thus the task team found that it was necessary to consider
other criteria.
9.     The second criterion applied was to examine if there are significant impacts on distinctive
cultural or economic ways of life. The task team has concluded that no such impacts can be expected to
occur:
*   Where acquisition of cultivated land affects members of minority nationalities, they are already
members of multi-ethnic locales. Rehabilitation measures are the same for all residents.
* The project does not affect herding areas, natural resources, or any income-earning
opportunities upon which minority nationalities rely.
*   The project does not appear to affect cultural institutions or practices (apart from three
mosques impacted by the project which received special attention), and there is no reason to
believe that it may do so.
*   Relocating households will get new housing and are likely to enjoy improved living standards.
* In consultations to date, members of minority nationalities have primarily been concerned with
terms of resettlement, and not with cultural or ethnic sensitivities.
Based on this analysis, the task team concluded that affected members of the minority nationalities
were to be affected as individuals or households, in the same ways as other residents in the project area.
- 109-



The minority nationalities are not affected by this project in any way that makes them vulnerable to
specific, group-based hardship as an ethnic group or ethnic community.
10.    The third criterion considered was the ability of affected minority residents to assert their
interests and rights. The task team also concluded that, although minority nationalities may sometimes be
restricted in their capacity to defend their interests, especially in politically sensitive circumstances, the
members of minority nationalities potentially affected in UUTIP have been able to assert their interests and
nghts in the many fora provided by the Bank and the project authorities, and are represented at different
levels of the project management team and local government. Relevant documents have been disclosed in
Uygur and Chinese, and local languages have been employed in the solicitation of minority residents'
views. Bilingualism and delivery of information in Uygur and Chinese is official UMG policy. Continued
consultations during project implementation have been agreed with UMG, are set out in the RAP, and are
covered by the Legal Agreement.
11.    Based on the process set out in paragraphs 7-10, the specific circumstances of this project, and
from the perspective of prior Bank practice, the task team concluded that the Uygur people in the
Liudaowan and Yamalike neighborhoods of Urumqi, as well as the other ethnic minorities in Urumqi
affected by the project, are not covered by the provisions of OD 4.20. However, the task team was aware
of the need for sensitive and prudent treatment of issues regarding minority nationalities, even though OD
4.20 does not apply to the project.
Description of Components Likely to Affect Ethnic Minorities:
12.   UUTIP consists of five components:
A. Road Network Development, mainly of an urban ring road;
B. Traffic Management and Road Safety;
C. Public Transport - reform and development;
D. Environmental Management; and
E. Institutional Development - Urban Transport System Management.
Only Components A and C are likely to have any direct adverse impact on individuals or communities,
including members of ethnic minorities.
13.   The development of a 31.25 kilometer urban ring road will affect Urumqi residents primarily
through demolition of structures on land required for road use. In all, 854 households will be required to
relocate to new residences. Of the 854 households, 261 are members of ethnic minorities. The proportion
of ethnic minority households to the overall number of households (31.9%) is slightly above the proportion
of minority households in the overall Urumqi population (about 27%). A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
has been prepared by the borrower, and provides an adequate basis for mitigation of all identified adverse
impacts (Details are given in Annex 12).
14.   The public transport component will consider potential improvements to system efficiency. The
component could lead to fare increases, route changes, bus stop changes, route frequency changes and other
changes that would affect individual members of ethnic minorities, along with the general population. A
socio-economic survey and public consultations were carried out from April to September 1999. Initially,
these exercises were intended to assess whether reform activities could systematically disadvantage one or
more minority groups. In the design phase, however, the survey and consultations were broadened to focus
on travel characteristics, attitudes and preferences of four demographic segments of the population:
minorities, transients (non-resident), women and the poor. Results are discussed in Annex 14.
- 110-



Actions Regarding Impacts and Issues of Concern to Minority Nationalities:
15.   Extensive consultation (as described in Annexes 11 & 12) was carried out in the preparation of the
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Documentation and consultation
was in spoken and written Uygur as well as Chinese. The documentation and the consultations provided
the opportunity for minorities to make informed judgments and to express their views.
16.   A socio-economic survey (described in Annex 14) was undertaken to examine the travel patterns of
vulnerable groups (including ethnic minorities), and to assess the affordability of existing public transport
services and proposals for fare increases. Measures to address concems raised in these surveys including
upgrading bilingual on-vehicle services, are being incorporated into the detailed design of the Component C
Public Transport of the project. It has been agreed that these measures will be monitored annually.
17.   For Component A Road Network Development, planning and design of the ring road sought to
minimize bifurcation of communities and impacts on culturally sensitive buildings (specifically mosques),
avoid sensitive areas (specifically Muslim cemeteries), and ensure continuity of pedestrian access.
Particular care was taken in the predominantly Uygur community of Yamalike and the mixed Uygur and
Han community of Liudaowan, where sections of the ring road are not based on existing roads.
18.   Civil works for the ring road improvement will require demolition of one mosque (Lanzhou
Mosque in Jinyingda Road) to the east of the CBD. The present mosque, housed in a former commercial
structure of no cultural or architectural significance, is overcrowded. In consultations with the mosque
council, a relocation site has been agreed, and compensation will be sufficient to build an improved
structure with a larger holding capacity. Mosque leaders have indicated to the resettlement planners, to the
Bank task team, and to the international anthropologist (see below), that they are pleased with the
relocation site (close to the existing mosque) and the prospect of a larger, more modem facility.
19.   A review of potential impacts was undertaken by an international anthropologist with extensive
China experience mid way through project preparation. The review confirmed that these impacts had in
general been adequately addressed but that continuing attention should be paid to the horizontal and vertical
alignment and design of the ring road in the Yamalike area and in the vicinity of mosques, and to provisions
for mitigation of adverse impacts in these locations.
20.   Later in the project preparation, community screening was undertaken by an independent national
consultant, (advised by the international anthropologist) as a check on the ethnic communities potentially
affected by the construction of the ring road. This screening confirmed that Yamalike was the most
affected area, but that a small ethnically mixed community in the Liudaowan area was also affected.
- 111 -



Yamalike:
21.   The Yamalike area is a largely squatter settlement on a hill in the south of the city, and to the west
of the CBD. It is bounded on the north by Nanliangpo Road, on the east by Baoshan Road, and bifurcated
by the railway (see Map IBRD 30808R Road Network Improvements). It was identified early in project
preparation as an ethnically sensitive area. The railway and the proposed ring road pass through the
community partly in tunnel. As a result there has been extensive consultation, as listed in the table, and
discussed below.
(a)    Two Yamalike resident committees were interviewed during development of terms of
reference for the environmental assessment in mnid-1998. At that time, the proposed alignment
skirted Yamalike Mountain rather than tunneling through it. As this alignment would have led to
substantially more residential and commercial displacement, attention at these interviews focused
largely on resettlement issues.
(b)    A small-scale questionnaire was distributed in the Yamalike area, asking respondents to
consider the proposed aligrnment and an altemative tunnel design that would have emerged through
a minority graveyard.
(c)    Yamalike residents were invited and participated in a first environmental assessment public
meeting, in December 1998. As the proposed alignment at the time of the meeting continued to go
around Yamalike Mountain, concerns from Yamalike residents raised at the meeting focused on the
necessity of displacement and resettlement terms. In addition to discussion at the public meeting,
these issues also were raised by Yamalike residents utilizing the telephone hot-line established
during the project preparation process.
(d)    Yamalike households were surveyed again in August 1999 regarding housing built without
requisite permits and the appropriateness of resettlement measures for residents in such structures.
All but one of the 24 households included in the survey were minority households.
(e)    A second public meeting was held in September 1999, again with Yamalike residents in
attendance. As the present tunnel alignment had been chosen by this time, in part to minimize
resettlement elsewhere in the Yamalike area, no Yamalike issues arose at this meeting.
22.    These consultations provided input to several major redesigns that were undertaken of the ring road
through the area. There were adjustments to both the horizontal and vertical alignment in order to reduce
land take and mitigate adverse impacts. The objective was to bring the road as close as possible to the
existing rail line in order to minimize additional community severance and to reduce the resettlement and
environmental impacts. The existing access road into the area is to be upgraded with a bridge across the
ring road, so as to maintain community movements to the existing elementary school and mosque, and to
allow bus services to penetrate the area. The existing local Guangming mosque is retained, and pedestrian
access to the mosque is maintained. Adjacent to the mosque the road is in cutting to lower noise level
impacts.
23.    The project will affect households lacking legal residency status. RAP policy terms require
equitable treatment of unregistered residents, regardless of ethnicity. Following consultations with affected
residents, a scheme to provide replacement housing with modem services (the present site lacks running
water) and improved public facilities on subsidized terms has been devised. In addition, households
- 112-



between the ring road and the railway and cut off from the rest of the community are to be resettled, even
though their houses are not physically affected. Residents have indicated to resettlement planners, to the
Bank task team, and to the international anthropologist, that they are satisfied with resettlement
arrangements.
Liudaowan:
24.    Liudaowan is the north east of the city. It is on the edge of a coal mining area. The preliminary
alignment of the ring road in this location was not selected until late in project preparation (as is customary
in road projects where alignments change during preparation). As a result, no specific consultations
(beyond those undertaken for resettlement planning or environmental assessment purposes as shown in the
table) were undertaken during project preparation. Additional consultation is necessary. This additional
consultation will occur early in project implementation, to permit the results to be fed into the final design
process for the ring road.
25.    Since part of the ring road alignment in this area was not on existing roads, as part of the design
process, care has been taken to reduce impacts on communities. Urban arterial road standards have been
adopted (in lieu of expressway standards used elsewhere). These provide a normal urban main road cross
section, with at grade pedestrian crossings and therefore less physical impact. As described in Annex 1 1,
ring road planning included the identification of several altemative alignments (in conformity with the
Master Plan). These were compared on technical, environmental, and social grounds before selecting the
proposed preliminary alignment, to minimize resettlement and impacts on communities, and to avoid areas
affected by coal mining.
26.    The alignment selected appears on aggregate best able to best satisfy all criteria, and is designed to
avoid the local mosque. For most of its length, this alignment is through open space, but it includes a 100
meter section through a community containing a mix of minority groups and Han. Resettlement of 31 Han
and 34 minority households, currently living in substandard housing to higher standard housing close to
their existing location is included in the project.
27.    This section is to be built in year 4 of ring road construction (2003). The technical, environmental
and social aspects of the proposed alignment and mitigation measures required will be evaluated in detail as
part of the final design process. Environmental and social review of the design will be jointly conducted by
Chinese authorities and the Bank.
Continuing Consultation and Monitoring:
28.    Arrangements have been made to continue consultations throughout project implementation in the
two predominantly Uygur neighborhoods affected by ring road construction. Consultation with individual
households on details of resettlement will be undertaken by the project resettlement team starting 12 months
before the scheduled start of construction activities. Community consultation will be undertaken early in
project implementation by independent local consultants. They will be guided by the independent national
expert (advised by the international anthropologist) who undertook the community screening. Activities
related to resettlement of members of minority nationalities will be included among subjects covered under
independent project monitoring. Resettlement and development of transport reform strategies will be
subject to direct Bank supervision.

Annex No.: 16
Project Summary Technical Analysis
Project Preparation
1.    Technical assistance. The technical capacity of local institutions in Urumqi and Xinjiang
Province was limited, and so the PEO required significant technical support for project preparation. Early
in the process, 1 1 person-months of TA over a 4 month period financed through Japanese Consultant Trust
Funds provided technical support for traffic model development and road network planning and in the
initial scoping of the traffic management and public transport components. This was followed by transport
modeling and preparation of domestic feasibility Studies by domestic consultants (funded partly through a
PHRD grant) whose skills were developed through TA provided under the two Shanghai Metropolitan
Transport Projects. These studies were in tum followed by comprehensive PHRD-funded technical
assistance and training (12 person-months over a 4 month period) for the economic evaluation of the
project, the further design of the traffic management and public transport components, and the preparation
of the PIP. Separate assistance finded by Canadian Trust Funds provided training and support to local
agencies on the environmental aspects of the project throughout preparation.
2.    Transportation Planning. Local capacity in transportation planning was somewhat developed
from recent implementation of the Hetan Road urban expressway project, and work with Tongi University
in 1993 on modeling for initial work on the updating of the Master Plan. However, due to limited scope of
the modeling, and the age of the data, the PEO agreed to develop a new travel demand model, to generate
traffic forecasts and to evaluate project benefits. City-wide home-interview and traffic surveys were
undertaken in 1998. Technical planning issues focused on questions of model structure and planning
assumptions, including projections of motor vehicle fleet growth. Several of these assumptions were later
tested in sensitivity analyses under project economic evaluation. The World Bank provided direct technical
assistance to the Shanghai City Comprehensive Transport Planning Institute (SCCTPI) which undertook
the modeling.
Road Network Development
3.    Ring Road. The technical approach for this component began with traffic projections which
indicated the need for major investment in transport network capacity to meet future travel demand,
particularly in the Northwest-Southeast direction and in the CBD. Analyses of the current major highway
facilities, including Hetan Road and provincial highway network also indicated the need for a high-capacity
distribution network to support development plans to the north and west of the city. Although the Ring
Road had been identified in the Road Master Plan, altematives were considered, both strategically (in terms
of other possible major network investments) and via standard altematives analysis of the "preferred"
investment (alignment, layout, scale, and standards). Altematives considered are described in Annex I 1,
Environmental Assessment and Environmental Action Plan. Strategic network tests are summarized in
Annex 4: Economic Analysis.
4.    Section-by-section technical analyses of the preferred altemative were performed on a continuous
and iterative basis using technical judgment and current modeling techniques. This approach - which
balanced a design's financial cost and impacts (land take, enviromnental impacts) against traffic volumes
and system benefits - was used as a means to "right-size" the facilities in lieu of full economic analysis of
each design option. To conduct a full cost-benefit analysis of each design option would have required
- 115-



extensive modeling of project benefits (in terms of travel time and vehicle operating cost savings), the time
and financial cost of which was considered prohibitive by UMG. Technical review resulted in revisions to
the horizontal and vertical alignment, scale, layout and lane configurations of each section of the Ring
Road, as well as specifications of construction design, method and materials. Technical work is
documented in the various Ring Road Feasibility and Modeling Reports and Mission Aide-Memoires (see
Annex 8).
5.    Other Road Network Improvements. Since 1995 Urumqi has undertaken a major roadway
upgrading program to bring arterial and secondary roads up to a new pavement and geometric standard.
This component addresses the needs of the 2000-2005 upgrading program. For later years, this work will
be carried forward in the proposed Transport Network Development Program Study.
6.    Road Maintenance. Technical analyses of road maintenance included review of the road network
by functional class; local estimates of road condition (85% of arterial and secondary network is considered
in good condition); and the organization, efficiency and financing of maintenance activities. The Municipal
Engineering Management Bureau oversees a number of Maintenance Units organized by geographic area
and type of facility. Maintenance Units are contracted to implement mutually-agreed annual maintenance
plans for a given budget. Due to inadequate funding levels, however, nearly all the maintenance units find
it necessary to engage in privately contracted work to supplement government funding to complete the
annual maintenance program.
7.    Present methods of maintenance planning and programming are limited, relying on semi-annual
visual inspections and technical judgment. Work planning by the maintenance units is conducted only on
larger rehabilitation projects and periodic maintenance work. Routine maintenance work follows an
established procedure. Administrative and financial systems are inefficient and labor-intensive.
Maintenance methods tend to be labor intensive with minimal use of equipment, which generally require
upgrading. Many of the work crews involved in small maintenance works include a large percentage of
women.
8.    Actual maintenance expenditure is estimated at an average of 4.1 RMB/sq. meter for all roads.
Expenditure by road category is estimated as: Arterial (5.5 RMB/sq. m.); Suburban (secondary) roads (3.5
RMB/sq. m.); Expressway (4.5 RMB/sq. m.); and Local Roads (2.5 RMB/sq. m.). These unit costs
suggest an annual road maintenance budget (excluding drainage, green space, etc.) in the order of 34
million RMB based on the total road area. Road maintenance funding in 1998 was approximately 23
million RMB as provided by the Engineering Management Bureau to the Arterial and Suburban
Maintenance Units. These maintenance units are engaged in some commercial work to earn additional
revenues to supplement funding from government contracts. The Expressway Maintenance Unit funds its
maintenance from tolls collected from expressway users. The other four Maintenance units receive their
maintenance funding from a combination of Municipal and Local Government funds.
9.    The analysis provided an insufficient basis for identifying the maintenance budgets that would be
required on long term basis to meet internationally accepted standards, with efficient operations. The
maintenance management systems to be implemented in the project will assist in defining the budget needs.
Actual budget allocations based on these needs will be the subject of discussion during the annual review of
the project.
- 116-



Traffic Management
10.   The technical approach to the design of this component was mindful of the constraints within the
sector, including:
(a) lack of a comprehensive approach and coherent traffic management policies and
strategies (there is no single agency responsible for traffic management);
(b) little experience or expertise in traffic management, planning and design;
(c) focus on vehicle flow and enforcement; and
(d) reactive problem solving stance (limited prevention practices).
As elsewhere, ownership of new ideas is fairly strong for new technologies, but less so on lower-cost
methods and planning strategies. Within this context, a "bottom-up" and collaborative approach between
the TA consultants and the local team was adopted focusing on junction channelization, signalization, bus
priority measures, accident and parking research.
11.   Junction Channelization and Signalization. In addition to city-wide traffic surveys, traffic
counts including turning movements were undertaken in support of channelization and signalization
schemes at 43 intersections. Channelization schemes included extensive consideration of pedestrian safety
as well as efficiency of motor vehicle movements. One pelican crossing (mid-block signalized pedestrian
crossing) will be piloted in the project.
12.   Bus Priority Measures. On-board bus surveys were undertaken in support of a 6 km. pilot
scheme on the Youhou Rd.- Yangzijiang Rd.- Changjiang Rd. corridor which has passenger flows of over
100,000 passengers per day. These were complemented by stationary observer surveys to cross-check
data. The technical work stressed analysis of the locations and causes of delay, and the siting and design of
bus bays (double width leading to bus lane). This work involved pioneering collaboration between UPSB,
UPTC, and UMEB, and will be carried forward through the inter-agency traffic management group to the
proposed bus route network and priority studies.
13.   Parking and Accidents Research and Analysis. Road accident analysis and parking studies will
focus on data collection and analysis, toward the implementation of pilot programs.
Public Transport
14.   Analysis was undertaken to determine current levels of demand and supply of services (by UPTC
bus and minibuses and non UPTC minibuses); costs, efficiency and cost recovery of UPTC operations;
sector finances and the current licensing and regulatory arrangements for service provision. Extensive
discussions were held with UMG to determine the existing policy framework and proposed changes, and
with UPTC to determine their business development strategy, and with both UPTC and UMG to detail
reform measures under consideration. UPTC proposals for sub-components were analyzed in terms of
cost-effectiveness and support for reform. Further studies to support reform and refine the sub-components
are proposed in the initial years of the project, including: the refinement of public transport regulatory
policies, the future route network, and the UPTC 5 year Corporate Plan. Provision has been made in the
component for additional bus priority measures (or other investments to support UPTC reform) to be
identified by these studies. The studies will be one of the topics of discussion at the annual review of the
public transport sector strategy.

15.   Baseline air quality and noise monitoring and modeling of alternative future scenarios (including
with and without project cases) were used to evaluate the project and determine environmental impacts and
mitigation measures. Project preparation also involved training on and development of Urumqi's Motor
Vehicle Emissions Control Program. Further details are provided in Annex I 1.
