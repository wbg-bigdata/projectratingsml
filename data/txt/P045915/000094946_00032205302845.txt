RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter I
Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Brief Description of the Project
Urumqi is the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. For a long
time, because of the terrain limitation, the Urumqi urban transport is blocked
from north to south and crowded from west to east; a large quantity of. long
distance and quick transport is not available, and the across-boundary
transport is difficult; the density of the traffic is uneven in which the south-
west and the south-east part is comparatively denser and the north-east part
is comparatively thinner so that it is hard to drive to the north-east district
and quite a long way to make a detour; the trunk road network is low in
technique and poor in transport capacity. The existing transport
infrastructures can't accommodate the need for urban development. so
improving the Urumqi urban transport constitute a task which brooks no
delay. The proposed Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project will
make the traffic smooth by extending the road network and improving the
traffic management so as to increase road network transport ability. The
Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project consists of five components:
*  Road Network Development
*  Traffic Management and Road Safety
*  Public Transport
*  Environment Protection and Improvement
*  Urban Transport System Management
Among these components, only the Road Network Development Component
will involve certain amount of land acquisition and resettlement. The Road
Network Development Component is designed specially to link old CBD to
1



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 1
new development areas of the city, to protect the CBD from extraneous traffic,
and to distribute regional traffic to the urban trunk road network. The
Project will include the construction of a 30.66-km high-capacity urban ring
road based of existing road structures, and improvements of a number of
connecting roads in the central city of Urumqi.
According to the new alternative (design option 4). The western ring (Western
Transition Road), the southern ring (Xishan Road. Baoshan Road,
Qiantangjiang Road), and the eastern ring (Tuanjie Road, Jinyin Street,
Donghuan Road, Wuxing Road, Qidaowan Road) of the outer ring road will.
be designed to use the standards of the urban expressway, and the design
vehicle speed is 80 km/h. And the northern ring (the planned Xinvi Road,
Nanhu Road, Suzhou Road, Altav Road) of the outer ring road will be
designed to used the standards of the urban principal trunk. and the design
vehicle speed is 60 km/h.
The total length of the whole route will be about 30.66 km. in which about
8.55km for the overhead roads, about 0.373km for tunnel, about 10.169km for
the surface expressway, about 10.568km for the urban principal trunk. The
length of the built Qiantangjiang Road interchange and Suzhou Road
interchange is about 1.0km.
The techno-economic feasibility study for the Project was jointly prepared by
the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute and the Xinjiang
Highway Prospecting Design Institute, and the report was submitted in April
1999.
Since the Project involves the expansion of the existing right of way, certain
amount of land acquisition and resettlement will be required. Following the
World Bank requirements, a feasible Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be
2



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 1
needed for the Project before the World Bank decides whether or not to
finance the Project.. The RAP of the Project is strictly prepared in accordance
with both the requirement for the Involuntary Resettlement from the World
Bank and the related requirements of all the Aide-memoire for the Project
from the World Bank.
1.2 Methods taken in the RAP preparation
1. Collect all related documents of the Project include:
1) The World Bank Memorandums of the Project.
2) The documents of relevant administrative departments of the State and
local Governments.
3) The Feasibilitv Study Report for the Project.
2. Collect local relevant laws and regulations on resettlement and land
acquisition,
3. During the 'investigating the affected people and assets. a door-to-door
100% field survey on the affected households, villager groups and units has
been conducted. The results of the survey have been put in the database.
4. Several options for resettlement and compensation have been worked out in
accordance with data collected in the field survey on the affected households,
villager groups and units.
5. Different approaches for alleviating the physical or economic losses have
been explored with the affected people in order to minimize the negative
impacts on PAPs.
6. Extensive consultation with PAPs and affected units has been conducted
3



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 1
through various forms of coordination meetings or visits in order to optimize
the plan for resettlement and rehabilitation.
7. Based on these discussion, the resettlement policy and compensation
standards for the project were determined after the Project Resettlement
Leading Group (PRLG) had convened conferences to discuss the details of the
plan, which was the basis for finalizing the cost estimate for the land
acquisition and resettlement for the Project.
8. In accordance with the policies and guidelines of the Chinese Government
and applicable World Bank Group policies, specifically OD 4.30 (on
involuntary resettlement), the RAP was compiled.

Chapter 2 Objective of the Resettlement
2.1 Avoidance and Minimization of Involuntary Resettlement
The World Bank's policy requires that all viable alternative project designs
has been explored to avoid the need for involuntary resettlement. Following
the policy, the Project owner and the departments concerned have used all
kind of methods in minimizing the land acquisition and resettlement and
reducing the negative impacts on the cultivated land, housing and units. The
measures are as follows:
.1. Throughout the period of the project planning and project design, a great
deal of efforts have been made by the Project authority and the design teams
in order to minimize land requisition and building demolition. Such efforts
even continue into the stage of detail project design and resettlement
preparation.
2. During the project implementation, further efforts, such as adjustment of
alignment, technological innovation and strengthening the management of
construction, can be made to further reduce the negative impacts on the
affected area.
3. For those impacts (land requisition and building demolition) cannot be
avoided, following the RAP, a series of measures will be taken to ensure full
rehabilitation or reconstruction for the affected residents, units, and
infrastructure facilities.
Take a four-story brick concrete building in the Altay Road Section of the
Project for example. The building belongs to Huateng Company. According to
the old design drawings, the side-line of the requisition land will occupy the
5



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 2
whole land area of this building. Even more, next to the building there are
quite a few two or three story buildings which are also affected. However, for
the principle of minimizing land acquisition and relocation, the design unit
has made some adjustment on the alignment. On the other side of road. there
are still some open ground. So the routine of this section has been moved to
the opposite side about 10 meters so that the four-story brick concrete
building and other neighboring buildings can be prevented from
demolishment.
2.2 The Objective of the Resettlement Program
The main objective of the resettlement program is to ensure that the
production levels. income-earning capacity and the living standards. of the
Project-affected persons (PAPs) are improved. or at least restored to the levels
thev would have had without the Project.
Therefore. a series of measures will be taken to safeguard the entitlements of
the affected people:
1. Ensure that all PAPs, including those on urban state-owned land, receive
compensation at replacement cost for lost assets due to the Project, and are
well resettled and rehabilitated so that they can share the benefits of the
Project:
2. Special care will be taken for the vulnerable groups (including the poor
households, the households having the disabled members, the households
headed by the women and the households where the aged live alone), such as
assistance in building and moving into their new houses;
3. Provide full compensation at replacement cost for the land acquisition to
6



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 2
the collective. The compensation will be used to increase the productive
capacity of the collective:
4. Help those whose houses are relocated select their new sites and build their
new houses. and make them harmonize with the new environment as soon as
possible;
5. Compensate the affected units and enterprises for their loss at replacement
cost: Provide those which need to be relocated with suitable alternative
locations to continue their business:
6. Affected infrastructures or community service institutions will be restored
or replaced:
7. The implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement will be
monitored and evaluated (M&E) by the independent monitoring institute.
The representatives of the PAPs will participate in the resettlement and the
PAPs have avenues for redressing their grievances.
8.  Persons identified as affected by the project are not to be denied
compensation or alternative forms of assistance because thev legal title or
permits.

Chapter 3 Affected Dimension of the Resettlement
Section One   Brief Account
3.1   Brief account of the census of the affected people and assets
In order to have a correct and full picture of the resettlement impacts caused
by the project, before compiling the RAP, the Project Resettlement Office
made arrangements for conducting a comprehensive census on the affected
people and lost assets.
The preparation for the census was done meticulously: which includes
working out the explicit investigating plans; designing all the survey tables;
training the investigators; making the contacts in advance with the
governments and the relevant agencies in the affected areas; conducting the
trial survey on site to verify the survev tables and demonstrating the
investigators how to do it. The whole investigating team is composed of the
relevant personnel from the Project Resettlement Office, the District/County
Resettlement Office, the municipal construction, land administration and
planning departments of the local government, the township/subdistrict
government and the villager administrative committees. The following is a
summary based on the detailed survey results.
In the Road Network Development Component, except the outer ring road,
another 2 connected roads will be involved, which are the Hleilongjiang
Road(O.6 km) and the Tuanjie Road (2 km). Following the investigation, both
the two roads belong to road reconstruction and will not involve land
acquisition and demolition. Therefore, the Resettlement Action Plan for the
8



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 3
Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project only includes the content of
the outer ring road.
The revised RAP is up to date following changes in project design.
particularly including for relocation the 12 households between the area of
tunnel emergence and the existing railway line, who are directly affected by
the Project according to the new design. The revised RAP also counts in the
costs associated with all the changes.
3.2 The Required Land for the Project
The required total land area for the proposed road is 2523 mu, including the
existing highwav right-of-way of 2013 mu. and required new land use of 510
mu. Of the total required new land for construction purpose, 197.5 mu of land
area belongs to the rural range, and 312.5 mu belongs to the urban range.
Since all urban land in China is owned bv the state, the Project, as a state
urban construction project, could be allocated with urban land use right
without paving land compensation. However, for those affected households
and work units on the acquired urban land. they will be provided with
building compensation, replacement structures or alternative site for
reconstruction. In fact, full replacement value compensation will be paid to all
demolished buildings and other attached properties, regardless they are
located in the newly acquired land, or within the existing right of way.
Because the urban land is the state-owned land, the Project can use it
unconditionally through the method of transfer as urban construction.
Therefore, there will not be detailed discussion on the urban state-owned land
in the RAP. For the information about the Project required land, please refer
to the following table.

3.3 Scope of Resettlement Impact
The Project will requisite 197.5 mu rural collectively owned land including
100.77 mu cultivated land. Along with land requisition, a total of 144609.9
square meters of building structures will be demolished, causing relocation of
871 households or 3580 individuals, and affecting 835 units with 5495
employees. A detailed breakdown of land requisition and resettlement impact
for the Project is as follows:

Among the affected ethnic minorities bv the Project. most of them are the
Uv-ur Nationality and the Hui Nationality. The Uygur Nationality is the
principal nationality in the Xinjiang Uvgur Autonomous Region and it has its
own language and words. The Hui Nationality uses the Chinese language and
words. Most of the Uygur Nationality and the Hui Nationality people believe
in the Islam  and they have their own nationality's customs in food, clothing,
festival and so on which is fully respected by the Han Nationality and other
nationalities.
During the investigation, the ethnic minority people by the Project,
accounting for one third of total affected residents, have put forward some
requirements based on their actual situation. Among them, two requirements
are directly related with their nationality custom and religious practice, which
include: avoid or minimize resettlement impacts on religious facilities, and
23



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 3
consider the religious needs when arrange resettlement housing for the
relatively concentrated minority areas. Those two requirements have been
carefullv considered in the current RAP. For details, see Section 6.6.
In addition. the affected minoritv people have also made other requirements.
such as inform them as early as possible before resettlement implementation;
provide them with adequate compensation: deliver compensation to them
timelv: and provide them with replacement housing or commercial space
following local laws and regulations. Since these requirements are also quite
similar as those put forward by Han Nationality, they will be addressed by
adopted resettlement policv and rehabilitation measures for the Project. No
special measures will be adopted for affected minority people on these
requirements.
3.10 Other socio-economic impact
According to the result of the socio-economic survey, the PAPs generally
express their support to the Project (the support rate is 95.3%), meanwhile.
the PAPs also put forward their requirements on compensation at the original
price, construction in another place after demolishment. rearrange residence
and operation place, etc according to their respective actual situation. When
formulating the Project compensation policies and resettlement rehabilitation
plan, the PAPs' rational requirements have been fully considered.
The land acquisition and resettlement of the Project will have certain impacts
on the career, education, living conditions, life style, cultural activities of the
PAPs. However. through the efforts of compensation and rehabilitation.
overall, such impacts will be positive for the PAPs.
Because of the little influence of the land acquisition of the Project on the
24



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 3
local average cultivated land per agricultural person, the resettlement
problem of the affected population will be solved by the method of cultivated
land redistribution. In general, the construction of the Project will promote
economic development along the road especially in the business and service
industry, and provide local people with new job opportunities; More contact
with the outside will widen horizons of the people in the affected areas, The
PAPs' housing conditions will also be improved to certain extent.
Through the 24 non-license households sampled in the Sayban District, the
Project impacts on the affected households, especially on the non-license
households, can be found out. These non-license households have lived in the
Yamalike Mountain, Sayban District for over 18 years on average. Most of
them belong to the ethnic minority households and their living condition is
poor, therefore, they hope to improve their living condition through
relocation. Most of them are satisfied with the resettlement plot. For more
detailed information, please refer to the following table;

Land for Construction Purposes
Article 43 Any unit or individual that need land for construction purposes
should apply for the use of land owned by the State according to law;
The term "apply for the use of land owned by the State according to law"
refers to land owned by the State and also land originally owned by peasant
collectives but having been acquired by the State.
Article 45 The State Council shall approve acquisition of the following land:
1. Basic farmland;
2. Land exceeding 35 hectares (1 hectare = 15 mu);
3. Other land exceeding 70 hectares.
The people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have the authority to approve acquisition of land other than
prescribed in the preceding paragraph and shall submit it to the State
Council for the record.
Article 47 In acquisition of land, compensation should be made according to
the original purposes of the land acquired.
Compensation fees for land acquired include land compensation, resettlement
subsidy and compensation for ground attachments to and standing crops on
the land. The compensation fee for cultivated land should be 6-10 times the
average annual production value during the three years prior to acquisition.
The resettlement subsidy shall be calculated according to the number of
agriculture population to be resettled. The number of the agricultural
population to be resettled shall be calculated by dividing the area of the
acquired cultivated land by the average per capita land holdings of the unit
prior to the land acquisition. The amount of the resettlement subsidy is to be
determined on a per capita basis and should be 4-6 times the average annual
output value during three years prior to land acquisition. However, the
43



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 4
amount of the resettlement subsidy should not exceed 15 times the average
annual value of the produce.
In reference to the land compensation and resettlement subsidy for cultivated
land acquired, the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities should
establish the compensation rates for other types of land.
The provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities should determine the
compensation rates for ground attachments and standing crops.
In acquisition of vegetable fields in suburban areas, the units using the land
should pay new vegetable field development and construction fund.
Whereas the land compensation and resettlement subsidy paid according to
the provisions of the second paragraph of this article are not enough to
maintain the original living standards, the resettlement subsidy may be
increased with the approval of the people's governments of provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities. But the combined amount of the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy should not exceed 30 times the
average annual production value during three years prior to land acquisition.
Article 48 After the plan for land compensation and resettlement subsidy is
finalized, related local people's government shall make an announcement and
hear the opinions of the rural collective economic organizations and peasants
whose land has been acquired.
Article 49 Rural collective economic organizations shall make public to its
members the receipts and expenditures of the land compensation fees for land
acquires and accept their supervision.
It is forbidden to embezzle or divert the land compensation and other related
expenses.

remains responsible for meeting anv reasonable cost overruns.
5.6 Contingencies
Some unanticipated costs mav lie in implementation of the land acquisition
and resettlement, which involves a wide range of aspects concerning the
livelihood of the local residents as well as the operation of the units and
enterprises. Therefore, the cost estimates for the RAP include provision for
both physical and price contingencies which comprise the major contingencies
for the Project.

6.1.3 Urban private houses
For the 106 households living in the non-conforming private houses in Sayban
District, the Project owner will provide funds to build the resettlement houses
on the unused land nearby. It has been planed that the Project owner will
invest to construct the resettlement houses of 6,000 sq.m which can hold more
than 100 households on a block of unused land, which is about 1 kilometer to
the south of Urumqi Railroad Station, and 3 kilometers from their current
sites. Then, the 106 households possessing non-license private houses can be
resettled. According to estimation, the cost including land and necessary
infrastructures will be about 910 RMB/sq.m. The built resettlement houses
will be provided to these households with welfare rental, which is stipulated by
the government at that time (1.57 RMB/sq.m of living space), according to the
floor space and structure of their demolished houses. This highly subsidized
housing with full services will provide residents with living standard much
improved from present conditions. The housing will be owned by the Project
owner and residents can continue subsidized occupancy until they want to
move. In addition, they will be subsidized properly by difference for the
replacement value of lost structures, and use right of rental apartment, which
is set at 50% of replacement value for the lost structures. According to the
survey, there are a large mosque (Tiexi Mosque) in the same neighborhood,
with only 300 meters distance from the proposed housing site, which can meet
the religious needs for those minority relocatees. Besides, an elementary school
(Xuelian Elementary School) is located next block which could provide
bilingual education for those school-age children.
For the other urban private houses, the method of providing them with
purchased low-profit resettlement houses nearby will be adopted.
For the urban private houses of every year, except the 106 household private
63



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
houses without license in Sayban District, it's planed to purchase the
resettlement houses from Guanghui Real Estate Company and Yinhe Real
Estate Company.
For the residents renting private houses, they will be arranged to keep rental
relationship with the original private owners and re-conclude the leasing
agreement: In case the original private houses can't be rebuilt, they will be
arranged to rent the houses with similar standards and rent in the
neighboring area and be compensated for all the rental application fee.
6.2   Unit resettlement
6.2.1 Units using the self-owned houses
According to the impact category, the affected units and enterprises are
divided into two types: the units and enterprises which are affected partially
and need not to be relocated are of one type: those which need to be relocated
belong to another type.
For the first type of units, since the project will only occupy a small portion in
their total land area and total floor space. the resettlement will result in
neither relocation nor production interruption of these units. They could
rebuild their structures by moving backward within their land area, which
could be done even before the old ones being demolished. Therefore, the units
can self-adjust the process of resettlement internally and it will not caused
operation interruptions. Their structures will be compensated according to
the replacement value. No depreciation will apply to the calculation of the
amount of compensation. Also, the value of the old materials which can still
be used will not be included in the total amount compensation.
64



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
For the units and enterprises which need to be relocated (occupy 26.6% of the
total demolished floor space of the units and enterprises),they will be
redistributed the new unit-used land no less than the original land to construct
the new  houses.  and the relocation site will be confirm  after fully
consultation with the affected units and enterprises. All the affected units will
be compensated according to the replacement value. No depreciation will
apply to the calculation of the amount of compensation. Also. the value of the
old materials which can still be used will not be cut from the total amount
compensation.
For the units and enterprises that don't ask for resettlement (replacement
plot), they will receive cash compensation equal to two times the original
houses replacement price in one time so that thev can purchase replacement
space from the market or solve their space problem by themselves.
For those units that need to be relocated in 2000, the units in Urumqi County
will be relocated to the site in No. 5 Villager Group near the ring road based
on initial consultation with Jiujiawan Village. And the units in Sayban
District will be relocated along Qingfeng Road, near Baoshan Road after
preliminary consultation with Sayban District. Most affected units from
Sayban District will be resettled along the two sides of Qingfeng Road, which
is only 1 kilometer away from the proposed new housing site for those 106
relocated households in Yamalike Mountain. To place the relocated
households and units nearby will be beneficial for solving the employment
problem for the affected people. The detailed plan is as follows:

The resettlement of the following affected units and enterprises will refer to
the method for 2000.
6.2.2 Units and enterprises using the rented houses
For the units and enterprises, which rent the public houses, they will be able
to continue to lease the space, since the demolished public structures will be
rebuilt after resettlement. In this case, they could maintain their original
leasing agreement with property owners.
For those units and enterprises, which rent the private houses, they can
continue to rent reconstruction houses, since these private houses can be
reconstructed according to original purpose. In this case, they could maintain
their original leasing agreement with property owners. In case these private
houses will not be reconstructed according to original purpose, these units and
66



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
enterprises will be assigned new retail spaces at the county-run trade market
near the project site and will be compensated for all their application fee.
6.3    Land acquisition
Because the Project impact to the rural collective cultivated land  is
comparatively small. the resettlement problem of the affected population will
be solved bv the method of cultivated land redistribution and generous
compensation. The left cultivated land after the every villager group will be
redistributed within the whole villager group in order to resettle the affected
agricultural population. Such arrangement can ensure that the cultivated land
can be redistributed to the PAPs according to the principle of equality.
All the agricultural population affected the Project land acquisition will get
economic resettlement and rehabilitation according to the agricultural
method, therefore, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy to the
villager groups will only be used to develop the collective economy and will
not be applied to any other use. According to the characteristics of the
affected areas of the Project. the application principle of this funds is as
follows:
1. Increase agricultural income from the remaining cultivated land by
improving the irrigation facilities, seeds. and the planting modes, etc.;
2. Develop the capital construction of water, electricity, road, and forestry:
3. Open up wasteland and exploit the agriculture production potentialities in
the non-cultivated and low-yield land;
4. Develop the second and the third industries related to agriculture so as to
67



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project             Chapter 6
improve the production ability of the affected administrative villages.
The cultivated land of 11 mu of the No.2 Villager Group. Jiujiawan Village
will first be acquired in 2000. Because the impact to the cultivated land per
capita of the No.2 Villager Group. Jiujiawan Village, which is only 4.23%, the
resettlement problem will be solved according to the method of cultivated land
redistribution. The left land of 249 after land acquisition will be redistributed
within the whole villager group. On the basis of consulting with related
departments for agricultural people's income loss whose cultivated land is
acquired. the initial assume about using land compensation and resettlement
subsidy has arose.

Because of land acquisition, the No.2 Villager Group, Jiujiawan Village will
lose agricultural annual product of RMB 16,500. In the land compensation
and resettlement subsidy of RMB 396,000, which the No.2 Villager Group,
68



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
Jiujiawan Village can receive, RMIB 80850 is initially assumed to open up
wasteland and enhance agricultural technology level. According to estimation.
only these items can increase annual agricultural product RMB 16,500 per
year. Therefore, such land acquisition arrangement will not have negative
influence on the PAPs' income and livelihood.
The resettlement of the other villager groups will refer to the method of the
No.2 Villager Group, Jiujiawan Village prior to the land acquisition.
6.4 Reconstruction and rehabilitation of the infrastructures
The affected infrastructures of the Project mainly include the water supply
and drainage pipes, the gas pipes. the heat pipes, the electric wires and the
communication wires. The affected infrastructures will be compensated at the
replacement price, and minimize the relocation as little as possible. The
infrastructures which really need to be relocated will be reconstructed or
restored to its original functions as soon as possible. At the same time.
reasonable new culverts, underpasses, pedestrian overpasses and other
accesses will be built for the convenience of the PAPs' living and working.
6.5 Resettlement of the vulnerable groups
The vulnerable groups include the poor households (staff), the households
having the disabled members (staff), the households headed by the women
(staff), and the households where the aged (staff) live alone. The specific
eligibility criteria for the vulnerable groups are defined as follows.
69

women(staff)                female staff heading the households)
4  the aged households(staff) living   the households where the aged above 70 live alone
alono
The following measures will be taken so as to ensure the rehabilitation of the
living standards of the vulnerable groups after resettlement:
1. The governments of all levels (such as administrative villages, villager
groups and so on ) will make everv effort to organize and provide labor force
to help and support the vulnerable groups in building their new houses and
relocating their households;
2. Give priority to satisfy the reasonable demands of the vulnerable groups.
such as taking precedence of choosing the new housing sites and operation
place;
3.  Make the specific compensation or poverty subsidy payment, or reduce or
remit their housing rental to the vulnerable groups in extraordinary difficulty
according to the fact. Concrete implementation details will be developed by
the Project owner during resettlement implementation based on actual
situation among different road sections.
6.6 Resettlement of the ethnic minority

each other verv well. About one third of Project-affected residents are
minority people. During the investigation, the ethnic minority people by the
Project, accounting for one third of total affected residents, have put forward
some requirements based on their actual situation. Among them. two
requirements are directly related with their nationalitY custom and religious
practice, which include: avoid or minimize resettlement impacts on religious
facilities, and consider the religious needs when arrange resettlement housing
for the relatively concentrated minority areas. For the other requirements put
forward bv the affected minorities. since they are the same as those put
forward by Han Nationality. they will be addressed by adopted resettlement
policv and rehabilitation measures for the Project. No special measures will be
adopted for affected minoritv people on these requirements.
On the requirement of minimizing resettlement impacts on religious facilities.
a great deal efforts have been made during the design stage in order to avoid
any impacts on such facilities. (Such effort will even last at the construction
drawings design stage and the Project construction period). In case such
impacts could not be avoid, efforts will be made during resettlement in order
to ensure restoration and improvement of the affected facilitv. Please see the
following cases.
Because of the Project impact, the Lanzhou Temple will be relocated, which is
located at the intersection of the Jinvin Street and the Yuejin Street in
Tianshan District. The Lanzhou Temple is one of the earliest built Islamic
temples in the Urumqi Municipality. It is initially located in Yonghe Lane,
and it moved to the current site due to the planning and reconstruction of
Yonghe Lane. The existing floor space of the temple is 611.33 sq.m and the
land area is 233.25 sq.m. At present household number of the fellow believers
who have religious service and other religious activities has reach about 600,
including 500 households of Hui Nationality and 100 households of Uygur
71



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
Nationality. Because the existing land area is comparatively small and it can't
meet the fellow believers' requirements on religious activities. It has been
planned several time to extend the temple, but finally it hasn't come into force
for various reasons.
When conducting the census and the socio-economic survey of the Project. all
the council members and the fellow believers expressed their full support to
the Project. After full consultation with the council members and the fellow
believers of the Lanzhou Temple. it is decided to extend the Lanzhou Temple
taking advantage of the relocation. The relocation site has been chosen in the
intersection of the Yuejin Street and the Second Lane in the Erdaowan Road.
and is agreeable to the mosque council. The land area of the new Lanzhou
Temple will reach about 600 sq.m and the floor space will reach about 800
sq.m. Compensation will be paid and adequate time will be provided for a
new mosque to be constructed before the old mosque is demolished. The
relocation of the Lanzhou Temple will improve the local religious activity
place and will benefit numerous local Islams.
During the Project feasibility stage. the road alignment will affect the minaret
of Liudaowav Mosque. During preliminary design stage. the proposed ring
road was moved slightlv in order to avoid such impacts. In order to further
reduce the impact of the ring road. on the condition of meeting the
requirements of pedestrian movement, the sidewalk along the Mosque was
reduced from 4 meters to 2 meters. In addition, a separate exit will be added
for the Mosque in order to improve the access to the Mosque.
For the Guangming Mosque on Yamalike Mountain, in the original design,
the proposed ring road was only a few meters away from the front gate. In
order to reduce the noise impact, following the request of local residents, the
ring road was moved away another 5 meters, and elevation of the ring road
was lowered by 6 meters. As a result, the height difference between the
72



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 6
Mosque and the ring road has been raised to 9 meters. In addition. the
Project will widen the platform to 4 meters in the front gate and build railing
along the platform in order to ensure the safety of local residents.
On the requirement of being close to religious facility for the concentrated
resettlement site for the affected minorities, these are two resettlement
housing areas with relatively concentrated minorities. One is Liudaowan Coal
Mine resettlement site, which is near the existing Liudaowan Mosque. The
other is resettlement site for the 106 households without proper titles or
permits. There is a mosque - Tiexi Mosque. which is located only 300 meters
away from the proposed resettlement site. As a result. this special requirement
made by the affected minorities has also been solved.
6.6 Resettlement implementation content and schedule
In order to ensure all the PAPs will be resettled successfully before the Project
construction, all the resettlement must be accomplished by at least one month
prior to the Project construction.
Due to the subsection construction character, the implementation of the
Project land acquisition and resettlement will be conducted yearly: before the

Aggrieved Aspects
92



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Chapter 8
PAPs can make an appeal on any aspect of the land acquisition and
resettlement, including the compensation being offered.
Detailed procedures for redress of grievances and the appeal process are
publicized among the PAPs bv distributing RIBs.
In spite of the above procedures established for redressing grievances, in case
any conflicts arise regarding the land acquisition and resettlement, the
conflicting parties will first negotiate and mediate the case in cooperative
effort. The above appealing procedures will be employed only when the
mutual negotiation mediation fails.

In order to ensure the proper implementation of resettlement, the Economic,
Legal and Social Consultancy Center of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences (ELSCC of SASS) has been entrusted as the external agency for
independent monitoring and evaluation of the land acquisition. resettlement
and rehabilitation activities of the Project.
ELSCC of SASS is one of the advisorv organs founded earliest in China.
Examined and approved by the World Bank. ELSCC of SASS now is an
institute authorized to undertake the consulting services for the World Bank-
financed projects. For the past several years, ELSCC of SASS has successfully
carried out a good few resettlement consulting project, which concern
resettlement preparation, planning, and monitoring and evaluation, for the
World Bank, IFC and other international financial institution-financed
proj ects.
Now ELSCC of SASS is going to organize a project team for independent
monitoring and evaluation of the land acquisition and resettlement of the
Project. The external monitoring team will include members of minority
nationalities, or staff who can speak nationality languages and who are
familiar with minority nationality customs.

area. The survey will employ the combination of stratum sampling and group
random sampling so as to identify and report the potential problems in
rehabilitation of living standards. The general socio-economic survey and
analysis, which will evaluate resettlement and its impact on the living
standards of the PAPs, will be conducted about 1 year after all the land
acquisition and resettlement is completed and report in written form the
living standard and conditions of the PAPs after their resettlement so as to
evaluate the actual impact of the implementation of the RAP on the living
standard of the PAPs.

RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
Annex    Minoritv  Issues  in  Resettlement for  Urumqi Urban
Transport Improvement Project
Introduction
1. As its name indicates, the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project
(UUTIP) includes a set of activities to improve traffic and transport management
in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
2. Urumqi has an ethnically diverse population. While Uvgur, Hui Nationality,
Kazaks, etc. constitute the majority of people in many areas of Xinjiang and in
the region overall, they represent only about 27 percent of the Urumqi
population. Uygur account for 12.7 percent of the city population, Hui
Nationality account for 9.5 percent, Kazaks account for 3.19 percent, Man
Nationality account for 0.54 percent, Mongols account for 0.4 percent, Xibe
account for 0.21 percent, Russians account for 0.21 percent and Uzbeks account
for 0.09 percent. Most of those people speak one or two languages.
3. UUTIP consists of five components: (1) road network development; (2)
traffic management and road safety; (3) public transport; (4) environment
protection and improvement; and (5) urban transport system management.
Among them, only the road network development component involves land
acquisition and resettlement, as described throughout the RAP. The purpose of
this annex is to review resettlement impacts and mitigation measures as they
relate to the affected minority nationality households.
4. As urban residents, members of minority nationalities will be affected by the
project in much the same ways as Han Chinese residents. All ethnic groups are
likely to benefit from traffic and public transport improvements. Conversely,
adverse impacts associated with UUTIP affect individual members of various
104



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
ethnic groups similarly. Because none of the minority nationalities are vulnerable
to specific hardship, no ethnic group-specific measures are necessary to mitigate
adverse impacts; hence, no separate minoritv development plan is required. All
necessary mitigation and rehabilitation measures are provided in the RAP.
5. The RAP is drafted in accordance with the related laws and regulations
issued by the People's Republic of China, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
and Urumqi Municipal Government, and the provisions from the World Bank
Operational Directive on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30). The purpose of
the RAP is to develop an action plan for the project-affected people. to assist
them in improving, or at least restoring, their incomes and living standards.
Resettlement Impact on Minority Nationalities
6. The development of a 31-kilometer urban ring road will affect Urumqi
residents primarily through demolition of structures on land required for road
use. According to the survey, 510 mu (34 hectares) of new land area will be
required by the project. This includes acquisition of 197.5 mu rural land (about
13 hectares) of which 100.8 mu (about 7 hectares) is cultivated land, and transfer
of 312.5 mu (about 21 hectares) of urban land use rights. Acquisition of
cultivated land will directly affected 53 households (218 individuals). Structure
demolition is expected to total 144,610 square meters, including 59.356 square
meters of residential housing. 871 households (3,580 individuals) will need to be
relocated. 835 enterprises or work units would be affected by non-residential
demolition or loss of land, which will affect 5.495 employees. Among relocated
households, 278 households or 31.9 percent belong to ethnic minority
nationalities with 1,196 individuals. Among affected employees, 15 percent of
them or 819 individuals are minority nationalities.
7. Most affected minority residents are concentrated in three districts,
including Sayban District (154 households), Tianshan District (78 households)
and Shuimogou District (33 households). The share of minority households
among total relocated households will range from 48.7 percent in Sayban District,
105



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
36.3 percent in Shuimogou District, to 21 percent in Tianshan District. In terms
of affected minority employees, most of them (92 percent or 753 individuals) are
also concentrated in these districts, with 376 persons in Sayban District, 304
persons in Tianshan District, and 73 persons in Shuimogou District.
Issues of Concern to Minority Nationality Households
8. Under UUTIP, most affected  minorities belong  to' Uygur and  Hui
nationalities. The Uygur nationality is the principal nationality in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and has its own language. The Hui nationality uses
Chinese language. The great majority of members of both of these groups follow
customs of Muslim religion, which is fully respected by the Han nationality and
other nationalities. Resettlement planning results indicate that no minority group
is specifically affected. Nevertheless. two kinds of resettlement-related impacts
were identified as ethnicallv or culturally sensitive: impacts on religious facilities.
and relocation of unregistered residents, many of whom are members of minority
nationalities. In fact, to avoid demolition of religious facilities and to ensure that
resettlement housing is reasonably close to religious facilities were two prominent
concerns voiced   bv the affected minority households during resettlement
consultations.
9. The physical work associated with ring road improvement would require
demolition of one mosque. At present, the Lanzhou Mosque is housed in a former
commercial structure of no major cultural or architectural significance. It
occupies 233 square meters of land area with 611 square meters of floor space. In
consultation with the mosque council, a relocation site has been identified with
600 square meters of land, and compensation will be sufficient to build an
improved structure. Mosque leaders have indicated that they are pleased with
the relocation site (which they themselves identified) and with the prospect for a
more modern facility. Additionally, changes were made in the project design to
avoid demolition of a minaret at another mosque and to avoid disrupting access
to a third mosque.
106



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
10. The project will affect 193 households lacking legal residency status. RAP
policy terms require equitable treatment of unregistered residents, regardless of
ethnicity. An area to be significantly affected by tunneling and road
improvement is near Yamalike Mountain in Sayban District, inhabited primarily
bv unregistered members of minoritv groups. Following consultations with
affected residents, a scheme to provide replacement housing with modern
services and improved public facilities under highly subsidized terms has been
devised, which will greatly improve the living condition for the resettlers.
According to the survev. currently most resettlers live in earth-wood structures,
96 percent of households without running water. No household has private
bathroom. Residents have indicated that they are satisfied with resettlement
arrangements.
Legal Framework and Compensation Standards
I 1. The legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement includes national.
provincial and local laws or regulations. Relevant national laws or regulations
include "Land Administration Law" (1998), "City Planning Law" (1990), and
"The Administrative Regulation on Urban Building Demolition and Relocation"
(1991). The local implementation measures include The Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous  Region  Implementation  Regulation  of  the  Sate  Land
Administration Law" (1989, the latest version is still in discussion): "the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Implementation Regulation on City
Planning Law" (1991), and "the Urumqi Municipality Administration
Regulation on Urban Building Demolition" (1995). Based on analysis of
replacement value of lost assets, a set of compensation standards has been
adopted for UUTIP, which will be applied equally for both Han Chinese and
ethnic minority nationalities.
Resettlement and Rebuilding Plan
12. Because UUTIP is situated primarily in an urban area, major project-related
impacts are associated with structural demolition, meaning that major mitigation
107



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
measures are associated with relocation. No one is expected to lose employment
permanently in urban area affected by the project, so rehabilitation efforts are
focused primarily upon relative few households affected by acquisition of
cultivated land. Only a small area of the ring road will involve land acquisition,
as most of the ring road alignment is in urban areas. The area affected by
acquisition of cultivated land is inhabited primarily by Han. As is common in
China, all of those losing land will be accommodated through collective land
redistribution. The affected villages will use compensation to identify and pursue
productive investment opportunities. Initial investment plans made by affected
collectives emphasize agricultural intensification and bring wasteland into
production.
13. Relocating rural households will be given house compensation at
replacement cost with no depreciation and salvageable materials will belong to
them. They also will be provided with alternative housing plots by their villages.
Relocating urban households living in public rental units will be provided with
replacement rental housing units of similar size and improved qualitv. Urban
private house owners will be provided with three options, including replacement
housing with ownership right, full compensation rate for lost housing plus the
right to rent replacement housing at low rates. or double the compensation rate
for lost housing if the affected household accepts. full responsibility for its own
relocation. Those renting private houses can continue lease agreement with their
current landlord after resettlement, or the project will assist them in locating
another place. The project will provide them moving assistance and subsidy for
temporary transfer that will be applied to all affected households. In addition to
these provisions, for affected minority nationalities, the availability of religious
facilities will be considered in selecting new housing sites for resettlement.
14. For employees of affected enterprises, members of minority nationalities will
be treated the same as Han employees. No employees will lose employment, and
all affected employees are eligible for temporary wage maintenance for the period
in which enterprises cannot function due to relocation or other project-related
disruptions.
108



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
Institutional Arrangements
15. Implementation responsibilities are shared between the UUTIP Project
Executive Office (PEO) and the local district (county) governments. In order to
facilitate resettlement implementation. the district resettlement offices include
staff from different minority nationalities, who can speak minority languages and
are familiar with their customs.
Consultation and Participation
16. In the course of resettlement planning, municipal officials and project design
staff have consulted with  potentially affected people, including  minority
nationalities. to identify impacts and to solicit preferences regarding mitigation
measures. These consultations occurred in various areas to be affected bv the
project, and were conducted in both Han Chinese and Uygur languages. The
consultation process contributed to minimization of impacts and identification of
remedial alternatives acceptable to the affected people. In Sayban District for
example, discussions with a mostly minority community in the Yamalile area
encouraged the project officials to provide a nearby replacement housing site
with improved public facilities.
17. To ensure that affected people are adequately informed, a number of public
hearings have been held; resettlement related information has been published in
local newspapers, and resettlement information booklets have been, or will be,
distributed in affected areas. The RAP has been made available in at local
district and county resettlement offices. The information booklets are available in
Uygur and Chinese.
Monitoring and Evaluation
18. Resettlement implementation will be subject to both internal and external
monitoring. The PRO will be responsible for submitting internal project reports
109



RAP for the Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project  Annex
to the Bank every six months. A team independent of the project owner will
conduct external monitoring, and will submit external monitoring reports to the
Bank every six months. Among other topics, monitoring reports will focus on
specific resettlement issues relating to the affected members of minority
nationalities. Additionally. the external monitoring team will include members of
minority nationalities, or staff who can speak nationality languages and who are
familiar with minority nationalitv customs.
