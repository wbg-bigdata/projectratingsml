REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MAURITIUS FOR
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
structural adjustment loan to Mauritius for the equivalent of US$15.0 million.
The loan would have a term of seventeen years, including four years of grace,
with interest at 9.6 percent per annum. The proposed loan would support an
ongoing government adjustment program designed to improve overall productivity
of the economy, to stimulate growth of exports, particularly those of export-
processing industries, and to strengthen the agriculture and tourism sectors.
PART I - RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Introduction
2.         Mauritius is small and densely populated.  Despite expansion of
other sectors since the early 1970s, its economy remains dominated by sugar.
Foreign trade continues to be of vital importance -- exports of goods amount
to about 50 percent of GDP-- because of the small size of the economy and the
structure of output. The economy is essentially an open one; there are few
direct restrictions on trade, and the exchange system is virtually free of
restraints on current transactions. With a per capita GNP of $1,040 in
1979, Mauritius enjoys the standard of living of a middle-income developing
country. Standards of nutrition, health care, and educational facilities are
comparable to those in other countries with similar income levels; but adult
literacy (over 80 percent) is significantly higher, as is life expectancy (67
years).   Basic needs are extensively covered through government programs.
Only about 12 percent of the population live in absolute poverty.
3.        The society is open and pluralistic, with a multi-party political
system, and a functioning parliamentary form of government. The Government
has encouraged private initiative to assume an important role in the develop-
ment process, itself providing infrastructure, institutional support and
incentives to the private sector within a framework of indicative planning.
Concerned about the pressures generated by a rapidly growing population, the
Government has actively pursued a pragmatic and successful population
policy.  (The population growth rate in recent years has averaged 1.3 percent
per annum, although the rate of natural increase is now probably close to
2 percent.) At the same time, the Government has laid stress on public
services (which include largely free medical care and education) subsidies on
basicfoods, selective control over consumer prices, minimum wage regulation
and public works programs, with the related objectives of alleviating poverty
and unemployment.



-2-
The record of the 1970s
4.         During most of the seventies the Mauritian economy was remarkably
successful. It achieved high economic growth, considerable employment
creation, moderate expansion of exports, and an excellent record in meeting
the most urgent needs of the populace. This contrasted with stagnating output
and rising unemployment in the 1960s. Economic growth averaged about 6.3 per-
cent per capita per annum for the decade as a whole. The rate of increase
in employment was sufficient (4.6 percent per annum), even with some increase
in labor participation rates, to halve unemployment to about 8 percent of the
labor force by 1979. Table 1 summarizes sectorial sources of growth in the
1970s.
TABLE 1

(Percent per annum)
GDP               7.7             Construction                  14.5
GDP Per Capita   6.3              Utilities                     13.2

Manufacturing   15.6                and Public Administration  9.5
5.        Employment and Wages.  Substantial progress was made in providing
more adequate employment opportunities in the 1970s, but employment growth
has tapered off in recent years. The number of workers in agriculture,
including sugar, which provides about a third of total employment, has been
falling off, with increasing mechanization. The rate of growth of employment
in manufacturing, a major source of new job opportunities, has slowed down.
Government employment, on the other hand, increased as the growth of private
employment decelerated. Unemployment, which had been greatly reduced during
the early seventies, has been creeping up and in late 1980 was over 9 percent
of the labor force. The very high rates of investment in the late 1970s
contributed only marginally to employment; increasing employment in Export
Processing Zone (EPZ - see paragraph 7) industry, construction and public
services was offset by a decline in agricultural employment.
6.        The buoyant demand for labor which developed during the 1970s
together with the demand for increased living standards stimulated by the
sugar boom, provided a framework for strong wage pressures to operate. Wage
developments were influenced by widespread and active trade union pressure,
and during the mid-70s real wages increased rapidly: average real monthly
earnings in 1977/78 were about 25 percent higher than in 1975/76. The
National Remuneration Board which has responsibility for wage policy began to
exercise effective restraint on wage increases only toward the end of the
decade, but since then has been notably effective, and real wages have
declined equally rapidly.



-3-
7.        Manufacturing.  Exports were boosted by the establishment in
1970 of the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) scheme (paragraph 70). By 1979, EPZ
firms employed some 20,000 workers, about 6 percent of the labor force and
10 percent of total employment in the formal sector. EPZ exports
amounted to some $100 million gross, equivalent to about $40 million net
of imported inputs. This compared with Mauritius total (gross) exports
of goods and services of $510 million during the same year. Manufacturing
industry as a whole (but excluding tea and sugar factories) employs
nearly 12 percent of the labor force.
8.        Between 1976 and 1979, EPZ performance slowed considerably,
although EPZ gross output still increased by 9 percent in real terms
between 1977 and 1979. Industry was affected by increasing labor costs,
by declining profits in the sugar industry (which reduced the funds
available in the economy for investment), by absenteeism and selective
labor shortages. Some European countries imposed selective non-tariff
barriers on certain Mauritian exports which had taken a significant part
of their markets. Mauritius also lost part of its competitive advantage
for firms seeking a base from which to export to the EEC, as more
countries with access to that market offered similar investment
incentives.
9.        Sugar.  The generally favorable growth in foreign exchange
earnings from manufacturing exports and tourism contrasts with experience
in the sugar sector. The volume of sugar exports grew slowly, and despite
the price support which Mauritius received from the EEC on its sugar quota
under the Lome Convention (approximately 75 percent of production), price
movements were unfavorable. Indeed, if measured in constant prices
calculated using the GDP deflator, earnings from sugar exports in 1978 and
1979 were 33 percent below the peak years of 1974 and 1975, and 20 percent
lower than in 1976 and 1977. The sugar industry in Mauritius was already a
highly efficient, "mature" industry at the beginning of the decade. It is
difficult to establish any clear production trend for the 1970s because at
the slow growth prevailing, climatic variations and other temporary and
largely unmeasurable factors have such a large relative influence. The land
area devoted to sugar is high, almost 90 percent of the total area under
cultivation, and there is very little scope for expanding the area. There
is some evidence of higher levels of productivity following the introduction
and expansion of improved varieties, plant protection measures, and a
consistent, slow increase in the proportion of land which is cultivated by
integrated sugar estates, which obtain a comparatively high output per
hectare. Higher cane yields have however been partly offset by a reduction
in sucrose content, due to lengthening of the harvesting period and
deteriorating milling efficiency.



- 4 -
10.        The slow growth in sugar production was accompanied by a switch
from the high profitability the industry enjoyed in the mid-1970s, to a
situation in which, according to the Chamber of Agriculture, the industry as
a whole was making losses. Data are not publicly available for the Govern-
ment or the Bank to make an independent assessment. The Chamber estimates
that the large miller-planters had losses per ton almost double that of the
rest of the industry in 1979. Many factors contributed to the reduced profit-
ability. The costs of miller-planters, whose output contributes almost two
thirds of the total, were particularly affected by rising labor costs. For
the industry as a whole, payments to labor rose from about 35 percent of total
costs, prior to the sugar price boom (1973), to 43 percent after the end of
the boom (1978). Even so, labor shortages developed during harvest time.
Real wages in sugar had increased by about 50 percent between 1970 and 1979,
mainly during the sugar boom, and increased a further 8 percent from then to
1979. Labor productivity improved with increasing mechanization. However,
increased labor costs and legislation requiring employers to pay some
seasonal workers for a full year seem to have been important factors reducinR
profitability. The sugar industry probably had limited incentive to re-equip
its factories to improve extraction rates, and to take advantage of whatever
opportunities existed for expanding cane production; in addition, Government
was reluctant to allow inefficient factories to close because of the unemploy-
ment this would cause.
11.        Other Agriculture.  Besides sugar and tea, the agricultural
economy produces small quantities of other products ranging from rice,
fruit, and vegetables to tobacco, meat, and fish. However, crop production
has shown no distinct trend since the mid-1970s. Efforts to reduce the
dependence on food imports have not been very successful, largely because of
scarcity of arable land and the established comparative advantage of sugar.
The situation is however changing. The integrated sugar estates have been
exploring new avenues of product diversification and investment opportunities,
for example, in promoting more intensive land use through planting food crops
in sugar-cane interlines. They have also been increasing their involvement
in capital-intensive livestock production.
12.     During the 1960s, Mauritius sought to expand its tea production
as an alternative to sugar in highland areas which were climatically more
suitable for tea. Mauritius has some 10,000 acres cultivated with tea, of
which about 4,500 are cultivated or maintained by the public sector Tea
Development Authority (TDA), 2,500 by smallholders and 2,600 by private
planters. Mauritius exported about 4,000 tons of tea per year in 1978 and
1979. Much of the land developed by TDA is now reaching maturity, so that
yields should increase sharply in the next few years. However, TDA has been
facing severe internal difficulties in recent years (see below, para 85) and
has been operating at a heavy loss. With the recent moderate prices on the
world tea market, and with the relatively high wages now paid in Mauritius,
many private tea planters have also been operating at a loss. Thus there is
great uncertainty about future tea production and potential export earnings.



- 5 -
13.       Tourism.  Mauritius began during the 1970s successfully to exploit
its potential for tourism. Tourist traffic grew at an annual rate of about
18 percent in the decade, and tourism contributed about 8 percent of gross
foreign exchange earnings in 1979. Expansion slowed following the increase
in air fares resulting from the 1973/74 increase in energy prices, but
averaged 15 percent in 1975-79. Developments during the 1970s reflect the
Mauritian tourist industry's resilience in offsetting its main handicap -
distance from European and other source markets, and resultant sensitivity to
rising transportation costs.
14.        Investment, Savings and Demand.  Gross investment rose to a peak of
41 percent of GDP in 1976, and fell only marginally during the rest of the
decade. Very high investment rates were accompanied by significant changes in
the sectoral distribution as well as in the structure of capital formation.
Investment in the private sector, including inventory build-up, tended to
decline relative to GDP; but accelerated government capital expenditure
sustained the high investment rate. Fixed capital formation in the public
sector increased, in real terms, by about 40 percent during 1976-79, about
four times as rapidly as in the private sector.
15.        A feature of the recent past is the diminishing importance, in
private and public sectors alike, of investment aimed directly at raising
production of goods. Government investment was increasingly devoted to the
development of education, health, housing and other social infrastructure,
which accounted for over half of the incremental budgetary capital outlay
during the three years ending in 1978/79. In the private sector, which
accounts for about two-thirds of aggregate fixed capital formation, the pace
of investment in directly productive activities also slackened considerably,
while there was an upsurge in housing construction. Fixed investment (in
constant 1976 prices) in agriculture and manufacturing fell sharply, and
despite a recovery in 1979 remained significantly lower than in 1976. There
has been a building boom since the early 1970s, particularly in housing; the
share of residential construction in gross fixed investment, which in earlier
years varied around 23 percent, went up to 33 percent in 1978, and remained
at about the same level in 1979. Thus a sizeable proportion of investment
has had a low direct impact on output, and the incremental capital-output
ratio increased consequently from 4.5 during 1970-75 to as much as 6.6 in
1976-79.
16.       As income growth accelerated in the early 1970s, domestic
savings rates increased, especially during the sugar boom. At the end of
the decade they averaged about 24 percent of GDP, double the 1970 rate. The
Government budget has not contributed to this improved savings performance;
it has been running a deficit on current account. Private savings were
presumably higher because of higher income levels. They may have been sus-
tained partly because investment opportunities were favorable, and partly due
to the high expenditure on housing, particularly owner occupied housing.



- 6 -
17.       Domestic demand after the end of the sugar boom was not adjusted to
the reduced resource availability, but was fuelled by high incomes, especially
increased wages, by high levels of public expenditure accompanied by increasing
public sector deficits and by the consequent high rates of credit expansion.
A progressively larger resource gap and balance of payments deficit on current
account was the result. By 1979 the deficit on current account had risen to
nearly 14 percent of GDP.
18.       Public Sector Finance.  The Government's overall deficit increased
rapidly from the mid-seventies, reaching about 16 percent of GDP by 1978/79.
Total government expenditures reached 40 percent of GDP. (Military expendi-
tures, it should be noted, do not loom large in the Mauritius budget.)
Recurrent outlays rose with the sharply increased wage bill, reflecting both
high wage increases and increasing employment. Food subsidies, health,
education, and social security expanded rapidly; expenditures in these
sectors were the equivalent of 10 percent of GDP. The capital budget was
influenced particularly by expansion of housing, education and health facili-
ties. The share of social infrastructure in the capital budget more than
doubled between 1976/77 and 1978/79 from 15 percent to 31 percent.
19.       On the revenue side, receipts remained high, about 25 percent
of GDP. This resulted in part from the rapid growth of imports, a very
important generator of tax revenues, and to increased tax rates on non-
essential imports. However, accelerating world inflation revealed, after the
end of the sugar price boom, that the Mauritian tax structure was not elastic
with respect to increases in GDP in current prices. Excise taxes are largely
specific, there is no sales tax, and income taxes do not produce a high
proportion of tax revenues.
20.       Credit.  With the rapid expansion of public sector deficits previous-
ly described, credit to the public sector expanded rapidly. Private sector
credit grew rapidly in 1976 and 1977, mainly due to the working capital needs
of sugar and the EPZ. Credit restrictions were tightened in 1977 to counter
inflation, and again in 1978; with the slowdown in the economy in 1978 these
led to a slower growth in credit. Capital for productive investment was
available from the Development Bank of Mauritius and other sources outside
credit controls. Although the effort to contain the overall rate of credit
expansion, combined with the need to finance the growing public sector deficit,
may well have squeezed out some private investment, it is probable that
the private investment thereby sacrified was of low priority. Investment
incentives in the private sector in the late 1970s may have favored trade
stocks, and commercial and residential construction: the last two, while not
mainly depending on bank financing, may have been contained somewhat by
restrictions on private credit, and some restraint on trade stocks, which do
depend more on bank credit, was probable.
21.       Money supply growth was more moderate than the overall credit
expansion. Domestic prices increased only a little more than import prices



-7-
from 1976 to 1979, largely because of the spill over of domestic credit
into imports of goods and services. 1/ Since excess demand was almost
immediately reflected in balance of payments pressure, rather than in
domestic prices, the distortion in investment and production incentives
was limited. The difference between the two indexes was slight, between
1 and 2 percentage points per annum. Prices of non-tradeables did not
increase substantially faster than tradeables. This may help to explain,
for example, the shift toward residential and commercial construction.
Construction has a relatively high domestic component. On the other hand,
the relative increase of investment in these sectors may reflect more the
strong inflationary expectations (fed to some extent by the rising fiscal
deficit and credit expansion), the physical damage to buildings caused by
the 1975 cyclone, and the other factors which reduced the profitability of
new investment in the commodity producing sectors.
22.       Exchange Rate Policy.  As noted above there was a tendency
beginning in 1975 for domestic prices to rise somewhat faster than import
prices. The exchange rate had moved very little until the devaluation of
October 1979, having been formally pegged to the SDR at the rate of Rs 7.7
per SDR in January 1976. The nominal, import-weighted, effective exchange
rate remained virtually unchanged.
23.       Balance of Payments and External Financing.  The relatively slow
growth of export earnings in the second half of the decade, reflecting both
the decline in sugar prices and slow volume growth in exports, and the
acceleration in consumption and high investment, led to an increase in the
resource gap, in the balance of payments deficit on current account, and to a
need for quickly disbursing, non-project financing. These developments are
summarized in table 2.
24.       Export earnings grew by only 8 percent between 1975 and 1978.  This
performance is, in the main, attributable to depressed sugar prices, although
access to the preferential EEC market helped to soften their adverse impact.
Besides low sugar prices, export performance was also affected by the slow-
down in the growth of EPZ exports. Export earnings, however, improved
significantly in 1979, owing to a somewhat higher volume of sugar exports and
better prices, as well as the recovery of EPZ exports. Gross earnings from
tourism increased to 8 percent of current account earnings in 1979.
1/   Between 1972 and 1976, when economic growth was higher, domestic prices
increased more slowly than import prices. The change after 1976 may
simply reflect the emergence of stronger inflationary expectations as
experience with inflation continued. Additional reasons for domestic
price increases being limited during the latter part of the 1970s were
price controls on certain essential consumption items and the impact of
consumer subsidies. These are more likely, however, to have affected
the composition of price increases, than the overall rate. They may
also have had income distribution effects. The related argument that
selective price controls and food subsidies are essential to an
effective wage policy in the Mauritius political environment may have
some merit.

25.       In sharp contrast to the slow growth of exports, the import bill
went up considerably after 1975. Although the economy had been expanding, the
small domestic market offered only a limited scope for import substitution;
expansionary fiscal policies raised the demand for imports, and import prices
continued to increase. The cif cost of imports increased by 54 percent to
Rs 3,076 million between 1975 and 1978, the volume of imports rising over
this period by about 21 percent. Because of credit control and selective
restrictions, the volume of imports fell a little in 1978 and 1979. Still,
as a result of the rise in import and especially energy prices, the import
bill increased to Rs3.6 billion ($568 million) from Rs 3.1 billion ($501
million) in 1978, with a further widening of the trade deficit in 1979,
leading to a current account deficit in 1979 of Rs 895 million ($140 million),
equivalent to 13.7 percent of GDP. The most notable capital account develop-
ment was the exceptionally high net capital inflow in 1978 and 1979, mainly as



a result of Rs236 million ($37 million) and Rs 310 million ($50 million)
raised in the Euro-dollar market. The overall balance of payments deficit
nevertheless increased to Rs 318 million ($50 million) in 1979 from Rs 122
million ($20 million) in the preceding year.
26.       Debt Service.  An increased volume of quickly disbursing non-
project borrowing, on harder terms, became necessary to close the growing
overall balance of payments gap. The debt service ratio, only one percent
of export earnings in 1976, went up to 4 percent in 1979, and was projected
to rise rapidly on the basis of commitments made by the end of 1979.
Stabilization Actions, 1979 to 1981
27.       Crisis.  The trends described in the previous section had by mid-
1979 brought Mauritius to an unsustainable economic position. Despite some
success in reducing import volume in 1978 and 1979, and some success in
obtaining increased access to quickly disbursing loans, exchange losses
accelerated in 1979 and reserves fell to the equivalent of two weeks-
imports. It became evident that a more ambitious program of adjustment was
necessary to permit continued economic growth and continued access to foreign
capital on appropriate terms. The Mauritian authorities in October 1979
accordingly adopted a stabilization program, as part of a two-year stand-by
arrangement with the IMF. The alternative, as seen by the Government, would
have been to abandon its primary reliance on market-oriented forces in
channelling resources, particularly foreign exchange. A shift to primary
reliance on direct controls would, in the Government s view, have endangered
the future growth of the economy.
28.       1979/80 Program.  The stabilization program involved a 30 percent
devaluation,l/ ceilings on wage increases, restrictions on total credit
and on credit to government, interest rate increases, increases in the price
of rationed rice and wheat flour to check the growth in consumer subsidies,
and restraints on other current government expenditures. Public investment
was subjected to some restraint. Taxation on the sugar and hotel industries,
both of which benefited from the devaluation, was increased.  The standby
arrangement was for SDR73 million, of which SDR40 million was to be drawn in
1979-80 in two tranches.
29.       Some positive results were achieved in 1979/80 as a result of
the program, although the abnormally severe cyclone season of December
1979 to March 1980 gave rise to emergency food imports and to additional
public and private expenditures to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure
1/   The Mauritian  Rupee had been pegged to the SDR at Rs 7.7138 = SDR 1
since 1975. Following devaluation it became Rs 10.0 = SDR 1 in
October 1979.

and buildings. 1/ In addition the sharp increases in 1979 in oil prices
and the large increase in other import prices reduced the effectiveness of
the program in improving the balance of payments. The additional expenditures
incurred by Government made it impossible to keep within the standby ceilings
on credit. A waiver to the conditions was approved by the IMF in April 1980,
which allowed the second SDR20 million tranche to be drawn. As described
below, the standby was subsequently cancelled and replaced in Septemer 1980 by
a one-year arrangement.
30.       The 1979/80 program reduced the balance of payments deficit on
current account from about 11 to about 10 percent of GDP, reversing the trend
of previous years. This was an accomplishment, considering that the terms of
trade deteriorated slightly in that year, and that cyclone damage added to the
import bill. Moreover, this improvement was accomplished while GDP growth of
3 percent was maintained. A major contributor to the success of the 1979/80
program was the government-s policy of wage restraint. With money wage
increases being limited to about 24 percent in the year, and prices increasing
rapidly, real wages declined by about 14 percent in the year following the
October devaluation. While the increase in foreign prices at the devalued
exchange rates was not fully passed through in domestic prices, the domestic
price increase was sufficient to produce a large decline in real wages.
31.       The fact that domestic prices did not increase by the full amount of
the devaluation shows some success during 1979/80 in the control of aggregate
demand. The budget, however, did not make a significant contribution to
demand management, either on the receipts or expenditure side. The tax system
as presently structured does not respond proportionally to increases in
incomes in current prices, and is also very dependent on taxes on imports,
which fell in 1979-80. Some tax rates (export duty on sugar, hotel tax) were
increased, balanced by reductions in others; tax receipts as a percentage of
GDP declined from about 25 percent of GDP to 23 percent. Current expenditures
were reduced in real terms, partly by the subsidy cuts cited above, partly by
expenditure cuts in a variety of budget categories, and partly by holding down
appropriations despite price increases. Public capital expenditures, however,
increased by 20 percent in real terms, due partly to the need for cyclone
rehabilitation. Thus, the overall fiscal deficit remained high, almost 15
percent of GDP and only slightly lower than in the previous year.
32.       The Government borrowed heavily from the banking system, causing,
together with the overall credit ceilings, a squeeze on bank credit to the
private sector. It is this squeeze, combined with wage policy, that appears
to have been primarily responsible for limiting the expansion of aggregate
demand, so that the effects of the devaluation were not completely off-set by
1/   It should be noted that the most serious impact of the cyclones was on
the sugar crop, but the reduction of sugar exports resulting therefrom
has taken place in fiscal 1980/81.

domestic price increases. There was some reduction in private invest-
ment. However, indications are that private consumption increased at
about the same rate as GDP. This seems surprising in view of the reduction
in real wages. There was presumably some increase in real non-wage incomes,
with no evidence of a significant increase in the proportions of income
saved. Nevertheless, in 1979/80 in contrast with earlier years, the
excessive growth in total resource use was arrested, with some progress being
made in reducing the balance of payments gap.
33.       Developments in 1980/1981.  Under normal circumstances, it was
to be expected that further progress would be made in 1980/81 in reducing
the balance of payments deficit. It was, however, evident that the volume
of sugar exports would be greatly reduced as a result of cyclone damage,
which reduced the 1980 crop (harvested from July to November) from the
700,000 tons forecast to about 475,000 tons. The authorities were reluctant
to take more stringent measures to reduce aggregate demand, when GDP would be
reduced by 4 or 5 percent due to the reduction in sugar. For this reason an
increase in the current account deficit was considered to be unavoidable.
This was accepted by the IMF in the September 1980 standby arrangement.
Taking into account later estimates of crop damage, the deficit on current
account is now expected to reach about Rs 1,265 million ($160 million) in
1980/81, equivalent to about 14 percent of GDP, a substantial increase from
the previous year.
34.       The current program combines measures to meet the needs of cyclone
reconstruction with a continuation of the demand management policy of the
previous year. It includes a continued stringent wage policy. In July 1980
a 10 percent wage increase was awarded. Government policy, sanctioned by
Parliament, is that no wage increase, beyond what was awarded in July 1980,
will be awarded before July 1981. This implies a further reduction in real
wages in the current fiscal year.
35.       The budget for 1980/81 was formulated on this basis.  About half of
total recurrent expenditure is dependent on wage levels. Further reductions
in food subsidies will result from increases in prices and reductions in
ration amounts of rice and flour, and expenditure restraints have been
applied across the board. Current expenditures (excluding interest payments)
in constant prices appear to have decreased significantly. Capital expenditure
is expected to rise by about 5 to 10 percent in real terms. During 1979/80,
following devaluation, the Government realized that it could not meet all of
the capital expenditures to which it was committed under the budget as
revised. It accordingly held up expenditure in a number of areas, partly by
delaying starts on new projects and partly by reducing allocations to certain
agencies. For the 1980/81 budget it took a restrictive attitude towards
capital expenditure proposals, producing a capital budget which the IMF
considered appropriate. No major new project was included in the budget,
with the result that some projects were delayed for which partial funding had
been secured (such as the Port Louis Throughway). However, commitments under
the public sector investment program had been accelerating in the late 1970s.



- 12 -
Thus the momentum of projects already under implementation was such
that the scope for reducing actual expenditures was not great, and
certain expenditures delayed from 1979/80 were made in 1980/81. The
readjustment of investment plans to the reduced resources now available
will be reflected to some extent in 1981/82 and increasingly in
subsequent years.
36.       On the revenue side, the budget for 1980/81 imposed a 10 per-
cent surcharge on most taxes and duties, and an increase in stamp duties
on imports. With the personal income tax being excluded from the sur-
charge, and because of the reduced amounts from the sugar export levy,
the net result is a projected increase in tax receipts only slightly
greater than that in GDP. Current revenues remain below 25 percent of
GDP, again due to the impact of a lower volume of non-food imports, and
the inelasticity of the tax structure to increased incomes in current
prices. The budget deficit in 1980/81 is projected to be 14 percent of
GDP.
37.        It appears from preliminary indicators that aggregate invest-
ment as a percentage of GDP has declined in 1980/81. This reflects the
impact of declining GDP on total savings as well as the impact of restraint
exercised by credit controls on expansion of credit to the private sector.
However, there is no evidence that productive investment is being deprived
of funds. It appears that the reduction is mainly in private housing and
commercial construction, although data are inconclusive.
38.        Due to cyclones, sugar exports in 19°1 were about 470,000 tons,
one third below 1979/80, and the overall volume of exports and non-factor
services may decline by approximately 13 percent. On the payments side,
a 9 percent decline in the volume of imports is projected. Although
world sugar prices are substantially higher in 1980/81, the whole of
Mauritius' 1980 sugar crop has been sold to the EEC, at prices only
5 percent higher. Thus, the slight increase in the sugar price received,
together with increased energy and other import prices, reduced the
terms of trade by about 2 percent. On balance, the terms of trade
deterioration was a major cause of the increased balance of payments
deficit.
39.       Given the continued higher deficit in the balance of payments
in 1980/81, the need for quickly disbursing non-project assistance
remains high. In 1979/80 the IMF provided virtually all of this
assistance under its standby. In 1980/81 assistance was sought from
many sources, including members of a Consultative Group which the World
Bank organized at the request of the Mauritian authorities, while
$45 million has come from commercial sources.



- 13 -
Longer-term Impact of Stabilization Programs
40.       For the two years 1979/80 and 1980/81 together, domestic prices
appear to have increased by some 50 percent, compared with an increase in
import prices, in rupee terms, of about 60 percent. Given the undiversified
nature of the Mauritian economy, the substitution possibilities between
resources going into tradeables and non-tradeables is rather limited in the
short run. However, taking into account the wage trends noted above, the
1979 devaluation and associated policies can be expected to have raised the
incentives for producers of traded goods, particularly for sugar and other
agricultural products. The manufacturing sector and tourism, which use more
imported inputs, should also benefit to some extent. The emergence of large
balance of payments deficits in the late 1970s was not associated with a rate
of inflation greatly in excess of the rate of increase of import prices. (Consumer
prices increased by about 10 percent per annum between 1976/77 and 1978/79.) The
rather small realignment of prices suggested by the preliminary data may thus
be sufficient in correcting the past price and cost distortion. It certainly
is all that could be expected from a devaluation which is associated with
only moderately restrictive aggregate demand policies. More restrictive
policies in 1979/80 and 1980/81 would have produced lower balance of payments
deficits, but at the risk of slowing growth in 1979/80 and depressing output
even further in 1980/81.
41.       Thus the moderately restrictive demand management policies imple-
mented in the past two years have had useful results. However, in view of
the present macroeconomic situation and of current short- and medium-term
projections, the Government has now had to reassess its whole development
policy. This reassessment has led it to develop a full adjustment program,
including programs designed to increase output and exports, as well as demand
management policies. This adjustment program is described below.
PART II - THE ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
42.       The economic problems which Mauritius faces can be summarized as
follows. Externally, the current account of the balance of payments remains
in heavy deficit (14 percent of GDP in 1980/81 is forecast). Sugar, the
main export earner, has shown only a slow growth in output, while the earlier
rapid growth in export earnings in the manufacturing and tourism sectors has
not been sustained. Despite successful attempts to contain the volume of
import growth, the import bill continues to grow due to rising import prices.
Thus, Mauritius has been forced to incur substantial non-project debt to
finance the deficit. Together with the debt required to finance the much-increased
public sector investment program (see below, para 51), this would lead to a rapidly
increasing debt service ratio, which if not controlled could reach untenable
levels by the mid-1980s. Internally, despite a high tax burden (23 to 25
percent of GDP), the fiscal deficit remains untenably high (over 14 percent of
GDP), due to high public current and capital expenditures. Unemployment is
high (over 9 percent of the labour force) and is growing.



- 14 -
Program Strategy
43.       The Government has become increasingly conscious of these problems
and has formulated, in successive documents, an appropriate adjustment program.
In mid-1980 it published an interim development plan covering the years 1980'S1
through 1982/83; in addition, a sector and macro-economic framework has been
designed covering the period through 1984/85. It further refined the program
in its submission of October 1980 to the Consultative Group, and subsequently
in discussions with the appraisal mission and with the IMF. The program is
summarized in table 10 (pages 45-48), and described in the Statement of
Development Policy (distributed separately). Basic to the new approach is a
realistic assessment of what is feasible in the way of economic growth, given
the basic trends operating in the economy and the instruments available to
government to accelerate growth, under the likely external conditions. The
program includes studies in the major sectors to develop measures which can
be the basis for further accelerated growth in the mid-1980s.
44.       The Government's plans for the next few years appropriately call for
the maintenance of the 3 to 3 1/2 percent growth rate achieved in recent years,
rather than an increase. The Government appreciates that a primary objective
of policy is to reduce the external deficit on current account in the next five
years. The pace at which the external deficit is to be reduced is critical.
Current thinking is to reduce the current account deficit from about 12 percent
of GDP in 1979-80 to about 8 percent in 1984-85, and for policies to be
adopted to keep the debt service ratio below about 15 percent in normal years.
Given the high dependence of the Mauritian economy on imports and constraints
to growth of exports, any drastic reduction in the current account deficit
would have required very severe controls over aggregate demand, including a
continued large reduction in real wages, and a precipitous decline in the
fiscal deficit. It would require massive cuts in social programs and capital
expenditures. It would involve heavy social and economic costs, including
steeply rising unemployment. Nonetheless, such drastic action will become
unavoidable if external capital can not be made available in relatively large
amounts, thereby permitting a gradual process of adjustment.
45.       The adjustment program is expected to maintain investment at a
level sufficient to maintain a growth rate between about 3 and 3.5 percent,
by adopting policies which will produce more output than in the past for a
given volume of investment. The volume of investment will decline, per-
mitting capital goods imports to be reduced. This strategy requires reduction
in investment in less productive sectors, and increasing to some extent
investment in sugar, manufacturing, energy, water supply, and other agriculture.
In some areas there is excess capacity which can be used. These policies
will sustain export growth at a moderate pace, while reducing imports.
Aggregate demand policies will be geared to maintaining savings rates and
limiting the growth in consumption, both private and public. Growth in
current public expenditure will be restrained, partly by wage policy, partly
by limiting growth in public sector employment, and partly by direct measures
to restrict growth or to cut spending in certain areas. Government action in
the past two fiscal years in limiting new starts on public sector investment



- 15 -
projects will reduce growth in public capital spending. Actions to be taken
in connection with future budgets will be targeted to produce, as explained
below, a reduction of public investment from 13 percent of GDP in 1979/80 to
about 9 percent in 1984/85. The action plan is designed to increase both
output and the attractiveness of investment in sectors oriented towards
exports or import substitution, and to reduce investment in residential
construction. The adjustment process is summarized in the following table,
using 1978/79 as the base year.

46.       The likely contribution of major sectors to growth of output
until 1984/85 is set out in table 4 below. These estimates and projections
reflect the likely growth of sugar production, progress of import substitution
in agriculture, industrial expansion and the development of tourism as a
result of the proposed investment program and policies. Following fluctua-
tions caused by the weather-induced steep drop in sugar output during 1980/81,
the primary production growth rate will vary between 3 and 4 percent annually,
with food production increasing more rapidly than sugar. Manufacturing at
present accounts for about 12 percent of GDP; yet it is the sustained and
relatively rapid expansion of industrial output, including production for
exports, which significantly strengthens secondary sector growth. Residential
and commercial construction is expected to decline. Although the contribution
of manufacturing to GDP is, as yet, not very large, while that of tourism
(about 3 percent) remains rather small, both subsectors have substantial
potential for further growth. Manufacturing and tourism could well grow at a
faster rate than is projected provided the relevant action programs are
implemented vigorously.

47.       The Government-s plans for the next few years explicitly recognize
that there is little prospect of reducing unemployment in the next few years
with the growth projections summarized above. The key sector with potential
for expanding employment is manufacturing where some 2,000 jobs could be
created annually. The Government plans to limit the expansion in government



- 17 -
employment. In the period of the adjustment program, pressures to reduce
unemployment by adding to the public sector payroll, and for increased
consumption both for public services and private consumption, will be intense.
Government is aware that these pressures will be serious, but intends to
maintain its position.
48.       Wages and Incomes Policy.  In order to achieve the very slow growth
in consumption consistent with reducing the current account deficit, wage
policy must continue to be stringently applied. Annual wage negotiations
between Government and unions set the level of wage increases for both public
and private sectors. They are based on cost of living increases in the
preceding twelve months. Government policy has the objective of keeping wage
increases to less than the combined result of the rate of inflation and a
1 percent presumed increase in productivity. The Government has been sur-
prisingly outspoken in this vital area of policy, and, as noted above, was very
successful in slowing wage growth in 1978/79, and then in reducing real wages
in the past two years, to the 1977/78 level. It is embarked on a similar
course in 1981. The Government has been aided to some extent by the labor
supply situation, and also by the public recognition that the country had to
adjust to the losses imposed by cyclone damage. However, the wage negotiations
to be held in July, 1981 will present special problems. The Government will
no longer be able to ask for sacrifices due to cyclone damage. In addition,
whenever wage negotiations are based on cost of living increases, it is
difficult to avoid an increase in real wages in a year of decelerating price
increases which follows rapid inflation. The cost of living may have increased
by 20 to 30 percent in the reference period of 1980/81, but will increase much
less in 1981/82. If wage rates were to increase by only half as much as the
cost of living in the past year, this would mean an increase of real wages of
up to 6 percent in 1981/82, assuming import prices rising at about 8 percent.
Thus it will be difficult to contain consumption. Appropriate fiscal policy
is essential to restrain consumption and to generate needed revenue. The
Government and the IMF are discussing these matters in the context of the
ongoing and proposed new stand-by arrangements.
49.       In 1982/83, the wage negotiations will be on the basis of a consumer
price index which reflects a boost provided by the sales tax increase. It
will thus again be necessary to make only partial adjustment for the past
increases in prices. Should money wages again increase substantially faster
than prices, Mauritius would again face serious macroeconomic problems. The
Government s response to such a contingency cannot be determined in advance,
but in addition to intensification of monetary and fiscal policies, much
stronger political pressure might arise for more stringent import and other
direct controls.
50.       In order for the wage policy and other politically unpopular mea-
sures to continue to be effective, it will be important for the Government to
establish and maintain a consensus on general economic policy. These measures
will be accepted more easily if set in the framework of a broad-based incomes
policy aimed at restraining non-wage incomes as well as wages. The Government
plans to set up, during 1981, a National Economic Council, composed of
Government, labor and management representatives, in which economic policy and
problems could be discussed, and the role of wage policy would be-placed in
proper perspective.



- 18 -
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP)
51.       An essential element of the adjustment program is a reduction
in public investment consistent with growth objectives, and a redirection
of investment towards economic infrastructure, particularly for maintenance
and rehabilitation. The public sector in Mauritius does not play a major
role as a producer in industry, agriculture (apart from tea), or commerce,
so that public sector investment is dominated by infrastructure and the
social sectors. Public sector capital expenditure rose rapidly from 5
percent of GDP in 1973 to about 12 percent on average in the past three
years, about one-third of total investment. (To some extent, the public
sector capital expenditure figure overestimates actual investment, since
between about 10 and 20 percent of the capital budget has in recent years
been for purposes which fall into a grey area between low-yielding
investment undertaken mainly to create employment, and expenditure on
direct work relief.) As table 5 shows, the sectoral composition of public
sector investment has also changed considerably in recent years. Notable
are: (i) the increasing importance of investment on education, health
and housing, from 5 percent of total public sector investment in FY74 to
25 percent in FY79, and (ii) the high level of development works expenditure,
relatively low-priority investments carried out mainly to provide employment.
Investment in basic infrastructure (that is transport, telecommunications,
power, water and sewerage) has remained about 20 percent of total in most
years.
52.      The PSIP for the current fiscal year, for the next two years of
the indicative plan, and projections for the following 2 years, are
summarized in table 6.  Both in size and composition, it is reasonably
appropriate to cover Mauritius- major infrastructure needs. Public sector
capital expenditure will rise to about 15 percent of GDP in 1980/81, and
slowly decline to 9 percent of GDP in 1984/85. The allocations in current
prices assume that wage policy as described above is successfully implemented.
The planned sector composition shows a marked shift away from the social
sectors, with education and health requiring little further capital
expenditure since facilities are now reasonable, and with housing showing a
rapid decline after 1980/81 (which will be the peak year for public sector
housing projects). Expenditure on transport, telecommunications, power,
water and sewerage will rise from 36 percent of the total in 1980/81 to 51
percent in 1984/85. Agriculture and rural development will account for
between 14 and 18 percent of GDP.
53.       Among the more significant components of the PSIP are the power,
water, road and agriculture sectors, in each of which important projects
are under consideration.

(i) A major hydroelectric project has just started, to provide
needed generating capacity. This project, and the power
distribution project which the World Bank is financing,
will together account for well over 10 percent of the PSIP
in 1981/82 and 1982/83. An additional, unidentified energy
project is programmed to start in 1983/84. The Government
is studying whether further power supplies needed can most
economically be provided by investment in upgrading existing
sugar mill generating plant. If this proves feasible,
lower investment in the sector would be needed in 1983/84
than at present planned.
(ii) The proposed investment in the road sector is of lower
priority. Mauritius has a good basic road network; road
congestion is not a major handicap to the economy. Thus the
Government has postponed the $25 mn Port Louis Through Road,
and other road investment,although undoubtedly some
of these projects should be implemented when resources
permit.
(iii) Investment in the urban water sector is urgently needed,
to rehabilitate and to expand the present distribution
system. In some areas distribution losses are at present
as high as 90 percent. Projects in the PSIP should
supply the most immediate needs, but only when this work
is further advanced will it be possible to assess needs
for future investment.
(iv) The most important investment planned in the agriculture
sector is a small-holder irrigation project, of which the
first stage is now being carried out with British assistance.
The second stage is now being prepared and seems to be well
justified, although financing is not yet completed. Some
investment in the tea industry may also be needed.
(v) Over 10 percent of the PSIP is for the Development Works
component (see paragraph 93), even after allowing for some
reorganization of the Development Works program.
54.          In general the Government is relatively well-equipped to
analyze projects and to make decisions about investment priorities.
It would however be desirable to strengthen the units responsible for
project analysis in the Ministries of Planning and Finance by arranging for
some of their staff to have training in project analysis. Of the major



- 22 -
spending ministries and agencies, some appear to need strengthening in
project preparation and administration, while others appear reasonably
well-staffed for the purpose. The Government has been reasonably successful
in the past in resisting pressures to go forward with big, politically
attractive projects of low priority. It intends to continue carefully to
scrutinize the costs and benefits of projects and will consult the Bank
before including in the budget for 1981/82 and 1982/83 any project not now
in the PSIP, whose total cost exceeds Rs 100 million. The Bank would be
expected to comment on the merits of such a project and its consistency
with the overall financing plan. Priority will continue to be given to
economically essential infrastructure, especially for the export industry or
other sectors contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings. The
Government has stated it will continue to include in the PSIP only those
projects whose economic, financial and technical justifications have been
carefully analyzed on the basis of generally accepted principles of project
analysis. The Government and the Bank will together review the criteria
used.
55.       In view of the need to trim the PSIP, the Government has decided
not to include in the list of projects at present two other major projects
whose economic feasibility is as yet uncertain, a new international airport,
and an oil refinery. These projects would be reconsidered if full foreign
financing became available on concessional terms. They would not be
included in the PSIP without consultation with the Bank, since their costs
would exceed Rs 100 million, and unless they met appropriate investment
criteria.
56.       Problem Areas in Capital Budget.  In three areas of the capital
budget, the Government recognizes that special problems call for substantial
reform. These are the public housing sector, about 10 percent of the capital
budget, the Government's "Development Works" program, over 10 percent, and
tea, about 5 percent (see paragraphs 85, 90 and 93). In each of these sectors,
expenditures have been larger than necessary to obtain high priority
benefits. The issue is complicated by the fact that in tea and the
development works program the Government has in the past considered one of
the primary objectives to be the creation of employment, and heavy invest-
ment in the public housing sector has been one of the major elements in the
Government's social program. The Government now recognizes that some re-
structuring of goals is required, with less emphasis on employment creation
and more emphasis on productivity and efficiency.  It has stated that,
taking these three (mainly capital budget) items together with capital and
recurrent expenditure on education (see paragraph 60), its objective would
be to reduce actual expenditure in 1981/82 to below the 1980/81 budget
level (which implies a constant price reduction of about 15 percent), and
to apply further reductions measured in constant prices in 1982/83.
Similar reductions are reflected in the projections for 1983/84 and
1984/85.



- 23 -
Financing Plan for PSIP
57.       The Government's overall plans for current and capital revenue and
expenditure for 1981/82 and 1982/83 (the indicative plan), and projections for
1983/84 and 1984/85 are shown in table 7. This table constitutes the financing
plan for the PSIP. In order for the PSIP, as outlined above, to be financed
within an appropriate macroeconomic framework, the Government will need to
make efforts to maximize public savings. This will require a continuation of
the policy, already initiated under the stabilization program, of restraining
current expenditures not related to development, as well as the rapid introduc-
tion of additional tax measures. The increasing role that fiscal policy must
play, if the control of aggregate demand is to make its proper contribution
to reducing the balance of payments deficit, is reflected in the planned
reduction in the fiscal deficit. A tentative allowance was made for the
impact on revenues of tax incentive measures to stimulate exports; the
Government has taken into account in its allocation of bank credit the needs
of the private sector for increasing access to domestic credit. While
restraining within narrow limits expenditures for the social services,
consistent with maintaining good provision of basic needs, the plan allows
for certain increases in current expenditure which are complementary to the
PSIP.
58.       Current expenditures.  As a result of the stabilization program,
current expenditures declined from 28 percent of GDP in 1978/79 to 25 percent
in 1979/80. This was mostly due to the success of wage policy, which affects
wage and salary payments, social security contributions, public service
pensions and transfers to local authorities. Government plans call for a
reduction in current expenditures to 20 percent of GDP by 1984/85. This
assumes that wage policy will be successful in keeping wage increases below
the increase in consumer prices, and that public employment growth will be
reduced to about 1 percent per annum, from the average of recent years of
between 3 and 4 percent.
59.       Subsidies and transfers in 1979/80 were about 11 percent of current
public expenditure. The authorities intend to maintain food subsidies (for
rice and flour) constant in money terms at the 1980/81 level of Rs173 million.
The Government has shown its resolve in this field in the recent past when it
doubled retail prices of the two subsidized food items, while at the same time
reducing ration amounts by 20 percent. The latest round of price increases
brought the price of flour and rice to some 40 percent below import cost.   In
order to reach their budgetary target on food subsidies, the authorities will
at least have to let rice and flour prices rise with world market prices. It
may also be necessary further to reduce entitlements. The indicative plan
also calls for abolishing subsidies to the Central Water Authority (CWA) by
1982/83 (0.5 percent of total recurrent expenditure). This is to be accom-
plished through increasing water tariffs to allow CWA to cover its operating
costs, thus continuing the development begun in 1979. The Government intends
also to maintain family allowances unchanged in current prices throughout the

projection period, coupled with better channeling of the benefits to the
target group.
60.       The education sector constitutes a special problem for bringing
the budget deficit under control and in reducing social expenditures which
are cost-inefficient. Education expenditures represent 16 percent of current
government expenditures, and expanded greatly during the 1970s. Current
policies would lead to a continued increase in education costs, for rather
limited educational benefits. We have been engaged for some time in a
dialogue with the Government about its educational policies. It is
important that sector policies be revised to reduce the growth of education
spending, and if possible to make reductions in real terms, as could in
principle be done without reducing the coverage or quality of education. The
Government is formulating a program of selective cuts, composed of the
following measures: (a) for gradually phasing out sub-standard private
secondary schools, which are all financed from the budget, and increasing the
utilization of Government junior secondary schools; (b) increasing the number
of pupils per teacher, and restricting entry into the teaching profession;
(c) restricting access to Government junior and senior secondary schools to
pupils who have passed the Primary Leaving Certificate and Form III national
examinations respectively; and (d) providing oriental language teaching only
in primary schools where numbers of students are adequate for this to be done
economically.
61.       Current Revenues.  In 1981/82, the Government intends to increase
tax revenue through a series of measures it has discussed with us and the
IMF. It also proposes various measures to improve tax collection. The
Government plans to introduce a sales tax in 1981/82, to convert many
specific excise duties to ad valorem to make yields reflect price changes, and
to rationalize the duties. The estimates of current receipts take into
account the effects of the additional tax incentives for the industrial
sector (paragraph 74). Allowance is also made for other tax incentives now
under consideration.
62.       The Government has recognized that it is essential to maintain
revenue performance, stating that it attaches great importance to
minimizing the fiscal deficit, both by restraining expenditure and by
ensuring an adequate level of revenue. It recognizes that the present
projections include relatively high deficits and states it will make every
effort to reduce them further. It expects that revenues, as a proportion
of GDP, will remain in the region of 25 percent during the period as a
whole. The Government is studying tax policy and implementation issues
with technical assistance from the Fund. We have reviewed these questions
in detail with the IMF which will monitor developments.
63.       Budget Savings and Fiscal Deficit.  On the basis of the Government s
present tax and current expenditure projections, the recurrent budget will
continue in deficit in 1981/82 and have only a marginal surplus subsequently.



- 26 -
The overall deficit as a percentage of GDP is likely to be about 14 percent.
The current revenue and expenditure projections for 1981/82 and subsequent
years incorporate on the one hand the likely impact of additional revenue
measures, such as the eventual introduction of sales tax, rationalization
of the structure of indirect taxes, and strengthening of tax administration,
and, on the other hand, of further measures to restrain the growth of current
expenditures. Such measures will be discussed in detail between the
Government and the IMF, as well as in appropriate cases with the Bank. The
projected revenue effort and expenditure levels are, however, well within
feasible limits, and may thus leave scope for further taxation or economies,
should need arise.
64.       Domestic Borrowing.  The monetary framework underlying table 7
makes allowance for the planned increase in foreign exchange reserves, and
the additional use of Fund resources (see paragraph 107). Domestic borrowing
plans are predicated on the assumption that with continuation of inflation at
international rates, domestic interest rates will be maintained at a level
which encourages broad money (M2) to continue to grow at rates slightly
higher than GDP in current prices. Private credit is to expand also at this
rate. This should assure that with the more favorable set of investment
incentives, high priority private investment and working capital needs will
be accommodated.
65.          External Finance.  The external financing shown as "Drawing
against new commitments" is based on the PSIP as summarized above. It
makes realistic assumptions about project financing to be expected from
donor agencies, based on their expressed intentions. Some local cost
financing by donor agencies is assumed, as in the past; suppliers credits
will continue to be used where appropriate.
66.       Financing Gap.  The residual needs for financing the PSIP - the
financing gap - will accordingly be a function of all of the above factors,
that is of the tax effort, of the success of control of government spending,
and of government's success in obtaining project financing. The needs can,
in our view, be met from external non-project borrowing from commercial
banks, governments, and international agencies.
67.       Debt Management.  The Government recognizes that, with the rapid
increase now taking place in the scale of its public debt, it needs to
develop its debt management machinery. We are discussing with the Government
how we can help them to formalize and to expand the arrangements they now
have to maintain data on public debt, to project debt-service obligations and
to advise on debt management.
Action Program, by Sectors
68.        The sectoral strategy does not call for an immediate, major
transformation in the structure of economic growth. Actions by Government
are required, however, if some of the unfavorable forces which have become



- 27 -
evident in the late 1970s are to be overcome, if some new favorable factors
in the situation are to be properly exploited, and if an adequate base is to
be established for a more substantial shift toward industrial exports in a
later period.
69.       Manufacturing Industry.  The private sector is the vehicle for
industrial development; state enterprises control less than 2 percent of
total industrial production. Enterprises producing primarily for the domestic
market are almost entirely Mauritian owned, but many export-oriented enter-
prises have a substantial foreign participation. While local ownership in
small establishments is relatively well dispersed, many larger establishments
belong to a few powerful groups, which also have substantial interests in the
sugar industry or in trading activities.
70.       The two main incentive schemes offered by Government to attract
industrial investment are:
(i)  The Development Certificate (DC) Scheme, introduced in 1964,
provides selected import-substituting enterprises with
significant tax and duty exemptions. Over 200 companies
have benefitted from the scheme, particularly in food and
beverages, textiles and garments, chemical products,
iron and steel, and tourism. This scheme has been success-
ful in developing industry for the domestic market and tourist
facilities. Most of the certificates issued have now expired.
Domestic manufacturing industry employs about 15,000 people
(excluding small firms), of which present and former DC
industrial enterprises employ some 6,600.
(ii)  Under the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Scheme, introduced
in 1971, enterprises setting up factories to sell their
entire output outside Mauritius are eligible for Export
Enterprise certificates, by which they are granted a
company tax holiday on retained earnings for 10 years
with a possible extension to 20 years, tax-free
dividends in the first five years and exemption of duty
for imports of machinery and equipment. Other benefits
offered include free repatriation of profits, liberal
work permits for specialist expatriate staff, and export
financing at preferential rates. Priority was initially
given by Government to labor-intensive industries, and to
those which introduced new technology and marketing skills.
Local participation in equity is encouraged. As of
September 30, 1980, the 98 EPZ companies in operation
employed some 22,000 people; textiles and garments (48
firms), jewelry, electronics, diamond cutting, watches,
toys and plastic goods are the major industries
represented.



- 28 -
71.       Cost-benefit analyses conducted on a sample of firms indicate that
both schemes have been of net benefit for Mauritius.   Employment creation,
while substantial in the EPZ companies, has been limited among the generally
more capital-intensive firms producing for the domestic market. Because
of sluggish demand, many firms are operating at less than full capacity. In
the latter part of 1979 and the first part of 1980, the EPZ has shown renewed
growth. Between January 1979 and September 1980, 22 new companies opened and
seven closed. EPZ employment increased by some 20 percent, or over 4,000,
which represented almost all of the new employment in Mauritius in this
period. EPZ value-added in current prices increased by 35 percent in 1979, a
real increase of about 20 percent, and exports by 65 percent, to $90 million,
a real increase of about 40 percent. Preliminary indications for 1980 show a
continued increase. On the other hand, industry producing for the domestic
market has stagnated during this period, with a slight fall in employment and
in real output. Applications for new Export Enterprises and Development
Certificates continue to be received and approved at a satisfactory rate.
72.       We estimate that industrial exports (both from the EPZ and other
sources) will grow at about 8 percent p.a. between 1979 and 1985. This may
well be on the low side if the action plan described below is put into place
and implemented speedily. Industrialists in Mauritius indicate that the
market impediments to export growth are being overcome by modifying product
lines and exploiting new markets. With greater assistance from the Government
as planned, this process can be accelerated. The internal transport problems
which were hindering double shift operations and further utilization of
capacity are being overcome. Developments in Singapore, Hongkong, and Taiwan
appear to be giving lower-cost countries like Mauritius greater scope, off-
setting at least to some extent the reduction in the comparative advantages
which Mauritius formerly enjoyed for exports to the EEC.
73.       The devaluation of 1979 and the subsequent wage restraint, combined
with the increase in unemployment and greater labor discipline, have created
a climate favorable to future industrial growth. Indications from several
industrialists were that they now found it less difficult than in the past to
recruit labour, and that the net effect of devaluation had been beneficial to
them. The recently completed and very successful investments in the port of
Port Louis, which have greatly speeded operations, have removed a bottleneck
for industry, which has also contributed to the improved climate for investors.
Air transport, to which industrialists turned when the port became congested,
is advantageous for some products and operates efficiently.
74.       The action program for the industrial sector consists of a wide
variety of measures. The package of measures as a whole, if implemented
vigorously, is thought likely to produce a considerable increase in activity.
No one measure can be singled out as being substantially more important than
the others, and it is impossible to quantify the effects of any individual
measure.
(i) Double taxation agreements have recently been reached with
Germany (in 1978), France and the UK. They in effect extend,
for tax payers from these countries who invest in Mauritius,



- 29 -
the benefit of the Mauritian tax-holiday provisions to the
taxes they pay in their home countries. This is a substan-
tial benefit, which has already led to renewed interest on
the part of German investors, and is expected to stimulate
British and French investors equally. A similar agreement
with India is under discussion, while Mauritius intends to
seek agreements with Japan, Taiwan and Singapore this year.
(ii) The Government and private sector representatives are
jointly studying the effects on industry of the system of
administrative controls, which are claimed to be time
consuming for businessmen and somewhat arbitrary in their
operation.
(iii) Intensified efforts are being made to promote Mauritius
to potential investors, and also to promote Mauritian
exports. A consultant firm will shortly be appointed,
with EEC finance, to represent Mauritius in the UK in
seeking investors: the date of its appointment is
dependent on a financing decision by the EEC. A
promotion mission is shortly to visit Singapore, Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
(iv) An export credit guarantee scheme will be inaugurated on
April 29, 1981. The absence of such a scheme has
discouraged exporters from exploring new markets,
especially for example in neighbouring countries and the
Middle East, as well as causing losses in a few cases in
traditional markets for small firms ill able to absorb
such losses. Government will meet administrative costs
of the scheme for five years, and will guarantee the scheme
against loss.
(v) The Government amended the EPZ legislation in July 1980,
inter alia to make automatic (instead of as previously
discretionary) the extension of the tax holiday from the
first ten years of a firm's operation, so that from the
eleventh to the fifteenth year 50 percent of income is
tax-exempt, and from the sixteenth to the twentieth year,
25 percent. This is a useful step in that it makes more
certain the environment in which an EPZ firm operates.
Further tax incentives to individual investors are being
considered, and legislation is planned for the current
session of the Legislative Assembly.
(vi) Measures are being studied to stimulate exports by firms other
than those in the EPZ,and the Government hopes to introduce
legislation this session. Incentive tax credits are
proposed, related to incremental exports of such firms.
In addition, for firms who benefit neither from EPZ nor
Development Certificates, the Government is considering a



- 30 -
proposal to allow duty-free import of goods to be used
for export production. Other means of stimulating
exports, such as through the Mauritian trading houses,
are also being considered.
(vii)  The Government is establishing a Central Training Office
to coordinate and to promote training for industry. The
office will probably develop a training levy scheme; if
it prepares appropriate recommendations it could be the
focus for a World Bank-financed education and training
project. The Bank has some reservations about the way in
which the Office has been placed under the control of the
Ministry of Education, and it remains to be seen whether
it will prove sufficiently responsive to the needs of
industry.
(viii)  There is a need to decentralize industry and to provide
serviced land for industrial development. The existing
industrial estates are filling up. A National Physical
Development Planning Unit is being set up in the Ministry
of Planning (under the Urban Loan, No. 1926). As part of
its work it will assess this need and how to meet it, for
example through serviced land or new industrial estates.
The existing industrial estate unit in the Development Bank
of Mauritius would need strengthening, if it is decided to
build additional estates, as we believe to be desirable. Al-
ternatively, a separate unit might be set up to handle both
existing and new estates: Government is reviewing these
arrangements.
(ix)   Mauritius has 23 public holidays a year.  The Government
recognizes that the large number hampers productivity
and increases industrial costs. Although an official
committee has recommended a reduction, Cabinet has not been
prepared to make the politically difficult decision of which
days should no longer be observed.
75.       Medium and long term credit is available for industrial
development. The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) has benefited from five
World Bank lending operations, as well as from loans from other sources, while
commercial banks also provide term loans. Investment credit is partially free
from the credit ceilings, in that DBM is not subject to them, and the 1980 IMF
Stand-by Agreement specifically exempts term lending by commercial banks
refinanced by DBM (DBM can use up to $2 million of the fifth Bank loan, No.
1789 of 1980, to refinance term loans by commercial banks). However, a major
set of issues with respect to industrial policy is that relating to the
availability to the EPZ of credit for working capital. The maximum interest
rate for short-term lending to EPZ firms was,until January 1981, 11.75 percent,
compared with the substantially higher rates charged to commercial borrowers.
It has now been increased to 12.5 percent, which may still be low. Some EPZ
firms (but not all) say they are restricted in their operations by lack of
credit; the EPZ Association and some bankers believe that in the coming months



- 31 -
credit in Mauritius will become increasingly tight as the banks approach the
lending ceiling, and that EPZ firms will suffer most. The authorities believe
that few impediments to expansion of industrial exports arise on the credit
side, beyond the export credit problems which should be eased by the establish-
ment of the export credit guarantee scheme. The Minister of Finance has
instructed the banks to give preference to exporters in allocating credit. A
study of the entire interest rate structure is underway, with assistance from
an IMF adviser, and will be discussed with the IMF and the Bank. We will
monitor the steps the Government takes to ensure credit is available to
industry.
76.       The measures affecting industry, supplementing the major impact
of the 1979 devaluation and the continued wage controls, should contribute
to maintaining the renewed growth the EPZ has shown in the recent past and
to creating the framework for accelerated growth. The Government's strategy
and policy framework for industrial development are generally suitable. The
main factors affecting industrial growth will be the degree of success in
maintaining competitiveness with other countries which seek to attract export
processing industry, and the vigour with which it seeks investors and markets
for its exports. There is no evidence of other major factors, under the
control of the Mauritian Authorities, which could reasonably be adjusted to
make a substantial change in the environment within which industry operates.
The Government plans to study further the industrial sector, policies and
prospects, and how those prospects might be enhanced. It seeks the Bank-s
advice and assistance in defining and carrying out this work, for which it
may seek UNDP finance. The study will in particular include: (a) whether the
EPZ and Development Certificate schemes might at some stage be replaced by a
more general scheme, covering all industry in Mauritius; (b) how to increase
the Mauritian value-added component of Mauritian exports without reducing
their competitiveness; (c) whether aspects of the Mauritian system of banking
and financial services (which are already relatively sophisticated) need
further development to facilitate industrial development; and (d) effective
rates of protection for local manufacture. The results of this study are
expected to contribute to refining and extending the structural adjustment
program.
77.       Agriculture.  The Government has not adopted ambitious targets for
the expansion of sugar output, which is to grow from 688,000 tons in 1979/80
to 740,000 in 1984/85, only 1.5 percent p.a. This slow growth is not above
the past rate, except for the last few years, a period of special difficulty
for the industry. It should be possible to maintain this growth as a result
of increased use of ripeners (which allow the harvest to be lengthened
without loss of sucrose content), the completion of the Northern Plains
(Stage I) irrigation project in 1983/84 (which will benefit small planters),
a continuing small increase in the estates' share of the cultivated area, and
an increase in small planter yields.
78.       A very substantial part of the increase in output, perhaps as
much as 70 percent, is expected to come from the efforts of the integrated
estates and the large planters, and 30 percent from the small planters. The



- 32 -
integrated estates and the large planters are in a better position to apply
ripeners (aerial spraying is required, a technique not adapted to use by
small planters), but increased production through application of other tech-
nical improvements can only be slow at best. The small planters, on the other
hand, who are in a poor position to apply ripeners, have a much greater
potential to increase yields. The tonnage figure of 740,000 for 1984/85
implies, according to our calculations that on a somewhat reduced area small
planters will increase output by about 8 percent over a 5 year period, in
addition to the output due to the Northern Plains Irrigation Project. The
Government action program is centered primarily on these small planters,
whose performance in the past has been disappointing. A continued small
expansion of the area cultivated by integrated estates is likely so long
as profits from sugar operations at the margin are adequately maintained.
Thus growth in sugar output, as well as all operations using hired labor,
could be greatly affected if wage policies now being applied could not be
continued.
79.         The Government intends to promote among small planters introduction
of higher yielding varieties of cane, more effective use of fertilizers, and
the shortening of the period between replantings. Ministry of Agriculture
services will be deployed to this end. Credit facilities, particularly for
replanting (shortening ratoons) are provided by the Sugar Planters Development
Fund and by the Development Bank of Mauritius. The likely impact of these
measures on small planter yields is uncertain. There are many small planters
who are little concerned with their farm as a business enterprise, and who
will not be very responsive. Among these farmers there is a strong tendency
to accept minimum revenue in return for minimum effort. The Government must
seek to identify areas where a large percentage of the small farmers are
responsive to advice, technical assistance and credit, and focus service
programs on such areas.
80.       In the sugar sector, in both the short and medium terms, there are
key policy issues that Government must face. It has decided to establish a
Commission of Enquiry on Sugar to study these issues, to report by mid-1983.
To prepare for the work of the Commission, the Government will set up a unit
in the Ministry of Planning for which it seeks technical assistance from the
Bank. The objectives and principle issues to be addressed are covered in the
Statement of Development Policy. They include (a) the structure and basis of
taxation affecting the industry including the aspects of contribution to
government revenue and the impact of the tax burden on different parts of the
industry, (b) how to balance efficiency and the need for power generating
capacity from the sugar industry, against employment considerations in
restructuring the milling capacities of the industry, (c) improvement of
labor efficiency and of small-planter production, (d) how to reduce
fragmentation of holdings and the economics of different land uses, (e) how
to improve sucrose extraction rates and (f) how to improve water utilization.
Detailed terms of reference will be worked out with the Bank.



- 33 -
81.       Demand for foodstuffs in 1979/80 was about Rs 1320 million ($170
million). In normal production years food imports meet about 80 percent of
Mauritius's consumption requirements. Assuming demand to increase with
population, it would reach about Rs 1440 million (in 1979/80 prices) by
1984/85. Import substitution programs are being designed to provide for this
additional demand, as well as to replace some of the existing food imports.
The Government's food production targets, with the notable exception of rice,
appear feasible. The prospects for rice remain uncertain, mainly because the
profitability of production on a larger scale is yet to be demonstrated. The
Government has decided to reevaluate the rice program. Marketing policy and
institutional capability are believed to be major constraints to increased
food production.
82.       The outlook for expansion of food production has been brightened
by the greater interest and involvement of integrated sugar estates in
product diversification and new investment opportunities. This has taken the
form of more intensive use of sugar cane land by growing food crops or animal
feed in crop interlines, and of increasing investment in capital-intensive
meat production. Some increase in interlining by other sugar planters,
particularly the larger ones, can also be expected.
83.       The details of the action plan in the agriculture sector remain to
be clarified, in particular concerning tax incentives proposed, pricing policy,
and the small public sector investment proposals recently made by the Ministry
of Agriculture. We will continue to work with the Government on defining
policies in the sector, with a view to including an appropriate package in
a possible second SAL. Government has appointed a series of joint committees,
including private sector representatives, to study specific policies, measures
and issues relating to the different agriculture subsectors (other than sugar
and tea). It expects to develop a revised agriculture plan of action for
discussion with the Bank by December 31, 1981.
84.       The Government recognizes that its action plan must include measures
to ensure that farmers can expect realistic price levels. While present and
prospective prices are on the whole favorable, wider participation would be
encouraged by a clear public definition of the pricing policy of the Agricul-
tural Marketing Board and other agencies. In the Statement of Development
Policy, Government has noted that the Board's guaranteed minimum prices are
reviewed periodically to ensure farmers an adequate profit margin, taking
into account production costs, relative prices, and international price
levels. To date the activities of the Board have been properly conceived but
the range of commodities covered needs to be slowly expanded on the basis of
careful study. Expansion of meat and dairy production is particularly
important. The recent advance in the guaranteed producer price for milk has
greatly improved market prospects. Beef prices are now stronger, and the
medium and longer term outlook for international beef prices is generally
favorable.



- 34 -
85.       Mauritius' second largest export crop is tea.  Of the 10,000 acres
cultivated with tea, the public sector Tea Development Authority (TDA) culti-
vates about 3000, and maintains another 1300 acres which were intended for
leasing to smallholders. It also handles the tea produced by some 1200
smallholders grouped into eight cooperative societies who lease another 2600
acres from TDA.   Thus some 70 percent of the area under tea is in the public
domain. Much of this land was planted with tea by TDA, which had been set up
for this purpose in 1970, with support of an IDA credit (No. 239 of 1971).
TDA has had a history of serious problems of inadequate management, over-
manning and poor training, leading to extremely low productivity, to pro-
duction well below potential in terms of quantity and quality, and to serious
financial difficulties. The Government transferred to TDA Rs67 mn (over
$8 mn) in 1980/81 to meet operating losses, for current maintenance
expenditures and, to some extent, for investment. The Government has now
projected expenditures decreasing by about 8 percent per annum in real prices
in later years, instead of its earlier expectations of constant expenditure
in real terms.
86.       Following reports of committees established during 1979 and 1980,
the Government has now instituted reforms in TDA's structure, and replaced
its senior management. Reforms involve a separation of TDA, with three
productive entities based on the tea factories concentrating on a nucleus of
the best land, which will employ only manpower needed for that nucleus,
leaving the remaining land to be cultivated mainly with crops other than tea.
TDA will need to mechanize its operations to a degree, in view of the wage
rates now prevailing in Mauritius, and so will require further investment
capital. Arrangements for exploiting the non-tea land remain to be worked
out. It must be recognized that laying off public employees, even those for
whom there is no work, can never be easy, so that overall reductions in
public expenditure on the tea sector and on the people and land who are at
present linked to the TDA, cannot be expected to be attained rapidly.
We will continue to work with the Government on developments in the area.
87.       Energy.  Net of the energy production and consumption of the sugar
industry, Mauritius depends heavily on imported oil, which accounts for some
90 percent of energy use. Oil imports, about 200,000 tons of oil equivalent
(toe) costing about $85 million in 1980, represent some 15 percent of total
imports and perhaps 10 percent of GDP. The other main sources are hydro-power
(30 percent of electricity generated) and bagasse. Sugar factories make
extensive use of bagasse, with a small amount of the power they produce being
sold to the grid. Energy pricing policy is realistic: petroleum product
prices reflect import costs, while electricity tariffs are adjusted automatically
as fuel costs increase. It appears that the price mechanism has been successful
in moderating petroleum consumption, in that provisional figures for 1980 show
it to have been 15 percent below the 1978 peak. The volume of energy imports
in the next five years is projected to rise at about the same rate as GDP,
even allowing for the additional hydropower from the Champagne River project



- 35 -
in 1984 or 1985. Without remedial action, oil imports could thus reach some
250,000 toe by 1985, and 310,000-350,000 toe by the end of the decade.
88.       The most promising means of increasing energy supply would appear to
be through the more efficient use of bagasse. Using processes now under study
in Mauritius and elsewhere, it appears that with relatively modest investment
in the generating plant of the sugar factories, and by introducing a means of
processing the bagasse to allow it to be used year round, the sugar industry
could increase substantially the amount of surplus electricity it could sell
to the grid. A feasibility study for use of bagasse is being financed by the
French Caisse Centrale. It should be noted that there may be political
issues to be solved concerning closing uneconomic sugar factories before any
substantial investment can take place. However, potential savings from this
source could be as much as 60,000 toe annually by the end of the decade
representing some $25 million at today's prices.
89.       Other, less-promising, means of reducing the growth in oil imports
-- such as energy pricing policy, conservation, use of imported coal, non-
conventional sources or further expansion of hydro-power -- need to be
studied. The production of ethanol from molasses seems unlikley to be
economic at present, although the EIB is financing a feasibility study.
Government has decided to set up, by September 1981, an energy planning unit
in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development to coordinate the
various studies under way and proposed. It will be charged with preparing a
long term national energy plan by the end of 1982. It will require con-
siderable technical assistance, which is likely to be financed by UNDP with
Bank cooperation.
90.       Housing.  Mauritius has invested fairly heavily in housing (about
30 percent of gross fixed capital formation in 1979 and 13% of GDP was in
housing) and annual production of about 7,000 units is close to the estimated
annual demand for new housing of about 9,000 units. While some people live in
poor housing, and while there are shortages of some types of housing in
certain areas, needs for shelter in Mauritius are met relatively well. There
has been more investment in new housing in recent years than the economy
could afford, by both public and private sectors. To some extent this was due to
rebuilding after severe cyclone damage in 1975, and there is evidence that
1980 saw a reduction in new house-building expenditure. The Government has
sought to discourage private housing investment by increasing interest rates
and by limiting the size of loans for housing. The level of private housing
investment will be watched closely.
91.       In the public sector, the Central Housing Authority (CHA) was
given in 1975 the role of carrying out a major program of building for
cyclone victims, a role it had performed on a smaller scale after the
previous major cyclone in 1960. However, of the target of 8,000 public
housing units then called for to be built by 1980, only 2,000 had been built
by mid-1980, at costs far above estimates. CHA housing units have been let



- 36 -
at rents which are too low to finance maintenance of the houses and infra-
structure, and in some CHA estates sewerage and other public services have
become grossly inadequate. (They are being rehabilitated under the Bank
Urban loan, No. 1926 of January 1981.) Government policy is now to charge
tariffs and rents on CHA estates at levels which cover costs, and gradually
to sell CHA houses to tenants and cyclone victims. Any houses surplus to
demand from cyclone victims will be sold on the market, at cost.  There is
not surprisingly considerable resistance from tenants to paying the increased
charges, even to buy their own houses, and sales are going slowly.
92.       Future public sector housing policy provides for a substantial
reduction in the level of public capital expenditure on housing. There will
be a decrease in building by CHA, and a switch in emphasis to provision of
housing credit through the public sector Mauritius Housing Corporation, which
is Mauritius' main housing credit institution. It has funds from the World
Bank Urban loan and from other aid agencies.
93.       Development Works.  Concerned about the then high and growing level
of unemployment, the Government in 1970 set up the Development Works Corpora-
tion (DWC), to be the main institution responsible for executing the "Travail
Pour Tous" program of providing employment through carrying out "development
works". Other public agencies also have budgets for employment of "development
workers". Development workers were hired by DWC and the other agencies from
the unemployment register; the original intention had been that employment
would be temporary, but development workers now have the right to permanent,
pensionable status after seven years. DWC acts as a Government works depart-
ment, building minor roads, planting forests, building primary schools,
etcetera. The total of development workers fluctuates seasonally: the peak
has fallen from nearly 13,000 in 1977 to the present 10,500. This compares
with the total of registered unemployed of 30,500 at June 1980. Of the
10,500 development workers, DWC employed 6,300 in June 1980. Practically no
new development workers have been hired since 1977, and DWC has since then
been transferring workers both to other agencies as development workers, and
to fill permanent positions in Government services.
94.       Total estimated expenditure on Development Works in 1980/81 is Rs
149 million ($19 million), or about 11 percent of the revised capital budget.
This is 4 percent in real terms below 1979/80 (which was 4 percent below
1978/79). DWC would receive Rs 80 mn from this total towards its estimated
Rs 110 mn expenditure; the remainder of its income is expected to come about
equally from the Ministry of Planning for specific rural development acti-
vities (a continuation of the Rural Development project financed by IDA
credit 419 of 1973) and for civil works contracts which DWC has won or
expects to win in competition with other contractors.  Development works
expenditure is expected to show a small annual reduction in real terms from
1980/81 through 1984/85. Emphasis is placed on increasing the revenue DWC
derives from contract work, on improved planning and cost control of DWC
operations, and on transferring development workers to regular civil service
posts, where suitable vacancies arise. Sizeable reductions in the Development



- 37 -
Works budget allocation could probably only be attained by laying off
workers, which would be politically difficult in view of growing unemploy-
ment and the near-permanent status which most development workers have now
attained. In order to protect the efficiency of DWC operations in a period
of budget constraints, Government recognizes it must ensure an appropriate
budgetary allocation between labor and materials: in 1980 DWC found itself
without enough funds to buy materials for its operations.
Balance of Payments and External Finance
95.       The Government's program, as described in the preceding paragraphs,
incorporates supply side measures, to strengthen and diversify the export
production base while promoting fuller exploitation of the import substitution
potential, as well as macro-economic and product-specific demand management
policies designed to bring about a significant reduction in the current
account balance of payments deficit relative to GDP by 1984/85. Given the
importance of action along these lines in maintaining future debt service
obligations within safe limits without sacrificing growth, the expected
effects of the steps proposed to be taken deserve to be considered in some
detail. The effects of these projections are summarized in table 8 below.
We believe them to be, if anything, conservative.  Nevertheless, given the
usual uncertainty to which sugar exports are subject, deviations in either
direction from the projected trend cannot, of course, be ruled out. For
instance, it now appears probable that, because of unfavorable weather,
the sugar crop in 1981/82 could be 640,000 tons, or about 6 percent
lower than the normal level. Export earnings during the year could thus
be smaller, and the current account deficit somewhat larger, than expected at the
time of appraisal. Such a development is unlikely to affect the projections
for 1982/83 and subsequent years, except that the objective of accumulating
reserves equivalent to about two months imports of goods and non-factor
services by 1984/85, may be reached a year or so later (unless, as is always
possible, an unforeseen short boom, like that of 1980, occurs in a good crop
year in Mauritius).

96.       The Government plans to reduce imports in four general ways.  First,
it will encourage additional domestic production of foodstuffs through suitable
support prices, production incentives and greater emphasis on extension. With
the already increasing involvement of integrated sugar estates in crop and
livestock production, these measures can be realistically expected to reduce
food imports on average by 4 percent a year until 1984/85, although the
progress of import substitution may be much slower thereafter because of
increasing marginal costs resulting from the scarcity of land. Second,
imports of non-food consumption goods would be restricted, in line with the
Government's declared policy aim of curbing non-essential consumption by



- 39 -
recourse to selective high tariffs, the proposed sales tax and continued wage
restraint. Per capita consumption of such imports could thus conceivably be
maintained at a more or less constant level until the mid-1980s, with some
increase only in subsequent years. Third, the implementation of on-going
power projects, the continuation of the existing energy pricing arrangements
based on import costs, and the introduction of conservation measures, should
prevent oil imports from growing more rapidly than GDP. In the longer run, a
more efficient use of bagasse - the most attractive supply option - could
generate additional power equivalent to about 60,000 toe annually by the end
of the present decade. A significant reduction in the dependence on energy
imports can thus be progressively achieved from 1984/85 onwards with the aid
of appropriate energy planning. Finally, further strengthening of measures
to discourage foreign travel such as the tax on air fares and reduction of
foreign exchange allowances, could bring about a decline, although at a
diminishing rate, of non-factor service imports over the next three or four
years.
97.       As regards exports, the program pays particular attention to
strengthening the long run prospects for the sugar industry through, among
other things, emphasis on further improvement of sugar-cane yields and milling
efficiency. At the same time, it is the Government's intention to restrict
domestic sugar consumption, which is now at a high level of 35-40 kg per head
per year, through further increases in consumer prices. The program measures
with respect to industry,together with the beneficial effects of devaluation
and wage restraint on profitability, and the recent removal of the bottleneck
caused by congestion in the port, should enable EPZ exports to grow at least 8
percent annually over the coming four or five years. As the EPZ continues to
grow, moving into more sophisticated product lines and diversifying markets,
annual growth could well accelerate significantly in the more distant future.
As for service exports, tourism can be expected to grow at an annual rate of 4
percent until 1984/85, and 5 percent thereafter. Present occupancy rates
(50-60 percent) and seasonal patterns leave adequate capacity while new
facilities are constructed. Promotion of charter flights or other steps
could offset the adverse impact of future increases in air fares; and new
source markets are being tapped through promotional efforts.
98.       The Government recognizes that the above projections are subject
to a considerable margin of error. They nevertheless set the framework for
goals and policies. In considering the kind of external borrowing program
that could be formulated for financing the resultant projected balance of
payments deficit, the Government decided (i)to build up international reserves
so that by 1984/85 they were equivalent to two months imports, (ii) and that,
even with such a reserve build-up, it would be imprudent to undertake a
borrowing program which would raise debt servicing, expressed as a ratio of
exports, in excess of 15 percent. The Statement of Development Policy
reflects these decisions.
99.       The future debt service burden will be sensitive to the composition
of the external borrowing program, and especially to the size and maturity of
commercial loans. External borrowing accordingly needs to be carefully
planned if debt service obligations are to remain within tolerable limits.
The 15 percent ratio of debt service payments to projected export earnings is a



- 40 -
prudent and useful rule in considering the size, structure, and terms of the
external borrowing program. While many countries have debt service ratios in
excess of this level, the Mauritian economy is small, open, and depends
heavily on sugar. Exports are high relative to GDP, so that export revenue
fluctuations have extensive repercussions. On the other hand, a large part of
Mauritius needs of food, essential consumer goods and industrial inputs is
imported, leaving little room for reductions in imports without economic
disruption.
100.      The magnitude of external non-project borrowing requirements will
depend significantly on Mauritius- ability to attract foreign private invest-
ment and the inflow of project assistance. With the rapid growth of EPZ
industries expected to result, inter alia, from the Government's investment
promotion efforts, net direct private foreign investment could attain a level
of Rs 250 million ($33 million) in 1984/85, while a further rise could take
place in ensuing years. It is also likely that, given the interest of the
donor community in Mauritius (see paragraph 110 below) the Government will be
able to contract new loans on a scale which, together with disbursements from
past commitments, is adequate to meet the projected external financing of the
investment program. Since project loan disbursements depend, inter alia, on
the progress of project implementation, they may of course diverge in any
particular year from the projected level. The external borrowing required to
sustain the balance of payments deficits and exchange build up, as formulated
by the Mauritian Authorities, is summarized in Table 9. Annex IV contains
a detailed explanation of these projections.
101.      The need for special non-project assistance (that is, balance of
payments support) is projected to decline from the peak 1980/81 level, the
more so when assessed in constant prices, although it will probably remain
substantial during the period. Reliance on commercial borrowing is limited by
substantial non-project assistance expected from official sources such as
the IMF, the World Bank and members of the Consultative Group (CG). The
IMF indicated at the 1980 CG meeting that it was prepared to consider making
available net additional resources in the amounts shown until at least 1983/84,
if satisfactory agreement could be reached with the Mauritian Authorities.
Mauritius could probably qualify for some additional access to IMF resources
in 1984/85 and 1985/86 in the event, as is likely, of continuing balance of
payments need. The World Bank, it is assumed, would be prepared to make
further structural adjustment loans in later years if the Government adjustment
program proceeds appropriately.
102.      With this external borrowing framework the debt service ratio is
projected to be about 13 percent by 1984/85. For the purpose of calculating the
debt service ratio, scheduled repurchases of IMF drawings have been excluded,
following current practice. 1/ It has also been assumed that official project
1/   If scheduled repurchases were to be included, the ratio would be about
19 percent in 1984/85: we have assumed that in such circumstances the
Fund would be prepared to permit further net purchases of Fund resources,
provided agreement can be reached on a suitable policy package. See Annex
IVa, table 3.

assistance will be forthcoming on terms similar to those of recently contracted
loans, and that commercial loans will be available on terms reflecting
likely market trends, that is to say a 7-year maturity and an interest rate of
15 percent until 1981/82, falling to 10 percent in subsequent years. If,
however, the maturity of conventional loans is reduced to 5 years and official
assistance is assumed to carry somewhat stiffer terms, the debt service ratio
rises to about 15 percent in 1984/85.
103.      In the period beyond 1984/85, however, the debt service ratio, re-
flecting the cumulative amortization of past borrowings, would exceed 15 percent
unless further action is taken, reaching 20 percent by the end of the 1980s, or
an even higher level in the case of projections based on harder loan terms. 1/
Clearly, to maintain the debt service ratio at about 15 percent it will become
necessary to develop and to implement further measures to accelerate the
growth of exports (or otherwise to strengthen the balance of payments). This
is by no means an insurmountable task. Even if the resource gap were reduced
over the next five years by an amount representing just about 3 percent of
nominal export earnings, the debt service ratio could be kept about 15
percent during the latter half of the 1980s. As described above, the present
program includes planning studies in the main areas of the economy - industry,
sugar, other agriculture, energy - to formulate structural adjustment packages
that could form the bases of future lending operations. In addition we will
continue to work closely with the Government on the composition of the public
investment program and on the problem areas of public expenditure so as to
increase the efficiency of the public sector.
104.      The feasibility and viability of the adjustment program is predi-
cated on the availability of substantial, concessional balance of payments
support. The projected amounts of such assistance are not unrealistic, and
will permit Mauritius to pursue a course of action that will ensure growth
and diversification of the economy. On the other hand, it is not difficult
to visualize the future course of events should Mauritius abandon its present
adjustment program. The country would not be in a position to mobilize
necessary external finance on comparatively easy terms from official sources.
105.      Thus, even if no allowance is made for the effects of not following
the adjustment program, in lower-than-projected export earnings and increased
fiscal and external deficits, the need to rely mainly on commercial borrowing
to meet payments needs could before long bring the debt service ratio to
as much as 30 percent. Such an explosive situation would lead to sharp
cut-backs in essential imports, leading to a severe economic decline and to
serious social problems.

PART IV - THE PROPOSED LOAN
History
106.      During the 1979 Bank/IMF Annual Meetings, the Mauritian delegation
enquired about the possibility of securing a program loan to assist in meeting
the severe balance of payments deficit the country then faced. A Bank economic
mission accordingly visited Mauritius in November 1979 to review financing
needs. Its report was distributed in September 1980 (Mauritius: Recent
Economic Developments - No. 2962). In mid-1980, the Bank also agreed to the
Government's request to organize a Consultative Group (CG) of potential
donors, which was held in October 1980. A Bank mission, in which the IMF was
represented, visited Mauritius in August 1980 to discuss the draft economic
memorandum, and the interim plan for 1980-82 which was then being formulated.
A Mauritian delegation visited Washington in September 1980 for further
discussions on the Government's economic program and to finalize the Govern-
ment's CG submission, entitled "Towards a Structural Adjustment of the Mauritian
Economy". On the basis of the program outlined in that document, an appraisal
mission, including an IMF staff member, visited Mauritius in October/November
1980. Details of the program were further defined in early 1981, and negotia-
tions were held in Washington in April 1981. The Mauritian delegation was
led by the Minister of Finance, Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo.
107.      Cooperation with IMF.  Mauritius has maintained a close, cooperative
and active relationship with the Fund. As of April 1981, the IMF held SDR 155.7
million ($200 million) Mauritian rupees, that is 384 percent of the SDR 40.5
million quota (see Annex V). In October 1979 the Government entered a
two-year stand-by arrangement with the Fund for SDR73 million ($95 million),
of which SDR20 million was drawn immediately (Paragraphs 27-29, above). The
Fund states that the Mauritian authorities conscientiously executed the
substance of the program. However, the results achieved diverged significantly
from the goals, mainly because the cyclones of December 1979-March 1980 and
the late 1979 oil price increase made it impossible for the Government to
keep within the stand-by ceilings. A waiver was approved in April 1980 to
allow the second SDR20 million tranche to be drawn. A new, one-year stand-by
arrangement for SDR35 million ($45 million) was approved in September 1980,
to replace the previous arrangement. In addition, the Fund in March 1981
made available a net amount of SDR29.5 million under the Compensatory Financing
Facility, in respect of the export shortfall due to the losses to the 1980
sugar crop.  This raises Fund   credit under the CFF to 100 percent of quota.
108.      The Fund states that all policy measures under the present Stand-By
have been implemented, and the criteria met. The Government now wishes to
move beyond this arrangement into a medium-term adjustment program, for which
it seeks the Bank's support as well as a further arrangement with the Fund.



- 44 -
The Fund is providing technical assistance on the preparation of the sales
tax, on preparation of the budget, and to the Bank of Mauritius on credit
analysis.
109.      The actions taken as a basis for the 1979 Fund Standby, and the
performance criteria agreed, included the 30 percent devaluation, the wage
increase limitations, increases in consumer prices of subsidized food, restruc-
turing of interest rates and credit ceilings; the program for 1980 included
revised credit ceilings, continued restraint in wage settlements, further
subsidy cuts, and an increase in the interest rate applicable to housing
credit.
110.       Cooperation with other donors.  In recent years Mauritius has
benefited from assistance from a number of donors. The African Development
Bank, France (which committed about $45 million in 1977-80), the EIB and the
Commission of the European Communities (which provided about $40 million
during the period of the first Lome Convention, 1976-80), the OPEC Fund,
BADEA, Britain, Germany, the USA, and the Kuwait and the Saudi Funds have been
among those countries and agencies which have provided, or which now expect to
provide, aid on a considerable scale. During the 1980 Consultative Group
meeting all donors present indicated a continuing interest in supporting
Mauritius with project aid. In addition, France was considering making
available about $10 million in program assistance in 1980/81, the USA hoped
to continue PL480 food aid, while Australia and the EEC hoped also to provide
emergency assistance. It should be noted in this context that some donors
have expressed concern about slow disbursements on aid to Mauritius, especi-
ally where financing agreements have been concluded at an early stage of
project preparation. The Government is conscious of these problems, and has
recently established a project implementation monitoring unit in the Ministry
of Planning which it hopes will enable bottlenecks to be identified in time to
speed implementation.
111.      Loan Objectives.  The proposed loan would support the Government in
carrying out its medium-term economic adjustment program, as summarized in
table 10 and described in Part II of this report, and particularly the actions
described in the Government-s Statement of Development Policy, which is being
distributed separately. The foreign exchange provided by the proposed loan
would help Mauritius to maintain the planned level of industrial production
and productive investment, without recourse to quantitative import controls
or to increased commercial borrowing on unfavorable terms. It would also
help to avoid a drastic reduction in present levels of production and employ-
ment and to prevent a reversal of Mauritius- excellent record in providing
for basic needs. The proposed loan would be complementary to assistance
already and expected to be provided by the IMF, France, the EEC and other
donors. Since Mauritius is expected to continue to have a balance of payments
gap for some years to come, a second structural adjustment loan by the Bank
is foreseen for about 1982 or 1983, if Mauritius is able to continue with its

112.      The adjustment program on which the Government is now embarking
cannot be expected to produce results quickly. In particular, in the sugar
sub-sector the Government is just beginning to create the framework which will
allow it to acquire the knowledge prerequisite to forming policy. Further
work is needed in other parts of the agriculture sector to determine both what
other crops have a potential to contribute significantly to the economy, and
also the conditions conducive to exploiting further the potential of existing
crops. In the industry sector Mauritius is heavily dependent on external
developments, as well as on actions by a large number of private entrepreneurs.
In the fiscal area, the Government is subject to political pressures for
higher expenditures, from within the administration as well as from outside.
It is probable that the Government will be able to keep to the relatively
gradual program of restraint which it has adopted, but a more stringent
program would have been difficult to enforce. The nature of the program
appropriate as a basis for future structural adjustment operations will need
to be decided in the light of progress in the studies mentioned above, and of
the Government's success in implementing the measures now proposed.
113.      Creditworthiness.  Mauritius is creditworthy for the projected
amounts of lending, provided measures comparable to the ones in the adjustment
program described in this Report are effectively implemented over the medium
term. These steps will enable the country to limit its reliance on conven-
tional borrowing sufficiently to maintain the debt service ratio at levels
not exceeding 15 percent by 1985, or even significantly below that level if
maturities of commercial loans eventually contracted are not too short. The
debt service ratio is highly sensitive to the terms of conventional borrowing,
particularly with regard to maturity periods. However, until the mid-1980s
the debt service obligations can be maintained well within safe limits so long
as maturities of such loans are not less than seven years. Although longer
term projections tend to be hazardous, our analysis of possible developments
beyond 1984/85 indicates that further measures will need to be taken before
then to prevent the ratio rising in the longer term. The Government is
taking steps to identify and to prepare the necessary measures, especially on
the supply side.
114.      Procurement and Disbursement.  The proposed loan of $15 million
would be made to the Government, and would be mainly used to finance imported
inputs and equipment for industry and agriculture (see below). The loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1981. It would be disbursed
against the foreign exchange cost of eligible imports, following receipt of
full documentary evidence that payment had been made. Import contracts
for goods costing more than $3 million equivalent would only be financed if
procured on the basis of procedures that include broad international tendering
amongst suppliers from the Bank-s member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 2.03). Other imports, which will account for
the bulk of disbursements, will be processed through ordinary trade channels,
since they represent a large number of small purchases by many private and
public companies and agencies. The Bank of Mauritius (the Central Bank) has
nominated a senior official to be responsible for all aspects of administration
of procurement and disbursement under the proposed loan.



- 50 -
115.      Imports eligible for financing would be items, imported from Bank
member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan  in SITC Division 2 (crude materials
and inedible materials), 3 (mineral fuels, etc.), 4 (animal and vegetable
oils, etc.), 5 (chemicals), 6 (manufactured goods), 7 (machinery and transport
equipment), and certain items in division 8 (miscellaneous manufactured
articles). The following exceptions would not be permitted: (a) goods
financed from any other source, (b) goods with a total invoice cost of less
than $5,000 equivalent, and (c) luxury consumer goods, cars, aircraft, etc, arms
and ships. No more than $3 million of the loan would be used to finance
petroleum imports (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1).
116.      Counterpart Funds.  The Government will place the counterpart funds
in an account with the Bank of Mauritius to be used for capital expenditure
for projects in the public sector investment program (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01).
117.      Monitoring.  The items to be monitored are shown in Table 10.  The
main macroeconomic variables, and the level and terms of external borrowing
and the resultant debt service burden, will be kept carefully under review in
cooperation with the IMF. Implementation of the policy measures in the pro-
gram, in accordance with dates specified in the Statement of Development
Policy, will be the main items monitored by the Bank. A formal review will be
held by November 15, 1981. The main items to be reviewed are listed in
Attachment VIII to the Statement,(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
Risks and Uncertainties
118.      The major uncertainties associated with the program concern the
Government's ability to restrain public expenditure, (of which a large
component is labour costs), and to continue the incomes policy for the
private and the public sectors which it has operated so successfully in the
past two years. The Government faces important decisions in mid-1981, in
the form of the 1981/82 budget, to be presented in May or June, and the
annual wage round, determined normally in July.
119.      According to the constitution, a general election must be held
no later than the early months of 1982. The election may well come
earlier should economic and political circumstances prove favorable.
The holding of an election naturally involves the chance that the
Government may change, and so an uncertainty as to the extent to which a new
Government would wish to follow the program now adopted. Many of the reforms
in the program are thought to be acceptable to the opposition parties.
However, pressures from unions and other interest groups will be particularly
strong as the election approaches.
120.      The Government has been particularly successful in the past year in
carrying public opinion with it on economic policies. There is a risk that
continued wage restraint, other measures which increase taxation or payments
by consumers of Government services, and measures leading to reduced employment
in tea, education, housing and other parts of government service, will lead to
strong dissatisfaction with the Government. Should this happen it might feel
forced to rethink some aspects of its strategy, which could affect implementa-
tion of the program in 1982 and subsequently.



- 51 -
121.      The program will require cooperation amongst many of the major
ministries and public agencies, in carrying out policies which some may
believe to be too restrictive. It will require detailed coordination of
action, and determination on the part of public officials at all levels to
carry through. The extra work needed to assist in preparation and to monitor
the execution of detailed programs in several sectors will place a particularly
heavy burden on the Ministries of Finance and Planning. Delays could well
arise in this regard.
122.      Despite the above risks and uncertainties it is our judgement
that the Government has demonstrated a will and an ability to carry through an
appropriate adjustment program. In this it deserves the support of the Bank
and other donors. To deny such support, or to postpone it while waiting for
further measures to be implemented, would intensify the difficulties the
Government faces in carrying through its intentions.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
123.      To date Mauritius has received five IDA credits and ten Bank loans
(including one loan on Third Window terms) totalling $115.5 million, to help
finance projects in industry ($28.5 million), utilities ($22 million), infra-
structure ($18.6 million), agriculture and rural development ($9.2 million),
urban development ($15.0 million) and education ($22.2 million). The most
recent loan approved by the Executive Directors was for Urban Rehabilitation
and Development, $15.0 million, on December 9, 1980 (Number 1926-MAS). IFC
made a loan in 1971 for hotel construction, and is at present considering
other proposed investments.
124.      The Bank's program of lending to Mauritius will continue to concen-
trate on supporting the Government's strategy of economic diversification and
employment creation through the development of industry.  Growing industriali-
zation has resulted in a greater need for infrastructural improvements, and
we intend, therefore, to participate in projects designed to improve and
expand public infrastructure and related institutions. Following the recent
Government decision to strengthen the Central Water Authority's financial
position by allowing an increase in water tariffs, we are processing a water
supply project and a road maintenance project is under preparation. We also
expect to support the Government-s education reforms through a third education
project,  depending on developments affecting Mauritius' program of technical
education and training. A rural development project has recently been
appraised on behalf of IFAD.
125.      Implementation of the education, power, industrial and port projects
is generally satisfactory. The first rural development project had mixed
success in achieving its objectives. On the other hand, the tea project, also
just completed, encountered problems caused by falling international tea
prices, inadequacies in project management and equipment, and lack of interest
from laborers to work on tea plantations and from smallholders to take over
tea plots. The profitability of the tea industry in Mauritius has declined to



- 52 -
the point where it is now doubtful whether a fundamental change in the indus-
try, including the phasing out of some tea operations, can be avoided. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Mauritius as of
January 31, 1981 as well as notes on the status of ongoing projects.
126.      The only audit report so far prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department (No. 2101 of June 20, 1978), concerns the first line of credit made
to the Development Bank of Mauritius. The report showed that the project had
made a valuable contribution to development of the Mauritian economy.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
127.      The draft Loan Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, are being distributed separately, as is the Statement
of Development Policy.
128.      An additional event of susDension of the Loan is provided by
Section 4.01of the draft Loan Agreement, that an event has occurred which
shall make it improbable that the structural adjustment program, or a
significant part of the program, will be carried out. Features of the
draft Loan Agreement of special interest are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
129.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
130.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

October 23, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: December 9, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The loan provides financing for the foreign exchange component of
the Development Bank of Mauritius loans and investments in industry, agro-
industry and tourism. The project is proceeding well, and about $5.9 million
have been disbursed. Funds were fully committed by the end of 1978, but since
then two sub-loans totalling $1.6 million have been cancelled, and the Bank
has agreed to allow DBM to-re-commit these funds.
Loan No. 976-MAS      Port Project: US$10.0 million Loan of April 12, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 13, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
Loan No. 1339-T-MAS  Revised Port Project: US$3.6 million Third Window Loan of
December 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 27, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project has already met its main objective, although still not
completed. The port is now operating without congestion. Physical execution
is proceeding well. Construction of the new berth facilities is completed.
Contracts for support facilities such as administration, workshop and fire
station buildings have been awarded after a delay of over a year in arriving
at decisions on land use in the port area. The Mauritius Marine Authority
(MMA) has made contractual arrangements with a new private dock company
established by the existing dock companies for cargo handling operations, and
is making good progress in exercising its responsibilities. Attention is now
being focussed on improving cargo handling procedures.
Loan No. 1481-MAS    Fourth Development Bank Project: US$7.5 million Loan of
August 29, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: October 6, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The loan provides financing for the term foreign exchange needs of
medium and large scale industrial, tourism and agro-industrial projects. The
loan is fully committed.

Loan No. 1548-MAS    Power Transmission Project: US$15 million Loan of
April 26, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: January 23, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project consists of construction of 66-kV and lower voltage
trans'xission/distribution lines and substations; construction of a system
control center; consulting services and training.
Almost all material and equipment have already been ordered except
that for the control center. Construction has also started at various sites
in the country to construct substations and power lines included in the
project. Although last year's cyclones slowed implementation, the project is
on schedule so far. Studies as set forth in the Loan Agreement for long
range power planning, reorganization, energy sector and training needs have
been completed. Recommendations of these studies are being implemented by
the Central Electricity Board.
Loan No. 1543-MAS    Second Education Project: US$15.2 million Loan of
April 26, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: August 8, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The Project Unit continues to operate satisfactorily. Construction
of 12 of the 15 Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) is expected to be completed
in 1981. All these schools are in operation, although they have not yet
attained full capacity. Design work is underway for the remaining three
JSS, the Mauritius College of Education, the Mauritius Institute of Education
and the Ministry of Education (MECA). After substantial delay, the reorganiza-
tion of the MECA is now proceeding satisfactorily. It is now estimated that
the new buildings for the MECA will be completed about one year beyond the              (
original Closing Date. Educational objectives are expected to be achieved
upon completion of the project. The project description has been amended to
allow four of the 15 JSS to be used for forms IV and V, instead of as JSS.
Loan No. 1789-MAS   Fifth Development Bank Project:  US$6.0 million Loan of
January 23, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: April 30, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Project assists the Development Bank of Mauritius in finan-
cing directly or through Mauritian-owned commercial banks the foreign exchange
component of loans and investments in industry, agro-industry and tourism. It
alsohelps cover the foreign exchange investment needs of artisan and small-
scale enterprises. Commitments are proceeding satisfactorily.

million Loan of January 8, 1981; Expected Date of Effective-
ness: May 8, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The Project will assist the Government in implementing a change
in its policy for providing housing in the public sector, including a reduction
in overall Government expenditure on housing, and redirection from building
rental units at subsidized rates to provision of housing credit for lower
income groups. It will also strengthen institutions responsible for urban
planning, development and maintenance. It includes an integrated housing
development at a site (La Tour Koenig) near to Port Louis, housing credit,
rehabilitation of urban services, traffic management, and establishment of a
physical planning unit in the Ministry of Planning. The date for meeting
effectiveness conditions was postponed by one month to provide time for the
Government to amplify the legal opinion.

NOTE ON BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
PROJECTIONS
IMPORTS
Food Imports
1.        In normal production years food imports meet about 80 percent
of Mauritius- consumption requirements. As such, demand for foodstuffs
in 1979/80 can be placed at about Rs 1,320 million. Assuming demand to
increase in step with population growth, it would reach about Rs 1,440
million (in 1979/80 prices) by 1984/85; import substitution programs
would thus have to provide for this additional demand of Rs 100-125
million as well as to replace some of the existing food imports, esti-
mated at Rs 1,054 million 1979/80.
2.        Feasible additional production of foodstuffs (excluding poultry
and eggs, dairy products and fruit) is estimated at Rs 190 million in 1979
prices (Rs 225 million in 1979/80 prices) over the five years ending in
1984/85. Most of this addition to domestic food supplies is expected from
incremental output of meat, vegetables and fish. Allowing, moreover, for the
expansion of poultry farming, dairying and horticulture over this period,
incremental food output could amount to Rs 300-325 million (in 1979/80
prices). As such, food imports could be expected to drop from Rs 1,054
million in 1979/80 prices) to about Rs 855 million (again in 1979/80 prices)
by 1984/85, which represents, on average, a decline of close to 4 percent
per year.
3.        It is hazardous to explore the likely course of import substitution
in the period beyond 1984/85. Although it is not inconceivable that domestic
production could be raised by another Rs 200 million or so (in 1979/80 prices),
it would become increasingly difficult, or costly, to achieve further expansion
of output because of the scarcity of land. It is accordingly assumed that the
rate of import replacement would decline to about 2 percent a year during
the second half of the 1980s.
Other Consumption Goods
4.        Reflecting the sharp increase in duty-inclusive import prices as a
result of devaluation, the decline in real GDP during the year and success
of wage restraint measures, the volume of imports of consumption goods other
than food is estimated to have dropped sharply (by over 25 percent) in
1980/81. Government recognized the need for specific measures to reduce the
importation of unnecessary commodities and to curb consumption. In subsequent
years, steps to restrain non-essential consumption, such as the proposed
sales tax and selective adjustment of tariff duty rates, together with
continued wage restraint, could limit volume increase to about 1.8 percent
per year until 1984/85, the same rate as population. Thereafter, with more
rapid expansion of the economy and per capita real incomes, imports could
realistically expand at an annual rate of about 3 percent.



- 64 -
ANNEX IVa
Page 2
Petroleum, oils and lubricants
5.        The volume of energy imports is estimated to have declined by about
7 percent (or somewhat faster than GDP) in 1980/81, due to pricing policy
measures involving passing on to the consumer all increases in the cost of
imports, notably through automatic adjustment of power tariffs to changes in
oil import prices. It is assumed that with the continuation of existing
energy pricing arrangements, energy imports in subsequent years will increase
more or less in step with GDP until 1984/85. With more rapid economic growth
beyond 1984/85, energy imports would, ceteris paribus, be expected to increase
by about 4.5 percent per year, which implies an elasticity of 0.9 with
respect to GDP. However, the dependence on energy imports could be significantly
reduced in the longer run through more efficient use of bagasse, which, on
the basis of available evidence, seems to be the most attractive supply
option. Some 250 million Kwh. of additional power - the equivalent of 60,000
tons of fuel oil - could be obtained through renovation and modernization of
the sugar industry's generating equipment and suitable arrangements for the
storage of bagasse. Import requirements could accordingly be reduced at the
rate of some 12,500 tons of fuel oil each year during the second half of the
1980s.
Other Intermediates
6.        So far as the intermediates consumed by EPZ units are concerned,
annual import requirements until 1984/85, reflecting the recent observed
trend, will amount to about 50 percent of f.o.b. export earnings. In the
coming years the intermediate import content can be lowered with the progress
of import substitution and the consequent rise in the share of domestic value
added in exports. It is difficult to assess the pace, extent and timing of
this process. It is assumed, perhaps conservatively, that the intermediate
import content could decline to 45 percent beyond 1984/85. The volume of
imports of intermediates required by the rest of the economy is estimated to
have declined significantly in 1980/81 owing to the fall in GDP during the
year. In subsequent years such imports will need to rise more or less in
step with real GDP.
Capital Goods
7.        Imports of capital goods vary with the level of gross fixed capital
formation.
Imports of Non-Factor Services (Excluding Insurance and Freight)
8.        About two thirds or more of NFS imports are accounted for by travel
and travel related expenditure, and the rest mostly by the Government sector.
In 1980/81 they are likely to have increased in real terms. However, with
the need to reduce non-essential imports to a minimum, NFS imports could
decline from 1981/82 until 1984/85, although at a diminishing rate, provided



- 65 -
ANNEX IVa
Page 3
recent measures, such as the tax on air travel and reduction of foreign
exchange allowances, were strengthened or supplemented by other steps.
NFS imports over this period could conceivably fall on average, by about
3 percent a year. But, during the second half of the 1980s, more rapid
growth of per capita real incomes, and possibly also some relaxation of
policies affecting foreign travel could lead to an annual real growth of
about 2 percent in imports.
EXPORTS
Sugar Exports
9.        Sugar production in Mauritius has in the past grown at a slow
trend rate largely because of rising output per hectare. This increase in
productivity was brought about by introduction of improved cane varieties,
pest and disease control measures, improvements in irrigation and a slight,
but consistent, increase in the proportion of land under cane cultivated by
integrated estates, which traditionally obtain higher yields than small
planters. The past observed output growth trend can be expected to be
maintained until 1984/85 as a result of increasing use of chemical ripeners
(to raise sucrose content), the coming onstream of Northern Plains (Stage I)
irrigation project in 1983/84, which will benefit small planters, and a
continuing small increase in the estates' share of the cultivated area.
Projections for the second half of the 1980s are admittedly subject to a high
degree of error. However, as these projections (which assume no significant
improvement in milling efficiency and in the related one-time
increase in output) are based on the likely favorable impact of destoning of
land, completion of the second stage of the Northern Plains irrigation project,
technological changes (such as varietal improvements) and greater responsive-
ness of small planters to opportunities for raising productivity, the forecast
output of 805,000 tons by 1989/1990 is feasible.

10.       Sugar consumption in Mauritius, approaching 40 kg/year per head, is
exceptionally high, largely because of the low consumer price. The doubling
of the price in August 1980, and the Government's intention to raise it
further if export prices go up, should prevent sugar consumption from growing
by more than about 1 percent a year (implying a slight fall in per capita
consumption) from the estimated 1980/81 level of 35,000 tons.
11.       It is the EEC-s reported intention to minimize future increases
in the basic guaranteed price. Given the uncertainties surrounding EEC
exchange rates, the annual increase in rupee prices could average somewhat
under 7 percent until 1989/90. The projected prices are as follows:
Rs/ton    cents/lb                       Rs/ton      cents/lb
1981/82     3,920         23          1986/87          5,273        31

1983/84     4,456         27          1988/89          5,298        35
1984/85     4,666         28
1985/86     4,970         30          1989/90          6,285        38
12.       Projected world market prices are shown below.  For the period
beyond 1984/85 the course of sugar prices may become less erratic, and the
underlying trend strengthened somewhat, because of (a) ethanol production
from sugar becoming economic with high oil prices and (b) possible faster
growth of the world economy. The price projections adopted for sales
to the world market are accordingly as follows:
Rs/ton    cents/lb                       Rs/ton      cents/lb
1981/82     5,000         29          1986/87          4,272        26

1983/84     4,144         25          1988/89          5,277        32
1984/85     3,770         24          1989/90          5,863        35
1985/86     4,272         22
EPZ
13.       EPZ exports which lately had been affected by increasing costs,
market access problems and growing competition abroad, can be expected to
record an annual growth (in real terms) of 8 percent from 1981/82 onwards.
This assumption about the future performance of EPZ industries is based
on several policy related and other factors. First, devaluation and wage
restraint have had a favorable impact on profitability of EPZ units. Second,
a number of new production units have come into operation, while requests
from investors for establishing plants are being received at a satisfactory
rate. Third, the investment climate has improved as a result of (a) double
taxation agreements with France, UK and West Germany, (b) easier availability
of labour because of persistent unemployment, (c) extension of the period
for exemption from income tax and (d) improved functioning of the port.



- 67 -
ANNEX IVa
Page 5
Third, an export credit guarantee scheme will become operational in April 1981.
Finally, the Government is strengthening efforts to interest foreign investors
in the EPZ and proceeding with the streamlining of procedures as well as
incentive systems.
14.       As the EPZ continues to grow, moving into more sophisticated product
lines and diversifying markets for its products, the annual growth of exports
will significantly accelerate during the second half of the 1980s.
15.       Tea.  Of the total output of made tea, amounting to 5.1 thousand
tons in 1979, 1.9 thousand tons, or close to 40 percent, was accounted for by
production in TDA estates and land leased to smallholders by the TDA. Exports
during the year totalled 3.9 thousand tons. The main obstacle to the growth
of exports is the low productivity of TDA plantations and of smallholders.
As compared to the average yield of 12.2 tons of leaf per hectare in private
factory-owned plantations, TDA plantations average only about 1.4 tons per
hectare. The growth of production and exports in the future would thus
depend largely on the improvement in yields attained in TDA plantations and
smallholder plots. The scope for such improvement is substantial considering
(a) the reorganization of TDA that is now underway and (b) that most of
the bushes in the planted area under TDA responsibility are now attaining
maturity. Assuming annual improvement yields of 20-25 percent from the
present extremely low levels, the volume of exports can be expected to
increase by about 7 percent a year during the 1980s.
16.       Tourism.  Following the first oil crisis at the end of 1973 and the
resulting steep increase in air fares, world-wide tourist traffic remained
depressed until 1976. However, except for a decline in the number of tourist
nights in 1975, Mauritius did not experience the full impact of rising air
fares. In fact during 1973-76 the number of tourist nights increased by about
22 percent. Mauritius was able to overcome the handicap of great distance
from source markets and rising fuel prices largely for the reason that it is a
comparatively new resort catering to middle and upper end of the tourism
market. Despite the continuing increase in the costs of air travel, tourism
can be expected to grow at an annual rate of at least 4 percent until 1984/85,
and 5 percent thereafter, for a number of reasons. First, tourist inflow
to Mauritius is markedly less seasonal than to many other destinations, so
that with the present occupancy rates of 50-60 percent there is adequate
capacity to handle additional traffic in the near-term future.  Second, new
facilities can be constructed in time to accommodate the likely increase in
the number of tourists over the longer run.  Third, any adverse impact of a
future increase in air fares can be partially offset by a shift in policy to
encourage greater competition between scheduled airlines, most of which
offered until recently much less attractive concessional fares to Mauritius,
compared to other routes and destinations. Such competition could be introduced
through the national carrier or promotion of charter operations. Finally,
considering the nature of the tourist traffic, the growth of tourism could be
sustained, inter alia, by promotional efforts in new source markets.

Price Projections
17.       Prices of traded goods and non-factor services, other than sugar,
petroleum products, foodstuffs and tea, have been assumed to move in line
with world prices. Product-specific indices are utilized for petroleum
products and tea. The index for foodstuffs is weighted average reflecting
the share of basic and other foodstuffs in imports.
CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND NON-PROJECT ASSISTANCE
18.       Project Loans.  Disbursements from past commitments and new loans
to be contracted will be adequate to meet the projected foreign financing of
the proposed investment program. In the period beyond 1984/85, project loan
disbursements will, it is assumed, increase annually in nominal terms by about
10 percent.
19.       Private Capital.  Direct private investment has been declining from
the peak of Rs 33 million (US$5.5 million) reached in 1975, which in 1984/85
prices represents about US$12 million. It is assumed that with the rapid
growth of EPZ industries (expatriates account for about 55 percent of the total
EPZ equity), which presupposes the success of investment promotion efforts
outlined earlier, net direct private foreign investment will rise from esti-
mated Rs 10 million (US$1.4 million) in 1979/80 to Rs 50 million (US$6.6
million) in 1981/82 and further to Rs 250 million (US$32.8 million) in 1984/85.
With continued expansion at a high rate of EPZ output expected during the
second half of the 1980s, net private investment inflow could attain the level
of Rs 400 million (US$52.6 million) by 1989/90. The inflow of other private
medium and long-term capital, mostly suppliers credits, would vary, as in the
past, with aggregate private fixed investment.
20.       Short-term capital.  Short-term capital movements are related
mainly to leads and lags in receipts for sugar exports as the interest cost
of commercial import credits is usually built up into the c.i.f. price. With
the projected steady increase in sugar exports from 1981/82 onwards, the short
term capital outflow is estimated at Rs 20 to 25 million per year.
21.       Non-project Assistance.  The sources of official non-project assis-
tance are the IMF, Bank-s Structural Adjustment Loans (SAL) and commitments
made by Consultative Group participants (CG).
22.       IMF.  It is assumed that repurchases of the CFF and EFF credits
will be rolled over. The levels of such credits are assumed to be as follows:

25.       Any shortfall in official non-project assistance in relation to
requirements will be met by borrowing from foreign commercial banks. In
view of the depletion of foreign assets, such requirements will be determined
partly by the need to build up foreign exchange reserves. It is assumed,
in this context, that foreign exchange reserves will be accumulated to
reach by 1984/85 a level representing about two months- imports of goods
and non-factor services.
LOAN TERMS
26.       IMF.  Service charges and interest on account of borrowing under
EFF and other facilities would range from 6.0 to 8.0 percent.
27.       Project Loans.  Average interest on project loans will be 7 percent
per annum. Interest on project loans from sources other than the Bank in FY80
ranged from 3.0 percent to 8.0 percent. Loans from OPEC, Kuwait Fund, BADEA
and CCCE carried interest rates of 4.0 to 6.0 percent. Project loans will be
repaid over 14 years including a grace period of 4 years.
28.       SALs.  SALs will be repaid over 17 years including a grace period
of 4 years.
29.       CG.  CG loans will be repaid over 18 years including a grace period
of 5 years, the rate of interest being 5.0 percent. These terms correspond to
the commitment-weighted average of assistance announced at the first CG
meeting.

1/  Scheduled repurchases of Fund drawings are considered as an operation leading to a decline in net foreign
assets instead of being treated as an element of debt service payments. If all such repurchases were
included in debt service, the debt service ratio would be 2 to 6 percentage points higher than what it might
otherwise have been in any particular year during the latter half of the 1980s. If, however, only EFF
repurchases were included the ratio would be raised by no more than 1 to 2 percentage points.

30.       Commercial Banks.  Loans from commercial banks contracted after
1980/81 are assumed to be repaid over 6 years including a grace period of
2 years. The interest rate is assumed to fall from 15 percent in earlier
years to 10 percent by 1982/83.
31.       Private capital.  Net private investment income outflow will vary
in proportion to cumulative net direct private investment. Other (mostly
suppliers- credits) private medium and long-term capital will be repaid over
6 years after a grace period of one year and carry an interest rate of 10.0
percent.
32.       Alternative Loan Terms.  For the purpose of testing the sensitivity
of debt service obligations to changes in loan terms, the following alternative
set of conditions has been adopted in respect to project loans, commitments
from future consultative groups and commercial banks:
Interest          Grace
Rate          Period           Maturity
(percent)        (years)          (years)

Commercial banks           15.0 until       2                  5
1981/82,
10.0 from 1982/83
DEBT SERVICE
33.       With these stiffer terms the debt service payments as a proportion
of exports of goods and non-factor services could rise to very high levels
by the end of the 1980s. As the estimates set out in Table 3 (overleaf)
show, more onerous terms and conditions of external borrowing could, largely
as a result of shorter maturity of commercial loans, raise the debt service
ratio by 2 to 8 percentage points. Even if external financing were avail-
able on terms postulated earlier, the debt service ratio may rise to about
20 percent by 1989/90. These projections, even though subject to rather
wide margins of error, emphasize the need for limiting market borrowing
to loans carrying reasonable maturities and to initiate steps for accele-
rating the growth of exports (or otherwise strengthening the balance of
payments) over the coming years. Even if the resource gap were reduced
by an amount representing just about 3 percent of nominal exchange earnings
over the next five years, the debt service ratio would be brought down to
about 16 percent by the end of the 1980s. And it could even drop to a
significantly lower level if the measures to improve the balance of payments
were intensified and/or sustained over a longer period. Thus more rapid
diversification of sources of exchange earnings, as well as greater fiscal
discipline to restrain the growth of aggregate demand, could be expected
to maintain the debt service ratio within safe limits over the present
decade.
