ROMANIA
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1.01     Despite the existence of extensive mountainous areas, Romania has a
fairly well developed and evenly distributed transportation network (Map IBRD
15462R) that provides access to all major centers of economic activity. The
transportation network includes about 11,000 route-km of railways, 73,500 km
of roads, one major seaport, four main commercial river ports and a sizeable
network of inland waterways and pipelines. The Danube river, which is navi-
gable, flows through 1,075 km of Romania, mainly along its southern border.
Ninety percent of the foreign trade is handled through the port of Constanta
on the Black Sea. Pipelines have been the principal carriers of petroleum
and natural gas but have a limited and specialized role. Air and coastal
shipping are relatively unimportant for inland transport.
1.02     Romania's economy has grown rapidly since World War II.  Increasing
economic activity and personal incomes have led to a high but declining
growth rate in transport demand: 10.5% and 10.2% yearly for freight and pas-
sengers in the 60s, down to 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively in the 70s (Annex 1).
1.03     The backbone of Romania's internal freight transportation is the
railway network, which has the crucial responsibility for moving traffic over
relatively long distances from the various concentrated centers of manu-
facture and trade to important consumption centers. Although road traffic is
increasing fairly rapidly in tonnage, it functions mainly as a short-haul
mover. In 1960, railways carried more than 80% of freight (in ton-km) which
by 1980 declined to 67% (Table 1), with a corresponding increase in the per-
centage carried by road. The Danube river transport and pipelines account
for about 2% and 6% of ton-km respectively. It is significant that for pas-
senger traffic, the railways' former dominance passed to roads in the late
1960s and the current rail/road split is about 27/73 (Table 2).
1.04     A detailed breakdown of the transport of goods by commodity groups
shows that in terms of ton-km, the railways are still the main carrier of all
commodities without exception (Table 3). The volume of quarry and ballast
products carried by road transport is, however, conspicuously high, since
working sites can mostly be reached by road only. Road transport is also
significant for the movement of higher value goods, such as machinery and
equipment, chemical products and processed foodstuffs.
1.05     Romania's development efforts have been concentrated on heavy
industry as the basis for creating an industralized society. The transport



- 2-
sector has first of all, therefore, been required to meet the needs of heavy
industry and associated large construction projects. The needs of light
industry, agriculture, and passenger transport have been secondary. By
international standards, Romania has a high number of employees per enter-
prise and more than 80% of gross industrial production and the industrial
labor force is concentrated in large enterprises, each employing more than
1,000 persons. Such enterprises are dispersed country-wide in response to a
policy of uniform regional development. Distribution of industrial and con-
sumer goods is made from distribution centers which have been established in
every "judet" (county). While transport to and from those centers within the
judet is by road, this pattern of geographically concentrated development of
production and consumption centers has favored railways because of their
ability to handle dense freight traffic flows from one center to another. To
cope with such flows these centers are generally well equipped with sidings
and handling facilities for bulk traffic. About three-quarters of railway
traffic moves from siding to siding. The present high technical efficiency
and quality of service of the railways is a further contributing factor to
their greater use. In particular, the Romanian Railways (CFR) have higher
labor productivity and make more intensive use of their capital assets, both
infrastructure and rolling stock, than most other railways. Furthermore, the
production of consumer goods and light manufacturing industries which
normally favor the use of road transport, are less developed. As such indus-
tries grow in the future, dependence on road transport may be expected to
increase.
1.06     The growth of the transport sector has been accompanied by more than
a threefold increase in its employment during the last three decades.
However, the share of the transport sector as a whole in the national labor
force has remained steady at about 6-7% during those years. There has been a
substantial shift in employment among transport modes; the share for
railroads declined from 76% of total transport employees in 1950 to about 40%
in the late 70s, while the percentage share of road transport employees
increased from 4% to more than 40%.
1.07     Sea transport has been used exclusively for foreign trade and there
is little coastal traffic. Over the last two decades an annual average of
65% of all exports and about 40% of all imports have been carried by sea.
With the exception of crude oil, most movements to and from the Constanta
port are by rail. Completion of the Danube-Black Sea Canal by the end of
1984 will add significant transport capacity to serve the growing economy,
and will facilitate movement of the projected traffic volumes to and from
Constanta. This canal is the major component of a larger program which also
includes construction of deep-water facilities at the port of South
Constanta-Agigea, designed to handle large bulk carriers.
1.08     Overall, transport accounted for less than 10% of Romania's total
investments during 1960-80, while in other countries it generally accounted
for about 15-25%. Thus, Romania's transport investments have been low by
international comparison. Transport agencies are granted only few resources
for expansion. Instead, efforts are made to intensify the use of existing



- 3 -
facilities. In practice, efficient transport in Romania aims at low resource
cost movement primarily for bulk materials among the key industrial centers.
B. Transport Planning, Policy and Coordination
1.09     The planning process in the transport sector follows the basic
iterative approach used for all of Romania's centrally planned economy.
Transportation projects included in the Plan originate both at the
micro-level through the enterprises and county authorities (especially for
municipal and local roads) and at the macro-level through the State Planning
Committee (SPC). The demands for transport by the economic enterprises and
sectors are reconciled by the SPC with the existing capacities and expansion
plans of the transport enterprises. The latter are determined after a review
of all expansion plans and the setting up of priorities within the allocated
investment budget. Review and coordination of new investment proposals are
the responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications
(MTTc) which submits its program to the SPC.
1.10     Responsibility for all transport modes other than aviation and pipe-
lines rests with the MTTc. Aviation has a separate Ministry and pipelines
are the responsibility of the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Geology.
MTTc's organization also includes construction and maintenance enterprises
(Chart). The role of officers and staff of the Ministry's headquarters is
limited mainly to planning, coordination, design, administration and
budgeting. For construction and actual transport operations, much authority
is delegated to regional units and to "Centrals"'/ and the enterprises
within them.
1.11     In Romania the principal objectives of transport policy are the
efficient provision of services with the complementary development of the
different modes, the lowering of the share of transportation costs within the
total costs of the economy, and reduction of energy consumption. To these
ends, the authorities are fostering the use of rail and water transport for
long and medium distance commodity hauls, and of road transport for short
hauls, the development of integrated transport facilities (e.g., containers),
and the use of common carriers in preference to transport on own account.
1.12     Energy has become a critical subsector for the Romanian economy.
Having started to import oil in 1968, Romania became a net importer of energy
by 1977, and in 1979 was expected for the first time to import more crude oil
than was produced (Table 4). In 1979, rail and road transport consumed about
1/ The Central is an economic unit subordinate to but separate from
a ministry, with responsibilities for planning, supervising and
coordinating the operations of enterprises under its jurisdiction.
It is also responsible through subordinate enterprises, for research,
design and foreign trade.

2.6 million tons of oil products (about 0.8 million tons of gasoline and about
1.8 million tons of diesel oil/heavy oil) accounting for about 14% of the
total domestic consumption of refined oil products. Special measures were
taken in July 1979 to curb fuel consumption, by raising gasoline prices for
private cars to Lei 7.50 (US$0.50) a liter (the second increase in 1979),
restricting weekend driving, reducing the number of taxis and official cars
and requiring foreign tourists to pay for gasoline in convertible currency.
Restrictions were also imposed on the movement of trucks, particularly "own
transport," while gasoline rations for state, cooperative and public property
cars were halved. Diesel fuel which was priced at about Lei 1.7 (US$0.11) per
liter for railways and Lei 1.1 (US$0.07) per liter for public road transport
was increased to Lei 2.23 (US$0.15) per liter for both modes from January 1,
1981,1/ still substantially lower than the imported price of crude oil
(US$0.23 per liter). By comparison, in April 1980, the international price of
diesel fuel was about US$0.42 per liter. Hence, although the role of public
transport is thus given dominance, the constant overcrowding of buses and
trains is evidence that passenger transport has not received the resources it
deserves (para. 1.08). Further, the revenue foregone by the Government due to
lower fuel prices to the railways and road transport enterprises is recovered
to a substantial extent in the Romanian system through the benefits (profits)
of these State-owned enterprises.
1.13     In order that the use of transport may be coordinated each major user
of transport services is required to specify his transport needs approximately
a year in advance. The movements of bulk commodities, which account for 70%
of traffic, are subject to an optimization process which links producers and
consumers in order to minimize transport costs. Producers of other com-
modities are linked to specified regions. For each commodity (bulk or other)
there is a coordinator at the Ministry responsible for its production/
distribution, who determines these linkages, selects the transport mode, and
informs accordingly the beneficiaries (producers and consumers) who enter into
contracts. His selection is mandatory, subject, however, to appeal by the
transport beneficiaries.
1.14     To attain these ends, coordinators select transport modes on the
basis of a computer program which has been prepared by MTTc. The program
takes into account tariffs (as a proxy for costs), distance, transit time,
and, reportedly, packaging costs, damage, energy consumption and transport
capacity constraints. However, it is not clear that the present traffic split
is optimal, because:
(a) capital for investment in transport facilities and in beneficiaries'
inventories is available either free or at a very low rate of
interest;
(b) the methods of recovery of infrastructure costs (both capital and
maintenance) differ between modes;
1/ Price changes made in context of new regulation (para. 2.24)



-5-
(c) costs, and consequently tariffs, are assessed on a national or
system-wide basis rather than on a route and service-specific basis;
and
(d) there are major differences between Romanian and border prices.
1.15     The proposed project includes, therefore, as an important component,
a study of traffic optimization, to be completed by the end of 1983. The
study would be designed to establish an appropriate basis for developing a
policy framework (including tariffs) for the economic development of the
transport sector, and for the efficient utilization and coordination of
transport facilities.
C. Tariffs and Costs
1.16     Rail, road and inland water transport tariffs are prepared by the
MTTc and approved by the State Committee on Prices (SCP). Rail freight
tariffs had been "ad valorem," high valued commodities subsidizing others,
until 1974 when a cost-based system was introduced. The principal criteria
for rail freight rates are wagon type, net loading and length of haul. Basic
movement costs per km are calculated for each category on a system-wide
average basis, without allowance for difficult terrain or other adverse con-
ditions which are route-specific. A further margin is added to allow for a
15% planned surplus for the system as a whole.
1.17     Road tariffs are also cost-based, the main criteria being truck type,
net load and length of haul. However, road users, unlike rail users, do not
make a direct contribution to the maintenance of roads which are provided as a
public utility. For costing purposes, roads are divided into six categories,
each with a coefficient ranging from 0.9 for a motorway to 1.6 for the worst
conditions on construction sites. There are separate groups of tariffs for
local services, intercity services, large parcel traffic, refrigerated/
insulated vehicles and car transporters. A comparison of rail (wagon load and
LCL) and road freight rates is given in Table 5.
D. Previous Bank Involvement
1.18     The proposed project will be the second in the transport sector and
the first for rail/road development. In January 1980 the Bank approved a loan
of US$100 million equivalent to assist in the construction of a 64 km canal
from Cernavoda on the Danube to South Constanta-Agigea on the Black Sea. This
p'roject will provide an energy efficient and cost effective means of trans-
portation, and enhance the role of inland waterways. The project is well in
hand and progress to date is satisfactory.

1.19     In addition to lending, the Bank (through EDI) and in collaboration
with the country's principal management training center, has assisted Romania
by conducting training courses for local officials on economic and financial
evaluation in the industry and transport sectors, first in Belgrade in 1973
(industry only), and, since 1975, annually in Bucharest. MTTc staff who at-
tended these courses, as well as EDI staff, have been prime movers in
preparing the proposed project.
II. THE RAILWAY AND HIGHWAY SUBSECTORS
A. Traffic Trends and Forecasts
General
2.01     Annex 1 provides a detailed analysis of surface traffic trends during
the past 20 years (Tables I and 2) and of forecasts for the five-year plan
period, 1981-85 (Tables 6 and 7). These are discussed below.
Freight
2.02     Total freight traffic is forecast to increase by about 35% (or 6.3%
p.a.) from 102 billion ton-km in 1980 to 138 billion in 1985. Over this
period the increase in tonnage is about 19% while the average haul lengthens
by about 13% mainly due to the use of the canal by long-haul and transit
traffic. At 21 billion ton-km in 1985 the share of river and canal traffic
increases from 2-15%. Rail traffic at 78 billion drops from 64-57% and road
traffic at 32 billion drops from 28-23%, while pipelines at 7 billion fall
from 6-5%.
2.03     For the five-year plan period 1981-85 the forecast growth rate (in
ton-km for all modes) of 6.3% p.a. is reasonable when compared to the overall
growth rate of 6-7% p.a. expected for the economy as a whole. The railways'
basic role in carrying about two-thirds of the present (and still increasing)
industrial load is unlikely to change substantially except in those limited
areas and for those commodities in the zones of influence of the Danube-Black
Sea Canal (paras. 1.07 and 1.18) which is scheduled to be opened during 1983.
However, as emphasis in development continues to shift from heavy to the
lighter industries, more low-volume, high-value traffic suitable to road
transport is becoming available.
2.04     The 1980-85 growth rate of 3.8% p.a. for rail freight is considered
attainable because of assured bulk movements of such commodities as coal, in
regions not served by the improved river and canal facilities. The forecast
rate of 2.4% p.a. for road freight appears consistent with present energy
policies, but is likely to be exceeded as light and medium scale industries
develop and call for increased use of road transport. River and canal tonnage



is forecast to increase fivefold by 1985, consistent with earlier forecasts
for the canal project.
Passengers
2.05     Total passenger traffic is forecast to increase by about 21% (or 3.9%
p.a.) from 85 billion passenger-km in 1980 to 103 billion in 1985. As the
average journey length is not expected to change, this increase applies to the
numbers of passengers carried. At 78 billion passenger-km in 1985, the roads'
share increases from 73-76% while rail, at 25 billion, drops from 27-24%. The
average total growth rate of 3.9% p.a. comprises 1.4% for railways and 4.7%
for roads both of which are considered attainable in the light of a rapid and
continuing urbanization (50% of 1980 population compared with 34% in 1965)
augmenting both intercity and suburban passenger movements. With the increas-
ing production of passenger cars (para. 2.51) the projected growth rate for
road traffic, in particular, may prove to be conservative.
B. Railways
Headquarters Organization
2.06     Under the Romanian system of centralized State control, the railways'
headquarters organization is contained within MTTc under collective manage-
ment. Of six groups within the Ministry, each headed by a Ministerial
Associate, four are concerned with railways. The First Ministerial Associate
(Deputy Minister) is responsible for railway operations in the nine Regions.
A second deals with the centralized Directorates for traction and rolling
stock, fixed installations, revenue control, data processing and
restaurant-car and sleeping-car services. A third looks after finance and
prices and oversees the Railway Workshops "Central" (RWC). The fourth is
concerned with the Railway Construction "Central" (RCC) and the Railway Design
Institute (RDI). These latter two Ministerial Associates also share responsi-
bility for the road subsector so that the machinery for coordination, rather
than competition, between the two modes appears inherent in the Ministerial
structure. Two other Ministerial Associates are concerned with maritime and
river transport and with posts and telecommunications. The Council of the
Ministry, its highest decision-making body, also intervenes in the coor-
dination process. The Council and its Executive Bureau are chaired by the
Minister and include all Ministerial Associates and certain heads of
departments and units. The Railway Department, the controlling body of CFR,
consists of the units responsible to the first two Ministerial Associates
(Chart).



-8
Regional Organization
2.07     Administration of the railways is deployed into nine Regions,
managements of which are responsible to the First Ministerial Associate at the
MTTc. A typical region is governed by a Workers' Assembly meeting annually
and a representative Workers' Council meeting quarterly to review performance
against plan. The Council also establishes five-year development plans within
the State framework. The Council has an Executive Board which meets every ten
days for overall control of policy and operations. The General Manager chairs
all meetings and exercises day-to-day control. Each Region produces its own
accounts.
Centralized Activities
2.08     The RDI is responsible for feasibility studies and detailed engi-
neering for railway works. The RCC, one of the principal entities for civil
works construction in Romania, executes works for railways, national roads,
airports and the Danube ports, and also fabricates precast construction com-
ponents such as pre-stressed concrete sleepers. Being part of MTTc, RCC's
operation is essentially a force-account one, although it executes work in
accordance with a bill of quantities and at unit rates discussed and agreed
during the planning process. RCC is capably managed, staffed and equipped.
The Investment Bank (IB), the Borrower for the proposed loan (para. 3.28)
exercises a general supervisory role over project implementation.
2.09     The RWC has six workshops carrying out periodic maintenance and major
overhaul of traction and rolling stock beyond the capacity of regional work-
shops. It also includes separate groups for manufacture of components for the
repair and modernization of rolling stock and for assembly. RDI, RCC and RWC
produce separate accounts.
Uneconomic Lines and Services
2.10     Since 1974, three narrow-gauge lines and one standard-gauge line have
been closed as a result of reviews made on the basis of line-specific costs
and revenues. The next major review is expected about 1982 when the
performance of all standard gauge and narrow gauge branch lines will be
examined and evaluated.
Railway Property
2.11     Track.  The CFR operates 11,110 km of route, 95% standard gauge, 22%
double tracked and 21% electrified. The track is mainly 49 kg/m rail with
welded joints, laid on monoblock concrete or wooden sleepers with crushed
stone ballast; 60-65 kg rails are being introduced on main lines during
overhaul. Track is generally in good condition, although the very high
traffic density (typically 25 million gross tons per main line track) has
limited the time available for maintenance and overhaul; both are in arrears
and speed restrictions have had to be imposed for months at a time. To
improve the situation, CFR are drawing up plans through collaboration with a



- 9 -
reputed firm for the manufacture of heavy-duty track maintenance equipment,
which would enable CFR to make full use of the limited time available for
maintenance and overhaul. During loan negotiations agreement was reached with
the Borrower for the introduction of these machines during the project period
and for the prompt provision as needed of resources necessary for track main-
tenance and overhaul.
2.12     Signalling and Telecommunications.  About 70% of the network is
equipped with color-light signalling and about 40% with automatic two-way
working on double lines. Although only 5% of lines have centralized traffic
control, in 71% of the stations signals and points are controlled from a
central location at each station. CFR plans to extend the use of automatic
block and to install points motors in about 100 more stations during 1981-85.
The telecommunications system, though of limited capacity, is modern and
adequate for the present needs, and is integrated with the national network.
There is radio communication with all main line locomotives, and automatic
train stops at all signalled stations. On the whole, the signalling and
telecommunications system on the main lines is modern and adequate; however,
the extension of automatic route setting at important stations and improved
signalling on the branch lines would expedite train movements. CFR plans to
install the necessary equipment at a few large stations during the plan period.
2.13     Marshalling Yards.  There are 27 major marshalling yards, 14 of which
were mechanized with conventional retarders about 30 years ago. Even in very
large yards handling about 5,000-6,000 wagons a day, skids are used instead of
secondary retarders. The working of the marshalling yards judged by the total
time for marshalling, is satisfactory (one hour on reception lines, 40 minutes
marshalling a 60-car train and two hours for train formation). CFR expects to
further improve wagon movement as a result of the mechanization of the remain-
ing 13 yards, during 1981-85.
2.14     Traction and Rolling Stock.  In 1979, CFR owned 2,091 diesel and 530
electric standard gauge locomotives, and 68 narrow and broad gauge diesels;
70% of this fleet is less than 11 years old (Tables 8 and 9). Two hundred and
fifty-one standard gauge steam locomotives are in service (all over 30 years
old), 190 for shunting and the balance for emergency use. Locomotive
maintenance facilities are good and the standards of repair are high. To meet
the growing traffic demand, as well as to replace outmoded equipment, CFR
intends to procure during 1981-85, 350 diesel locomotives and 400 electric
locomotives (Table 10).
2.15     In 1979, CFR had about 126,000 freight cars, 41% up from 1970.  Fleet
capacity had increased by 73% during 1970-79, to 5.2 million tons, as a result
of the purchase of larger cars (Table 8). However, half the 1979 fleet
consisted of two-axle cars, and of these, the equivalent of 1,800 four-axle
cars, generally over 40 years old, were scrapped during 1980 and a further



- 10 -
8,500 cars are to be scrapped during 1981-85 (Tables 9 and 11). During the
period, 1981-85, CFR will acquire 31,000 four-axle cars to meet rising traffic
and to replace cars to be scrapped.
2.16     Of the 5,500 passenger coaches 1/ available in 1979, 1,200 were
over 40 years old (Table 9). Of the latter, 780 are to be scrapped
during 1981-85, while CFR will acquire 1,150 new coaches. As the average
occupation ratio is about 105%, the additional seating capacity of new coaches
(84 in second class compared with 54 in the older two-axle coaches) will, to
some extent, relieve the chronic overcrowding.
Operations
2.17     In 1980 CFR performed 98.7 billion traffic units.  Its traffic
density, 15 million gross tons per route-km, is one of the highest in the
world. The operational efficiency of the railway has been steadily improving
and is generally high, comparing favorably with other European railways (Table
12). Productivity in 1980 was 559,500 traffic units per employee, 14% up from
1975 and expected to increase about 14% to 638,000 traffic units per employee
by 1985 (Table 13). Steam traction, which in 1975 hauled 6% of gross ton-km,
has been virtually eliminated, except for some shunting and emergency use.
Electric traction which hauled 18% of gross ton-km in 1975, has risen to 36%,
and is expected to rise to 45% in 1985, partly as a result of further
electrification included in the proposed project.
2.18     Consequent to the acquisition of more bogie cars, average car
capacity rose by 9% during 1975-79 (to 41.3 tons) while net ton-km per car
rose only 1% to 602,000. The difference between these increases is due, at
least in part, to a 18&o increase in turnaround time to 4.48 days in 1979.2/
Turnaround deterioration is due to increased delays at terminals, and also to
greater complexity of operations resulting from new production centers served
by additional industrial sidings. Delays at terminals have increased because
traffic growth and the shortened work-week have increased pressure on
customers' storage facilities especially at collieries, with resultant pro-
tracted detention of wagons at terminals and loading points. Studies
regarding terminal detention of wagons and of measures to improve their turn-
around time are being initiated. Again, CFR has developed a computerized car
control program which is being tested in one of its Regions. At negotiations,
an understanding was reached with the Borrower that CFR will keep the Bank
informed of progress on all measures to improve wagon utilization and that car
procurement will be reviewed in the light of improvements in turnaround time.
2.19     Engine-km per engine/day for diesel locomotives shows a decreasing
trend: 419-383 for passenger and 309-257 for freight, during 1975-80.
Although this is partly due to the increasing use of electric traction
1/ Including mail, baggage, restaurant and sleeping cars.
2/ k further increase to 4.57 days has occurred in 1980.



- 11 -
superseding diesel on the more important routes carrying long distance through
traffic, the introduction of a computerized system for locomotive scheduling,
as adopted on some of the European railways, may improve utilization. At
negotiations, the Borrower confirmed the intention to carry out a program of
studies, through technical assistance, designed to improve locomotive utili-
zation through appropriate measures including the introduction of computerized
control systems.
2.20     The availability of diesel locomotives at 85.4% and of freight cars
at 95.5% in 1979 was satisfactory. Availability of electric locomotives was
85.4% in 1979, and is forecast at 85.6% for 1985. The availability of
electric locomotives is acceptable for 1979, because they are of local and
recent manufacture, but should improve to about 88-90% by 1985 by which time
initial teething troubles should have been overcome. During loan negotia-
tions, an understanding was reached with the Borrower that the program of
procurement of electric locomotives will be reviewed in the light of
availability improvements.
Staff Quality
2.21     The management and staff of CFR are technically well qualified and
competent. Planning staff have been quick to grasp Bank-style investment
analysis (para. 1.19).
The Railway Investment Plan (1981-85)
2.22     CFR's 1981-85 Investment Plan (Table 14), prepared as part of
Romania's National Plan (para. 1.09), aims at providing the transport
capacities needed for Romania's expanding economy and for improving operating
efficiency. In the present stringent financial conditions emphasis is now
being placed on early completion of ongoing works with the consequent defer-
ment, until later in the plan period, of some new projects. Although the Plan
is in an advanced stage of the approval process it is not expected to receive
final approval before the end of June 1981.
2.23     All Romanian investments are subject to technical and economic
scrutiny. However, their economic analyses are made at Romanian prices only,
and hitherto there has been no attempt at border pricing. To rank their
projects, they utilize a "payback period" approach. This payback period for
investments is determined by dividing the gross undiscounted investment cost
by the estimated net benefits of a typical operational year. The merit or
otherwise of a project is then determined by the length of the payback period,
the shorter being the more desirable. This type of evaluation, however,
favors projects with high early yields, consistent with a policy of accumu-
lating profits at a high rate for reinvestment. While the transport invest-
ments approved so far appear sound, a broadening of investment analysis
methodology is an objective of the proposed project.



- 12 -
2.24     Authority to proceed with an investment project is given by approval
of the "Nota de Comanda" (NdC), a document which summarizes the main project
features including the total cost; current prices are used with a 5% physical
contingency. The total cost may not be exceeded without approval of a new
NdC, but in practice it is exceeded only rarely. NdCs are prepared at
"catalog" prices which are fixed by law for all tradeable items, including
imports. This pricing system is self-consistent in that all prices cover
domestic costs, themselves based on "catalog" prices, and yield a specified
benefit (profit). Imports which hitherto have been priced below border prices
are, under new pricing regulationsl, to be gradually adjusted nearer to
cost. Investment costs both for the Five-Year Plan and for the proposed
project show no net increases following revisions of catalog prices for 1981.
2.25     The 1981-85 Investment Plan is available only in Romanian prices, but
the cost of all components proposed for inclusion in the proposed project has
been estimated in both Romanian and international prices (para. 3.04).
2.26     A summary of CFR's 1981-85 Investment Plan (Table 14) is given
below. As all costs are based on NdCs, they include a contingency allowance
of about 5% which has proved adequate in the past and is expected to continue
to do so as a result of Romania's tight control over unit prices and
quantities. Although inflation may increase somewhat in the future, it is not
expected to exceed 2% per annum, and any necessary revisions in the provision
of investment funds or in the content of the Investment Plan could readily be
undertaken during the yearly updating.
1/  Official Bulletin Year XVI No. 110 dated December 23, 1980.
The Import/Export Price Equalization Fund which has hitherto
operated in balance, the *excess cost of imports over local prices
being broadly covered by the excess earnings of exports over the
local production costs, is expected only to apply to some raw
materials and other selected items.

2.27     Over half the total investment expenditures are for traction and
rolling stock; of these, one-quarter is for replacements (paras. 2.14-2.16)
and three-quarters for additional capacity.  The mission analyzed traction and
rolling stock proposals, as illustrated by Tables 10 and 11, for locomotives
and freight cars, and found that these investments are needed to enable CFR to
carry the forecast traffic (paras. 2.03-2.05).
2.28     It has been CFR's policy to implement line doubling in stages as
traffic grows, and to avoid the development of bottlenecks. Further doubling
is reasonable in view of the high traffic densities of 15 million gross
ton-km, on average (only 22% of the network is double track); 35% of
investments in line doubling have been included in the proposed project.
Further electrification is also justified by the high traffic density (a
relatively small proportion, 21% of the network, is electrified). The
subsidization of diesel fuel (para. 1.12) and the execution of feasibility
studies at Romanian prices (para. 2.23) are responsible, at least in part, for
the low rate of electrification hitherto. About 48% of electrification
investments have been included in the proposed project. Although the
Romanians are aware of the need for increasing the pace for electrification,
investment constraints (para. 2.22) are limiting progress.
2.29     Virtually all investments in new lines, and steel for one of the two
Danube bridges, (para. 3.11) have been included in the proposed project.
Investments in marshalling yards consist of mechanization of 13 yards (para.
2.13) and the construction of a new yard near Bucharest. About half the
miscellaneous investments consist of infra- structure works, including in some
cases the electrification of sidings needed to increase CFR's capacity to
handle growing traffic from major users.



- 14 -
2.30     To sum up, the mission examined in detail the investment proposals
for traction and rolling stock and for the proposed project; these account for
75% of CFR's Investment Plan. Though the examination of the remaining 25% was
in more general terms, the mission is satisfied that the plan is responsive to
the needs of Romania's economy.
2.31     Capital overhaul of track is charged to operations and is not part of
CFR's Investment Plan. About 3,000 km are to be overhauled with new rail
during 1981-85. This length includes eight high priority sections, totalling
about 610 km, which are to be overhauled during 1981-84 mainly with 60/65 kg
rail (Table 15). During loan negotiations agreement was reached with the
Borrower that CFR will overhaul these sections as programmed.
Financing Plan

C. Highways
Organization
2.33      The Directorate of Roads (DR), under MTTc, is responsible for the
construction and maintenance of the national road network, which comprises
some 14,700 km, or about one-fifth of the country's total network. The
remainder, including district and village roads, is administered by the
"judet" (county) authorities which receive planning and technical assistance
from the Directorate.
2.34      To administer its functions of investment planning, project prepar-
ation and implementation, procurement and maintenance, the Directorate divides
the country into six regions and deploys staff accordingly. Each region is
further subdivided into districts which provide and supervise the teams
executing the maintenance and improvement works needed for the national road
network.
Planning
2.35      For national roads, a five-year plan is formulated on the basis of
improvements identified by the enterprises, industries, and ministries who use
highway facilities extensively, and is coordinated at the Republic level.
Detailed annual plans are prepared one year in advance and their implemen-
tation is monitored by both DR in the physical sense, and IB which, as for
railways, keeps a watching brief on expenditures.
2.36      The planning of provincial and local roads is coordinated at the
Republic level and, as needed, technical advice is obtained from both DR and
the Road Design Institute (RoDI).k/ Provincial and local authorities bear
the responsibility for construction and maintenance and for meeting the
planned targets.
2.37      A particular aspect of planning which is now being emphasized is the
provision of grade-separated road/rail crossings. At present, most are at
grade, but since traffic on each mode has increased substantially in recent
years, the policy is now to separate the traffic streams. Here DR, in
consultation with the local authorities and CFR, determines the priorities for
construction.
Engineering
2.38      DR and RoDI prepare the feasibility studies needed to determine the
justification of projects. They prepare also the final engineering of
projects and utilize the resources of a comprehensive materials laboratory to
facilitate site investigations. Pavement design is one aspect of project
1/ This is part of IPTANA which is also the design institute for sea
and air transport within MTTc.



- 16 -
preparation which is treated exhaustively: considerable care is taken to
select the pavement structure which maximizes the use of locally available
materials and minimizes cost commensurate with strength and durability
criteria.
Construction
2.39      For national roads, investment projects are executed by the RCC, the
principal civil works authority in the country (para. 2.08). Road works are
competently supervised by DR assisted by RoDI and by the services of the
materials laboratory. Minor works on national roads are generally carried out
by DR's personnel with their own equipment. For provincial and local roads,
construction works are generally carried out by their own forces, although for
larger works beyond their capacity they may call on the RCC.
The Network
2.40      Romania has about 73,500 km (Table 17) of roads of which about
39,100 km are unpaved. The primary road network, for which DR, under the
MTTc, is directly responsible, comprises some 14,700 km of which about 14,000
km are paved. The total length of the modernized road network increased from
about 5,900 km in 1960 to about 14,500 km in 1980 (Table 18). However, the
rate of modernization has not kept pace with the demands of vehicle usage.
There is inadequate capacity on certain key links in the network. In some
cases, lack of all-weather access to areas not served by other transport modes
has been a deterrent to progress and development. In others, poor surface
conditions, plus narrow, winding alignments and in many cases excessively
steep gradients, have imposed harsh cost penalties on vehicle usage.
2.41      Only one road, that between Bucharest and Pitesti (100 km), is built
to full expressway standards with limited access (dual carriageways separated
by a central median) and is part of the European "E" road network, whilst
there are about 230 km of four-lane undivided highways, in the main radiating
from Bucharest.
2.42      The bulk of the network (about 58,700 km) comprises district and
communal roads which are administered by the provincial authorities. Of
these, about 20,100 km only were paved as of the end of 1980 (Table 17).
Maintenance
2.43      The maintenance allocation for national roads is about 60% of the
total for all highways (Table 19) and in absolute terms is about US$4,500 per
km, which is high compared with other European countries with similar con-
ditions. For example, neighboring Yugoslavia spends about US$3,600 per km.
2.44      Although, to a limited extent, such a high cost reflects the
maintenance needs of some of the older roads which had been improved or
upgraded some years ago and whose old light pavements are subjected now to
heavy traffic loads and are distressed, the expenditures also cover some
asphalt overlay and betterment works which conventionally would be a debit to
the capital budget.



- 17 -
2.45      Maintenance practices are in general labor intensive and suffer
because labor is in short supply. Many of the routine tasks could be
performed more efficiently and better by machine and it is an objective of the
technical assistance element of the proposed project that the study visits for
key DR personnel should include their exposure to latest maintenance practices
elsewhere.
Road Transport
2.46      The Road Transport Central (RTC) under MTTc is responsible for the
operation and maintenance of the public road transport fleets for the carriage
of both passengers and freight. All transport users have access to RTC
vehicles. However, certain economic units and other organizations have their
own transport fleets whose use is normally limited to meet the local needs
only of their enterprises, but may be extended to inter-city work subject to
RTC's consent. Measures have been taken recently to transfer many of the
enterprises' own fleets to RTC, and to consolidate the remainder into larger
transport units under the control of the concerned ministries, and subject to
the national plan.
2.47      RTC's vehicles are normally used in intercity services and an
important objective is to minimize empty hauls. With the help of a network of
agencies which coordinate the requests for transport users and the collection
of goods, dead mileage is kept to a minimum. Drivers passing through a
district without a load are obliged to contact the local agency and must not
proceed empty unless the agency certifies that an onward load is not available.
2.48      Basic regulations controlling motor vehicle transportation are
contained in the Decrees of the State Council of Romania of December 1977 and
July 1979. They are mainly safety oriented, and focus on speed and load
limitations, and vehicle utilization, but certain measures have been taken
recently to curb fuel consumption (para. 1.12). As an additional energy
saving measure, the use of horse-drawn carts in preference to motor vehicles
is being encouraged for farming needs, in spite of the congestive effects of
such slow-moving vehicles on traffic flows on main roads where they are
frequently encountered. Table 20 gives an indication of usage of selected
routes of the primary network on the basis of 1978 average daily traffic.
2.49      Road transport is developing rapidly and the vehicle fleet has
approximately doubled at an average rate of nearly 12% per annum from about
538,000 in 1972 to 1,016,000 in 1978 (Table 21). The expectation is that this
annual rate of increase will itself increase further as domestic production of
motor vehicles expands. In 1978, nearly 132,000 units were produced (Table
22), but this output will be more than doubled by the end of 1981 when a new
Citroen plant near Craiova is expected to add a further 150,000 units per year.
2.50      The annual export of vehicles has fluctuated around 25,000 units
annually since 1975 (Table 22) and it is conjectural at this stage as to what
proportion of the new Citroen output will be sent abroad. It may be assumed
that much of this new production will go to the domestic market which has long
been repressed through lack of vehicles to purchase, although high price and
other disincentives to vehicle acquisition have in the past also restrained
growth of the private fleet.



18 -
2.51      The indicators seem clear that the road fleet will increase,
certainly in the short run, at a rate much greater than the 12% annual average
recorded heretofore. As a result, traffic forecasts (paras. 2.02-2.05) may
well be exceeded, especially the 4.7% yearly growth estimated for road pas-
senger traffic, and thus aggravate the congestion which already exists on key
links.
Highway Investments (1981-85) and Financing
2.52      Roads and road transport accounted for nearly 25-35% of the total
investments in the transport sector during the 70s (Table 23). A similar
situation is expected during the next plan period also. However, in the
1981-85 plan, special attention will be given to developing small scale
industries, including light processing industries and handicrafts, by using
local resources. The overall production of this sector is expected to more
than double during the next plan period. Such a shift in emphasis would
accentuate the demand for additional investments in the regional, secondary
and feeder roads so necessary to stimulate economic development in outlying
areas of the relatively less developed regions.
2.53      These circumstances notwithstanding, MTTc's 1981-85 Investment Plan
was cut back severely in mid-1980, following the Government's decision to
restrict investment expenditures; the consequent sharply declining trend in
highway investments during the next five years could have resulted in the
development of serious transport bottlenecks, especially as the sector suffers
from past underinvestment. However, Government recently reviewed its earlier
decision and these cutbacks have been partially restored.
2.54      As evidenced by the following table, road investments (excluding
road transport) during the next plan period will be about 7,900 million lei
(US$527 million), about 6% above 1976-80 expenditures in real terms. Comments
made in paras. 2.22 and 2.23 about investment in Romania are also relevant
here.

The length of the modernized road in the entire network is expected to
increase from about 14,500 km in 1980 to about 15,500 km by 1985. The length
of lightly asphalted roads is expected to increase from about 19,700 km to
about 27,000 km during the same period. Special attention is proposed to be
given to overpass structures and the elimination of busy at-grade road/rail
crossings (para. 2.37). Nevertheless, several main roads carrying consider-
able traffic volumes will still remain unpaved. Much of the communal and
district road network needs to be upgraded to provide all-weather service and
older wooden bridges, which restrict vehicle loadings on many of these roads,
need to be replaced.
2.55     The highway (national roads) expenses are financed mainly from the
state budget, whose income sources are a variety of taxes and payments from
the benefits (profits) of the enterprises and the state economic organizations
at republic level and taxes and duties from the population. Similarly,
expenses for district and local roads are met from the budgets of the state
local units whose income sources are freight traffic tax, payments from the
benefits (profits) of the enterprises and the state economic organizations at
local level, taxes on the benefits (profits) of cooperatives and handicrafts,
and taxes levied on the population. With no rules governing the amounts to be
channeled into highway projects, the authorities can determine freely the
amounts to be invested from year to year based on established priorities.
Such a system, as in many other countries, offers flexibility in determining
the amounts of highway expenditures to accord with public policy objectives.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01     The objectives of the project are to assist Romania:
(a) to avoid transport cost increases by providing timely relief of
existing traffic congestion through road and rail investments
intended to widen and increase the capacity of transport links which
are approaching saturation;
(b) to provide all-weather access to a development area, which heretofore
has been served by only a fair weather track, and to provide
transport for a new mine;
(c) to improve the economic evaluation of projects;
(d) to improve monitoring of the use of the road network;
(e) to improve resource allocation in the transport sector by transport
policy analysis (especially in respect of the modal split); and
(f) to familiarize the railway and highway organizations with recent
developments and trends in operating, monitoring and maintenance
techniques utilizing the latest technology.



- 20 -
B. Project Preparation
3.02      MTTc has set up special working groups, which have prepared
Bank-style feasibility studies, using both Romanian and international prices,
for all components of the proposed project. This is the first time that
Romania has carried out transport studies based on a methodology customarily
used in Bank projects, and in this respect key roles were played by MTTc staff
who had attended the courses held with EDI's participation (para. 1.19).
Bank-style analyses have also been made by MTTc for some projects which are
not Bank-financed. However, widespread use of such analyses requires a change
in the law specifying investment criteria. Experience under the proposed
project should enable them to compare Bank-style analyses with those at
present in use. As the latter have not yet been completed for all elements
proposed for the project, an understanding was reached during loan
negotiations that comparison of the results obtained by the two methods should
continue to be made by MTTc and reviewed during project supervision.
C. The Project Description and Cost Estimates
3.03      The proposed project would consist of high priority items included in
the railway and highway 1981-85 Investment Plans, preparation of which was
sufficiently advanced. Project components (Map IBRD 15462R) are summarized in
the table below.

The first column shows the total costs as recorded in Romanian investment
plans. They are derived from NdCs where these are available or calculated
similarly. Thus they are based on "catalog" prices which do not cover the
full cost of imports; they include a 5% contingency, and no other contin-
gencies are allowed (para. 2.24). The railway and highway components account
for 17% and 22%, respectively, of the 1981-85 Investment Plan of the mode in
question.
3.04     The second column shows the local component of total costs, and the
third column the foreign exchange component estimated at international prices;
the sum of these two columns, about 11.5 billion lei (US$767 million), is the
proposed project cost; the foreign exchange component is US$331 million. The
mission identified items suitable for Bank financing totalling US$125 million,
US$94 million for railways, US$30 million for highways and US$1 million for
technical assistance.   Table 24 contains details of railway items on which
the loan would be disbursed, while Table 29 gives similar information for
highways. A US$125 million loan would thus represent about 16% of the total
cost of the project and 38% of the foreign exchange component. Project costs
are detailed for the railway components in Table 25 (investment plan esti-
mates) and Table 26 (World Bank project cost estimates) and for highway
components in Table 27 (under similar headings).
3.05     Cost estimates for the civil works items are based on quantities from
substantially completed final designs, and unit rates based on mid-1981 prices.
3.06     Total Investment Plan costs include a 5% physical contingency al-
lowance (para. 3.03). This 5% contingency was netted out to obtain the basic
value of the local component of the cost faced by Government, and the foreign
exchange component of that cost was calculated using international prices
(para. 3.03-3.04). In accordance with Bank practice, contingencies were then
added as follows: 10% physical contingency; 2% p.a. increase in local cost,
and annual increases in foreign costs of 9%, 8.5% and 7.5% respectively, for
1981, 1982, 1983 and later years.
Railway Components
3.07     New line construction.  Two lines are to be constructed, totalling 77
km. The first, from Vilcele to Rm. Vilcea, closes a 40 km gap between two
existing lines, but traverses difficult mountain terrain and includes two
tunnels totalling about 3 km, and about 3 km of bridges. Maximum gradients
are 1% and miminum curve radius 300 m. In the immediate future the line will
provide a much shorter route for regional traffic. A longer-term benefit will
be its role as a shorter through route from Bucharest to the Hungarian border,
but as it is not yet electrified, operating costs will be higher than on the
existing longer, electrified routes. However, electrification from Bucharest
to a point near the new line is included in the 1981-85 Investment Plan, and
the authorities propose in due course to continue electrification beyond the



- 22 -
new line. This investment should yield substantial benefits because much of
the heavy traffic on the alternative routes would ultimately divert to this
more direct route.
3.08     The other line will link a coal producing area at Berbesti to the
railway network at Babeni, 37 km away. It traverses the Carpathian foothills,
and will include 4 km of tunnels and 2 km of viaducts, with gradients of up to
2.1% and curves down to 250 m. Both lines will have 49 kg rails on concrete
sleepers, telephone block working and mechanical with key interlocking. Since
this line will serve a new mine providing fuel for a power station being con-
verted to coal operation, agreement was reached with the Borrower during loan
negotiations that the complementary mining and electrical power investments
will be made on time.
3.09     Line doubling.  Three line sections totalling 124 km will be
doubled. Each is joined to at least one section which has already been
doubled, and carries at present about 15-25 million gross tons (Table 28).
Tunnels, totalling about 2 km, will have to be constructed on only one
section, Rm. Vilcea-Podul Olt. Rails will be 49 kg on concrete sleepers, with
automatic block and electro-dynamic signalling, and in each station signals
and points will be controlled from a single location.
3.10     Electrification.  Four hundred and seventy route-km of main lines
will be electrified on three sections, at 25 kV, 50 c/s. Except for
Dej-Cluj-Simeria which is already double track, electrification will be
installed in conjunction with line doublings (Table 28). Telecommunications
and signalling works needed in conjunction with electrification are part of
the proposed project.
3.11     Danube bridges.  CFR's busiest railway route starts at Constanta,
crosses both arms of the Danube, at Cernavoda and Borcea, and then bifurcates
westward to Bucharest and northwestwards to Tandarei. All these lines,
including the Cernavoda-Borcea link, are double track, but the intensively
worked bridges over the two arms of the Danube are single track and constitute
what is probably Romania's most critical transport bottleneck. These bridges
are 100 years old and are near the end of their useful lives. CFR is
replacing them by double track combined road and rail bridges, for which piers
are now being built. However, contracts have yet to be awarded for the super-
structure of the bridge at Cernavoda, and the high tensile steel for manu-
facture of the components would be financed from the Bank loan.
3.12     Freight Cars.  The requirements for freight cars for the 1981-85
Investment Plan as a whole are based on system-wide traffic and operating
needs and include the cars for additional traffic allocable to transport
facilities created or improved by the works included in the project.I/ The
project provides for the acquisition of 330 cars initially needed for such
traffic.
1/ Mobile asset costs allocable to such facilities are included in the
economic evaluation in Chapter IV.

Highway components (Annex 3)
3.13     Paving of two-lane gravel roads.  Three gravel roads, totalling 110
km, are to be paved. Two are in difficult terrain in the Carpathian
foothills. The first, 37 km long, between Schitu Golesti and Curtea de Arges,
carries considerable coal traffic from mines near Schitu Golesti. The
proposed alignment will be 4 km longer, to avoid areas of instability and to
reduce excessive gradients; pavement construction will be staged to follow
traffic growth. The second will upgrade a 29 km track linking Adjud and
Birlad and will attract most of the traffic from the existing alternative
route which involves a 40 km detour. The track which is the only means of
access to several villages, traverses a highly friable loess soil which, after
only a little rain becomes slick and negotiable only by four-wheel-drive
vehicles. It is virtually impassable for about six months in the year.
Availability of an all-weather road will have important developmental effects,
especially as substantial food processing investments being made at Podul
Turcului could not otherwise be adequately exploited. Finally, the 40 km
Craiova-Balcesti road is in such poor condition that travellers prefer to make
an extra journey of 30 km to avoid it. Seven sections of this road, totalling
16 km have been improved, and the proposed project includes the remaining five
sections.
3.14     Widening from two to four lanes.  One of Romania's busiest roads
extends northwards from Bucharest, to Ploiesti, Cimpina, Brasov and beyond.
Its area of influence contains Romania's main oil fields, refineries, heavy
and chemical industries, vehicle assembly plants, and a rich agricultural
area. The Bucharest-Ploiesti section is already four-lane and the road
eastwards from Brasov is four-lane for 4 km. The proposed project includes
the widening of the next 6 km to Harman, to accommodate growing commuter,
industrial and agricultural traffic.
3.15     New Construction.  Construction of the railway bridges at Borcea and
Cernavoda 7para. 3.11) now offers the opportunity to shorten by about 60 km
the main highway connection between Bucharest and the Black Sea in Romania's
most heavily trafficked corridor. Cantilevers are being added to the two new
bridges to provide four-lane road crossings; however, most of the highway is
two-lane at present. It is proposed to include in the proposed project the
construction of the intervening 17 km road between Borcea and Cernavoda; the
approaches to the bridges will be four-lane, to ensure symmetrical bridge
loading, but the remaining 11 km will be two-lane with provision for widening
later to four lanes.
3.16     The Cernavoda-Constanta highway is being improved at present and, to
ensure that full benefit is obtained from the new construction, during loan
negotiations the Borrower agreed that improvements on the Bucharest-Fetesti
road will be made, as needed and co-terminal with the completion of the
project road. The Borrower also confirmed that no improvements should be made
to the longer highway without adequate study of the traffic assignments in the
Bucharest-Constanta corridor.

Technical Assistance
3.17     Traffic Optimization Study.  This study (paras. 1.14 and 1.15) has
the principal objectives of promoting energy conservation, improving inventory
control and more closely defining the relationships between tariffs and
service-specific costs. It will entail reviewing the existing criteria and
procedures for determining transport linkages and the modal split in order to
recommend improvements. Terms of reference for the study (Annex 4) have been
discussed with the authorities and are acceptable.
3.18     The authorities have insisted that the study be undertaken by
Romanian consultants since foreign consultants are not familiar with the
Romanian system. Romanian institutes, such as the Technological Research and
Design Institute for Transport (ICPTT), have competent staff which could
undertake this study, and their employment on the project would contribute to
the development of Romania's consulting industry. Tt is therefore proposed to
award the study, which is expected to require about 150 man-months of expert
services, to Romanian consultants and to finance their services in full from
the proposed loan at a cost of about US$825,000. Average man-month rate is
estimated at US$5,500 based on individual's fees and reimbursable expenses.
Inclusion of the study in the proposed project and the use of
consultants, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, was agreed
with the Borrower during loan negotiations.
3.19     Employment of foreign experts and training abroad.  It may be
desirable, however, to use foreign consultants for specialized methodological
tasks, or to enable Romanian experts to visit foreign organizations engaged in
similar work. The visits of foreign consultants or study travel abroad by
Romanians would also be useful in connection with improvements in car control
and locomotive utilization (paras. 2.18-2.19) as well as familiarization with
modern highway maintenance practices (para. 2.45). The estimated foreign cost
of such technical assistance would be about US$175,000 which would include
about 30 man-months covering individual's fees, international travel and local
allowances at about US$5,800 per man-month. During loan negotiations the
Borrower confirmed the intention to prepare by June 1982 a program for such
visits for discussion and agreement with the Bank.
D. Project Engineering
3.20     Highway engineering standards, which are adequate, are given in Annex
5. Engineering, according to these design standards, has been carried out by
the DR in conjunction with the Design Institute, RoDI, and the materials
laboratory. The design standards for the railway works are shown in Annex 2.
These standards are defined by the Railway Design Institute (RDI) for each
item. In the case of new lines the principles of economic railway location
are followed in respect of ruling gradients, minimum curvature, bridge and
axleloads, track structure, etc. For line doubling the profile generally



- 25 -
follows the existing alignment except where deviations offer economic and
engineering advantages. Standards for electrification follow broadly inter-
national practices. On the whole the specified standards are satisfactory.
3.21        Although  detailed  engineering  is substantially  complete  for  the 14
construction subprojects which would be included in the project, NdCs (para.
2.24) have been finally approved for only two. The remainder are still being
reviewed by beneficiaries, and final approval is expected at the end of June
1981. According to IB and MTTc representatives, significant changes are
unlikely. During negotiations, cost estimates were discussed and confirmed
with the Borrower. The data used in the preparation of the project and the
source material are listed in Annex 6.
E. Financing
3.22        Project costs  in U.S.  dollars,  as estimated  by the Bank  (para  3.04),
would be broadly met from the following sources:

/c  Although $2 million for railway component may not be disbursed until after December 31, 1985
it is included in the table to match corresponding expenditure in project forecasts.



- 26 -
3.23     From its own resources, CFR would provide about US$187 million.11
The proposed Bank loan of US$94 million meets about one-third of the foreign
costs of the railway component of the project (Table 26). The balance of
project funds amounting to US$333 million would be met by the State.
3.24     For the highways component the proposed loan allocation is US$30
million which meets about three-quarters of the foreign exchange costs. The
remaining foreign costs together with the local costs (US$122.5 million in
total) would be met by the State.
3.25     All project costs including cost overruns as well as funds in excess
of those budgetted in MTTc's investment plans would be met by the Government
of Romania in terms of the Guarantee Agreement. In addition during loan
negotiations agreement was reached with the Borrower that design standards may
only be modified by agreement with the Bank.
3.26     Items suitable for Bank financing are analyzed in detail by sub-
projects for railways totaling US$94 million (Table 24) and for highways,
US$30 million (Table 29).
Co-financing
3.27     The Bank should continue to assist the Government in obtaining
co-financing from appropriate sources, but, regardless of the amount of
co-financing available, Romania is considered capable of financing the balance
of foreign exchange costs, as well as the local costs. Also, it would not be
possible for all offers of co-finance to be made, approved and effective until
after Board approval of the proposed Bank loan. Therefore, approval of the
proposed loan should not be deferred on this account, or made conditional on
the obtaining of co-finance.
F. The Loan, the Borrower and Beneficiaries
3.28     The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the IB and the loan would
be guaranteed by the Socialist Republic of Romania. The IB is the specialized
agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for dealing with investment projects in
all sectors of the economy, except in agriculture (including water resources)
and food processing. It has a large technical and economic staff at its
Headquarters, and branch offices throughout the country. The IB's involvement
in investment projects commences in the preparation phase; it appraises all
major projects technically and financially according to Romanian procedures
and, in the case of the proposed Land Transport Project, has facilitated the
economic analysis, by the appropriate agencies, of all subprojects according
to Bank methodology.
I/ The railways contribution is assumed to be 44% of the railway project
cost at Romanian prices, (Table 25), the percentage for "important
developments" was derived from the 1981-85 Plan (Table 2.2 in
para. 2.32).



- 27 -
3.29     The IB makes recommendations to the Council of State on major
projects and their financing, and all investment funds for an approved project
are channeled through the IB which authorizes payments for work performed in
accordance with the approved plan. It is IB's responsibility to ensure that a
project is executed according to the financial and technical data included in
the final approval (Project de Executie), and its inspectors supervise
projects to ensure progress according to the approved schedule.
3.30     The IB will supervise the execution of the proposed project with the
participation of MTTc, which will be responsible for the overall coordination
of the project and project-related activities within the MTTc. The railway
and highway components of the loan will be channeled through IB respectively
to the Railway Department and the Road Directorate, which will be responsible
for the coordination of project components in their subsectors. MTTc will be
responsible for the technical assistance element including the traffic optimi-
zation study (paras. 3.18 and 3.19). The immediate beneficiaries from the
proposed project will be the railway and highway regional organizations, and
ultimately, the users.
G. Project Implementation
3.31     For railways, MTTc has within its organization the RDI and the RCC
which together constitute the two main implementing agencies for creating new
facilities (para. 2.08). While the RDI undertakes field surveys and investi-
gations (with some input from the railway regional staff), prepares designs
and drawings, estimates, feasibility studies as well as all documentation
preparatory to the execution of a project, the RCC (one of the biggest
construction organizations in Romania, employing 55,000 people) executes all
railway construction works including new lines, line doubling, electri-
fication, signalling, etc. Both these organizations are well staffed by
competent people; RDI has 1,350 employees of whom 400 are graduate engineers.
The physical execution of the project items will be entrusted to RCC under
firm contracts for each subproject. The supervision and acceptance of the
work will be by regional staff supported by senior engineers from the RDI when
necessary. Thus, while the overall responsibility for the implementation of
the project will rest with the MTTc, the devolution of the responsibility to
the executing agencies within the MTTc is well defined and the agencies'
competence satisfactory, judged by the timely completion of similar railway
facilities in the past.
3.32     DR would be responsible for executing the road works under the
project. That Directorate, with the assistance of the personnel and resources
of the materials laboratory of the Transport Research and Design Institute,
and of the RoDI, would also be responsible for supervising the road
construction.



- 28 -
3.33     Construction of the project roads will be executed by the RCC's
departmental forces on the basis of prices, unit rates, and quantities of work
determined and agreed prior to loan negotiations.
3.34     Agreement was reached at negotiations that IB would supervise the
execution of the project including the procurement of goods and services.
3.35     Project Implementation Schedule.  With the possible exception of the
cantilevers to carry the roads over the two Danube bridges at Fetesti and
Cernavoda, all the project roads are scheduled to be completed by the end of
1984 and the railway works by the end of 1985. At negotiations the project
implementation schedules (Tables 30 and 31) and progress reporting procedures
were discussed and confirmed. The Borrower also agreed to prepare a project
completion report within six months of the Loan Closing Date. That report
shall cover separately each project rail and road section and shall outline
also the evaluation of the road and rail subsectors.
3.36     The process of acquiring the land needed to build or extend the
project roads has already commenced. No difficulties are foreseen that might
delay construction. The process has not yet started for most railway works.
At negotiations the Borrower agreed that measures needed for prompt acquisi-
tion of all lands would be taken by the appropriate departments of the
guarantor.
3.37     Allowing for some slippage, the project completion date should be
June 30, 1986. The Loan Closing Date should be March 31, 1987, allowing for
about nine months for the release of security deposits on supply contracts
where performance guarantees are specified.
H. Procurement
3.38     Procurement will be by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines, on the basis of a list of equipment and
materials agreed between Government and the Bank for purchase under the loan.
On the basis of a US$125 million loan (para. 3.04), the goods on which the
railway component (US$94 million) of Bank loan would be disbursed would
consist of rails, steel for concrete sleepers, points and crossings, track
fittings, copper contact wire and substation equipment used for electri-
fication, cables for signalling and telecommunications required for new lines,
doubling of track and electrification, special steel for the Danube bridge at
Cernavoda, telecommunication equipment (including radio-telephone systems) and
a limited number of freight cars (Table 32). For the highway component of
US$30 million, the goods to be procured would comprise road construction and
maintenance equipment, bitumen, and reinforcing steel (Table 29). However,
the Bank would not directly finance the equipment and materials for road works
but would disburse funds equivalent to about 75% of the foreign exchange costs



- 29 -
of civil works construction under the proposed project. These works would be
carried out by RCC (para. 3.33) which is experienced and familiar with local
conditions, methods and regulations. This practice has been acceptable to the
Bank for previous projects in order to "stay with" the project for effective
supervision after equipment procurement.
3.39     Almost every type of equipment required for the project is manu-
factured in Romania. It is expected that Romanian bidders will be successful
for all ICB items with the exception of bitumen (about US$5 million)
especially as Romanian manufacturers and suppliers would be allowed a prefer-
ence of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is the lower.
3.40     The responsibility for initiating procurement action for items
financed by the proposed Bank Loan rests with the IB. At the request of IB,
MTTc's Foreign Trade Enterprise (FTE) (called CONTRANSIMEX in Romania)
consults with the Design Institute, the Railway Department and the DR, and
prepares the bidding documents for approval by the Bank through IB. All the
further procedures, until the final stage of placing the contract for the
supply of material and equipment, are processed through the IB. During loan
negotiations, the Borrower and the Bank reviewed and agreed the lists of goods
(Tables 29 and 32) to be purchased mainly through ICB. A few items such as
remote control equipment for railway electrification and some minor items of
highway machinery would be procured through prudent shopping amongst inter-
national suppliers; the total value would not exceed $1.5 million with a limit
of $200,000 for individual contracts.
I. Disbursements
3.41     For railway equipment and materials the loan would be disbursed
against the full cost of foreign contracts, including insurance and freight if
contracted with non-Romanian organizations, and against the full ex-factory
cost of contracts won by Romanian organizations.
3.42     For highways, the proceeds of the loan would finance about 75% of the
foreign costs or about 25% of the Investment Plan costs of the subprojects;
disbursements would be made at that proportion (25%) of total expenditures,
which may be varied by agreement between the Bank and the Borrower.
Statements of Expenditures, against which the Bank will disburse, will be
submitted at regular intervals by the DR through the IB in respect of work
completed on each project road. In this respect the DR's accounting branch is
competently staffed and routinely maintains records adequate to meet the
Bank's requirements for disbursement under this procedure. However, no
disbursements shall be made from the loan allocation for Civil Works until the
Bank has received satisfactory evidence from the Government that ICB procure-
ments have been made for highway construction equipment and materials in an



- 30 -
aggregate amount sufficient to cover anticipated withdrawals. During loan
negotiations, the Government's agreement to the foregoing disbursement
arrangements was obtained.
3.43     The loan would finance, in full, technical assistance expenditures,
both foreign and domestic.
3.44     Assuming the loan becomes effective late 1981, a schedule of
disbursements has been prepared and is shown in Table 33. The schedule of
estimated disbursements was discussed and confirmed during loan negotiations.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      Increased emphasis is being given to the development of Romania's own
natural resources, including coal and lignite, in the 1981-85 Development
Plan. Relatively high growth rates, about 9-10% per annum are envisaged
within metallurgy, machine building, chemical and a number of other basic
heavy industries, as compared with an overall growth rate of 6-7% per annum
for the economy as a whole. In general, these economic priorities will result
in increased transport requirements by rail of heavy and bulky raw materials
and semi-finished products, although increasing efforts are also being made to
locate processing industries at raw material sources using road transport for
short hauls. As in the past the railway investment programs will remain
closely related to the transport needs of high priority industries.
Furthermore, the railways are likely to assume renewed significance in the era
of energy consciousness.
4.02     Parallel to the overall economic growth objectives, the plan aims to
reduce inter-regional disparities in development levels and to generate
employment opportunities in rural areas with the development of small scale
processing units. Considerable emphasis is, therefore, being given to
selected road developments which would solve some pressing socio-economic
problems and which would also catalyse development within their zones of
influence.
4.03     Many important links in the transport networks are already overloaded
and with the projected growths in traffic would become even more congested.
The proposed project aims at relieving transport bottlenecks and mounting
congestion on some of the most heavily trafficked railway and road sections.
These lines and road sections connect several large cities and industrial
areas and are of critical importance both for the transport network and the
country. Some of the project road sections would also provide direct
all-weather paved road connections between several growing commercial centers,
and would also open up some areas which are now isolated for much of the year.



- 31 -
4.04     The ultimate beneficiaries of the proposed project would be rail/road
users who, due to the diversity of traffic using the rail/road networks, come
from a wide range of sectors and income groups. The proposed project will
benefit long distance as well as local traffic. The important commodities
that would be affected by the modernization and improvement of the proposed
rail/road sections are raw and processed industrial materials including
mining, wood and wood products, other manufactured goods, construction
materials, and agricultural commodities. The favorable impact of the proposed
project will also be felt by the rail/road passengers from the higher quality
of service and travel comfort.
B. Project Costs and Benefits
4.05     The economic evaluation of the different subprojects is based on the
feasibility studies undertaken by the Railways and the Roads Directorates in
the MTTc. These studies were reviewed and discussed with the concerned
agencies and a number of marginal subprojects were either reformulated or
postponed as a result of the review.
4.06     The traffic projections for the different subprojects are based on
past traffic trends, recent origin-destination studies and planned increases
in production and consumption in the zones of influence. The forecasts take
into account normal traffic growth and, wherever appropriate, the additional
traffic generated by the proposed project over the normal project life.
4.07     Overall, the rail sections considered for doubling and electri-
fication are at present carrying about 15-25 million gross tons per km per
annum (Table 28). The projected growth in traffic volumes on these rail
sections range from 3-5% per annum. These growth rates are low when compared
with past rates. Traffic justification (about 4 million net tons per annum)
of a new short railway line (Babeni-Berbesti) in the proposed project depends
on the mining and thermal power generation ventures which it serves. Three of
the road sections (Podul Turcului-Birlad, Craiova-Balcesti and Schitu
Golesti-Curtea de Arges) in the project, on which traffic flows are estimated
between 500 and 1,000 vehicles per day at present (Annex 3), would provide
important direct links to the railways. Of these roads, two sections, Podul
Turcului-Birlad, and Craiova-Balcesti, would afford sizeable distance savings
for through traffic and would provide better access and thereby promote
development in their zones of influence. The other road included in the
project requiring widening is heavily congested with about 8,000 vehicles per
day with a high proportion (about 60%) of heavy commercial vehicles.
4.08     For calculating the economic benefits and costs, international prices
have been used for imported equipment and materials, and other tradeable
commodities. In Romania, prices of railway traction and rolling stock, rails,



- 32 -
road trucks, diesel fuel, electricity and many other important components
influencing transport activity are significantly below the border prices
(Table 34). Labor, land, and other nontradeable items like "ballast and
stones", have been valued at local prices. Prices were translated at the
official trading rate of 18 Lei per U.S. dollar prevailing at the time of
project appraisal. Adjustment of the exchange rate to the current US$l = Lei
15 affects both cost and benefit streams in the same direction. Further the
proportion of foreign exchange in both cost and benefit streams are very
similar. Current adjustments, therefore, do not change the economic and
financial viability of the subprojects to any significant extent.
4.09     Quantified benefits due to the proposed project will result mainly
from reduced maintenance and operating costs, and improved utilization of
traction and rolling stock. For road sections where traffic congestion is
heavy or where substantial distance saving is involved, the economic analysis
takes into account savings in passenger travel time.11 Savings in transport
costs, excluding passenger time savings, account for about 80% of the total
benefits on these heavily congested roads. Benefits due to increased comfort,
convenience and safety have not been considered.
4.10     In selecting the proposed investments, several alternative solutions
were evaluated such as doubling and/or electrification, improving or recon-
structing the existing road, constructing a new one, construction of the
ultimate four lanes at once or by stages, construction of aerial cableway,
etc. For each project section, the most economic solution has been adopted.
C. Economic Return
4.11     Based on the most probable estimates of construction costs, operating
and maintenance costs and time costs, the proposed investments on the project
rail/road sections produce economic returns (ERs) ranging from 13-70% (Table
35). All investments would yield first-year benefits of 10% or more. The
weighted average ERs of all civil works components, which account for about
99% of total project cost are 20% for the project as a whole, and 24% and 15%
respectively for its railways and highways components. The above ERs
understate the full economic benefits of the project by excluding reductions
in accidents and the greater comfort and convenience of travellers on the
1/ To take social overhead and indirect costs into account, time
savings were valued at 1.1 times the average hourly wage rate of
travellers in the influence area of journeys made for business
purposes and at 1/4 the average wage rates for other journeys.



- 33 -
improved railway and highway facilities. Sensitivity analyses were carried
out to test the effects of variations in construction costs and users'
benefits on the above estimates. Even under the unfavorable assumptions of
15% higher construction costs combined with a 15% reduction in users' benefits
the ERs remained within the range of 10-55% with an overall weighted ER of 16%
which is still an acceptable level.
Railway Subprojects
4.12     Doubling of the Ilia-Arad and Faurei-Tandarei lines would yield
relatively high benefits (Table 35) as the expenditures are for completing
ongoing works, yielding full benefits on completion.
4.13     The ERs of railway electrification of the three lines, namely
Dej-Cluj-Simeria, Mintia-Arad and Faurei-Tandarei are 20% and above (Table 35)
though financial returns of the railways on these electrifications in terms of
Romanian Investment Plan prices are estimated around 10-12%. The difference
between the economic and financial rates of return results largely from the
differences in the economic and financial costs of diesel fuel and electrical
energy. Although Romania is at present importing substantial quantities of
crude oil, diesel oil is still being made available to the railways at much
below resource costs. As a result, financial returns to the railways on
electrification are less attractive than the ERs based on resource costs,
which amply justify electric traction.
4.14     The new line Vilcele-Rm. Vilcea (para. 3.08) is interlinked with the
doubling of Rm. Vilcea-Podul Olt section and yields an ER of 22% by saving
considerable distances for about 3 million tons of freight per annum. The ER
of 13% on the other new line Babeni-Berbesti is based on the planned
development of a new lignite mine at Berbesti with a production capacity of
about 4 million tons in 1984 and the gradual switch over by the Govora thermal
power station from oil/gas to coal during the same time (para. 3.09). The
project variants considered included transport by road.
4.15     The Constanta-Bucharest transport corridor is the most important in
the country. At present, the two old single track railway bridges over the
Danube on the double track Bucharest-Constanta electrified railway act as a
serious impediment to smooth traffic flow. The freight traffic on this
section is about 40 million net tons per annum. The proposed new
rail-cum-road bridges across the Danube, therefore, are of crucial signi-
ficance in Romania's transport system and yield a satisfactory ER of about 14%
compared with the ferry alternative.
Highway Subprojects
4.16     The paving of three gravel roads would provide all weather routes
which would act as important distributors/collectors of a considerable volume



- 34 -
of railway traffic, particularly of coal, forest, produce and agricultural
commodities. Two would shorten the average journeys for through traffic from
Adjud/Podul Turcului to Birlad and from Craiova to Balchesti by about 40 km
and 30 km respectively. The link proposed between Podul Turcului and Birlad
is an entirely new one which would help to provide necessary medical, educa-
tional and essential facilities in this remote area and would open up other
possibilities for the future. Savings in vehicle operating costs amply
justify the proposed investments, with ERs ranging from 13-19%.
4.17     The proposed addition of two new lanes and the improvement of
alignment on one short section, from Brasov to Harman, is expected to yield ER
of about 25% mainly on account of the reduction of congestion costs as
quantified in time and operational cost savings.
4.18     Construction of a new road between Fetesti and Cernavoda on the main
route between Bucharest, the capital, and Constanta, the Black Sea port, would
substantially lower transport costs due to distance savings of about 60 km
(paras. 3.16-3.17). The new section is estimated to yield an ER of 15%.
Other Project Elements
4.19     Benefits could not be quantified for other project elements, namely,
techlnical assistance and training which are necessary for the project as a
whole and whose benefits will permeate the entire investment plan.
D. Project Risks
4.20     The clear economic justification for the project and the planned
nature of the Romanian economy which helps to ensure that traffic forecasts
and construction programs will be realized would indicate that no special
risks are expected in the execution and implementation of the proposed project.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION FOR RAILWAYS
A. General
Accounts
5.01     The national accounting code and the standard accounting package
(operating results, balance sheet and annexes) were revised in 1979 to
accommodate the new economic and financial measures generally effective from



- 35 -
January 1, 1979. The accounts appear to be well-kept and promptly prepared on
an increasingly computerized basis. Fourteen days are allowed for monthly, 20
days for quarterly and 25 days for annual presentations.
Capital Investment
5.02     Under the new economic and financial measures investments in produc-
tive assets are financed either from the "Fund for New Enterprises and
Important Development", or from a unit's "Fund for Economic Developments".
Important developments are defined by law and in the case of railways are
designated as; (a) procurement of locomotives and cars; (b) new lines; (c)
doubling existing lines; (d) electrification of lines; and (e) bridges over
the Danube and Borcea. About 75% of railways' investments fall within this
category of important investments and these remain tightly controlled by the
State. Railways, in common with other economic units, are to be given more
control over the remaining 25% of investments to be financed from their "Funds
for Economic Development". The "Fund for Important Developments" is financed
partially from railways' "own funds" (depreciation and benefit) and partially
from State allocations repayable, but interest free. The State allocations
may be reduced to the extent to which foreign loans are obtained. The "Funds
for Economic Development" are financed mainly from "own funds" but can be
supplemented by repayable, interest-bearing State credits.
Plans (Budgets)
5.03     The railways' subsector, in common with other sectors of the economy,
is subject to the strict discipline of the centrally prepared and controlled
five-year plan, for cperations and investments. Within the framework of the
five-year plan, detailed annual plans are prepared for one year ahead and
performance is measured against these detailed plans on a quarterly and annual
basis, with improved workers' bonuses for profits in excess of forecasts and
penalties for shortfalls.
Audit
5.04     Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises submit
periodic operational and financial reports to their "Central", the appropriate
Ministry and the Investment and National Banks. These reports serve primarily
to ensure achievement of plan targets and proper use of and accounting for
funds. Though the contents and presentation of these reports differ from
those normally received by the Bank they can be adapted to provide adequate
information for the Bank to monitor the progress of project implementation and
operations. During negotiations agreement was reached that the accounts of
the railways audited by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles consistently applied should be furnished to the Bank
through the IB not later than six months after the end of each year.



- 36 -
Insurance
5.05     Normal business risks are not insured in Romania.  Although enter-
prises set aside a small share of benefit to cover unforeseen events, this is
only sufficient to meet minor loss or damage. The State acts as its own
insurer, reimbursing enterprises which suffer major losses arising from events
beyond their control or making specific provision for replacement of major
assets in the next State Budget.
Accounting Assumptions
5.06     The principal assumptions made in the following presentations of Past
Financial Performance and Future Financial Position are set out in Annex 7.
B. Past Financial Performance
Operating Results
5.07     Table 36 includes operating results for the seven years 1974-80
combining the nine operating regions and the centralized activities included
in the railways' accounts. Excluding interest, which was negligible during
this period, and capital overhaul of track (normally capitalized but, in
Romania, charged to operations) the results for alternate years are summarized
as follows:

Revenue
5.08     Although passenger volume increased by less than 4% during the period,
revenue per passenger-km rose by nearly 30%, mainly due to the 1977 fare
increase.  Freight rates were last increased in 1974, but revenue increased
with volume by about 26%.  The proportion of passenger revenue to total revenue
consequently increased from 25-27%.
Working Expenses
5.09     Wage increases of about 15% in real terms were absorbed without
difficulty in 1978.  Fuel expenses have been slightly reduced during the
period, increased costs of fuel being offset by progress with dieselisation and
electrification. Charges for other materials show no increase since 1976 and
this may be linked with some inadequacies in maintenance, particularly of the
track (para. 2.11). Periodic repair costs have increased steadily as mid-term
overhauls have become due on locomotives obtained within the past 10-15 years.
The working ratio has not exceeded 69 in the past six years.
Operating Expenses
5.10     The operating ratio has exceeded 85 only once, in 1976.  A ratio of 88
in that year was improved to 78 in 1977, mainly by the national policy of
retaining assets in use for maximum periods with correspondingly lower
depreciation charges and by the rate increase for passenger traffic.  Average
rail asset lives are now about 50 years (locomotives 35-40 years). However,
the depreciation charges, together with benefit, generate adequate internal
resources for investment (para. 5.13).
Net Operating Income ("Benefit")
5.11     In the planned Romanian economy, the target for the railways is to
produce for all activities combined a "benefit" of about 15% of expenditure.
This has been well exceeded for the past four years, 1977-80, and the return on
average net fixed assets in use during the 1976-80 plan period has been about
5%. These results are due to the high density of traffic, about 15 million
gross ton-km per km per year on the average, and the high productivity per
employee of about 560,000 operating traffic units per year.
Costing
5.12     Annually all costs are allocated on a computer program to passenger
and freight traffic, both on a subjective (financial sub-heads) and an
objective (types of work) basis, to provide average system-wide costs. The
methodology has been developed in detail and is revised at not less than five
yearly intervals while the coefficients used to apportion expenses which cannot
be directly allocated are revised annually. A summary of the analyses for



- 38 -
1977-79 is given in Table 37. The cost per traffic unit increased by less
than 5% during the period although wages increased by about 15%.

5.15      The need to revalue fixed assets is recognized in principle but
because of the low rate of inflation!/ in Romania, such revaluations have
taken place only at the end of 1963 and 1976, and the change in net fixed
asset values resulting from the latter was negligible. Up to 1978, no
distinction was made in the accounts between State equity and amounts provided
from railways' own funds because the latter were paid over to the State and
subsequently included in the gross repayable State allocations. Long-term
debt was virtually non-existent and a debt/equity ratio was therefore not
meaningful. From 1979 and at least through the plan period 1981-85,
1/ Averaging 0.8% p.a. in recent years.



- 40 -
the net repayable State allocations will steadily increase because investment
on "important developments" will exceed the depreciation charges and 10% of
benefit which the CFR would otherwise be required to repay to the State for
prior years' allocations. The current ratio has ranged between 1.6 and 2.0
since 1974 and the liquid ratio is consistently around 0.8. These are satis-
factory in view of short-term borrowing arrangements which can be utilized to
supplement working capital as necessary.

- 41 -
5.17     These forecasts are prepared within the context of the Five-Year Plan
for 1981-85 on the basis of 1981 prices including the second tranche of the
wage increase (in real terms) authorized during the 1976-80 plan, which was
effective from December 1, 1980. Price changes authorized, effective January
1, 1981, include a 30% increase for diesel fuel and electricity used by
railways and a consequential increase in rail freight rates of 5.7% has been
authorized from the same date. If further price or wage increases are
authorized during the 1981-85 Plan period tariffs would again have to be
reviewed at that time.
5.18     Meanwhile, at current rates, revenue per passenger-km is forecast to
reduce by only 1% through the period but revenue per freight ton-km falls by
about 2% due to changes in the commodity mix, principally increases in bulk
coal movements and an increasing proportion of small-volume higher-rated
traffic moving by road. Working expenses (including periodic repairs) are
generally held to 1981 levels by increased staff productivity and better
energy utilization and the costs per traffic unit reduce by nearly 10%. While
recognizing the general merit of the exacting targets being set for the
Five-Year Plan, concern was expressed about constraints on track maintenance
(para. 2.11).
5.19     Depreciation will rise about 30% and the charge per Traffic Unit (TU)
about 15% as the ongoing 1976-80 and further 1981-85 investment plans mature.
The combined effect of these trends would improve the working ratio from 68 to
63 and the operating ratio from 81 to 78 and the overall rate of return on net
fixed assets should hold at about 5.0% despite the increase in net fixed asset
values.l/ The net cash generated by depreciation and the anticipated
operating surpluses should finance more than 50% of investments and any
further price changes (para. 5.17) are not expected to affect these
satisfactory prospects adversely.
Cash Flow Forecasts 1981-85
5.20     Table 38 includes cash forecasts for 1981-85 which are summarized as
follows for the five-year period.

5.21     CFR should to be able to finance 54.3% of its US$2.5 billion 1981-85
capital investment from its net internal resources, slightly better than the
53.6% achieved for 1976-80 for a comparable level of investment. For the
important developments which the proposed bank loan will principally support,
the net internal resources would provide about 43% of the finance required and
about 90% for the other less important items. The financing plans for the
plan and project are discussed in paras. 2.32 and 3.22-3.26. About half of
CFR's forecast gross internal resources consist of depreciation and half is
net income which is reasonably assured by the pricing mechanism (para. 5.17).

5.23     Net repayable State allocations continue to increase (para. 5.15)
with a consequential increase in the debt/equity ratio to 27:73 by 1985. This
trend will persist while the costs of "important developments" exceed the net
internal resources allocable. However, excluding the net repayable State
allocations, the commercial-type debt outstanding at the end of 1985 would be
about 2 1/2% of total debt and equity and the Bank loan would represent less
than 1 1/4%. Annual servicing of the Bank loan would absorb less than 1% of
CFR's gross internal resources.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During loan negotations agreement was reached on the following
principal matters:
(i) the implementation of a technical assistance program including a
traffic optimization study (paras. 2.19, 3.17-19);
(ii) the resources needed for track maintenance and overhaul including the
introduction of heavy track maintenance equipment would be provided
promptly as needed (paras. 2.11, 2.31);
(iii) the complementary investments needed for the project including those
in other sectors would be made on time (paras. 3.08, 3.16); and
(iv) no improvements would be made to other routes parallel to the
Bucharest-Fetesti road without adequate study (para. 3.16).
(v) the equipment listed in Tables 29 and 32 for the highway and rail
components of the loan would, except for some minor items, be
procured by ICB, but for the highway part of the loan, disbursements
would be made against Statements of Expenditure in line with progress
of the project roads (paras. 3.40 and 3.42).
6.02     With the agreements indicated above and others recorded in the text
the project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$125 million to IB for a 15
year term including a three-year grace period.

Traffic Trends and Forecasts
General
1.       Detailed analyses of surface traffic trends for the period 1960-80
are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Commodity analyses for 1972 and 1978-80 are
given in Tables 3 and 6 and traffic growth is forecast in Table 7. Principal
features of these analyses are summarized below.
Freight
2.       In 1970, railways carried 73% of freight (in ton-km) and they remain
the dominant mode although their share had declined to 64% by 1980, with a
corresponding increase in the percentage carried by road. The following table
shows the further reduction to about 57% forecast by 1985, assuming the
Danube-Black Sea Canal opens in 1983.

of growth shown as follows:

Total          10.5                5.5                 6.3
The forecast 3.8% for railways for 1980-85 is considered realistic as it
includes long-haul imports and exports growing at 7.9% p.a. and increased
internal movements of bulk commodities, particularly coal, in areas not served
by the improved river and canal facilities. The overall forecast growth rate
of 6.3% p.a. includes substantial canal traffic and is reasonable in view of
the overall growth rate of 6-7% p.a. forecast for the economy as a whole
(para. 4.01).
4.       In terms of tons, road transport is dominant but tonnages move over
relatively short distances. The total for all modes in 1980 was 2,103 million
tons'/ of which the railways hauled 275 million tons, or 13%, an average
chargeable distance of 237 km. Public road services hauled 451 million tons,
or 21%, an average of 26 km, of which construc- tion and building materials
(for which access to sites is in many cases restricted to road) comprised
about 270 million tons hatuled an aveprage of 19 km. The heaviest road tonnage,
1,335 million tons, or 62%, was hauled an average of only 12 km by industries'
own transport. Only 41 million tons, or 2% was carried by river and pipelines
over an average of 212 km. The impact of the canal both on tonnages and rates
of growth is shown in the following table.

ANNEX 1
The forecast 4.0% p.a. rate of tonnage increase for railways is considered
attainable. Of the 60 million extra tons, about 28 million tons or nearly
half will be imports and exports, and most of the remainder will be internal
bulk movements principally coal.

5.       Railways' former dominance passed to roads in the late 1960s, and the
current split of 27:73 is expected to decline further to 24:76 by 1985 as the
following table shows:
1960               1970               1980              1985

/a Including private buses and cars, estimated for 1980.
6.       The current average journeys of about 67 km by rail, 23 km by public
bus and 12 km by other road vehicles are not expected to change significantly
and the passenger-km rates of growth shown below, therefore, also correspond
broadly to the growth in numbers of passengers:
1960-1970          1970-1980           1980-1980
-------------annual percentage growth  M3--------------

Road               18.7                11.8                4.7
Total            10.2                 8.4                3.9
7.       Rail passenger traffic is predominantly domestic, international
traffic being less than 0.5% in terms of passengers and about 3% in
passenger-km. Suburban traffic is about 60% of domestic passenger-km. Thus,
the domestic growth rate of 1.6% p.a. (out of the average 1.4%) depends upon
increasing patronage of commuter services and of services linking the main
centers. Rapid and continuing urbanization (50% of 1980 population compared
with 34% in 1965) should make this growth rate attainable.

ANNEX 3
ROMANIA
APPRAISAL OF
A LAND TRANSPORT PROJECT
Highway Component of the Project
Paving of Two-Lane Gravel Roads
(a)  Schitu Golesti-Curtea de Arges (41 km)
1.       The present route, 36.5 km long, traverses broken terrain with
gradients of up to 14% and with many short radius curves. The road crosses
many areas of instability where recurrent slides have necessitated frequent
and costly reinstatement works. Romania's comprehensive rail network provides
no alternative access to the area, although both termini are connected to the
system. The substandard geometry, excessive gradients and poor surface con-
dition of the present alignment impose severe penalties on vehicle use, whilst
in winter many of the steeper sections remain impassable because of snow and
ice. There is considerable coal mining activity along the first 11-1/2 km
from Schitu Golesti with about half a dozen mines having access to the road.
An aerial cableway carries some of the production of the nearest mines to
Schitu Golesti, but the bulk of production is carried by road.
2.       The proposed alignment is some 4 km longer than the existing road.
The additional length permits gradients to be flattened to an absolute maximum
of 8% with most being less than 6%. Moreover, the worst areas of instability
have been avoided although some cannot without excessive realignment. In
these cases, adequate provision is made for retaining walls to be built to
depths below the slip circles.
3.       The construction of the pavement will be staged so that the forecast
traffic for ten years from opening the road can be accommodated, after which a
second stage of an additional asphalt carpet will be applied.
4.       The pavement for the first 11-1/2 km will be stronger than the
remainder in order to carry the heavy coal transporters.
5.       Present traffic is about 1,000 vehicles-day (about 40% trucks) and is
projected to grow at 10% over the first five years from opening, 6%-year for
the next five years, and 2%-year thereafter.



- 51 -
ANNEX 3
(b)  Adjud (Podul Turcului)-Birlad (29 km)
6.       The present track across rolling to hilly terrain provides the only,
but unreliable, means of access to the several villages it serves. A journey
by road between the termini Adjud and Birlad, both of which are on the railway
network, by other than this direct alignment, involves a 40 km detour to the
south.
7.       For the most part, the soil encountered on the route is a highly
friable loess, which after only a little rain becomes slick and, particularly
on gradients, impassable to all but four-wheel-drive vehicles. Local infor-
mation indicates that the track is impassable for about 150 days in the year.
The loess material has the added disadvantage of being highly erodable, and
there is ample evidence along the present track where surface run-off from
haphazard drainage has created gullies which are eating back into the hills.
There are no bridges on the present route, all streams being crossed at
unpaved fords.
8.       Podul Turcului is the center of a development area where substantial
investments being made in the food processing industry will depend for their
viability on good access to the crops and produce raised in the hinterland.
All weather access provided by the construction of the proposed two-lane paved
road, will promote the planned regional development.
9.       If the road were open now, about 500 vehicles-day would use it.
Traffic growth is estimated at 12%-year for the first five years from opening
(taking into account generated traffic) and 4%-year for the next 15 years.
(c)  Craiova-Balcesti (39.7 km)
10.      The improvement of this direct link between Craiova and Balcesti
would enable traffic between the two centers to enjoy a distance saving of
some 30 km. The present road is in such poor condition that travelers prefer
the longer journey on a good road rather than take this, the direct route.
Prior to its being declared a national road in 1978, the provincial adminis-
tration over the previous few years had carried out selected improvements on
six sections totalling about 13.2 km. Although present traffic levels are not
high, the pavements of all six sections are showing signs of distress indica-
ting that an asphalt overlay will be needed in the near future. The RD has
included this work in its program, but outside the context of this project.
The Municipality of Craiova is at present reconstructing the first 3 km which
fall within its boundaries, but the remaining 23.5 km in five separate
sections, which include the most adverse terrain on the whole road, would be
reconstructed under this project.



- 52 -
ANNEX 3
11.      Present traffic is about 800 vehicles-day (40% trucks) and is
expected to grow at 6%-year over the next ten years and 3%-year thereafter.

12.      The existing two-lane road from Brasov to the northeast is an
important corridor for transit traffic from Bucharest to the north of
Romania. In addition, it provides a conduit for considerable commuter traffic
between Brasov and Harman as well as catering for Harman's textile industry
and agricultural development, and the heavy industry of Brasov.
13.      The present road has been doubled to four lanes up to a point 4.15 km
east of Brasov.  The present project provides for doubling the next discrete
section from km 4.15 to km 10.15 where a major junction with National Road No.
10 occurs, and where much of the local traffic dissipates.
14.      The terrain is flat and the road is straight.  Construction of the
additional two lanes should be relatively straightforward. A deficiency of
the existing road, inadequate cross drainage, will berectified by the
construction of eight additional box culverts, and the existing pavement will
be strengthened.
15.      Present traffic is about 8,000 vehicles-day (60% heavy) and is
expected to grow at 6%-year for the next decade and 3%-year thereafter.
Stage 1 (Two lanes) of Eventual Four-lane Road:
Fetesti-Cernavoda (17 km)
16.      Romania's principal transport corridor is that between Bucharest and
the Black Sea port of Constanta. The Black Sea coast is also a prime tourism
area, and seasonally attracts holiday makers up to the capacity of its hotels
and camping grounds. Transport needs are presently served by a double-track
electrified railway, and by the main road (National Roads No. 2 and 2A) which
bears northeast from Bucharest to Urziceni, then follows the Ialomita river
eastward to a crossing of the Danube at Giurgeni and finally bears southeast
to Constanta. This road is essentially two-lane throughout with only rela-
tively short lengths being widened to four lanes. In parts, it is reaching
capacity.
17.      A more direct route, however, and one which would avoid the dog-leg
to the north, is that followed by the rail. Paralleling the railroad,



- 53 -
ANNEX 3
National Roads 3, then 3A bear due east from Bucharest via Lehlui to Fetesti
at the west bank of the Danube. Here the river is divided into two streams by
an island 17 km wide on the east/west axis. Although rail bridges span each
bifurcation of the stream, there are no road crossings or ferries. From the
east bank of the river, Cernavoda is linked directly to Constanta by National
Roads 22C and 3. Thus, there exists a 17 km gap between Fetesti and Cernavoda
in what would otherwise be a preferred route, reducing by some 60 km the
present 260 km Bucharest/Constanta journey by the northern road.
18.      Primarily to increase rail capacity, two major bridges are to be
built over the Danube at Fetesti and Cernavoda. The opportunity is being
taken therefore to provide road crossings by adding cantilevers to the two
bridges so that a two-lane road deck can be supported on each side.
19.      To ensure symmetrical loading of the bridges, it is necessary to
divide the traffic so that each side carries the flow in one direction. Thus
the approaches to each bridge will be four-lane construction to a total of 6
km, the intervening 11 km will be two-lane only, but with embankment and
structures built to full four-lane width in anticipation of its future
widening.
20.      The cost of the additional structural work to accommodate the road
pavements amounts to less than 5% of the total construction cost of these
bridges, and the railway component of this project provides for the
procurement of special steel for this purpose.
21.      However, the road between Bucharest and Fetesti does require some
minor pavement rehabilitation works and some local betterments to improve
substandard geometry on curves and to provide adequate shoulders throughout.
The DR is fully aware of the needs, but nevertheless, at loan negotiations,
the Government should agree to a timetable for this work which would ensure
its completion at or before the completion of this project element.
22.      The road between Cernavoda and Constanta is currently being improved
and work thereon should be finished by the end of 1981.
23.      The opening of this major link to Constanta should postpone for many
years the need for additional capacity on the northern route (National Roads 2
and 2A).
24.      If the road and bridges were open to traffic now the road would carry
about 9,000 vehicles-day, a substantial portion of which (about 5,000) would
be diverted from the present longer route to Constanta. Growth is estimated
at 5%-year for the next ten years, and 3%-year thereafter.

A LAND TRANSPORT PROJECT
Outline of Terms of Reference
for Traffic Optimization Study
A. Objectives
I.       The main objectives of the study are:
(i) to evaluate and improve as needed the computer programs used for
determining, on the basis of costs, linkages between suppliers and
consumers and the resulting traffic flows; and
(ii) to acquire a more in-depth knowledge of factors affecting the modal
split, and hence to establish an operational model for minimizing the
social costs of door-to-door transport.
2.       The study would cover railway, road, coastal shipping, river and
canal, pipelines and domestic air transportation. While it will focus on the
Romanian transport sector, its methodology should be adaptable for use in
other countries.
B. Scope of the Study
3.       The study shall establish an operational model for freight traffic
flows and their modal distribution, on the basis of several criteria, mainly
social expenses of transport including capital cost, the relationship between
tariffs and service-specific costs, energy consumptions (also on a
service-specific basis) and total transport time. The social expenses of
transport will take into account fully distributed costs of the entire trans-
portation process including the packaging of goods, the damage risk during
transportation, inventory and storage costs. For all main commodities, the
study should aim at maximizing the price to the producers net of distribution
costs. Furthermore, if local prices (costs) are significantly different from
border prices, the study should indicate the likely change in modal split by
adopting border prices.
4.       The operational model shall permit the use of one or several criteria
for the optimization and distribution of goods by different transport modes,
depending on their priority (manpower, energy, investments, inventories, etc.).



- 55 -
ANNEX 4
5.       The study shall take into account both conventional transportation
modes and their combinations (containers, piggy back, RO-RO, etc.). The
system shall provide the basis for effective, long-term planning of the
transport activity, related development of transport projects and conse-
quential investments on different transport modes based on discounted
cash-flow analyses.
6.       The focus of the study at the final stages shall be on such factors
as:
(i) development of algorithms for the determination of the optimum
freight transport flows, as well as intermodal economic distance
limits with particular application to Romania;
(ii) formulation of appropriate computer programs to ensure flexibility
and to allow adoption of alternative strategies by the user country;
(iii) the dependence of diverse categories of goods (as appropriate for the
user country) on different transport modes for specific distance
ranges (such as 50-100; 100-150; 150-200 and 200-250 km); and
(iv) establishmenL of a data base and programs for its administration.
C. Time Schedule
7.       The work shall commence within 30 calendar days of the effective date
of contract (tentatively fixed at October 1, 1981). The different stages of
work will be as follows:
(i) Stage I - Report  -  Determination of the system requirements
and of the detailed methodology for the
study.
Completion: December 31, 1981
(ii)  Stage II - Report -  Models and algorithms for the
determination of the optimum transport
flows and of the intermodal economic
distance limits.
Completion: July 31, 1982
(iii) Stage III - Report - Model for adapting the system to the
specific character of the user country.
Completion: December 31, 1982



- 56 -
ANNEX 4
(iv) Stage IV - Report - Computer programs.
Completion: June 30, 1983
(v)  Stage V  - Tests, experiments, identification of market segments
with various levels of dependence on transport modes,
determination of economic distance limits based on
the methodology developed in Stage I and establish-
ment of the data base.
Completion: November 30, 1983
8.       The consultants will submit reports, in English, for each of the
intermediary stages, to the Government and to the Bank, which, within 30 days
of receipt of the reports, will comment and make suggestions for improvement
of the study.
9.       On completion of the study, the consultants will submit the draft
final report(s), in English, to the Government and to the Bank for review and
comments and shall finalize the report(s) within 45 days of receipt of
comments.

ANNEX 7
ROMANIA
APPRAISAL OF
A LAND TRANSPORT PROJECT
Main Accounting Assumptions (Railway Component)
General
1.       The actual and forecast Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements and
Balance Sheets included in this report are based on those prepared by CFR,
adjusted to correspond more closely to the Bank's usual formats and to include
a railway component of US$64 million out of the present proposed Bank loan of
US$95 million.
Exchange Rates
2.       A foreign exchange rate of 18 Lei to US$1 has been used up to
December 31, 1980 and 15 Lei to US$1 thereafter.
Income Account (Table 36)
3.       Income Accounts are analyzed in detail for the basic railway
activities but, for the auxiliary activities which account for less than 5% of
total activities, only the total revenue, expenditure and net benefit are
shown. Certain centralized activities such as the RCC which executes works
not only for railways but also for primary roads, airports and Danube ports,
produce separate accounts which are not incorporated with those of CFR.
Revenue
4.       Revenue estimates are based on traffic forecasts established for the
Five-Year Plan (1981-85), by the SPC evaluated at current tariffs. Rail
passenger traffic is forecast to grow at about 1-1/2% p.a. and freight traffic
at about 4% p.a. No change in passenger fares (last increased in 1977) is
expected during the plan period but freight rates (last increased in 1974)
have been increased by 5.7% from January 1, 1981 (For causative cost
increases, particularly in fuel prices, see para. 6, below).
Working Expenses
5.       Working expenses have to conform strictly to State planning targets
and limitations. No increase in wage rates is incorporated, except for



- 62 -
ANNEX 7
the full-year effect of the second tranche of the previous five-year plan
increase, effective from December 1, 1980. Wage cost increases are therefore
limited to 1% corresponding to the permitted increases in staff. Any further
increases in wage rates authorized during the plan period would be incorpor-
ated in annual plan revisions. Taxes on wages and salaries are assumed to
continue at 16.5% of wages and salaries and social security contributions at
15% of wages and taxes combined.
6.       Fuel and electricity costs are forecast to reduce slightly at current
rates, increased traffic and train-km being offset by increased electric
haulage and elimination of steam traction. Increases of about 30% in both
fuel and electricity rates in 1981 are included in the forecasts.
7.       After an increase of about 10% assumed for prices of other materials
in 1981 these and other expenses controlled by Regions are forecast to remain
constant, as achieved in the previous five years. These limitations, coupled
with the strict control of personnel expenses, demand further improvements in
already high productivity for both operations and routine maintenance.
8.       Maintenance other than routine is strictly controlled through the
railway Headquarters' budget. All regionally-collected revenue is channelled
to Headquarters which assures priority for funds for centralized expenditures
before allocating funds for regionally-controlled expenditures. The two
principal items of centralized expenditure (both assumed to be subject to 5%
materials price increases in 1981) are periodic repairs of traction and rol-
ling stock, which are planned to increase in volume by approximately 1-1/2%
p.a. during the plan period, and capital overhaul of track, planned to
increase by approximately 1% p.a. Capital overhaul of track, normally
capitalized in other countries, is charged in Romania to operations and has
consequently been excluded when calculating working and operating ratios and
rates of return on net fixed assets in use.
Depreciation
9.       Asset lives, for depreciation purposes, are published in the Official
Gazette for all sectors of the economy and those for railway assets were last
revised in 1977. For mobile assets they range from 8-40 years, most loco-
motive and wagon types being 35 or 40 years. Immovable asset lives are
generally longer and the average for all assets is about 50 years. No changes
in asset lives are forecast for 1981-85.
Interest Charges
10.      In the Romanian system interest on long-term borrowings is charged to
construction funds but has been transferred to the Income Accounts in the Bank
presentation. Interest on short-term borrowings is included in "other



- 63 -
ANNEX 7
expenses". Interest on the railway component of the proposed Bank loan has
been included at 9.25% and on repayable State credits at 2%. Repayable
allocations are interest free.
Cash Flow Statements (Tables 16 and 38)
11.      Cash Flow Statements prepared by CFR have been adapted to the Bank's
normal format. Under the Romanian system the amounts are kept in three main,
self-balancing sections for fixed assets in use, fixed assets in course of
construction (work in progress) and operations (which has a further sub-
division to show the utilization of net income or "benefit"). Movements
between sections are not recorded by direct bookkeeping transfer but through
parallel entries in each of the sections concerned, e.g., in the case of
transfer from operations to fixed assets in course of construction (of
depreciation, "benefit" reinvested, etc.) bank transfer payments record the
movement of funds generated by operations (which are held on deposit with the
National Bank) to funds required for investments (which are kept on deposit
with the IB.
12.      The total benefits (basic and auxiliary activities) and their al-
location as forecast by CFR are detailed in Table 22.2 (in the Project File)
and summarized in Tables 16 and 38. Depreciation of basic activity assets and
other assets is similarly detailed in Table 22.1 (in the Project File) and
summarized in Tables 16 and 38.
13.      External resources include State Allocations/Credits as forecast by
CFR and adjusted for changes in the amount of the railway component (at
present US$64 million) of the proposed Bank loan and by revision of CFR debt
service schedules made by the mission. The Bank loan is assumed to be
repayable in 25 semi-annual installments commencing in July 1984.
14.      The division of State support between "Allocations" repayable without
interest and "Credits" repayable with interest was established by CFR after
analyzing the investment plan into "important investments" chiefly attracting
State Allocations and "other investments" attracting only the State Credits.
Subsequent changes resulting from adjustments of plan totals and amounts of
the Bank loan have been made only in the total of State Allocations and the
original assessment of 967 million lei (US$65 million) for State Credits has
been retained. State Credits are repayable over 15 years. State Allocations
are repayable from depreciation and benefit but in the case of CFR these
repayments are less than the gross allocations required for investment so
that, at least for the plan period there are net annual additions to the
figure of allocations repayable.
15.      No foreign loans are expected other than the proposed Bank loan.
Some items of equipment and materials are expected to continue to be



- 64 -
ANNEX 7
obtained under the barter arrangements which Romania has with its COMECON
partners but sufficient information is not available to show such sources
separately in the financing plan.
Balance Sheets (Table 39)
16.      CFR presented a two-part Balance Sheet which has been adapted to a
single presentation in the Bank's normal format. CFR's first part comprises
the sections for fixed assets in use and for operations; the second part
consists only of fixed assets in course of construction (see also para. 11).
17.      Fixed assets in use are shown by CFR as being fully financed from
"own funds". Prior to 1979 State Allocations were not repayable and no
distinction was made between "own funds" generated by railways operations and
"own funds" derived from non-repayable State Allocations. For 1979 State
Allocations, although now repayable are still shown in CFR's Balance Sheet as
"own funds" but in the Bank presentation a distinction is made between
non-repayable and repayable allocations so that for 1979 and subsequent years
something approaching a debt/equity ratio becomes increasingly meaningful. A
reconciliation between capital expenditures and additions to fixed assets in
the Balance Sheets and a similar reconciliation for depreciation are available
in the Project File (Tables 23.1 and 22.1).
18.      In certain circumstances fixed assets may temporarily be recorded
twice in the Balance Sheet, e.g., where assets are taken into use before final
approval of the construction or before applicable outstanding loans are repaid
(repayments of principal, like, interest payments (see para. 10) are charged
to construction funds. Such duplications are not at present significant and
fixed assets in progress during the 1981-85 plan period are not expected to
exceed 5% of the gross fixed assets in use.
19.      Capital assets in course of construction (work in progress) for which
CFR produces a separate self-balancing section of the Balance Sheet are
financed partly by loans and credits and partly by short-term interim finance
pending longer-term arrangements through State Allocations and usage of "own
funds". In the Bank presentation work in progress is shown as financed, to
the extent identified by CFR, by long-term debt and, for the remainder, by
interim finance.
20.      Working capital is included on the basis of CFR's estimates and
allows for an increase of about 3% p.a. for inventories and 2% p.a. overall.

/1  Traffic Units (TUs) are the sum of net metric ton-kms (nmtkm) and passenger-kms (pkm).
Nmtkm chargeable are based on the tariff (shortest) distance between origin and
destination. Nmtkm operational may be greater because some traffic is routed circuitously
to avoid saturated lines or to utilize better facilities, e.g., electrified and/or
double-tracked lines.

1|  Project cost as quoted in Nota de Comanda, and based on Romanian prices, includes 5% physical
contingency, but no allowance for price escalation is permissible.
2/  Allows for depreciation based on international prices of foreign equipment used, and international
prices of fuels and bitumen, of which Romania is a net importer. Locally-produced tradeables have
not been border priced here. Five percent physical contingency included in Investment Plan column
has been netted out.
3/ Local components for highways consist essentially of labor and materials such as crushed stone which
are not traded internationally. Their price was taken as equal to the local component of costs
based on Romanian catalog prices.
4/ Based on a three-year construction period 1982 through 1984, local costs escalating at 2% per year
would increase by 5%. Foreign costs are assumed to increase by 9Z in 1981; 8.5% in 1982; and 7.5%
in 1983 and thereafter. Thus over the three-year period from 1982-1984, foreign costs would
increase by 20.8Z. Estimates are based on May, 1981 prices.

/1  Revisions of the Five-Year Plan forecasts, resulting from 1981 price changes, could not be given in detail by CFR until after June 198t when their
inpact could be better assessed. The Plan forecasts shown are therefore based on those originally prepared by CFR, adjusted as follows:
(a) passenger income is increased snd freight income reduced by 200 million lei (UWSW3 million) each -fear to reflect 1980 results.   The reduced *nnual
freight revenues are then enhanced by the 5.72 freight rate increase effective January 1, 1981.
(b) expenditure each year is increased in total to metch the extra revenues frm the freight rate increase and expenditure for esch subhead is
calculated as follows.
(i)   fuel and electricity. original forecasts for each year adjusted by ratio of 1980 actual to 1980 forecast and then enhanced hy 302 price
increases effective January 1981.
(ii)  other materials; as in (i) but price increase of 10%.
(iii) other expenses: as in (i) but no price increase.
(iv)  periodic repairs and capital overhaul as in (i) but price increase of 52.
(v)   depreciation. original forecasts retained as investmnt costs are substantially unchanged.
(vi)  personnel costs  increased by residue of total expenditure incresse after amounts applied to (i)-(iv).
Personnel costs thus increased appear to meet only about half of the second tranche (152 effective December 1, Iq0) of the uaoe increases authorized
under the 1976-80 Plan, the balance being sought frov further improved productivity and other economies.  Further price chbnges which nav c asothoriced
during-the 1981-85 Plan would have to be similarly a*comodsted.
/2  Taxes are 16.5X of wages and salaries; Social Security contributions are 152 of combined wages and taxes.
/3  Estiated figures.
/4  Capital overhaul of track, normally capitali.ed, is in Roenia charged to Operations.
/5  Asset lives were increased in 1977.
