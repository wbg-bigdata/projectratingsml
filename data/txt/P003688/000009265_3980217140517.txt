IMPLEMhENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN No 3074-FIJ)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third
Telecommunications Project in The Republic of Fiji, for which IBRD Loan 3074-FIJ
in the amount of US$ 8.1 million was approved on May 25, 1989 and made effective
onJanuary5, 1990.
The loan had an extension of one year with a closing date of December 31,
1996. Final disbursement took place on March 13, 1997 at which time a balance of
US$ 542,468.10 was canceled. Cofinancing for the Project was provided through the
Australian Commodities Support Program (ACS) and the European Investment Bank
(EB).
The ICR was prepared by R. Peter Wright of the Telecommunications and
Informatics Division (IENTI) and reviewed by Emmanuel Forestier, Portfolio
Manager, Telecommunications and Informatics Division (IENTI); Jamil Sopher,
Principal Financial Advisor, Finance & PSD Sector Unit (EASFP) and Elizabeth
Brouwer, Senior Country Officer (EACNI).
Preparation of this ICR is based on material in the project file. The draft
report was reviewed with the imnplementing agency, which contributed comment, as
well as financial and performance data. The draft report was provided to the Borrower,
and despite repeated requests for a contribution to the report, no response was received.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN No. 3074-FIJ
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.          The implementation of the Third Telecommunications Project in the
Republic of Fiji, which was supported by IBRD Loan 3074-FIJ in the amount of US$
8.1 million, was under the supervision of the Government's Ministry of Finance (MOF).
Provision was made to on-lend through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement US$ 7.6 million
to the Fiji Post and Telecommunications Limited (FPTL). The Loan Agreement was
signed on September 25, 1989, became effective January 5, 1990, and the Closing Date
for the Loan was December 31, 1996.
2.    During a mutltisector mission in July 1986 the Government requested Bank
assistance in the telecommunications sector. A Bank review mission identified the need
for (a) improvements in the policy and regulatory framework, (b) changes in
institutional arrangements, (c) an institutional development plan and (d) additional
preparatory work to ensure the soundness of P&T's investment programn. The Bank
approved a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$ 450,000 in 1988 to provide
assistance to the Government and P&T to help draft a sector policy and necessary
legislation, and to plan in detail the restructuring of P&T into a limited company.
Project Objectives and Description
3.   The stated objectives of the project were to: (a) assist the Government to establish an
appropriate policy and regulatory framework in order to improve the operating environment
of the sector; (b) help to restructure along commercial lines to enhance customer focus and
increase revenue generation and operational efficiency; (c) strengthen P&T through a
program of institutional development; and (d) help to finance the expansion and
modernization of telecommunications facilities to increase the range of services available to
business subscribers and to improve the quality of service, and thus help stimulate growth and
investment.
4.   The project was estimated to cost US$ 47.9 million (F$ 68.5 million), with a foreign
cost of US$ 30.0 million; including IBRD financing of US$ 8.1 million for local distribution
copper cables, with co-financing of US$ 7.4 million by Australian Commodities Assistance
Support Program for digital switches, and US$ 6.4 million from the European Investment
Bank for digital microwave transmission and multiplex equipment, fiber optic cables, and



ii
HF/VHF radio and rural radio stations. FPTL was to finance the rest of the physical plant at a
cost of US$ 26.0 million.
Sector Reform
5.   The Fiji Telecommunications and Postal Act, provides for authority and control of
telecommunications and postal operations by the Ministry of Communications,
Transportation and Works. Telecommunications services in Fiji are provided by two entities,
originally the Post and Telecommunications Department (P&T), a department of the Ministry
of Communications, Transportation and Works which provided domestic telecommunications
services, and FINTEL, a private corporation 51 percent government-owned (49% owned by
Cable and Wireless Company of the UK), which provides international telecommunications
services. P&T was also responsible for postal services and sector regulation. As a
prerequisite for the project, the Posts & Telecommunications Decree, enacted in November
1989, led to the creation of FPTL, a wholly government-owned corporation and the creation
of a separate regulatory unit, effective January 1, 1990. On July 1, 1996, a separation of
post and telecommunications occurred, creating Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL).
6.   In October 1993, the Government adopted a comprehensive public enterprise reform
program directed to increase the efficiency of Government commercial enterprises. In 1995,
the Government's Public Enterprise. Unit (PEU) initiated action to evaluate the option of
privatization of the telecommunications sector. The PEU engaged a consultant, financed by
the Loan, to (a) study the present telecommunications law and telecommunications operations
of TFL and FINTEL; (b) provide recommendations for the regulation of the sector; and (c)
provide recommendations on how to sell a minority share of TFL. The consultant report was
submitted in June 1996, the Cabinet accepted the recommendations, and has instructed the
PEU to engage consultants to assist the Government to undertake restructuring of the industry
and to act as advisors for the privatization of the restructured TFL in the future. The Bank
supported assistance to Fiji through a New Zealand Aid Fund.
Project Achievements and Results
7.   Institutional Objectives. Within the framework of this project, institutional
objectives for FPTL included: a managerial development program; and a "twinning"
arrangement with a developed communications company to enhance FPTL's managerial
and technical capabilities. Training of 12 middle and senior managers-for 60 person-
months was completed. The twinning arrangement with Singapore Telecom
International was structured in two phases: the first to prepare a report on
recommendations to change FPTL operations to a commercial enterprise, which were
instituted successfully, and the second for "on-the-job training" of FPTL personnel, for
which an assignment for Materials Management was completed. In 1991, the Loan
Agreement was modified to enable the Government to use unallocated funds to provide
technical assistance, training and equipment to the newly created Regulatory Unit.
Unfortunately, regulatory staffing was delayed and training subsequently postponed in
light of the public enterprise reform activity (see paragraph 6).



iii
8.    Staffproductivity. The target staff ratio for 1994 of 26.1 staffY1,000 working
lines was not achieved (actual 31 staff/1,000 working lines). Subsequently, staff levels
have declined significantly (see table 5), to better project target figures by 1996.
9.    Operational targets for telecommunications activities. FPTL's physical target
at the time of project preparation was to increase the switching capacity from 51,198
lines in 1987 to 69,000 lines by 1994 (an increase of 18,000 lines) and increase the
working lines from 34,001 in 1987 to 56,700 (an increase of 22,700 services). The
actual achievement was slightly greater, and FPTL also replaced 35,460 analog switch
lines in this period. Rural public call office (PCO) development was targeted to grow to
249 by 1994, and achieved 264 by 1995 (see Table 5).
10.  Implementation schedule. Procurement of digital exchanges and outside plant
cables was to occur over the period 1989 through 1993, with installation ready-for-
service progressively from 1991 to 1995. Actual procurement of switching equipment
and availability for service was on schedule. Local distribution cables were procured in
1989, 1992, 1994 and 1995. 27,300 cable pairs were placed in the 1990-1995 period
(an increase of 12,300 over the project target). Digital microwave transmission systems
were placed on schedule. A 150 station trunked radio system (TRS) was installed on
the main island of Viti Levu to replace the rural radio telephone system.
11.   Objectives of service quality. The quality of service improved during project
implementation. Faults/working line/year increased marginally, however average lines
faulty declined and speed of fault clearance improved significantly. The call completion
rate improved to standards enjoyed in more developed countries.
12.   Cost ofFinancing The actual cost of the project from 1990-1996 is US$ 104.86
million (F$ 150 million), with US$ 7.56 million (93% of the approved loan) disbursed
by IBRD, US$ 1.26 million for institutional development and US$ 6.3 million to meet
physical objectives. Co-financing expenditures of US$ 16.2 million were incurred.
Implementation Experience and Results
13.   Government performance at the preparation stage is rated highly satisfactory, but
it deteriorated during project implementation. Adequate support for the creation of an
effective telecommunications regulatory unit was lacking, and development of an
appropriate tariff policy never occurred.
14.   FPTL suffered from a high turnover of senior management during the period
1991 to 1994 contributing to difficulties in meeting financial covenants. It has since
recovered from most of its financial problems and developed a managerial team.
15.   Bank perfortnance in the preparation and approval phase is also rated highly
satisfactory. Bank supervision experienced a high turnover of task managers (four from
project preparation to closure), resulting in a lack of consistent support to FPTL through
a period of tumultuous change from a public to private sector organizational climate.



iv
Although most physical objectives were achieved, the Bank's role in developing an
effective regulatory agency proved inadequate, as little was achieved. Overall then, the
Bank's supervision of the project is considered as less than satisfactory.
Project Benefits and Sustainability
16.   The benefits of the project are related to the improvement of services provided to
subscribers and the impact on the economic activity of the islands. Specifically, they
are: (a) an increase in the quality and coverage of telecommunications services; (b) the
introduction of new telecommunications services that impact the business and rural
communities; (c) the creation of a commercial telecommunications operation with
improving profitability; and (d) implementation of institutional development activities
in operating company leading to more commercial operations and customer orientation.
The Project is considered satisfactory in achieving its development objectives.
17.   The organizational split between post and telecommunications activities,
although not an objective of the project, will provide the basis for further
commercialization and privatization of TFL. The Government, through the PEU, is
moving towards competition in the sector and the privatization of TFL. The significant
investment in physical plant over the past five years has positioned TFL well for
continued expansion and development of services. Issues related to regulation and tariff
reform remain and need to be addressed to affect the changes desired. In respect of the
positive climate that exists for continuing reform of the sector, both within the
Government and TFL, project sustainability is highly likely.
18.   FPTL achieved the overall objective of the project in line with Government
policy, even though the Company and the Government have gone through a great
cultural, political and economic change.
Key Findings and Lessons Learned
19.   The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a)   Implementation and the achievement of development objectives are crucially
dependent on continuity of staff on the Bank's side, as well as the frequency of
Bank supervision visits and consultations and the adequacy of the composition of
its mission teams. This is vital when the implementing agency is going through a
transition from public to private sector orientation to customer service, evolving
from public sector personnel policies to a commercial operation, and is being
prepared for competition and privatization.
(b)   The Bank has a responsibility to educate the Borrower and the implementation
agency on the requirements of the legal covenants and the implication of non-
compliance and must play a continuing role in assisting the Borrower in resolving
problems in meeting such covenants in a timely fashion.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN No. 3074-FIJ
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
The implementation of the Third Telecommunications Project in the Republic of Fiji,
which was supported by IBRD Loan 3074-FIJ in the amount of US$ 8.1 million, was under the
supervision of the Government's Ministry of Finance (MOF). Provision was made to on-lend
through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement US$ 7.6 million to the Fiji Post and Telecommunications
Limited (FPTL). The Loan Agreement was signed on September 25, 1989, became effective
January 5, 1990, and the Closing Date for the Loan was December 31, 1996.
A. Background
1.   In accordance with provisions of the Fiji Telecommunications and Postal Act, authority
and control of telecommunications and postal operations is vested in the Ministry of
Communications, Transportation and Works. Telecommunications services in Fiji are provided
by two entities, originally the Post and Telecommunications Department (P&T), a department of
the Ministry of Communications, Transportation and Works which provided domestic
telecommunications services, and FINTEL, a private corporation 51 percent gcvernrnent-owned
(49% owned by Cable and Wireless Company of the UK), which provides international
telecommunications services. P&T was responsible as well for postal services and sector
regulation.
2.    Two previous telecommunications projects, IBRD Loan 833-FIJ (1972-1976) and Loan
1140-FIJ (1975-1981) with a total value of US$ 7.2 million, were made available to P&T for the
construction of telecommunications infrastructure, and institutional development. Project
Completion Reports (PCR) and Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) considered that both
projects had successfully achieved their objectives of (a) helping to expand basic service in urban
areas and provide service to remote outer islands; (b) strengthen P&T project implementation
facility and improve training of technical staff; and (c) increase P&T's financial autonomy by
separating its accounts from the Government's and establishing a commercial accounting system.
During project implementation, the Bank helped P&T to obtain much-needed tariff increases.
3.    During a mutltisector mission in July 1986 the Government requested Bank assistance in
the telecommunications sector. A Bank review mission in November 1986 identified the need
for (a) improvements in the policy and regulatory framework, (b) changes in institutional
arrangements, (c) an institutional development plan and (d) additional preparatory work to ensure
the soundness of P&T's investment program. At Government request, the Bank prepared an
options paper "Restructuring of the Telecommunications Sector, Options for Fiji", which
addressed the issues of telecommunications policy, restructuring options, a regulatory regime,



2
international services, separation of posts and telecommunications, and future P&T organization.
The paper was instrumental in assisting an Interministerial Committee' in March 1987 in a
review of the status of P&T to identify the key issues involved in sector restructuring and the
pros/cons of alternative options. The Govermnent planned to take a decision on the restructuring
of P&T in May 1987 following national elections, however this was delayed by govermmental
coups in May and September 1987. In January 1988, the Government decided upon restructuring
P&T as a private company, 100% state-owned.
4.    In preparation for the Third Telecommunications Project, P&T agreed to initiate
consultant studies on (a) demand review, development of the network and review of the
investment program, (b) tariff review and (c) assessment of computerization requirements for
P&T. The first study was financed by UNDP/ITU and the latter two studies by P&T. The three
studies were completed in late 1987 and made available to the Bank. A condition established by
the Bank for Board presentation of the Third Telecommunications Project loan was Government
approval of necessary changes to the Telecommunications Act to create a post and
telecommunications corporation, and an agreed action plan of key activities for restructuring of
P&T. At the request of the Government, the Bank approved a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
of US$ 450,000 in June 1988 to provide assistance to the Government and P&T to help draft a
sector policy and necessary legislation, and to plan in detail the restructuring of P&T into a
limited company. "Policy consultants" were appointed in July 1988, and "restructuring
consultants" in January 1989.
5.    During the 1988 appraisal for the Third Telecommunications Project, it was found that
the telecommunications sector in Fiji was average for Pacific Island Countries, but well abo-ve
average for developing countries, with 34,000 direct exchange lines (DEL) in service at the end
of 1987, for a telephone density of 4.7 lines per 100 population. The long distance network was
composed of analog microwave facilities that linked main exchanges in the two large islands of
Viti Levu and Vanua Levu and some minor islands. There were few dedicated networks, mainly
for the use of the electricity authority and the army. International direct dialing (IDD) was
introduced only in November 1987. Existing telex capacity exceeded demand and was expected
to decline as telex service was replaced by facsimile and data transmission. An estimated 70% of
telecommunications revenues was derived from government, parastatal and business subscribers.
Rural areas were poorly served with only 3,000 exchange lines for a population of 450,000 (0.7
lines per 100 population). Service was by small manual exchanges and very high frequency
(VHF) radio telephone public call offices (PCO), with limited operating hours.
B. Project Objectives
6.    The Project was developed in line with Governmental goals and objectives to increase
access to modern and efficient telecommunications services in urban and rural areas and to
increase the commercial efficiency of entities in the telecommunications sector. The Project
aimed to improve the availability of and access to modern telecommunications services in Fiji
Members included the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Planning, the Public
Service Commission, and the Posts & telecommunications Department in the Ministry of Communications, Transport and
Works.



3
by: (a) assisting the Government to establish an appropriate policy and regulatory framework in
order to improve the operating environment of the sector; (b) helping to restructure along
commercial lines to enhance customer focus and increase revenue generation and operational
efficiency; (c) strengthen P&T through a program of institutional development; and (d) helping
to finance the expansion and modernization of telecommunications facilities to increase the range
of services available to business subscribers and to improve the quality of service, and thus help
stimulate growth and investment.
7.    The IBRD component of the Project in support of P&T's 1990-1994 Investment Program
was structured to finance cables and other materials to increase the local distribution network by
15,000 DELs, or approximately 80,000 km-pair of cables. IBRD financing for this component
was appraised at US$ 7.0 million, including contingencies. Grant funds provided through
Australia's Commodities Assistance Support (CAS) Program would finance purchase of digital
switching equipment (13,312 lines for expansion and 2,400 lines for replacement at a cost of
US$ 7.4 million equivalent). A European Investment Bank (EIB) loan (US$ 6.4 million
equivalent) would finance digital microwave transmission and multiplex equipment for 10
sections ("hops"), junction fiber optic cables, HFNVHF radio for 4 hops and 60 rural radio
telephone stations as required for the 1989-1992 investment period. P&T would finance
transmission equipment required for the 1993-1994 investment period, as well as subscriber
premises equipment, data equipment, new buildings, vehicles, tools and computer equipment
(US$ 26.0 million equivalent).
C. Achievement of Project Objectives.
Sector Reform
8.    Enacting the Posts & Telecommunications Decree 1989 led to the creation of FPTL and
the separation of regulatory and operational functions, effective January 1, 1990. FPTL was a
wholly government-owned corporation responsible for postal services and all domestic
telecommunications services in Fiji. FPTL and FINTEL were issued exclusive 25 year licenses
to operate domestic and international telecommunications services respectively. In 1994,
Vodofone Fiji Limited (51% FPTL and 49% Racal-Vodofone UK Limited owned) was granted a
license for operation of cellular wireless service throughout Fiji. Separation of post and
telecommunications functions of FPTL required asset evaluation, which was completed in
December 1995. Effective July 1, 1996, Post Fiji Limited (PFL) and Telecom Fiji Limited
(TFL) were created as separate government-owned corporations.
9.    Regulation The regulatory regime was established in March 1990. The Director
Telecom, Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and Telecommunications is also Director of the
Telecommunications Regulatory Unit. The responsibilities of the unit encompasses licensing
operators and frequency allocation, customer provided equipment (CPE) type approval,
registration of approved contractors, enforcement and administration functions related to quality
of service, network interconnection, rural service and tariff approval. Early in 1993, the
Government proposed establishing a separate statutory regulatory body for telecommunications
and sought Bank assistance with defining the roles, organization and staffing of this organization,



4
together with the necessary legal advice and assistance in drafting legislation for this body.
Although the Bank indicated its support for this initiative, regulatory restructuring was postponed
by the Government later in 1993 pending development of a broader initiative of public enterprise
reform (see paragraph 10) that was thought might lead to a need for regulation of additional
sectors2.
10.    Privatization  In October 1993, the Government adopted a comprehensive public
enterprise reformn program directed to increase the efficiency of Government commercial
enterprises. A Privatization Committee was established to oversee the Public Enterprise Reform
Program and a Public Enterprise Unit (PEU) was established to develop and implement the
program. The PEU initiated action in 1995 to evaluate the option of privatization of the
telecommunications sector. With support from the Bank, the PEU engaged a consultant,
financed by the Loan3, to (a) study the present telecommunications law and telecommunications
operations of TFL and FINTEL; (b) provide recommendations for the regulation of the sector;
and (c) provide recommendations on how to sell a minority share of TFL. The consultant report
was submitted in June 1996, the Cabinet accepted and agreed with the consultant
recommendations in August 1996, and instructed (Decision-CP(96)177) the PEU to engage
consultants to assist the Government to undertake restructuring of the industry and to act as
advisors to the Government for the privatization of the restructured TFL. PEU sought further
financial assistance from the Bank4 to permit engaging legal consultants to introduce required
legislative changes and introduce competitive licenses in 1998, and financial consultants to
subsequently handle the partial privatization of TFL. In the spring of 1997, the Bank attempted
to obtain an IDF Grant to support this effort, but was unsuccessful. Subsequently, assistance to
Fiji through a New Zealand Aid Fund was initiated and supported by the Bank.
Institutional Development
11.    Regulatory institutional objectives. In 1991, the Loan Agreement was modified to enable
the Government to use US$ 250,000 of the unallocated funds to provide technical assistance,
training and equipment to the newly created Regulatory Unit. The Government engaged
consultants who specified three additional stafflskill requirements, regulatory training, and test
equipment and vehicle requirements. By mid 1992, additional personnel were not in place5 and
training proposed for the fall was canceled by the Government. Despite encouragement from the
2 At this time, the Government anticipated the need to regulate the power and water sectors if privatization was introduced. The
Government wished therefore to consider the options of a less restrictive regulation model as introduced in New Zealand
for telecommunications and/or the creation of a single regulatory agency to oversee all three sectors.
3 December 1995 the Govermment requested the Bank to extend the Closing Date of the Loan by one year to December 31,
1996 to permit funding of the consultant study, as well as to permit FPTL to complete procurement of the fourth tender for
outside plant copper cables.
4 The PEU wished to utilize the uncommitted balance of the Loan to finance further consultant activity. TFL also sought to
utilize the funds for procurement of additional cables. The Government however did not request a second extension to the
Closing Date for the Loan, so neither activity was funded through the Loan in 1997.
5 Approval of Telecommunications Regulatory Unit staffing was delayed by lack of MOF approval of additional personnel
slots and Public Service Commission approval of the required positions.

Bank in its missions in 1993-1994 to undertake the required training, it was only in October 1995
that the Director of the Telecommunications Regulatory Unit requested funding for an ITU
consultancy on establishment of a fully operational telecommunications regulator, and
subsequently in 1996/1997 overseas training for of 12 months regulatory staff. As the PEU
study (see paragraph 10) was to be initiated, the Bank suggested that a fiurther consultant study
would cloud the issue of regulation independent from the broader issue, and proposed that
training be delayed until the PEU study was complete in 1996 and Government action resolved
relative to regulation. As the Government did not request a further extension to the Loan Closing
Date in 1997, the issue of regulatory training did not get resolved.
12.    FPTL reorganization. FPTL underwent significant restructuring in 1993. Subsequent to
a massive operating cost increase (27%) in 1991, due in part to a rapid increase in labor costs6,
the Board of Directors of FPTL hired Arthur Anderson Consulting in 1992 to prepare a strategic
business plan for the company. A restructuring recommendation of the study7 led to the
establishment in FPTL of five strategic business units: Post, Telecom Customer Services and
Marketing, Telecom Network, Finance & Accounts, and Support Services. In December 1994, a
sixth business unit was introduced - New Business, responsible for introduction of new services.
13.    FPTL management. The unusual turnover of senior management and the Board of
Directors over four years 1991 to 19948 contributed to difficulties experienced in meeting
fmancial objectives. Bank interventions, Governmental support and leadership from the
remaining experienced General Managers during this period enabled FPTL to maintain service
quality, construct a modem network, and expand the customer base such that a fast fiscaF
recovery in 1995-1996 under a new Managing Director was possible (see Table 5).
14.    FPTL institutional objectives. Institutional objectives for FPTL included: a managerial
development program; and a "twinning" arrangement with a developed communications
company9 to enhance FPTL's managerial and technical capabilities. This component of the loan
amounted to US$ 600,000. Training of 12 middle and senior managers for 60 person-months
was completed. The twinning arrangement with Singapore Telecom International (STI) was
6 August 1991 wage increase of 15/o, along with a proposed 8% cost-of-living adjustment and a 7% increase through a Hayes
job evaluation exercise contributed to increased labor costs in 1991.
7 The study recommended to reduce staff; recruit outside commercial experts; establish cellular radio service as quickly as
possible to cater for remote rural and mobile customers; reorient the investment program towards high return areas with an
emphasis on completing the "last mile" (local distribution plant) in connecting customers; and transform FPTL into semi-
independent profit and cost centers.
8 The original Managing Director (MD) of FPTL was removed from office in April 1992 by a new Board of Directors as a
result of declining financial performance, but the MD was reinstated in 1992 by a newly elected Government, as a result of
an employee strike and network sabotage. The Chairman of the Board was dismissed, the Board then resigned, resulting
in a new Board being appointed. The new Board Chairman acted as CEO of FPTL until a Chief General Manger (CGM)
was engaged in January 1993 to direct the commercialization and restructuring effort. The Chief Financial Officer was
removed in April 1993 and replaced with a less experienced local appointee. Conflict between the CGM and the
Managing Director over restructuring and financial initiatives led to the CGM being removed in mid 1994. The Managing
Director met an untimely death in September 1994. A new Managing Director, a former senior civil servant, was
appointed in February 1995.
9 A condition of Loan Effectiveness was that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank shall have been made with a twinning
organization.

structured in two phases: the first was a report'0 on recommendations to change FPTL operations
to a commercial enterprise, which were instituted successfully; and the second was for "on-the-
job training" in Singapore of FPTL personnel, for which an assignment for Materials
Management was completed. The twinning arrangement was terminated in 1994. This effort
has proven successful in that learned managerial skills were applied in the 1994 through 1996
organizational restructuring programs, with all trained personnel being retained on staff.
FPTL 's operations
15.   Staffproductivity. The target staff ratio for 1994 of 26.1 staff/1,000 working lines was not
achieved (actual 31 staff/1,000 working lines). As a result of a hiring freeze on regular staff,
FPTL increased the number of "casual" employees to meet its program of installing increased
customer services, improving service quality and an increased construction program. The
telecommunications staff component for 1992 and subsequent years includes salaried staff, wage
earners and casuals, resulting in a peak staff of 2176 in 1993. Staff levels have subsequently
declined significantly (see table 5), to achieve project target figures by 1996.
16.   Operational targets. FPTL's physical target at the time of project preparation was to
increase the switching capacity from 51,198 lines in 1987 to 69,000 lines by 1994 (an increase of
18,000 lines) and increase the working lines from 34,001 in 1987 to 56,700 (an increase of
22,700 services). The actual achievement was slightly greater than the target figures (see Table
5), and, FPTL also replaced 35,460 analog switch lines with digital equipment in 25 exchanges in
this period. This physical network growth was a significant achievement, but had a significant
impact on capital expenditures in 1992-1993, which adversely affected the rate of return (ROR)
(see paragraph 17), but did position FPTL to achieve subsequent growth in services in 1995-
1996. Rural PCO development was targeted to grow from less than 170 in 1987 to 249 by 1994,
and although not achieved by 1994, the PCO development was 264 by 1995.
Financial Objectives
17.   Financial situation. FPTL's annual rate of return (on average net fixed assets) covenant
for the project was to be at least 9%. This was exceeded in the period 1989 through 1991, but
fell drastically 1992 through 1994, due to large construction and equipment modernization
program expenditures. Covenant targets were achieved again by 1995. The operating ratio
(operating expenses to operating revenues) exceeded targets from 1991 through 1994, but was
improving by 1995, an indication that expense management was taking hold. Revenue improved
through higher international settlements with FINTEL impacting 1996 results. The current ratio
(current assets to current liabilities) target was to be not less than 1.2, which was achieved, and
the debt coverage ratio remained consistently above target throughout the project period (see
Table 5). FPTL's financial situation, judged by the covenant indicators achieved by 1995-1996,
is satisfactory. The internal economic rate of return (IRR) at appraisal was projected as 22
percent. Sensitivity analysis at that time indicated a decrease to 10.6 percent would occur with a
combination of a 20% increase in investment, increase in operating costs, and reduction in

operations, and diagnosis and recommendation for the exchange planning and network planning operations.



7
operating revenues; or would decrease to 13.5% if benefits were delayed two years. Both
factors occurred during the project making the IRR achieved 5.3 percent (see Table 9).
18.   Annual audit requirements. The provision of FPTL's audited financial statements was
not in compliance with the provisions of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (within six months of
the end of the fiscal year). For the period 1991 through 1996, audited financial statements were
received one to two months late. The provision of audited Statements of Expenditure (SOE) was
in compliance with the Loan Agreement.
19.   Tariffs. Tariff adjustments in 1983 and January 1990 were applied prior to the project. In
July 1994 a tariff adjustrnent increased monthly rental charges 80% for business, 32% for
residence and applied a 10% increase in call charges. The project Staff Appraisal Report
recommended revised sector policies to include provision for adjustment of overall levels of
tariffs in line with inflation, however no agreed basis for tariff increases exists between the
Government and FPTL.
Physical Objectives
20.   Implementation schedule. Procurement of digital exchanges and outside plant cables was
to occur in four "groups" over the period 1989 through 1993, with installation ready-for-service
progressively from 1991 to 1995. Actual procurement of switching equipment and availability
for service was on schedule. Local distribution cables were procured in 1989, 1992, 1994 and
1995. 27,300 cable pairs were placed in the 1990-1995 period (an increase of 12,300 over the
Project target) for a total installed base of 72,900 pairs by 1995. Local distribution cables remain
as the limiting factor for the provision of additional customer services, so the 1996-1997
construction program target of 11,920 cable pairs to be placed in service is essential to meet
existing demand. Digital microwave transmission systems were placed on schedule. A 150
station trunked radio system (TRS) was installed on the main island of Viti Levu to replace the
rural radio telephone system, and a third phase to complete in 1995/96 would service 100
stations in Vanua Levu and Taveuni Islands.
21.   Accounting system. At project preparation, only subscriber billing and payroll were
computerized, utilizing the Government's computer facilities. The billing program in use for
more than ten years no longer met P&T's requirements. In 1990, the STI contract (see
paragraph 14) assisted FPTL in the preparation and tendering of a bid for the Customer Services
System, a computerized system for customer records, network assignments, service order
processing, fault reporting, and billing which was financed by FPTL and introduced in 1992.
System enhancements and upgrading are currently underway".
22.   Objectives of service quality. The quality of service improved during project
implementation. Faults/working line/year increased marginally, however average lines faulty
By 1994, the customer records and billing system was experiencing throughput capacity problems. A 1995 consultant study
advocated extension of existing technology and introduction of on-line billing. Approval was received from the Board in
May 1996 for expenditure of US$ 6.3 over two years.

declined and speed of fault clearance improved significantly. The call completion rate improved
to standards enjoyed in more developed countries (see Tables 5 and 6).
Cost of Financing
23.   The cost of the project (support for P&T's 1990-1994 Investment Program) was
estimated at appraisal to be US$ 47.9 million (F$ 68.5 million), with a foreign cost of US$ 30.0
million (see Table 8A and B). IBRD financing was foreseen at US$ 8.1 million, Australian CAS
of US$ 7.4 million, EIB of US$ 6.4 million and PTC's contribution at US$ 26.0 million. The
actual cost of the project from 1990-1996 is US$ 104.86 million (F$ 150 million)'2 (see Table
8A), with US$ 7.56 million (93% of the approved loan) disbursed by IBRD, US$ 1.26 million for
institutional development and US$ 6.3 million to meet physical objectives. Co-financing
expenditures of US$ 16.2 million were incurred (see Table 8B).
Procurement
24.   Procurement of local distribution plant copper cables to meet physical investment
objectives of the project was by FPTL Materials Management, using ICB procedures. Four
tenders were issued for copper cables (see paragraph 20).- Procurement of computer equipment
and consultants, financed locally and through the loan, followed World Bank procurement
guidelines. Training was sole source.
Disbursements
25.   Disbursement lagged the appraisal estimate by approximately one year due to the delay in
effectiveness of the loan until 1990 and a lack of applications for withdrawal in 1993 (see Table
4).
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
26.   Factors not generally subject to Government control. The substantial reduction in
international market prices for the digital technology equipment and copper cables has impacted
the overall cost of the physical component of the project. The new technology, in addition to
lower cost, provides more reliable service and requires less maintenance thereby positively
impacting staff productivity and operating cost.
27.   Factors generally subject to Government control. Adequate support for the creation of an
effective telecommunications regulatory unit was lacking. The development of an appropriate
tariff policy has not occurred (see paragraph 19), limiting domestic revenue growth in FPTL,
and necessitating special negotiations in 1996 between FINTEL and FPTL to establish a more
equitable settlement for international long distance revenues. Both issues need to be addressed
before the introduction of additional telecommunications licenses and the privatization of TFL.
12 The project cost for the period 1990-1994 is estimated to be about USS 55 million (F$ 84 million).



9
28.   Factors generally subject to Implementing Agency control. Changes in Borrower's
physical development targets and the sources of financing were to be included in annual reviews
with the Bank and clearly documented. Such information was obtained during supervision
missions, often after the fact. During the early years of the project, ambitious investment in
construction programs, not balanced with control of operating expense and appropriate tariff
increases, adversely affected financial results (see paragraph 16).
E. Project Benefits and Sustainability
29.   Project Benefits. The benefits of the project are related to the improvement of services
provided to subscribers and the impact on the economic activity of the islands (see paragraph 6).
Specifically, they are: (a) an increase in the quality and coverage of telecommunications services;
(b) the introduction of new telecommunications services that impact the business and rural
communities; (c) the creation of a commercial telecommunications operation with improving
profitability; and (d) implementation of institutional development activities in operating
company leading to more commercial operations and customer orientation. The Project is
considered satisfactory in achieving its development objectives.
30.   Sustainability. The organizational split between post and telecommunications activities,
although not an objective of the project, will provide the basis for further commercialization and
privatization of TFL. The Government, through the PEU, is moving towards competition in the
sector and the privatization of TFL. The significant investment in physical plant over the past
five years has positioned the company well for continued expansion and development of
services. Issues related to regulation and tariff reform remain and need to be addressed to affect
the changes desired. In respect of the positive climate that exists for continuing reform of the
sector, both within the Government and TTL, project sustainability is highly likely.
F. Bank's Performance
31.   Preparation and appraisal. The Government requested assistance from the Bank in 1986
with institutional reform and developmental issues in the telecommunications sector. The Bank
worked with P&T in 1987 to initiate fundamental studies required to determine the scope of
assistance required, and assisted the Government in 1988 through a PPF to engage consultants to
prepare policy and legislation, and plan restructuring for the corporatization of FPTL (see
paragraph 4). The project was subsequently initiated to include restructuring of the
telecommunications provider, as well as institutional development, and physical objectives for
the sector. Preparation and appraisal took place in 1988, with negotiations and Board approval
early in 1989. The Bank's preparation and appraisal of the project are rated highly satisfactory.
32.   Supervision. Supervision took place with two visits per year in 1990 and 1992, and one
in each other year through 1996. When the project closed, it was with its fourth task manager.
The initial task manager who had prepared the project was reassigned before effectiveness, and
the third task manager - from 1992 through 1994 during a critical period of organization change -
left the Bank in 1995. The Bank's support and assistance in developing an effective regulatory
agency, a key objective, proved inadequate, as little was achieved. Therefore, the Bank's overall
supervision of the project is rated as deficient.



lo
G. Borrower's Performance
33.   MOF was the Borrower, with FPTL being the implementing agency of the funds.
Cooperation between MOF and the Bank's project team was satisfactory, but did not lead to
regulatory development as anticipated by the project. Cooperation by PEU in initiating action
for further reform in the sector was excellent. FPTL association with the Bank was inadequate in
the early years, improved somewhat in 1993-1994, and was most effective in the latter two years
of the project life.
34.   Compliance with Loan Covenants. The status of compliance with all Loan covenants is
shown in Table 10. The Borrower's compliance with Loan convenants was deficient in the area
of: provision of performance targets for subsequent years; provision of audited financial
statements by FPTL, while timely by the terms of the Loan Agreement, was late by the terms of
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement; and the rate of return did not meet objective levels 1992 through
1994. Compliance began to improve in the latter two years of the project.
El. Assessment of Outcome
35.   FPTL achieved the overall objective of the project in line with Government policy, even
tilough the Company and the Government have gone through a great cultural, political and
economic change. The implementation and outcome of the project are considered satisfactory.
1. Future Operation
36.   The project achieved its objective of restructuring a Government department into a
commercial entity, the commercialization of the new company, and an increase in the quality and
coverage of telecommunications services. Technical assistance in support of the introduction of
competition in the sector, the privatization of TFL, and the development of appropriate
regulation are the only venues open to consideration for future Bank support.
J. Key Lessons Learned
37.   The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a)   Implementation and the achievement of development objectives are crucially dependent on
continuity of staff on the Bank's side, as well as the frequency of Bank supervision visits
and consultations and the adequacy of the composition of its mission teams. This is vital
when the imnplementing agency is going through a transition from public to private sector
orientation to customer service, evolving from public sector personnel policies to a
commercial operation, and is being prepared for competition and privatization.
(b)   The Bank has a responsibility to educate the Borrower and the implementation agency on
the requirements of the legal covenants and the implication of non-compliance at the time
of project preparation, and at any subsequent time when there is a change in senior
management, and must play a continuing role in assisting the Borrower in resolving
problems in meeting such covenants in a timely fashion.
