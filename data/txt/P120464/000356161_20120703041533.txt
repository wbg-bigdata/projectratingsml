                                 Restructuring Paper



1.     This paper proposes that the closing date for the Sudan Umbrella Program for
Health System Development, P120464- TF 096243 be extended from June 30, 2012 until
September 28, 2012.

2. The implementation is progressing well and the project is on track to achieve the
   development objectives:

  i. Delivery of Basic Package of Health Services through Lead agencies in four states
     as well the use of these services has progressed significantly. According to the
     available HMIS data, the availability and use of high impact services in the project
     supported four states (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria)
     have been improved significantly. The number of health facilities providing
     immunization, antenatal care and skilled clean delivery has increased from Quarter 3
     2010 to Quarter 1 2012 from 184 to 379, from 190 to 531 and from 125 to 457
     respectively;
 ii. Over the same period the number of children under 12 months who received DPT3
     vaccination increased from 14,022 Quarter 3 2010 to 44,815 in Quarter 1 2012.
     These significant achievements could be partly the result of improvements in the
     reporting system. Indeed, the number of health facilities submitting their HMIS
     report to the county on time has increased from 16% to 67%. However, an
     additional analysis of data from 160 health facilities which were reporting
     constantly for the whole time period confirm that the progress is not just a function
     of improved reporting;
iii. The capacity of county health departments to coordinate and monitor the delivery of
     Basic Package of Health Services has been improving; to date, 95% of the county
     health departments have been made functional with the support of the Lead
     Agencies;
iv. The procurement of drugs is about to be completed, the last shipment will reach Juba
     at the end of June. The availability of essential drugs has been improved
     significantly (essential drugs were available in more than 70% of supervised health
     facilities);
 v. The planned M&E activities have been implemented: country wide Health facility
     Survey and LQAS survey have been conducted respectively in February 2011 and
     April 2011. The number of health facilities submitting their HMIS report to the
     county on time has increased from 16% in Q3 of 2010 to 67% in Q1 of 2012;


                                            3
  vi. An additional financing of US$7 million was approved on February 4, 2011,
      specifically for procurement of drugs;
 vii. As of May 28, 2012, all the funds allocated under the project were fully committed
      and a total of US$67.7 million out of the US$ 70 million has been disbursed;
viii. The project financial management systems which are managed by the government
      Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) used for all MDTF projects are
      satisfactory. The PFMU would still be used during the period of extension for the
      financial management of the project. The audit for the year ended December 31,
      2011 is in progress. The Interim Financial Report (IFR) for the quarter ended April
      30, 2012 did not indicate any significant financial management issue. The FM risk
      rating is moderate and FM ISR rating is satisfactory.

3. The proposed extension will give enough time for the successful completion of
   ongoing activities (delivery of BPHS by Lead Agencies, procurement and distribution
   of essential drugs, etc.) and a successful achievement of the development objective.
   The Ministry of Health, which is the implementing entity, has submitted through
   MOFEP the formal request for extension of the project up to September 28, 2012.
   The MOH has also submitted the revised plan of action which shows that the planned
   activities under the project will be completed by September 28, 2012. The Task team
   has reviewed the revised plan and is confident that the plan can fully be implemented
   by September 28, 2012.


4.      This will be the second extension of the project for a total of three months.
