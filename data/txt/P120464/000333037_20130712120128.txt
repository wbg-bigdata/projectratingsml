1.1 Context at Appraisal

A. Country and sector issues

1.     The Republic of South Sudan covers a geographical area of approximately
640,000 square kilometers. The population is estimated at 8,260,490 million 1 with a
density of 15 people per square kilometer. More than 90% of the population lives in rural
areas. The average annual population growth rate is 2.2%. Females constitute 52% of the
population while males account for 48%. The total fertility rate is estimated at 6.7, while
the average life expectancy at birth for both sexes is 42 years2.

2.      South Sudan suffered decades of conflict with massive internal and external
population displacement, widespread insecurity, and lack of public funding. South Sudan
was, and still is, characterized by high prevalence of poverty, inadequate access to basic
services, inadequate access to economic opportunities, high mortality and morbidity rates
and food insecurity. The health care system as well as the health status of the people of
South Sudan suffered greatly during this period. Overall infrastructure was destroyed,
roads were inaccessible and the entire education system was barely functional. This was
and still is a major bottleneck with regards to national capacity building efforts.

3.     In January 2005, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed
between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement (SPLM). The CPA marked the end of more than 20 years of civil unrest and
ushered in a new dawn for laying the foundation for peace. It provided a framework and
agenda for conflict resolution, power sharing and development.

4.      The Joint Assessment Mission (JAM), of March 2005, comprising the Sudan
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the Government of Sudan, the World Bank, and
the United Nations (UN), prepared the “Framework for Sustained Peace, Development
and Poverty Reduction? to establish the financial requirements, as envisaged in the Peace
Agreement, for reconstruction and development of South Sudan. In addition to the
humanitarian aid and the UN and bilateral presence, the Government of South Sudan
(GoSS) anticipated significant resources resulting from: 1) the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, which includes a wealth sharing protocol intended to transfer substantial
amounts of oil and non-oil revenues to the SPLM; and 2) the Multi Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF) to be administered by the World Bank using Bank procedures, into which
donors agreed to contribute funds. The Bank committed at least 1% of US$ 548.0
million received for the period of the MDTF. The figure and chart below shows the
different MDTF donors and their funding proportions.

5.      Under the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), an Umbrella program to provide
financial and technical support to carry out the Ministry of Health's (MoH) sector
development program was developed and has been effective since July 28, 2006 (see
Phases of MDTF-UPHSDP). The program was based on the JAM's recommendations
and on the draft GoSS Health Policy and has provided the framework for strengthening
the sector's managerial capacities, developing essential health care delivery systems, and
increasing the population’s access to basic health services. The Basic Package of Health
Services (BPHS) of the MoH GoSS provides the key elements of services to be
developed and provided in a manner that focuses on epidemiological priorities and
intended performance targets as recommended by the respective Directorates of the
Ministry in pursuit of the Global Millennium Development Goals and commitment to
other specific Global Health Goals.

6.      Progress on strategy formulation in the health sector: The MOH made
progress on formulating a strategy for the sector and establishing a consensus. The
accomplishments were: (i) development and launch of the “Health Policy for the
Government of Southern Sudan 2007-2011? in December 2007; (ii) building partnerships
with international (mostly NGOs) and local (mostly faith-based) implementing partners
after the signing of the CPA; (iii) strong government willingness to adopt implementation
mechanisms, particularly in the area of contracting, which were designed to overcome
existing capacity constraints; and (iv) developing a consensus on the need for
decentralizing governmental responsibilities and health services management. Another
important accomplishment of the GOSS-MOH was the focus on developing Primary
Health Care (PHC) as the cornerstone of the new health policy. The policy instrument
underlying this consensus was the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS). Even
though the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) becomes more comprehensive with
each revision, the underlying message that remained was that of high impact
interventions that needed to be implemented on a priority basis.

7.       Health Sector Financing: The GoSS/MDTF provided the main health sector
financing mechanism with a resource criterion pegged on two-to-one during Phase I3 for
the domestic government budget and international donor funding, respectively. Reviews
of public expenditures and budgets show that the GoSS allocated 7.9% of its budget
(US$ 110 million) to health in 2006, gradually dropping to US$82.5 million (5.4% of the
national budget) in 2007 and, US$70.5 million, or 4.2% of the national budget in 2008
and in 20114. Similarly, development assistance to the health sector has dropped from
US$214.8 million in 2009 to US$169 million in 2010. In per capita terms, GoSS health
spending stood at US$ 7 in 2008, well below her neighbors—Kenya (US$28), Tanzania
(US$ 12), Uganda (US$ 10) and Zambia US$ 18. This was far below the WHO
recommended level of US$34 per capita to provide for minimum basic services and
below commitments by African governments in Abuja to spend 15% of the total budget
on health. The reductions in health spending during the period 2010-2012 were largely
attributed to volatility of oil revenues as the main source of domestic revenue, and
Ministry of Finance inability to release money in a timely manner in the previous years.
Table 1 and Figure 1 below highlights the proportion of health financing as a percentage
of total of annual government funding for the period 2006-2011.

8.      Health Status: South Sudan continued to have poor health indicators and equally
poor access to health5 services which remained limited and inequitably located. (Table 2
below). Estimates for maternal mortality (2,054 per 100,000 live births) were the highest
in the world and the coverage of preventive services such as immunization among the
lowest. Malnutrition remained widespread with tropical diseases making a large
proportion of the total burden of disease. Infectious disease epidemics continued to
remain common and HIV prevalence estimates from location-specific surveys range from
0 to 8% among adults. The annual incidence of tuberculosis in South Sudan estimated at
325 per 100,000 was among the highest rates in the world.

   . The availability of health services facilities remained minimal. Coupled with many years of war, there was very
little construction of new facilities or rehabilitation of old infrastructure and consequently infrastructure remained poor
and inadequate, greatly affecting access.

9.       Health Facilities: There are in total 1,487 health facilities in the 10 States. Of
these 1,147 are functional, while 340 are non-functional. Of the functional ones, 3 are
Teaching Hospitals, 7 State Hospitals, 27 County Hospitals, 284 Primary Health Care
Centers, 792 Primary Health Care Units, 10 Private facilities, 14 specialized
hospitals/clinics and 10 police and military health facilities. The non-functional health
facilities include 2 State Hospitals, 1 County Hospital, 30 PHCCs, 302 PHCUs, 4 Private
facilities and 1 Specialized Hospital/Clinic. Regarding the state of infrastructure in these
health facilities, 376 (26%) are in good condition, 347 (23%) require minor renovation,
274 (18%) require major renovation and 490 (33%) need complete replacement.
Furthermore, these facilities lack medical equipment, transport and communication, water
and power supplies.

10.    Access to health facilities: It is estimated that 44% of the population are settled
within a 5 kilometer radius of a functional health facility (HFM 2011)8. The per capita
Out Patient Department utilization rate is estimated at 0.2 visits per annum. A
combination of factors lead to the low utilization rates: lack of qualified staff; inadequate

equipment and supplies in County and State hospitals; long distances to health facilities;
poor roads and transport; limited/no ambulance service; dysfunctional referral system;
cultural and financial barriers.   Access to known, cost-effective, life-saving maternal
and child health interventions, for instance bed nets, water-guard and immunization, is
still low in South Sudan.

11.     Primary health Services (PHC): PHC delivery at the County level is catered
around 1377 PHCUs and 270 PHCCs. Provision and quality of health services are very
low with estimated 35% of health facilities providing immunization, less than 20%
providing laboratory services for common tests and over 50% have regular drug stock-
outs. Facility utilization rate is lower than 0.2 contacts per person per year. Utilization of
maternal and reproductive health services is low. Just 48% of pregnant women attend one
or more Ante Natal Care (ANC) visits of which only 26% have delivered by skilled
health personnel whereas the rest is provided by non-health personnel such as CHWs.
Deliveries assisted by skilled birth attendants is just 10%. Prevalence rates of modern
contraceptives are less than 3%. Access to Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and
Neonatal Care (CEmONC) in hospitals is very low. Overall 20% of health facilities at the
primary level are not operative mainly due to a deficit in HRH. Particularly remote areas
show over 40% non-functionality of primary health facilities. In addition, health facilities
mainly suffer from inadequate and dilapidated infrastructure and lack of equipment and
supplies. Health services are provided by lower staff cadres that have not received
adequate professional schooling or any further training. Supervision by the SMoH and
CHD is often inadequate. Table 3 below shows the distribution of facilities in South
Sudan. As can be seen, the actual number of facilities in Equatoria is more than the
number of facilities in other States showing the unequal distribution of facilities.

12.     Health Service Delivery: Like in many post-conflict settings, the organization of
health services in South Sudan was and mostly still is a patchwork of efforts that was not

        having a substantial effect on the population as a whole. The whole country was sub
        served by a network of un-coordinated NGOs whose link with Central and State MoH
        was at best minimal. This created a serious challenge on monitoring implementation and
        coordinating the various players on the ground. Work by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
        indicated that 27% of the counties (21 counties) did not receive external financing for
        primary health care (PHC). Most of the funding to counties was directed to a few of the
        payams (districts or local government areas equivalent) was provided as support for
        vertical programs. In addition, financing for PHC exhibited significant inequities. The
        amount of money available for PHC ranged from $0.94 to $9.02 per capita per year. The
        health management information system (HMIS) was not functional. There were no
        systematic health facility surveys except for a facility mapping exercise the development
        of which was initiated under the phase 1 and completed under Phase 2 of Umbrella
        Program for Health System Development.

        13.     Human Resources for Health (HRH):              There is a huge deficit in Human
        Resources for Health (HRH) with the health workforce skewed to a poorly trained low-
        level professional and auxiliary staff and an absolute shortage of higher-professional staff
        such as clinicians, midwives, medical officers, nurses, pharmaceutical technicians,
        laboratory technicians and health administrative cadres. It is estimated that just 10% of
        the staffing norms are filled by appropriately trained health workers11. In addition, the
        capacity of health training institutions is limited. Only 23 of the 36 pre-service health
        training schools are functional with training mostly for low professional cadres. The table
        below highlights the HRH situation in the country.

        14.     Support to the health sector: During the period of the war and even after the
        Comprehensive Peace Agreement, health services were fragmented among many actors,
        including over 100 NGOs which were supported by multilateral and bilateral agencies. In
        the three years that followed the Joint Assessment Mission of 2005, in addition to the

GOSS budget, three principal financing channels came on board to support the health
sector: (i) the GoSS/MDTF Umbrella Program for Health Systems Development
(UPHSD); (ii) the UN and its partners’ Work Plan; and (iii) bilateral donor mechanisms,
including humanitarian programs, with some donors contributing through more than one
channel. Among bilateral agencies, USAID supported an integrated health sector
development project, building parts of the health system in 12 (of a reported 79) counties.
The Joint Donor Team through the Basic Services Fund (BSF) supported 43 counties.

15.    Rationale for Bank involvement: Following the CPA and JAM of 2005, it
became important that the Bank play a significant role in the administration of
developmental support given its comparative advantage in post conflict areas. In addition,
the Bank has been involved as Trustee in administering a large number of trust funds.
The Bank under the context of the MDTF – UPHDSP was uniquely positioned not only
to administer the trust fund, but also to bring its comparative advantage in systems
development, monitoring and evaluation, financial management and procurement. In
Phase I, the GOSS-MOH made considerable headway in formulating policy and in
decentralizing decision-making. However, effective stewardship and efficient use of the
large amount of resources coming into the sector needed to be strengthened considerably.
This required the MOH to further build its capacity to effectively monitor and evaluate
health sector performance and efficiently coordinate the activities of its many
implementing partners. The Bank was well positioned to support the MOH given its
experience in other post-conflict areas. The Bank as part of the donor coordinating
committee was leading the work on overall system strengthening and health financing.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

16.    The project's development objective was to: (i) improve the delivery of the Basic
Package of Health Services (BPHS) in four states (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria,
and Eastern Equatoria); and (ii) strengthen key stewardship functions of the MOH,
including monitoring. The project consisted of the following two components:

Component 1: Development of key stewardship functions

  I.   Strengthening the coordination and management capacity of MOH;
 II.   Development of monitoring and evaluation capacity, including the measurement
       of health sector performance;
III.   Strengthening pharmaceutical management, supply, and distribution system.

Component 2: Expansion of delivery of basic health services

IV.    Expansion of the coverage of basic health service delivery (provision of basic
       package of health services in Upper Nile, Jongeli, Central Equatoria, Eastern
       Equatoria, including further development of human resources)




                                            8
17.      Project Development Objective indicators were:

      1. Percentage of births attended in a health facility.
      2. Percentage of children 12 to 23 months old who received measles vaccine before
         the age of 12 months.
      3. Percentage of health facilities submitting new HMIS monthly reports within one
         month of the reporting month.
      4. Percentage of children under 5 sleeping under ITN the night before survey.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

18.      PDO was never revised during the lifetime of the project

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

19.     The project beneficiaries were the populations served in the project States with a
combined population of 4,734,400 (52% of country’s population) for all interventions
outlined in the PDO. However, the procurement of pharmaceuticals benefited the entire
country population as the UPHSD was the designated entity for nationwide procurement
of all pharmaceuticals. The project preferentially benefited children and women for the
delivery of basic health care package that looked at specific maternal and child survival
interventions. In addition, the project benefited the MOH and State MOH and their
counties in policy formulation, strengthening of capacity in policy implementation,
capacity building in human resources and monitoring and evaluation through the design,
development and implementation of the HMIS. The project also strengthened inter-
connectivity between the Country Health Departments (CHD), State Ministries of Health
and the Central Ministry of Health which had far reaching benefits.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Development of key stewardship functions: Component 1 had three sub
components: Total cost US$ 35, 5 million.

Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening the coordination and management capacity of
MoH: Total cost US$ 1, 7 million.

20.     Under this sub component, Phase II continued to support n GoSS-MOH to
enhance the capacity of the MOH to coordinate the health sector and enable it to manage
grants from diverse sources. The management team comprised four competitively
selected national consultants – two public health consultants, one financial management
specialist and one procurement specialist. Their tasks included: (i) coordinating the
country-wide provision of the BPHS to fill gaps in service delivery and avoid
duplication; (ii) ensure that non-state actors (NGOs, private firms) follow MOH
guidelines and strategies (e.g. implementation of new HMIS); (iii) carry out the
recruitment of NGOs with MOH-GoSS and selected donors’ funds; (iv) manage the



                                             9
contracts of NGOs, including regular field supervision; (v) monitor and evaluate NGO
performance; (vi) oversee the management of funds from the MDTF, GAVI, Global Fund
etc.; and (vii) assist in developing the capacity of the MOH to work effectively with
NGOs and FBOs for the future partnerships with the private sector in health, utilizing
domestic resources. To support the management team’s activity, Phase II of the UPHSD
provided the team with the budget for salaries, equipment, operating costs, and
transportation.

Subcomponent 1.2: Development of monitoring and evaluation capacity. Total cost
US$ 3, 2 million.

21.     Under this sub component, Phase II of the UPHSD provided support for data
collection and analysis with technical assistance provided through a contract with
Liverpool Associates in Tropical Health (LATH) financed from phase I. Phase II
supported: (i) The design, conduct, and analysis of country-wide health facility surveys.
The surveys examined quality of care, availability of drugs, personnel, and equipment,
and implementation of the high impact interventions of the BPHS; (ii) Obtaining
community-based information through a national health household survey; (iii)
Development of a standard LQAS (lot quality assurance sampling) survey protocol that
can be implemented by NGO partners to provide rapid household information on key
coverage indicators at county and state level; (iv) Development, field-testing, and
implementation of a quantitative supervisory checklist (QSC) that will facilitate and
strengthen supervision of PHC facilities; (v) Development of an HMIS database to be
used at county, state, and national levels; (vi) Strengthening the MOH M&E department
through the provision of furniture and equipment and recruitment of two local
consultants; and (vii) Rolling out the implementation of the revised HMIS formats
through the implementing agencies (lead agencies and other NGOs) across all of the 10
states.

Subcomponent 1.3: Strengthening pharmaceutical management, supply and
distribution system: Total cost US$ 30, 6 million.

22.    Under this sub component, Phase II saw the development of pharmaceutical
management, supply, and distribution capacity within the MoH. It continued to take
advantage of the ongoing contract with Euro health which was extended from Phase 1.

Component 2: Expansion of delivery of Basic Package of Health Service. Total cost
US$ 27, 5 million.

Subcomponent 2.1: Expansion of the basic health service delivery in four states
(Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria, and Eastern Equatoria), including further
development of human resources: Total cost US$12, 7 million.

23.    Under this sub component, Phase II, the Lead Agencies (LA’s) (IMA World
Health and Norwegian Peoples Aid) working in 4 states had their contracts extended until
the end of the project. The lead agency contracts were amended to: (i) make them more



                                           10
results focused and ensure greater concentration on actually improving service delivery
as well as strengthening capacity in a meaningful and measurable way; (ii) increase the
flexibility provided to the LA’s so they can effectively respond to challenging
circumstances and fill financing gaps; (iii) facilitate procurement activities by LAs by
making more use of post-review procedures and taking full advantage of the prior-review
threshold; and (iv) reduce the focus on subjective deliverables such as the quality of work
plans.

Implementation of activities not completed in Phase I but funded under Phase II:
Total cost: US$ 14, 8 million.

24.     This sub-component included those activities that were not completed in Phase I
due to lack of funds mostly and late implementation and finalization of contract by GoSS
MOH. These were brought forward and funded in the Phase II budget. The activities
included the following: i) MoH institutional capacity strengthening contract with
Liverpool Associate in Tropical Health (LATH); ii) Lead Agency contract for Eastern
Equatoria state, Health and Life Sciences Partnership (HLSP); iii) State MoHs V-SAT
installation contract, UNOPS and; iv) Pharmaceutical management and capacity building,
Eurohealth. The detailed costing is shown in the tables below.

25.     Project costs by component: Financing of UPHSD Phase II should be viewed in
the context of the overall design and financing of the different phases of the project. In
the 2006 proposal, the total cost of UPHSD was US$225 million, which was divided over
three phases (I-III) of implementation. Donors were to finance US$75 million and the
GOSS would finance US$150 million in line with commitment to a two-to-one ratio of
domestic-to-international funding for MDTF programs. The tables below show the
original and revised phased allocation of the funds. The three-year-UPHSD was
originally scheduled to be implemented from April 2006 – December 2008 but had to be
extended to a more realistic time frame of July 2006 – June 2011. The estimated cost of
Phase I was $60 million, of which the donors were to provide $20 million against
GOSS’s $40 million. However, due to the financial crises and austerity measures, the
GOSS was not able to put more than $28.0 million and donors financed GOSS’s part for
the rest of phase I and all of phase II. $14.8 million of Phase I was financed from Phase
II.

1.6 Revised Components

26.       The original components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.    Design, Scope and Scale: No changes in design were made from the project
design of Phase I. However, a number of activities that were scheduled to be
implemented in Phase 1 were funded and implemented in phase II. These activities are
highlighted in table 3. The scale of the UPHSD was to have covered all the 10 States.


                                                  12
However due to the GoSS inability to meet its obligations, donor funding for both Phase
II and Phase III12 was moved to support implementation of Phase II. This reduced the
number of States for Phase II to four (Eastern and Central Equatoria, Jonglei and Upper
Nile). The lack of financing to meet the earlier plan affected the overall scope of the
MDTF UPHSDP by limiting actual implementation to the four States mentioned earlier.
However, this did not impact the range of activities to be implemented.

28.     Implementation arrangements and schedule: The implementation
arrangements of UPHSD Phase II took advantage of pre-existing contracts (such as for
the lead agencies, pharmaceutical supply and distribution, and capacity strengthening in
the MOH and following closely the implementation of Phase I). The schedule of
implementation was designed to last from June 30, 2010 to June 30 2012, but this was
extended by six months to December 30, 2012 to ensure that there was no gap in the
delivery of the BPHS, while the next phase of Bank support became effective (Health
Rapid Results Project).

     2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

     2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29.     Project preparation: The project was prepared as part of the overall MDTF
UPHSD. There was high stakeholder participation right from the development of Phase I.
Government, Bilaterals, Multilaterals and NGOs all worked together in line with the
spirit of JAM recommendations in the development of the project proposal. The overall
development period was a joint and consensus effort of getting the health sector transit
from humanitarian support to health systems development. Hence, even though there was
no formal quality at entry review, this can be said to have been satisfactory given the high
level partner participation and review.

30.     Design: The design of the second phase was consistent with the priorities
identified in the new health policy of South Sudan, with a greater focus on results and
improved coordination of activities in order to facilitate a more coherent sector-wide
approach. Implementation challenges encountered in Phase I helped inform the design
of Phase II. The Phase II of the UPHSD was implemented in four States Jonglei, Upper
Nile, Central and Eastern Equatoria, with the objective of implementing the basic health
care package, strengthening infrastructure and human resource base, and improving the
availability of pharmaceuticals in Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) and Units. The
lead agencies recruited under Phase I to strengthen service delivery had their contracts
extended until the end of phase II except for the HLSP whose contract was not renewed
and reassigned to Norwegian peoples Aid (NPA). Similarly, technical assistance on
pharmaceutical management, procurement, financial management, planning and
monitoring and evaluation was extended to the end of Phase II. Overall, there was no
change in implementation arrangements. The continuation of these contracts from Phase I


12
   . In the original planning, the MDTF-UPHSD was supposed to have been implemented in three phases. However,
due to financial challenges, Government could not meet its obligations and hence Phases II and II were fused.


                                                      13
had a significant impact on the level of implementation for Phase II. The challenges and
delays of Phase I were not encountered and the project moved to implementation
immediately. This can be seen from that fact that all activities for Phase II were
implemented including the remaining Phase I activities.

31.     Project Organization and Management: The program continued to operate
within the framework of the structure and management determined by the GOSS. Under
the arrangement, the GOSS MOFEP had overall responsibility for procurement and
financial management, and continued to build the capacity of the MOH at all levels. A
management team within the GOSS-MOH played a key role in coordinating and tracking
implementation of the project’s activities. The MOH-GOSS continued to be the grant
recipient. Within the MOH, the Senior Management Board acted as the Project Steering
Committee with overall responsibility for program implementation. The Executive
Board comprised of the Under Secretary, the Directors General, and Directors directly
managed the program with the assistance from the Management Team established during
Phase II. The Management Team collaborated with the directorates to ensure the
availability of necessary technical information and provided project financial and
administrative information to the Executive Board.

32.     MOH and Partners: The MOH established the Health and Nutrition
Consultative Group (HNCG) to coordinate the activities of development partners such as
donors, UN agencies and NGOs. The project contributed by financing: (i) quarterly
supervision and review of program and project implementation; (ii) annual planning and
budgeting to ensure effective and flexible use of resources to fill gaps and implement new
priorities, at national, state, and county levels. In addition, the UPHSD provided the
framework for the MOH health sector development plans, to which other partners (such
as USAID, DFID, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) continue to contribute. Phase II focused on
strengthening effective coordination of partners and the stewardship role of the MOH,
building towards a future sector-wide approach. Ultimately, the MOH continued to take
the responsibility to ensure that activities were not duplicated among the various
supporting mechanisms with initiatives supported by other partners complementing the
UPHSD by either focusing on different activities or geographical coverage. Overall, the
GoSS was fully committed to implementation but challenges in resource availability and
inadequate human resources were a major drawback.

33.      Lessons from Other Post-Conflict Settings: The experience of developing
health systems in other post-conflict settings suggested that success required: (i) a clear
and understandable strategy with explicitly enunciated priorities that stakeholders buy in
to; (ii) a focus on achieving tangible results in a reasonable time frame as judged by a few
specific and measurable indicators of success; (iii) actual collection of data by which to
assess progress; (iv) that the ministry of health invests sufficient time and resources in
coordinating the delivery of services (particularly geographical coordination) rather than
focusing exclusively on delivering services itself; and (v) that the ministry of health take
on a stewardship role rather than try to exert its influence through “command and control?
mechanisms. Excessive centralization of management decision-making tends not to work




                                            14
well in post-conflict situations, particularly when infrastructure has been destroyed and
political considerations require significant decentralization.

34.     MDTF financing provided an opportunity to apply these lessons effectively in
South Sudan. During Phase I, the GOSS-MOH made considerable headway in
formulating policy and in decentralizing decision-making. However, effective
stewardship over the sector and efficient use of the large amount of resources coming into
the sector needed to be strengthened considerably and required MOH to further build its
capacity to: (i) effectively monitor and evaluate health sector performance overall and of
its implementing partners in particular; (ii) efficiently coordinate the activities of its many
implementing partners; (iii) fill gaps in service delivery by quickly mobilizing the
resources required to implement the high impact interventions of the BPHS. Phase II of
the UPHSD aimed to help MOH to play key stewardship functions thereby increasing the
effectiveness of other investments being made in the health sector.

35.    Risks and mitigating measures:

1. High expectations from the population and partners. For the population, this was
   mitigated through building support for expanding basic service delivery and high-
   impact health interventions. For the partners, the UPHSD supported country dialogue
   and coordination with other sectors and key ministries, including assisting the MOH’s
   capacity building for coordination at the central, state and country levels.
2. Project scope and complexities of implementation. Was mitigated through phased
   implementation (especially the components to develop public health administration
   and health infrastructure/equipment) and geographical targeting and the use of Lead
   Agencies.
3. Inadequate skilled human resources: Insufficient and mostly unqualified human
   resources to manage health systems development coupled with inadequate salaries
   was a challenge mitigated through increased skills training and use of incentives in
   the delivery of basic health care package as well as subcontracts to NGOs to
   implement specific activities.
4. Rapid expansion of health services remained a major bottleneck but was mitigated by
   mobilizing workers from the community and those demobilized from the SPLM
   including retired civil servants.
5. Weak procurement and fiduciary capacity: This was mitigated through the
   recruitment of both Financial and Procurement Specialists who sat at the Ministry of
   Health and whose roles in addition to ensuring adherence of Bank processes and
   procedures was to ensure that appropriate capacity building and knowledge transfer to
   MOH Staff.
6. Inadequate capacity in monitoring and supervision of the project: The recruitment
   of a Monitoring Agent ensured that implementation progress, fiduciary and
   procurement processes were adequately monitored ad supervised in a timely and
   effective manner.
7. Donor relation complexities: This was mitigated through interagency donor
   coordinating meetings and monthly MOH and Donor meetings.




                                              15
2.2 Implementation

36.    The project was not restructured nor was it at risk at any point. There was no
mid-term review as the project only had a two year time line. The project had two rounds
additional financing;
    1. USD$7.0 million for the purchase of pharmaceuticals following the designation
       of the UPHSD as the overall entity for national drug procurement including other
       medical products, and
    2. US$1.5 million for the procurement of anti-retroviral medicines; as well as for
       continued support to counties previously supported by USAID in Jonglei to
       ensure continued implementation of the BPHS after the USAID contract ended
       and responsibility transferred to NPA.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.     The Directorate of Research, Planning and Health System Development in the
MOH was responsible for program monitoring and reporting on performance. Technical
support was provided through a contract with LATH. The results framework for Phase II
was in line with overall MOH M&E framework focusing on outputs and outcomes rather
than inputs. Data was collected through a HMIS developed through the support of the
project and now being used by all states of South Sudan, a health facility survey and a
household survey using the LQAS methodology. GoSS MOH Directorate of Research
and Planning was and remains responsible for the implementation of HMIS, development
and implementation of a quantitative supervisory checklist, and carrying out surveys
(health facility survey and LQAS). The lead agencies recruited for the provision of BPHS
were in charge of implementation of HMIS in the respective health facilities that they
supported.

38.     As reflected from the results matrix, significant progress was made in both data
collection and data utilization. During the ICR mission to the counties of Juba in Central
Equatoria and Torit in Eastern Equatoria, the level of data management and utilization
was evidenced by disease trend charts in measles, BCG and DPT vaccination, malaria
visits and TB reporting. This was reiterated as the norm in other counties that were under
other Lead Agencies. Reports from the Lead Agencies clearly show the advanced level
data of collection and utilization at source. Monitoring missions were held on a quarterly
basis and contributed to project implementation. It should be pointed out that the
availability of the TTL who was resident in South Sudan provided an increased measure
of proactive follow up and greatly strengthened the frequency and quality of monitoring
and supervision support visits.

39.     Another aspect that was strengthened was the implementation of surveys. As was
noted earlier, data for decision making at project inception was scanty and this led to
setting of targets based on surrounding counties and regional level data. The 2006 South
Sudan Household Survey (SHHS) was old and the project contributed to implementation
of surveys to improve data availability.




                                           16
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40.     Environmental and social safeguards: A draft Environmental and Social
Assessment Framework for MDTF Investments in South Sudan was finalized by the
Directorate of Environment in the Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and
Environment and shared with all major GOSS sectors. Based on this Framework, the
Ministry drafted an Environmental and Social Screening Checklist. The checklist
identified issues and mitigation measures with regard to environmental management and
social safeguards requirements during implementation of the investments. As UPHSD
only did minor rehabilitation of existing functioning health facilities in the four States
and no new construction, no safeguard issues were raised. Environmental issues were
addressed through the existing Environmental and Social Management Framework that
provided guidelines for environmental site selection, design and construction, and
procedures for ensuring compliance. In addition, a Medical Waste Management Plan was
prepared and was implemented in the four states (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria
and Eastern Equatoria) through Lead Agencies. The implementation progress of the plan
was under the Department of Environmental Health in the MoH. No issues in the
implementation of the medical waste management plan were encountered during the
project period as centers supported by the project constructed incinerators that were used
to dispose of medical waste.

41.     Fiduciary compliance and expenditure: The World Bank contracted Price
Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) Africa Associates Ltd as the Monitoring Agent (MA) for the
MDTF-SS. The MA assisted the World Bank fulfill its fiduciary, management, evaluation,
and reporting obligations with respect to procurement and financial management, as well
as monitoring and evaluation of results for the purpose of accountability and
transparency. 13 Projects/programs financed through the MDTF-SS were subject to a
financial audit on an annual basis. The MoFEP contracted an External Audit Agent to
carry out the functions of an external auditor of the MDTF-SS projects. The table below
shows the commitments, disbursements and utilization of the UPHSD Phase II resources
by close of project. Project ratings in ISR for Implementation Progress were satisfactory
throughout project life; MS for first two and satisfactory for the last three ISRs for
development objective. (Trend of disbursements in data sheet).

  . The MA’s role was to monitor expenditures related to the activities financed under the Grant. It had the following
responsibilities: 1). Monitoring the procurement of goods, works and services; 2). Monitoring progress of
implementation of activities and other items; 3). Screening and recommending withdrawal applications for IDA’s
approval and payment; 4). monitoring all expenditures financed under the Grant, and 5). screening the financial
management capacity of the Recipient so as to ensure that the proceeds of the Grant are disbursed only for the intended
purposes and according to applicable IDA procedures

42.     Procurement: Goods procured under phase II were IT equipment, essential drug
kits for additional 21 months and office equipment for the Management Unit. GoSS also
used the Bank’s standard evaluation forms. Goods procured from United Nations
agencies such as United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Fund for
Population Administration (UNFPA), or the United Nations Office for Project Services
(UNOPS) were in accordance with the provision of paragraph 3.9 of the Guidelines,
subject to the Bank’s prior review. All Good and Services procurement were done
according to the World Bank’s guidelines. Procurement monitoring was done every six
months.

43.     Given the measures taken by the GoSS MoFEP vis-à-vis the procurement of
monitoring agents, contracting of an external audit firm and recruitment of a PFMU
within the MoFEP, the project did not have any qualified audits. Reports and other
stipulated financial requirements such as interim financial reports and financial annual
reports were delivered on time. By the close of project, the project had been fully
committed and disbursed as shown in Table 4 above (details in annex 2).

44.        The project was in compliance with all legal covenants.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.    Sustainability: The GOSS has developed the South Sudan (SS) Development
Plan 2011-2013 as well as the Health Sector Development Plan (HSDP) 2011-2015
which has requested donors to align, harmonize and coordinate their financial and
technical support to the implementation of the HSDP at State and County level. It is
important to note that as part of sustainability MDTF-SS was GoSS led and driven, there
was high community participation and use of NGOs to implement projects. The three
major donors of the HSDP (WB, DFID and USAID) have continued to support the sector
as described below.

46.     Following GoSS and partners agreement on the division of support to states by
the various partners, the Bank has been designated to support two Northern, and most
challenging, States of Jonglei and Upper Nile, and does so through the US$28 million
Health Rapid Results Project whose main development objectives are: (i) to improve the
delivery of high impact primary health care services in Jonglei and Upper Nile; and (ii) to
strengthen coordination and monitoring and evaluation capacities of the Ministry of
Health. The project was approved in April 2012; became effective in August 2012 and
will close in October 2014. USAID supports Central Equatoria and Western Equatoria
States while the other six States will be supported through the Health Pooled Fund (led
by UK DfID and partners). Following the adoption of the new arrangement for
supporting the sector, discussions were held to ensure that health service delivery was not
interrupted with the closure of the ongoing support (MDTF, SHTPII and BSF). This last
point is essentially critical as evidence on the ground is showing the negative impact of



                                                  18
rapid deployment of new implementation arrangements coupled with changes in local
NGOs. This has led to challenges in meeting the logistic needs of facilities as the new
lead implementing agencies are still becoming operational and so not able to meet the
needs of the affected health facilities and communities, i.e., drug distributions and
operational costs for PHCC and PHCU are being affected negatively as resources
allocated from the County are minimal.

47.     It will be important to point out here that the designation of different partners to
provide total State support could also be a challenge and could hinder implementation if
the health system based approach and the procurement and contracting mechanisms
already established within UPHSDP Phase II are not continued. Already some of the
challenges noticed above are a result of discontinuation of the work of some Lead
Agencies on the ground. In addition, the role of State MOH will have to be especially
strengthened to ensure that overall health implementation is done with State leadership
for continuity and sustained capacity strengthening.

       3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.        Rating: Substantial for overall relevance of MDTF-UPHSDP Phase II. The
objectives were (and remain) highly relevant to the existing political orientations and
technical considerations and are in synch with the current health agenda.

   1) Relevance of PDO: The relevance of the PDO of the MDTF UPHSD was in line
      with the JAM recommendations and the overall direction of the GOSS in ensuring
      that MOH was taking the lead and prioritizing health interventions in line with
      meeting the MDGs. The focus towards MDG attainment is evident across all the
      MDTF support projects in all sectors. The relevance of the PDO remains high at
      the time of the ICR.

   2) Design: The design of the second phase was consistent with the priorities
      identified in the new health policy of South Sudan, with a greater focus on results
      and improved coordination of activities so as to facilitate a more coherent sector-
      wide approach. The design of the project also contributed to other higher level
      objectives such as good governance and equity where the GoSS had stronger
      stewardship over the health sector to help improve equity and ensure that all the
      people of South Sudan have access to at least basic health services and poverty
      alleviation through strengthening the delivery of preventive, promotive, and
      curative services which will mitigate the worst aspects of poverty and help
      prevent families from becoming destitute.

   3) Bank Assistance Strategy: Lastly, the Project was in line with the World Bank
      Africa Strategy for Health that focuses on attainment of MDGs and poverty
      reduction and the country development strategy on health; and one that regards
      the health system as the cornerstone of sustainable delivery of health services.


                                            19
       The project was being implemented taking cognizance of Phase I lessons and
       using Phase I arrangements. This drastically reduced time lag in procurement and
       initiation of delivery of services on the ground.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.     Attainment of PDOs: The UPHSDP Phase II by and large achieved its
development objectives. The project was implemented within the time frame with an
extension of six months to ensure that the delivery of the basic package of health services
was not interrupted. All the components of the project were implemented fully albeit
with some challenges mostly due to ongoing security issues and inadequate human
resource capacity on the ground. The use of contracted lead implementing agencies and
their supporting NGOs was especially useful in the attainment of results. The fact that
the Lead Agencies were carried over from Phase I meant no time was wasted in
recruitment at the start of the project and therefore, they were operational right from the
start of the project. The implementation of planned activities was done in a timely
manner and undoubtedly contributed to the achievement of expected outputs. A
summary of implementation by PDO is provided below.

PDO 1: Improve the delivery of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) in
four states (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria, and Eastern Equatoria):

50.     Expansion of delivery of Basic Health Services: The purpose of this PDO was
to strengthen the delivery and expansion of coverage of a basic package of health services
in Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria and the development of
human resources. This was done through the implementation of high impact interventions.
As part of improving coverage and quality of service, Lead Agencies were allowed to
incentivize the implementation of activities leading to the attainment of this PDO.

51.     The project supported the improvement of access to high impact interventions
through a fixed strategy (routine delivery of service in health facilities) and outreach
activities. Priority was given to interventions known as most effective and providing the
best value for money. These interventions are child immunization, treatment of major
child killers (diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, etc.), Vitamin A and LLINs distribution,
maternal care, etc. The achievement of results for these interventions within a very short
period of time (32 months) is seen through data as follows:

52.      The utilization and coverage of high impact interventions increased significantly
from Quarter 3 2010 to Quarter 3 2012: The number of children under 5 treated in
facilities increased from 29,121 to 205,181; the number of children under 12 months who
received DPT3 vaccination increased from 14,022 to 44,815; and the number of pregnant
women receiving antenatal care during a visit to a health provider increased from 4,913
to 20,175. The number of under-5 consultations increased from 20,690 in Q1-2011 to
39,954 in Q-1 2012. During the same period, there was an increase in number of women
attending antenatal consultations (52152 vs 589) number of deliveries occurring at health
facilities (1,501 vs 551 ) and number of children under 12 months who received DPT3



                                            20
vaccine (5,352 vs 2,020). Even though these significant achievements could be attributed
to improvements in the reporting system, the 80 health facilities in Upper Nile who were
reporting consistently over the same 18 months showed significant improvements in
service delivery. The final status of health coverage for the high impact interventions is
contained in the data sheet.

53.      A detailed analysis of the attainment of each PDO indicator is described below.

      1. PDO Indicator 1: Birth attendance in health facility: 85 % of target reached.
         The proportion of pregnant women who delivered in a health facility increased
         from 10% at baseline 2009 to 15.3% in 2012. Although this achievement is less
         than the agreed end of project target (18%), the overall observed progress should
         be taken in the context of a country where the availability of health services
         providing skilled delivery was extremely limited. In 2010, only 125 health centers
         out of 787 functioning health centers were able to provide skilled delivery. During
         the project life, this number increased consistently and reached 457 in June 2012
         and consequently, the number of pregnant women who have delivered in a health
         facility increased from 17,851 in 2010 to 28,944 in 2012. High levels of
         insecurity and the nomadic nature of the population in the northern states could
         have had an impact on fully reaching the target.

      2. PDO Indicator II: Children immunized: 100% of Target reached. The number
         of children under 12 months of age who received DPT3 vaccine and a Measles
         vaccine has increased from 34,286 (baseline 2009) to 179,260 for DPT3 in 2012
         and from 54,553 (baseline 2009) to 180,462 (2012). This substantial increase is a
         result of improved availability and access to routine immunization services; the
         number of health centers providing immunization services increased from 184 in
         2010 to 388 in June 2012 in addition to the dry season campaign supported by the
         project which aimed at improving access and coverage of basic services such as
         immunization, vitamin A supplementation, and insecticide treated bed nets for
         malaria prevention.

      3. PDO Indicator III: Health facilities submitting new HMIS monthly reports within
         one month of the reporting month to the county health department: Target
         surpassed. At the launch of the project, HMIS was essentially not in existence in
         the country, there were various reporting tools and channels, and the MOH was
         not systematically receiving data from implementing agencies which were
         reporting to their respective donors. The project supported the development of
         HMIS tools, capacity building and ensured that reports were delivered from the
         participating health facilities. The proportion of health facilities submitting their
         monthly HMIS report on time increased from 5% baseline-2009 to 68.5% in June
         2012, even surpassing the MDTF target of 35%. The HMIS now forms the basis
         for all reporting in all ten states and is used by all actors supporting the states.

      4. PDO Indicator IV: Long-lasting insecticide-treated malaria nets purchased
         and/or distributed: Target surpassed. The project was not intended to procure



                                              21
       bed nets which was planned and funded under the Global Fund. The objective of
       the project was to ensure the distribution of the bed nets for pregnant women and
       children under-five. During the project’s life, 287,234 long-lasting insecticide-
       treated malaria nets were distributed through the routine health service and the dry
       season campaign supported by the project. This met and exceeded target of
       189,378 LLINs procured /distributed set for UPHSD Phase II. Table 8 highlights
       the various achievements by indicator category.

PDO II: Strengthen key stewardship functions of the MOH, including monitoring
and evaluation.

54.   The project had three sub-components supporting this particular PDO. The three
subcomponents were: (i) Strengthening the coordination and management capacity of
MOH; (ii) Development of monitoring and evaluation capacity, including the
measurement of health sector performance; and (iii) Strengthening pharmaceutical
management, supply, and distribution system.

55.     Strengthening the coordination and management capacity of MOH:                The
coordination and management capacities of the Ministry of Health at the central and state
level were strengthened through the setting-up of a functional project Management Team
with the objective of coordinating and monitoring the delivery of health services not only
in the project supported states but throughout the country. Monthly coordination meetings
were conducted with the involvement of the MOH staff, lead agencies team, NGOs
providing services, the World Bank and other development partners. The purpose of these
meetings was to identify obstacles to the implementation of the project with a focus on
delivery of health services and to find appropriate solutions.

56.     The capacity of County Health Departments (CHDs) was strengthened through
better staffing, equipment (provision of internet connection, transport means), and
operating costs to carry out regular supervision. Within the overall context of
strengthening the MOH capacities, the project supported the provision of technical
expertise to the MOH to implement the following activities: (i) identification of strengths
and weaknesses of the MOH as it sought to oversee the management of the health system,
(ii) revision of the existing infrastructure needs and definition of new roles and
responsibilities which clarified lines of authority and decision making; (iii) reviewing and
updating of the Health Sector Policy and development of a 5 year Health Sector
Development Plan which was published in 2011. The project was instrumental in the
engagement of IFC/Health Initiative for Africa in South Sudan which looks at policy
frame work development and support for private sector in health. The table below
provides an example of the level of capacity strengthening of CHD in Upper Nile. (See
details in Annex 2).

57.     The project contributed to the development of a government concept note to
introduce PPPs in the health sector. It supported the conduct of two studies: one to assess
the existing legal framework and the other on the feasibility of an integrated
pharmaceutical supply chain through PPP. One of the ongoing challenges within capacity
building was availability of personnel to be trained or those with adequate skill to be
further developed. This is a larger challenge in the Northern regions and less so in Central
Equatoria.

58.      Development of monitoring and evaluation capacity, including the measurement
of health sector performance: The project supported the development of an M&E system
in the country. The MOH did not have any operational M&E system and the only
credible available data at the launch of the project was the report from the 2006
Household Survey. The project supported 2 population-based surveys, a health facility
survey, developed and implemented the routine HMIS with the introduction of the
District Health Management Information System. This has improved the reporting from
facilities. The project was instrumental in ensuring the availability of credible data which
has contributed to enhanced decision making and informed planning in the sector.

59.    Strengthening pharmaceutical management, supply, and distribution system: The
Umbrella Program for Health System Development was designated as the preferable
source of essential drugs procurement. Following this agreement, the project supported
the provision of drugs for the entire country. A total of US$ 38 million was used for
procurement of medicines and other pharmaceuticals out of which US$ 35.1 million was


                                                      23
invested in the procurement and distribution of drugs for more than 1200 health facilities
covering the needs of 10 million individuals. The Health Facility Survey (2011) and
subsequent surveys and supervision revealed that availability of drugs is comparable to
other countries with an established health system. Euro Health was also engaged for
capacity building and pharmaceutical management as per table below.

60.     Training: 6 Laboratory technicians were trained at Malakal Teaching Hospital
while 5 Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) laboratories were equipped and supplied. 76
Front line workers were trained in Maternal Neonatal Child Survival interventions and
referral to EmOC centres with over 4000 persons were reached in EmOC outreach
campaigns. The five EmOC centers have been functional since June 2012 and the
preliminary results (August-October 2012) show an increase of ANC attendance (994)
compared to the same period of 2011 (427). Major partners for this component outside
MOH and UPHSD were USAID, Great Lake University in Kisumu (Kenya),
Massachusetts General Hospital and UNFPA. Table below highlights the training
outcomes in Upper Nile State (See detail in Annex 2).

This level of training was conducted across all the States and in all the Counties that were
being supported by the project.

61.      Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOI)s: The project saw a progressive
improvement in the attainment of IOIs throughout the lifetime of the project.
Structured supervision with the use of supervisory check list was introduced. Health
facilities with at least 10 essential drugs exceeded the set target of 65%. The health
service has seen an increase in number of pregnant women who receive antenatal care at
health facilities and the target has been surpassed (102% achieved). Overall, outpatients’
visits per capita have also increased during the project exceeding the target by at least 20
percentage points. Especially noteworthy is the progress in health facilities with at least

 63.     Issues with data sources: A number of data sources are used to measure progress
 in this ICR. These include data generated through developed HMIS and District
 Management Information System, household and health facility surveys and the LQAS
 survey. It has to be appreciated that as part of improving data availability and utilization
 within the span of the project time, there will be limitations in the comparability of these
 data. Whereas HHS and HFS are mostly comparable over time due to uniform use of
 similar tools, LQAS can be used as an additional source on how well an intervention is
 doing over a given threshold. However, all survey methods are useful in defining how
 well interventions have been attained. It should also be pointed out that during project
 development some indicators were designated as percentages. For a project of two years
 duration, the issue of appropriate denominators becomes rather challenging in an
 environment where denominators might change as more accurate data and estimates
 become available.

 3.3 Efficiency
 64.     Rated Substantial for the reasons described below.

 1. Net present value: The Umbrella Program for Health System Development (UPHSD)
    Phase II financial investment for a total amount of US$71, 5 million was a small
    contribution compared to $100 million per annum coming into the South Sudan
    health sector during the period of project implementation. However, it was able to
    make a very significant difference in health services and delivery of care in the
    project States. The level of capacity strengthening in terms of human resources and
    infrastructure development was high. The States where the project was implemented
    showed improved delivery of service, policy coordination and increased coverage of
    high impact interventions.

 2. Cost effectiveness: The cost of delivery of health care through a system approach and
    strengthening of coordination was found to be cost effective. As explained in the
    economic analysis (annex 3), the cost per total DALYs averted is equal to USD 496.
    Taking the per capita GDP of South Sudan as USD 1546, the monetary value of
    DALYs averted is equal to USD 175,532,840. The present value of benefit is far


                                             26
   greater than the present value of the costs incurred. The effectiveness or cost benefit
   ratio of the project (56,365,286.47/175,532,840) is 0.32. Furthermore, close
   monitoring of project implementation enhanced efficiency and contributed to better
   harmonization with other donors in the sector thereby reducing duplication and
   ensuring effective use of resources.

3. Financial Rate of Return: The implementation of UPHSD Phase II was designed in
   the context of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery as
   the country transitioned from humanitarian delivery of health service. The financial
   rate of return in a post conflict situation where delivery of health services is done by
   an uncoordinated mix of NGOs is very minimal and might not provide value for
   money.       As the country grows, the availability of NGOs might become
   complementary rather than the mainstay for health delivery. Hence, the strengthening
   of capacity and improved coordination for the different players at different levels,
   national, State and County provides the opportunity for streamlining the
   developmental agenda and maximizing on the financial rate of return. In addition, the
   investment in delivery of the Basic Package of Health Services translates into high
   rate of return for children and pregnant women in the medium to the long term.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

65.     Rating: Satisfactory. Implementation of the MDTF UPHSD contributed greatly
to the success and strengthening of health service delivery in the project States. There
was substantive improvement in all the PDO indicators and Intermediate outcome
indicators. Evidence on the ground shows improved level of infrastructure, increased
number of staff developed as part of capacity strengthening and strengthened delivery of
the Basic Health Services Package. The development and strengthening of HMIS through
the DHMIS and supportive supervision has resulted in successful information
management. All these are indicative of good project performance. Therefore, in view of
substantial rating for relevance, substantial rating for attainment of PDO/Implementation
progress (efficacy), substantial rating for efficiency, the overall project outcome rating is
rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development:

66.    The project focused on equity and gender by making priority service delivery to
the most vulnerable through the delivery of the high impact interventions in the Basic
Health Services Package. High impact interventions were prioritized to maternal and
child survival thereby helping contribute to improving the very poor health indicators.
The ICR mission to the States PHCCs and PHCUs noted the satisfaction of the health
workers as regards the UPHSD, especially for supporting maternal health interventions
such as advocacy for health facility delivery, provision of ANC and the implementation
of community child campaigns for EPI. The availability of the UPHSD also provided the
much need operational costs that allowed the facilities to conduct community monitoring,
thereby taking health services as close to the people as possible. Morbidity reduction in


                                             27
the health of women and children contributes to reduction in poverty, as women’s
contribution to household income has been shown to be more towards social development
and poverty reduction including improvement of child survival interventions.

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67.     The MDTF UPHSD was designed as per recommendation of the JAM to
transition the country from delivery of health care through humanitarian support to
delivery of health care through a health system strengthening approach. Results from the
implementation of the UPHSD at central level have clearly shown the improved capacity
and strengthening of the MOH. The GoSS has gradually taken overall coordination of
health, and development policies and across its implementation units, increasing the
functionality and supervisory roles of MOH. This has helped strengthen coordination of
the health partnership at central level. The States are also leveraging the efforts of the
Central level in taking leadership. An example from Eastern Equatoria shows that all
partners and NGOs now have a consolidated monthly presentation that follows the work
plan of the State MOH. The partners contribute their quarterly achievements to MoH and
the Ministry then presents the overall report on behalf of all other stakeholders.

68.     The development of the HMIS and use of supervisory checklist has strengthened
the collection and use of information at all levels. Human resources for health, however,
remain a challenge. This is not due to the lack of capacity building, but rather as a
consequence of the long period of war which resulted in destruction of schools and the
opportunity for education in the general population. However, the project has mitigated
this situation through on the job training of CHW, county nurses, and traditional birth
attendants to support delivery at health facilities. Plans for roll out of higher training are
ongoing at Central and State levels. Those nurses, clinical officers and few doctors that
are available are continuously taken by NGOs who pay better salaries, leaving the MoH
with a shortage of appropriately qualified human capacities.

69.     It should be highlighted that the project was instrumental in moving the health
systems delivery in South Sudan closer to a systems approach. Following the war and
CPA, the level of infrastructure development and human resource capacity was
practically negligible. The development of the HMIS and DHIS, strengthening of county
health departments in the areas under the project, human resource capacity development
across all levels, and provision of commodities across the country all highlight the added
value that the project contributed to improving the level of service delivery in South
Sudan. Without the project, this level of development towards a system based health
system could not have been realized as the humanitarian mode of health delivery could
have continued. This is not to say the aim of developing health systems for South Sudan
has been reached, but rather to point to the fact that the project helped jump start the
process and now has to be supported by all stakeholders for success under the leadership
of the GoSS MOH.




                                             28
       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

70.    The following can be said to be the unintended positive outcomes:

1. That the success of any program requires appropriate capacities at all levels to ensure
   adequate stewardship, coordination and supervision especially where the country’s
   implementation of health service delivery is still reliant on NGOs.
2. That strengthening of polices leads to better coordination of implementing agents on
   the ground.
3. The government has agreed with donors and partners in health for comprehensive
   states support as opposed to piecemeal support by different NGOs in each State.

71.     A negative unintended outcome lies with the different NGOs who were formerly
supporting the MOH who may not fully support the enhanced coordination and strategy
direction shift from the humanitarian mode of operation to an increasingly confident
stewardship role from both the Central and State governments. There will be a need to
manage this more carefully to leverage resources and capacities available from this group
of stakeholders.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

72.     There was no beneficiary survey undertaken. However, during the ICR mission,
beneficiaries’ opinions were obtained as part of understanding the impact of the project
on the ground. Beneficiaries expressed a high level appreciation of the services being
offered in facilities. They considered that activities covering ANC and community
outreach were successful and that they should continue. They were especially pleased
with the availability of drugs during the project implementation period. Challenges
identified included lack of coordinated takeover between the new and the old Lead
Agencies as part of the agreement for overall states support. This resulted in inadequate
resources for operations and some shortages of drugs due to difficulties in distribution.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome:

73.    Rating: Substantial. The MDTF UPHSD was implemented in a very
challenging environment. Immediately post war, with minimal infrastructure, few and
inadequate human resources, poor access to facilities, continued high insecurity and a
highly expectant population. All these attributes rendered the implementation of a health
program in a system wide approach extremely challenging. However, the mitigation
measures that were put in place such as the renewal of contracts for lead implementing
agencies, and monitoring agents ensured that the project remained on track as planned. In
addition, the recruitment of consultants for financial management and procurement all
reduced the risk in dealing with financial arrangements and procurement processes using
Bank procedures. All these were part of lessons leant in implementing Phase I and
contributed to reducing the risk to development outcome in a post conflict environment.
However, the fact that the project still remained part of the broader system where these




                                           29
inadequacies were prevalent resulted in a high level of risk throughout the
implementation period.

74.     The results of this project have been satisfactory over the two years of its
implementation. However, sustainability of these results will depend on the continued
commitment of all partners and GOSS. The new arrangement of health service delivery
will need to take into account the lessons of both Phases I and II to ensure sustainability
of the system developmental approach. Indeed the new Bank supported project, the
Health Rapid Results Project, which is being implemented by the MOH in a similar
manner to the UMPHSD Phase II, will contribute to sustainability in Upper Nile and
Jonglei but this will need to be replicated across all other States if any meaningful impact
is to be attained. The Ministry of Health will continue to have personnel challenges and
as such it will still rely on external support; however, the Ministry will need to be in
charge of coordination and provision of overall States level guidance on policy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

75.     (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: There was no quality at
entry assessment. The design ensured extensive collaboration between the different
MDTF donors and Government. The project was designed within the framework of the
JAM recommendations and the Bank was tasked with administering the MDTF. The
recruitment of the Lead Agents ensured that the issues of low capacity at national and
state levels were addressed. In addition, the Lead Agents contributed to the transfer of
capacities through training and on the job support. The recruitment of financial
management and procurement specialists located in the Ministry of Health resulted in
timely implementation of activities and compliance with fiduciary requirements.

76.     (b) Quality of Supervision: The country had no substantive M&E capacity and
had only conducted one household survey in 2006. The supervisory role of the Bank was
carried out with the additional support of the Monitoring Agent Price Waterhouse
Coopers. The Bank contributed to the development of the M&E system and the
operationalization of the Health Management Information System and the strengthening
of the District Health Information System. Through the project, the Bank conducted
quarterly supervisory missions which fed into technical areas for improved
implementation of the project. The presence of the TTL who was stationed in Juba
strengthened this component. The Bank and MA were proactive and diligent in providing
supervision on the ground.

77.    Through the Bank supported supervision, the project was able to conduct two
household and facility based surveys and two lot quality assurance sampling surveys.
The development of the HMIS resulted in the strengthened district health management
system that contributed to a wealth of information at central level enhancing decision
making. Even though Government was involved in the planning and discussions in field




                                            30
supervisions, at times the M&E unit at the MOH was not fully involved in the actual
supervisory missions14.

78.     Fiduciary supervision was strengthened and supervision of the financial specialist
and the Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) in the MoH was enhanced by the
Monitoring Agent. There were no delays in reporting of Interim Financial Reports and
annual audits. All financial covenants were complied with. Safeguard monitoring was
carried out as per recommendations from the medical waste management framework. As
part of carrying out the recommendations, facilities renovated under the project had
incinerators installed to deal with medical waste disposal. In view of the efforts of the
Bank team, monitoring agent and support from MOH, Bank rating for Supervision is
Satisfactory.

79.     However, there were limited skills transferred due to unavailability of
appropriately trained staff in MOH. This is an issue that Government will need to take
up for the immediate short and medium term as it has the capacity to impact negatively
on sustainability. However, even with this challenge of inadequate skills transfer through
the Bank’s support, the performance of the available staff was greatly improved. Bank
Performance is rated Satisfactory.

80.     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Given the
satisfactory rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and satisfactory
rating for Bank supervision, including fiduciary aspects and safeguards, the overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

81.     (a) Government Performance: Rating: Satisfactory. A management team
within the GOSS-MOH played a key role in coordinating and tracking implementation of
the project’s activities. The MOH-GOSS continued to be the grant recipient. The GOSS
MOFEP had overall responsibility for procurement and financial management. Within
the MoH, the Executive Board which was the Project Steering Committee had overall
responsibility for program implementation. The Management Team collaborated with
the directorates to ensure the availability of necessary technical information and provided
appropriate logistical and technical support. In this regard, Government provided the
playing field for the implementation of the MDTF-UPHSD Phase II which included
coordination, and policy development. Quarterly coordinating meetings were held
between the management team and the MDTF UPHSD partners and these looked at
resource management and implementation. Review of outcomes fed into improving the
implementation on the ground.

82.    (b) Implementing Agency or Lead Agencies Performance is rated
Satisfactory. Lead Agents were responsible for implementing component two on the
expansion of delivery of basic health services. Initially, three agencies were recruited.

     . Comments from GOSS, MOH, Director- Monitoring and Evaluation.


                                                 31
However, the performance of one agency was not satisfactory to the MOH and was
replaced by the Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA). The two Lead Agencies, Norwegian
Peoples Aid (NPA) and IMA World Health were each responsible for two States: Upper
Nile and Jonglei for IMA, and Central and Eastern Equatoria for NPA. The Ministry of
Health pursued a two-track strategy, balancing development of core capacities of the
health system and immediate delivery of essential services to a significant proportion of
the population. The TOR of the two LAs were identical and reflected on GoSS's health
sector objectives that intended to: 1) develop core institutional capacities of the public
health administration; 2) implement a phased infrastructure and equipment investment
plan; 3) invest in human resources for health; 4) develop the pharmaceutical
management, supply, and distribution system; 5) expand the coverage of health service
delivery and support selected high-impact health interventions; and 6) strengthen
capacities to monitor and evaluate project results and sector performance. The Lead
Agents were able to work directly or through contracted NGOs. They conducted both
system health system related activities and the delivery of high impact interventions. The
summary below shows achievements in the various components.

1. Supply of pharmaceuticals :
      1. Medical supplies were procured and distributed to 47 hospitals; 250 primary
          health care centres (PHCCs); and 1000 primary health care units (PHCUs).
          Covering a period of 18 months and valued at US$ 24.3m.

2. Capacity building:
      1. 84 health facilities rehabilitated;
      2. 15 MoH and County Health Departments (CHDs) staff trained in Basic
         Primary Health Services (BPHS);
      3. CHDs equipped with furniture, EPI, data processing and communication
         equipment and transport means;
      4. PHCCs and PHCUs management committees formed and trained;
      5. Health Management Information System established for monitoring and
         reporting tools developed and used.

3. Basic package of health services:
      1. Provision of Basic Package of Health Services in four states, namely Central
          Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Upper Nile and Jonglei through contracted
          NGOs focusing in high impact interventions ( See detailed description in
          Annex 2)

4. Supply of ARVs to health facilities in South Sudan

83.    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. In view of the
level of effort of GOSS given the circumstances of South Sudan at the beginning of
Phase I in moving to a systems wide approach for the delivery of health, the coverage and
implementation success of the Lead Agents, the Borrower performance is rated
Satisfactory.




                                           32
6.       Lessons Learned

84.  The following are the lessons that can be drawn from the implementation of the
MDTF- UPHSD Phase II.

     1. Long term sustainability, overall stewardship and coordination: Sustainability of
        project gains requires both government commitment and partnership support to
        ensure that health systems are strengthened as the country moves from
        humanitarian service delivery to systems oriented approach. The new donor
        mechanism for working at the state level needs to be strengthened to mitigate the
        negative effects of change (lack of continuity). This has to have strong
        coordination from both Central and State governments to ensure government
        policy is articulated and systems development and capacity building meets the
        needs of the government. Policy direction and coordination from central level is
        critical for streamlined and uniform policy management. There is need for the
        central government to strengthen its role as the driver of policy at State level and
        the current examples of central level led monitoring and supportive supervisory
        roles should be strengthened.

     2. Scarcity of human resources, capacity building and skills transfer: In post
        conflict situations, challenges in human resources availability, skill set mix as
        well as challenges associated with implementation with scarce human resource
        capacity are inevitable; the use of partners to support government to deliver
        service may not support government develop its systems unless the Government
        provides strong leadership. However, it should be taken as an opportunity of
        continued strengthening of systems for sustained delivery of health service. The
        unavailability of appropriate qualified personnel in post conflict creates a need for
        a sustained effort by both Central and State governments to develop innovative
        policies that would attract capacity to underserved areas.

     3. Supply of Pharmaceuticals: Central distribution of pharmaceuticals in post
        conflict situations is as difficult as it is challenging. In South Sudan, given the
        poor infrastructure, poor road network and difficult geographical terrain,
        contracting out improved commodity availability in facilities helped create
        confidence in the population to seek services at facilities. This approach is
        especially useful for the immediate short to the medium term. However, for the
        long term, there is a strong need for a more robust distribution mechanism and
        strengthening of the logistics management information systems.

     4. Monitoring and Evaluation including Data Management: At the beginning of
        Phase II, there was little data available for use in decision making. The
        implementation of Phase II saw a number of surveys being conducted, such as
        South Sudan Household survey, Health Facility Surveys, and Lot Quality
        Assurance Sampling Surveys. These surveys contributed to improvement in
        overall availability of data for decision making. The development of HMIS and
        implementation of the DHIS helped strengthen overall information management



                                             33
         as evidenced by the number of facilities and counties reporting data back to
         central level by the end of the project. Hence, in post conflict situations, specific
         health surveys are a priority in helping provide the data required for immediate
         health decisions but should be taken as a complement to the overall strengthening
         of health information management.

      5. Challenges in sustaining a Health System Approach: Development of Health
         systems may not be the preferred approach for international aid agencies and
         NGOs working in a post conflict situation as results of such investments are
         mostly long term and not immediate. Hence, a project approach may be the
         preferred approach to show results. This requires a careful balance between
         strengthening the system and continuously improving the system over time. Both
         the Health Rapid Results Project and the new donor matrix should support the
         objectives of Health System Strengthening by ensuring that overall leadership,
         from both the Central and State governments continue to support critical
         components of the system.

7.        Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

85.      (a)     Grantee/Implementing Agencies:

      1. Government Comments can be summarized as follows: The MDTF-UPHSD was
         the core bearer of health systems development in health. It came at a time when
         all infrastructure was destroyed as a result of prolonged war with resultant poor
         development of all sectors especially so in health. Service delivery at the time
         was highly fragmented being delivered by local and international NGOs. The
         UPHSD provided government with the opportunity to bring order to the sector
         and transform from humanitarian based service delivery to a systems based
         delivery which was more sustainable and development oriented. Despite the
         numerous challenges on the ground (inadequate infrastructure, poor human
         resource base, lack of M&E capacity, inadequate drug supply, poor road network
         and above all persistent insecurities), the project was able to step up and provide
         valuable support in all these areas. Under the new Project, the Government felt
         that renewed attention needs to be given to capacity building to ensure the long-
         term sustainability of health sector investments in the country.

      2. Combined Comments from NPA and IMA: The two lead agencies felt that the
         MDTF - UPHSD was a very good vehicle to promote health system development.
         They observed that the project was able to meet both short term goals
         (implementation of BPHS) and medium to long term goals of strengthening the
         MoH at both central and State levels. The development of County Health
         Department and the strengthening of the HMIS, and improved supply of
         pharmaceutical at facilities were really remarkable.

86.      (b)     Comments from Co-financiers/Donors

      1. DFID: Noted that there was need to look at the MDTF as a comprehensive
         project and not to focus on health only. They noted that the procurement of
         pharmaceuticals was well done and contributed to increasing the availability of
         essential drugs in the facilities. The issue of systems versus humanitarian support
         in the current environment was challenging as most parts of the country still need
         direct NGO interventions.

      2. WHO: highlighted the challenges associated with developing sustainable health
         service delivery in post conflict environment associated with scarcity of human
         personnel, adverse terrain and impassible roads. In addition, WHO noted the
         continued security issues in the country which impacted on sustained system
         delivery.

      3. UNICEF: Noted the challenges facing South Sudan described a two pronged
         dichotomy. One of inadequate human resources and the other of increased
         decentralization. However, UNICEF noted that the MDTF was instrumental in
         supporting the development of systems. UNICEF also noted the need for both the
         Bank and itself to be more engaged in issues of comparative advantage such as
         nutrition.

      4. Comments from Joint Donor Coordinating Agency: The coordinator of Donor Aid
         expressed her appreciation of the MDTF –UPHSD. The UPHSD was the only
         health initiative that was helping South Sudan develop health systems and very
         vital in assisting the Government transit from humanitarian service delivery to
         System wide service delivery. The coordinator noted the level of capacity
         building at development levels and the coordination policies that MoH was
         advocating as part of the project outcomes.

87.      (c)     Other partners and stakeholders

88.    None.       No comments received. However, comments incorporated from
discussion with Lead implementing agent. Lead agents subcontracted some of the work
to NGOs and these were under direct supervision of the LA to ensure TOR were
implemented a in a timely manner.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The overall goal of the BPHS project was to assist the State Ministry of Health in
delivering the Basic Package of Health Services through county health departments
(CHDs) and health facilities (HFs) to the population of four states supported by the
project while strengthening the overall network of health services (HSS). To achieve this
goal, the project aimed to substantially improve the quality, accessibility, and
sustainability of the selected basic preventive and curative services, and to reinforce the
capacity of local health personnel in planning, coordinating, and managing primary
health care activities. The discussion for this section will be done by components and
will aim at highlighting the implementation of each component taking into account the
situation on the ground.

COMPONENT 1: DELIVERY OF CORE HEALTH SYSTEM

2.      This was implemented at National and State levels. The component was designed
to strengthen governance/coordination/management, monitoring and evaluation (Health
Management Information System - HMIS) and also contribute to human resource
capacity building. As infrastructure was utterly destroyed during the course of the war,
one of the major responsibilities of the project was to contribute to infrastructure
rehabilitation and equipping of facilities providing the BPHS.

3.      At national level, staff capacity building was strengthened through the recruitment
of technical specialists in financial and procurement management. These officers were
stationed in the MoH and worked as part of the MOH team providing on the ground
supports and direct knowledge transfer were feasible. Notable success in this area was
achieved; 1). The development of policies and establishment of coordinating meeting
between MOH and the partners, the renovation of buildings to accommodate the MoH,
capacity building in form of the strengthening of supervisory roles from the MoH.
However, this remained challenging as the States felt that Central level was not doing a
lot to ensure coordinated actions and implementation of polices at State level. The
reporting to central level from the States was also increased (table on indicators of
success). Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation through the implementation of surveys
was strengthened via contracting of LATH. LATH worked with GOSS in developing
and conducting the survey. However, due to reasons already alluded to, the level of
knowledge transfer and actual capacity building in implementing LQAS survey was
minimal.

4.      At State level, these activities were part of the overall TOR for the LA. The LA
or contracted NGO provided capacity building and coordinating roles were even more
pronounced as this is where actual implementation was done. The States MoH offices
were all renovated and the country health departments (CHD) under the four States were
all strengthened in capacity building, office renovation and equipment provision as well
as all counties were strengthened in HMIS and collected data from PHCC and PHCU and
aggregated at CHD level. LAs were able to partner with Health Information System
Program (HISP) to support HMIS roll out. Across All States, HMIS roll out can be said


                                            37
    to have been significantly developed and rolled out as exemplified by end of project
    surveys which show at least 60% of facilities reporting on the HMIS. As part of
    strengthened supervision, the GOSS developed the integrated supervisory checklist which
    has become a very useful tool for supervision as well as on the job training. This has
    been rolled out from national to State, to CHD to PHCC and PHCU (See table on
    capacity strengthening)

    (GoSS) and include access to Health Care, family planning and services, antenatal care,
    intra-partum Care, essential newborn care services, immunization, clinic IMCI,
    Community -IMCI, malaria treatment and Prevention, TB detection, HIV/AIDS and

Package of Health Services delivery had two objectives namely; 1). Improving the
delivery of the basic package of health services (BPHS), especially for the poor and
under –served communities with initial focus on the high impact health interventions; as
part of objective one of the BPHS, facility renovation and reconstruction was a critical
component in the delivery of BPHS. As earlier stated, the overall infrastructure within
the States was destroyed or was very inadequate quality. Hence, renovations and
reconstruction become vital to effectively deliver services.2). Strengthening key
stewardship functions of the Ministry of Health (MOH) at state, county, health facility
and community levels, with an initial focus on coordination of BPHS activities,
supervision of PHC, monitoring and evaluation, and strengthening the technical
knowledge of the health workers.

6.      This component was delivered by the two Lead Agencies; IMA World Health and
NPA. The LA instituted the use of incentives for performance in the implementation of
the BPHS as well as subcontracted to NGO for effective implementation in some
counties. The agencies worked closely with GoSS-MOH and the four States under the
project, i.e. State Ministry of Health (SMOH), local primary health care clinics (PHCCs)
and primary health care units (PHCUs), and various non-government organizations
(NGOs) to achieve project goals. The results are drawn from the 2011 LQAS and relate
them to the project areas. However it should be noted that the LQAS was not specific for
the four states but rather country wide and hence the results will highlight the progress
being made from almost nothing at the time of the CPA and the JAM. The details of
achievements by component are described below.

7.     Objective 1: Improving the delivery of the basic package of health services
(BPHS), especially for the poor and under –served communities with initial focus on the
high impact health interventions;

8.      Maternal Health: South Sudan has one of the highest Maternal Mortality Rates
(MMR) in the World, estimated at 2054/100,000 live births15. Although close to 46.7%16
of pregnant women attend at least one ANC visit, only 14.7% of deliveries are attended
by skilled health professionals. Institutional deliveries account for just 12.3% of births,
while the contraceptive prevalence rate is 4.7%. The caesarean section rate, a good
indicator of access to Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric & Neonatal Care (CEmONC),
is only 0.5%17 of the population served in the three teaching hospitals (Juba, Malakal and
Wau).

9.     Most of the deliveries are predominantly still done at home (78.7%) compared to
16.2 % of institutional deliveries. Skilled attendants at deliveries account for only 22.1%.
Given the proportion of ANC attendance, malaria prevention in pregnant women for two
doses of SP remains low at 23.7%.

10.     Contraception Prevalence Rate: This remains low but is well over the project
target of 1.5. The unmet need for contraception is clearly very high.

11.     Child Health: Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Under-five Mortality Rate (UMR)
at onset were high at 102 per 1000 live births and 135 per 1000 live births, respectively.
The EPI program had 13.8% of children less than 12 months having received DPT318 and
just 1.8% children under-five years of age fully immunized. 22.7%19 of children with
diarrhea received oral rehydration therapy and only 35.1% of children with suspected
pneumonia are taken to an appropriate healthcare provider or health facility.

The LQAS results show low coverage in all EPI indicators..

12.         Malaria: Malaria accounts for almost a quarter (24.7%)20 of all diagnoses
reported by health facilities in South Sudan. The 2009 South Sudan Malaria Indicator
Survey (SSMIS) showed that 35% of children below 5 years had suffered from a fever
within the two weeks preceding the survey and 12% of children with fever were treated
with an appropriate anti-malarial medicine within 24 hours of the onset of fever. 60%21 of
households have one or more insecticide-treated nets.

13.    As can be seen the house hold coverage of at least one net is lower that the project
coverage of 60% with the proportion of children under five sleeping under the net at
31.2%. Given that malaria accounts for at least 24% of all childhood morbidity; there is
clearly a great need to mitigate this challenging I coverage. However, this is a great
improvement from near zero at the beginning of the project..

14.    Neglected Tropical Diseases: Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are endemic
in South Sudan and account for a considerable proportion of the disease burden. The
major NTDs include leishmaniasis, trypanosomaisis, onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis.

15.      Tuberculosis: The annual incidence of all forms of TB is estimated at 140 per
100,000 population (79/100,000 are smear positive cases), while TB specific mortality is
estimated at 65 per 100,000 population. The treatment success rate for smear positive
pulmonary TB was 79% in 2008.

16.     HIV/AIDS Prevalence: The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Sudan is
estimated at 3%22, with the epidemic considered to be generalized, albeit some areas are
described as hot spots. There are 17 HIV treatment centers in South Sudan taking care of
about 8,000 clients (about 5% are children) with close to 2,500 on Antiretroviral Therapy
(ART). The HIV program has established 55 Prevention of Mother to Child
Transmission (PMTCT) and over 105 HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) sites that are
integrated into existing health care structures.

Figure 9: HIV indicators LQAS health survey




17.      Even though the prevalence of HIV might be described as low, the actually
knowledge on HIV for prevention and treatment countrywide is low. There is a huge
need to support overall prevention methods to not only increase knowledge awareness but
also to improve the rate of voluntary testing and counseling.

18.     Objective 2: Strengthening key stewardship functions of the Ministry of Health
(MOH) at state, county, health facility and community levels, with an initial focus on
coordination of BPHS activities, supervision of PHC, monitoring and evaluation, and
strengthening the technical knowledge of the health workers.

19.    Brief Summary on the Implementation and achievements of BPHS by NPA:
The BPHS project was implemented in Eastern Equatoria state in January 2009. The
contract for the implementation of the project was awarded to HLSP, who were the lead
agency (LA). However, the contract initially awarded to HLSP was terminated after two
(2) years of the project implementation, because the lead agency did not have a
competent team of permanent staff to implement the project. Through single sourcing,
NPA was mandated to take over in February 2011.

20.   Targets and achievements: From February 2011 to May 2012, NPA was able to
accomplish the activities below:

Brief Summary on the Implementation and achievements of BPHS by IMA World
Health:

23.     From 2008 to 2012, IMA World Health served as the lead agency (LA) BPHS in
both Upper Nile and Jonglei States, South Sudan’s two largest states. The original three-
year timeframe (January 2009 to December 2011) was extended recognition of initial
funding delays and other challenges, with activities ultimately extended through
December 2012. BPHS project was to assist the State Ministry of Health in delivering
the Basic Package of Health Services through county health departments (CHDs) and
health facilities (HFs) to the population through improving the quality, accessibility, and
sustainability of the selected basic preventive and curative services, and to reinforce the
capacity of local health personnel in planning, coordinating, and managing primary
health care activities. IMA World Health worked closely with GoSS-MOH, the State
Ministry of Health (SMOH), local primary health care clinics (PHCCs) and primary
health care units (PHCUs), and various non-government organizations (NGOs) to achieve
project goals.
 
24.      Key successes included:

      1. Significant capacity building of the County Health Departments through continual
         training and engagement, provision of essential equipment and supplies, technical
         assistance, and more
      2. Introduction of Performance-Based Contracting, which incentivized health
         workers and CHD staff to reduce staff turnover and improve timely reporting
      3. Implementation of successful, multi-focal Dry Season Campaigns, which in 2012
         alone administered over 400,000 vaccines in both states
      4. Establishment and support of a Statewide HMIS System with one of the best
         reporting records in the country.

         25.      Monitoring and Evaluation: HMIS was introduced and the lead agencies ware
         responsible to supported by LATH and Boston Massachusetts group in addition. To
         overcome challenges, pay incentives for reporting were worked into the project plan to
         promote timely and accurate data collection. HMIS officers for at state level were
         brought on board strengthen the HMIS at the State level. Thanks to these solutions, the
         project noticed considerable improvement in reporting coverage from CHDs and health
         facilities. The project provided laptops, DHIS and antivirus software, flash drives, and
         other essential equipment necessary for successful and timely reporting the project
         introduced Introducing the “MOH Priority Indicator List? for use by all CHDs and
         facilities. This was a single form covering all health facility information, with World
         Bank reporting requirements included.

26.      A progressive improvement of reporting over time is seen as is the number of
facilities reporting supervisory visits at 83%. Please take note that the two sets of data
one in the results framework and the other in the LQAS survey are not comparable as one
is through HMIS and the other through sample based survey. However both do indicate
increased facility data reporting.

27.     Drugs and Pharmaceutical Management: The project was the principle vehicle
for the procurement of all medicines and other pharmaceutical products. A total sum of
US$ 38 million was used for medicines. The project also supported the distribution from

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Two methods are commonly used to measure the financial impact of interventions
in the health sector. These are the cost effectiveness (cost benefit ratio) and the cost
benefit analysis methods. These methods require the descriptions of i) the baseline
scenario or the without (before intervention) case, ii) treatments or interventions which
could be single or multiple, iii) costs of interventions, iv) the health benefits attributed to
treatments, v) comparisons between costs and benefits after proper discounting has been
made (these are usually done either by simply looking at the ratio of costs/benefits in the
case of cost effectiveness or by calculating the cash flows, net present values (NPV)and
the internal rate of return (IRR) in the case of cost benefit analysis).

2.       While the estimation of cost of intervention is relatively easy to get (from project)
and discount overtime, the estimation of the benefits of intervention has been challenging.
Despite the challenges, the most common approach is the use of “disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) averted due to intervention. The DALY extends the concept of potential
years of life lost due to premature death (PYLL) to include equivalent years of healthy
life lost by virtue of being in states other than good health.

3.     Following Murray and Lopez (1996) total DALYs for each case-age-sex group

4.      Where, N is the number of deaths, C is the age-weighting correction constant, r is
the discount rate, B is the parameter from the age weighting function, a is the age of onset,
L is the duration of disability or time lost due to premature mortality, I is the number of
incident cases in the reference year, DW is the disability weight and K is the parameter
which specifies whether age-weighting is specified (K=1) or not specified (K=0).

5.      To analyze the DALYs averted due to the interventions namely: birth at facility,
child immunization, provision of insecticide nets, antenatal cares and outpatient cares, the
following assumptions are made:

     1) The discount rate for DALYs equals to 0.03 based on the Global Burden of
        Disease (GBD) standard value, the age-weighting correction constant equals to
        0.1658 based on GBD value, the parameter from the age weighting function
        equals 0.04 based on GBD value, and financial discount rate is 15%.




                                                                 51
   2) A woman dying during her lifetime from pregnancy related causes in South
      Sudan is 2054 per 100,000 births (2.05%) according to UNDP report. We assume
      that giving birth at facility reduces maternal mortality to 500 per 100,000 births
      (0.5 %). According to Cormetto et al. (2010) there are 250 deaths per 1000 live
      births (25 %) in South Sudan. We assume that birth at facility will reduce infant
      mortality to 50 deaths per 1000 (5 %).
   3) We assume that child immunization will reduce child mortality by 75%.
   4) Provision of insecticide nets avert around 50% of malaria cases (WHO).
      Greenwood (1987) identified malaria as the probable cause of 4% of infant deaths
      and 25% of deaths in children aged 1 to 4 years in West Africa. We assume that
      malaria is responsible for 20 % of infant deaths in South Sudan. Thus, using nets
      will reduce infant mortality by 50% of 20% which is (10%).
   5) We assume that antenatal care reduces maternal mortality from 2.05 % to 1 %.
      For outpatients, incidence case is assumed to be equivalent to the number of
      outpatients who received treatment from this project. We also assume that
      treatment given to outpatients reduces DW from 0.9 to 0.3.
   6) The average age of women delivering at birth facility and who get antenatal care
      are assumed to be 30 years (median of 15-45 years), children immunized 6 years
      (average of 0 and 12), and average age of outpatients as 25 years. Benefits from
      insecticide nets were calculated only for children.
   7) The life expectancy in South Sudan is taken as 49 years and per capita GDP as
      USD 1546.

6.     Tables 1 to 5 give the estimated values of DALYs averted based on equations (3)
and (4) above for each interventions. In tables from 1-5, baseline is the without
intervention scenario and new is the with intervention scenario. The values of baseline
scenario have been given to the new scenario until 6/25/2012 as the data for the new
scenarios are not available except for the year 12/26/2012.

7.      Table 6 presents the comparisons of costs and benefits of the project. The total
DALYs averted through all of the interventions is 113540. The cost per total DALYs
averted is equal to USD 496. Taking the per capita GDP of South Sudan as USD 1546,
the monetary value of DALYs averted is equal to USD 175,532,840. The present value
of benefit is far greater than the present value of the costs incurred showing that the
project is profitable. The effectiveness or cost benefit ratio of the project
(56,365,286.47/175,532,840) is 0.32, which means that for every 0.32 dollar invested, the
health benefit equal one dollar.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR

1.      Country Context: The Republic of South Sudan separated from Sudan after a
protracted liberation war lasting from 1955 to 2005. The Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) ended the war and ushered in the transition to the new Republic of
South Sudan (RSS) on 9 July 2011. Following the CPA, a Multi-donor Trust Fund for
Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS) was established with the contribution of US$718million by
donors and US $178 million by Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS)) to finance 18
projects in various sectors. The World Bank managed the MDTF-SS under an Oversight
Committee (OC). This collaboration manifested itself in the design and implementation
of the Umbrella Program of Health System Development (UPHSD). As part of the Multi-
donor Trust Fund for South Sudan (MDTF-SS), the UPHSD (TF056369) was
implemented in two phases between 2007 and 2012 in recognition, by GoSS and its
donor partners, of the need to tackle the deplorable health situation in South Sudan which
urgently needed improvement. The liberation war had destroyed basic infrastructure in all
sectors and depleted the country of the majority of its already limited number of trained
health personnel. The GoSS opted for a two pronged approach which it considered
necessary for building a responsive and efficient health system, while in the short-term
improving access to basic services, especially among rural poor communities. This
approach was to tackle the country’s priority care needs, and begin to find solutions to
systems-related health problems: a health infrastructure in ruins, incalculable loss of
human lives, displacement of over four million people, acute shortage of modern
medicines and other medical supplies, uncoordinated and sporadic emergency responses).
These sector problems were aggravated by the complete lack of communications network,
frequent floods and droughts and continuous internal civil armed conflicts.

2.      Relevance and coherence of design with GoSS’ health sector priorities:
Emerging from the liberation war, MoH’s very limited sector leadership engaged donor
support to tackle pressing constraints to basic health care delivery and sector organization
based on GoSS’s Health sector Policy for 2007-2011. Taking advantage of strong donor
support through the MDTF-SS, which had already funded a first Phase of UPHDS, the
GoSS sought donor support to continue and sustain progress achieved under Phase I,
through the funding of UPHSD Phase II. The activities that were programmed included:
(i) the establishment of the basic infrastructure for MoH of the Government of South
Sudan and its state MoHs (provision of office equipment, vehicles, and V-SATs); (ii) the
improvement of sector coordination through the establishment of the joint review system
between Government and state MoHs (Government of Southern Sudan Health
Assembly); (iii) the effective use of technical assistance in the area of public health,
monitoring and evaluation, health facilities mapping, planning, financial management,
procurement, and pharmaceuticals management; (iv) the procurement and distribution of
an 18 months’ supply of essential drugs; (v) the financing of two emergency distributions
of the drugs down to counties; (vi) tackling serious shortage of properly trained personnel
through the development of training schools and pre-service training for middle cadre
staff including nurses and midwives; (vii) the conduct of campaigns to distribute high-
impact interventions such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), Vitamin A,
ORT and Zinc to Warrap, Jonglei, and Western Bar-al Ghazal states; and (viii) the



                                            56
mobilization of three lead agencies to deliver the GoSS’ Basic Package of Health
Services (BPHS) in Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria, and Eastern Equatoria states.

3.      The BPHS, revised in January 2009 through a consultative process, defined and
guided the selection of interventions for disease prevention and health promotion, facility
rehabilitation and upgrading of curative services already initiated under UPHSD Phase I.
The package prioritized and funded activities addressing pressing health problems
through an integrated response which made services accessible at appropriate levels of
care at affordable cost24. The completion of renovation work started under Phase I offered
a window of opportunity for developing and institutionalization of a health system which
was responsive to major diseases afflicting South Sudan’s population Support in the
health sector from NGOs since the liberation war years, has been uncoordinated and
limited in geographical coverage. Most of it was emergency health assistance. Under
UPHSD Phase I, MoH had set out to harness such NGO efforts under contracted lead
agency (LA) NGOs to assist in the delivery of South Sudan’s PBHS in the various States.
These LAs were to support sector officials of SMoH and County Health Departments
(CHDs) in the management of essential health care services. Health sector tasks out-
sourced to NGOs in 2009 included the training of field staff on supportive supervision,
the organization of CHDs, streamlining of jobs and responsibilities, as well as building
the capacities of service providers in health facilities.

4.      The LAs were to contribute in the development and implementation of new
technical guidelines and standard treatment norms; the management of county-level
health facilities and preventive services; the organization of communities for promotional
services; the execution of monitoring and evaluation tasks; and the preparation of reports
on the performance of PBHS and related health services. These activities were meant to
be a follow-up to work completed or initiated under UPHSD I, especially those tackling
maternal and child health problems. These activities required refocusing rural first-level
referral services to successfully deal with high mortality and high morbidity often caused
by frequent epidemics, seasonal droughts succeeded by floods, tropical communicable
diseases, and frequent traumas. Out-sourced tasks were meant to help MoH build modern
communications channels for rapid monitoring and evaluation of the sector program.

      A. UPHSD Phase II’s Original Objectives, design, implementation, and
         operational experience:

5.      Original Objectives: The specific objectives for UPHSD Phase II were to
support actions by the GoSS to: (i) improve the delivery of a basic package of health
services (BPHS) in four States (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Eastern
Equatoria), and; (ii) strengthen key stewardship functions of the MoH, including
monitoring.

                                            57
6.     To reach these objectives, the Program executed actions at all levels of the health
care system which contributed to: (i) increased access to basic health services and health
promotion; (ii) strengthening human resources in the health sector; (iii) expanding the
pharmaceutical and medical equipment supply chains; (iv) strengthening the health
management system, and; (v) rendering fully functional the MoH’s HMIS developed
under UPHSD Phases I and II.

Key indicators:

7.         Specifically, the programme sought to raise the number of children under 12
months who received DPT3 25 vaccination from baseline 34,286 (2009) to target of
85,220 by close of Program; (b) those of same age who received measles vaccination rose
from 54,553 in 2009 to 104,158 by program end. The programme sought to raise the
percentage of deliveries in a health facility attended by a trained staff from 15% in 2009
to 25% by program end. On the monitoring of services performance, the Programme
sought to raise the percentage of health facilities submitting new MHIS monthly reports
within one month of each reporting month for CHDs from 5.0% in 2010 to 55.0%;
maintain outpatient visits per capita per year for children under five at 0.2%, by close of
Program The Program set the target of ensuring that the percentage of each PHCU with
one male and one female trained health worker (CHW or Higher) rose from 11% in 2009
to 59% by end of Program. To capture improvements in essential drugs supply to health
facilities, the MoH sought to raise the percentage of facilities having 10 essential drugs at
time of supervision from 5.0% (2009) to 70.0% by end of Program. On reproductive
health, the Program expected percentage of new acceptors of modern contraceptive
methods to stay at 1.0% all through the Program duration and for the number of pregnant
women receiving ANC to rise from 16,889 (2009) to 75,751 by program end.

       B. Assessment of outcome of UPHSD II against agreed Objectives:

8.      Achievement of Objectives and Outcomes: The programme was to achieve set
objectives and outcomes through the implementation of the two components presented
above. The Programme made satisfactory progress towards target values agreed upon as
key development outcomes.

9.     Intermediate indicators monitored through the Programme are presented below
and indicate general progress achieved through the Programme. The HMIS reporting rose
from 5% of reporting health facilities in 2010 to 65% by close of programme on
30/12/2012.

   C. Government’s performance during preparation of UPHSD Phase II:

10.     The preparation of UPHSD II reflected the focus of the Republic of South
Sudan’s Health Sector Development Plan in five program areas: (i) increasing access to
basic health services and health promotion; (ii) strengthening human resources in the
health sector; (iii) expanding the pharmaceutical and medical equipment supply chains;
(iv) strengthening the health management system, and; (v) strengthening provision of
HIV and AIDS services integrating these in programme content and into MoH’s new
MHIS.

 11.   The new Southern Sudanese health sector managers and officials, a majority of
whom were unfamiliar with working with the World Bank, initially expressed
reservations about working with the World Bank because of lack of familiarity with WB
procedures. This initial constraint was resolved by extensive dialogue with the Task
Team that supported MoH during UPHSD Phase I. This GoSS/WB sector dialogue led by
MoH would have to be intensified and all donors active in the sector would have to
support it to facilitate South Sudan’s long road to health system development backed by
clearly articulated strategic and priority choices and by implementable sector
programmes.

12.     The MoH with the help of the Task Team assessed risks and took measures
to mitigate them. The MoH was very conscious of the risk of failure to successfully
implement Phase II of UPHSD. Although it had extended Technical Assistance (TA)
contracts from Phase I to help its central, State and County level institutions, there was
always the risk that implementation of Phase II would be hindered by MDTF-SS failure
to mobilize the total amount of funding agreed upon. The possibility that GoSS would not
have its own funds to finance any such shortfall became very real during Referendum-
related conflicts with the Sudan that fueled armed conflicts and extended boundary
disputes between the two countries. These hostilities contributed to drying up South
Sudan’s income from oil exports and caused sharp declines in GoSS’ contribution to
UPHSD thereby forcing GoSS into a prolonged period of drastic budgetary cuts. These
cuts disrupted input/output to outcome linkages because MoH’s recurrent and investment
budgets suffered major cuts. Through its sustained dialogue with the WB backed by the
OC, additional financing from IDA amounting to US $8.5 million enabled MoH to
complete Programme execution satisfactorily, meeting virtually all outcome targets.
Another constraint the MoH had to deal with was poor transport infrastructure in the four
States covered by UPHSD Phase II. This rendered the implementation of BPHS, a very
high priority under Phase II operations, a very difficult task. This constraint persists even
when UPHSD Phase II supplied new vehicles and other forms of transportation. Bad
roads raised the costs of vehicle maintenance and depreciation factors that raise the unit
costs of health service delivery in all communities in South Sudan.

 13.    Government commitment to the Programme remained strong throughout
implementation in spite of the political volatile period during which critical activities
were carried out. Events which constrained implementation included the following: (i)
activities surrounding the conduct of the Referendum; (ii) the destabilizing effect of



                                             59
armed conflict with Northern Sudan preceding and immediately after independence of the
Republic of South Sudan; (iii) incidences of isolated internal armed conflicts after
independence, and; (iv) the shut off of oil exports which deprived GoSS of the only
source of Government revenue. These events adversely affected the GoSS’s
implementation oversight and financial support. The MDTF-SS’s Financial Management
Unit (PFMU) at the MoFEP performed satisfactorily throughout implementation limiting
delays in payments to MoH Departments and implementing agencies to acceptable levels.
Ongoing processes of building the capacity of the MoH Administration and Finance
Department have been undermined by an acute shortage of candidates with relevant
and/or required qualifications and by the rapid turnover of staff recruited under the
Program. Senior Managers and Officials of the MoH viewed the design of UPHSD II as
novel given the limited duration of MoH’s learning and doing experience within UPHSD
Phase I. The oversight roles of OC and the WB Country Manager’s role made the
preparation of UPHSD II a seamless transition from Phase I to Phase II. The preparation
process was basically a health discussion between the World Bank and GoSS/MoH on
what progress had been achieved and what activities needed sustaining as the partnership
moves forward. Many of the issues surrounding Phase II were already widely discussed
under Phase I during WB supervision missions and during other sector meetings with
donors and stakeholders.

 14.    Implementation experience of MoH Staff: The change in WB Team leadership
during the preparation of UPHSD Phase I was very opportune. It quickly built Bank/MoH
credibility and helped mobilize MDTF-SS for the health sector. The fruits of that
partnership continued during Phase II leading programme completion and full
disbursement backed by satisfactory documentation of outputs, outcomes and impact
results achieved. Most of the studies carried out during implementation resulted from the
dialogue, support and close collaboration between MoH and the Bank’s preparation Task
Team. MoH officials were introduced to a new team approach to sector analysis,
techniques for ranking priorities and interventions, building and sustaining partnerships
and instituting evidence-based performance evaluation and accountability through
carefully crafted roles, responsibilities and accountabilities.

15.     Health systems strengthening under UPHSD Phase II included capacity building
of the skills of health Sector Managers and technical staff in procurement, financial
management and monitoring and evaluation and supportive supervision. New terms of
reference in contracts of Consultants and Agencies hired during Phase I included the
design of norms and protocols for service delivery, as a strategy to standardize the use of
TA to build sustainability in health systems management. It was not evident that there
was a meeting of minds as to how outsourcing was to be sequenced along with measures
to build sector capacity, as contracted out tasks are gradually transferred to newly trained
health sector officials who will be responsible for procurement, financial management
and structured service delivery supervision. The start of implementation of UPHSD II
saw a culture of accountability taking root in the health sector.

16.     The performance of the MoH as Implementing Agency for UPHSD II was
satisfactory. It accorded high level of engagement in carrying out activities designed to



                                            60
build the Ministry’s capacity for executing sector stewardship functions implemented
with support from international institutions and agencies hired under the Programme.
Technically, MoH’s focus on expanding the delivery of its BPHS was sustained and
inputs (essential drugs, medical supplies, office equipment; various means of
transportation for CHDs, supervision resources to SMoH and engagement of LAs)
facilitated improvements in services as documented by key intermediate and outcome
indicators. Strong commitment by MoH and SMoHs in the process of facility restoration
and/or reconstruction (PHCC, PHCUs and CHDs) and in the installation of V-SAT
internet communications systems in CHDs, upgraded the service delivery environment.

17.     The MoH sustained productive collaboration with LAs, UN and bilateral
Agencies, local stakeholders and SMoHs which contributed to the studies, designs and
introduction of new management tools, especially HMIS, LQAs and QSC, currently
instruments for strengthening performance evaluation throughout the health sector. The
Ministry, through its decentralized structures, supplied all health facilities in South Sudan
with kits of essential drugs for delivery of its BPHS and thereby delivered better quality
health care, especially among rural communities. The performance of MoH was
satisfactory when assessed against its ability to learn and adjust to new evidence.

18.    The MoH continued the conduct of sector studies and analysis all through
implementation. In spite of misgivings by some senior sector leaders, the Ministry
embraced WB proposed outsourcing of the delivery of the PBHS. The budget crisis in
2011 dampened the level of commitment, but it is likely to rise to initial levels as
revenues from oil exports enable the GoSS meet its budget commitments.

19.    Risk assessment and challenges to successful implementation were candidly
reviewed by the GoSS preparation Team supported by the WB’s Task Team. This fruitful
working relationship between the two teams strengthened the collaborative design of the
Programme. This trust gradually replaced original senior GoSS officials’ skepticism
about what they perceived, with some justification, as excessive WB bureaucracy,
complicated by lengthy procurement procedures and conditionality. Measures taken by
the Task Team and the MoH to mitigate these risks were appropriate and were designed
to start capacity building activities right from effectiveness. The clarity of the
programme’s results framework solidified MoH’s comprehension of measures to mitigate
perceived substantial risks.

20.     Other Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes: There were a whole
range of risk factors that could have derailed the implementation of UPHSD Phase II.
Internal political risks persisted even after independence in 2011. MoH and its partners
would have to continue managing these as national efforts to reduce and eliminate these
types of risks continue. The Republic of South Sudan, as a young nation coming out of a
protracted war, does not yet have a viable supply system for a broad range of goods and
services. The nascent private sector and civil society organizations lack established
business practices, accounting and financial records keeping, and all these took their toll
during implementation. Donors supporting MoH program would have to recognize and




                                             61
take into account the fact that sector costs would remain relatively high until new and
reliable supply routes are established.

21.     Mitigating Implementation Risks: An acute shortage of trained doctors, nurses
and other health technicians would remain a major sector constraint to programme
implementation for several years to come. Cognizant of this constraint, the MoH
amended and extended contracts of Lead Agencies hired under Phase I to deliver BPHS
equitably to all communities in UPHSD Phase II areas. At the start of implementation,
MoH sought WB assistance for the procurement and distribution of essential drugs even
before it had determined exact needs of each State or County. Managing the supply chain
turned out to be difficult, even with pre-package kits, and in some areas drugs expired
soon after delivery at rural health facilities with limited or no capacity for correctly
disposing of expired stocks. Storage and stock management of medicines and other
medical supplies were inadequate, especially in facilities located in geographically
inaccessible areas.

22..   Contracting out service delivery functions to LAs was convenient as it reduced
direct management responsibilities by a Ministry with limited capacity, embarking on
decentralized sector management and service delivery requiring close supervision with
few qualified personnel. The LAs served as partners in on-the-job training and for testing
treatment protocols and norms, M&E framework and supervision check lists developed
by MoH. The use of LAs as MoH’s contractors ensured that people in more remote rural
areas had access to the PBHS which was not available before UPHSD was launched.

23.     The MoH’s HMIS system was designed, tested and put into practice to facilitate
sector accountability and for the assessment of the effectiveness of programmes being
supported under UPHSD Phase II. However, State hospitals were not yet incorporated
into the HMIS at the time of the mission. Excluding hospital data keeps out a significant
portion of the health system’s routine health service statistics. Rapid staff turnover among
middle level cadre, especially in the PMU, diminishes efforts by MoH to develop and
deploy skilled technical staff within contractual arrangements, with TA personnel
expected to transfer skills to sector staff. The constant loss of staff recruited for
procurement and financial management duties derails the goal of capacity building on a
sustainable basis. A significant number of documents were produced during UPHSD
Phase II making available information for the new IDA-funded Rapid Results Health
Project. However, the lack of a viable information reference unit leads to outside
agencies taking away data which is the exclusive property of the MOH. Reports of
routine health statistics and survey reports are not readily available at the Ministry,
thereby depriving MoH of tools for evidence-based policy and strategic development and
for performance evaluation. The absence of such an information reference unit also limits
access to more recent information for research purposes by South Sudan universities and
research institutes.

24.    By the close of UPHSD Phase II, the MoH had complied with all provisions of
the Grant Agreements, fulfilling all technical and fiduciary requirements and covenants.
The Grants were totally disbursed by the closing date of 30 December 2012. During the



                                            62
life of the operation, the disbursement gap dropped from 11.11 months soon after
effectiveness to 0.0 month by closing date. However, the Ministry’s management of
capacity building tasks within technical units of MoH was not effective and very few
counterpart staff received hands-on training from Consultants and technical assistance
personnel. A good number were either not hired or were not replaced when they left their
posts.

   D. Evaluation and Assessment of the Performance of the World Bank and Co-
      financiers

25.    World Bank performance during preparation to ensure quality at entry: The
performance of WB’s Task Team during preparation was very satisfactory and quality at
entry was strong. The Bank recommended the continuation of the sector-wide programme,
including sequenced work in all subsectors and levels of services, which were initiated in
UPHSD Phase I. The Task Team, guarded by the strategic relevance of the GoSS’ vision
that “a strong civil service is central to national economic and social development?
helped the MoH establish organizational structures for the Central and decentralized units
of MoH (SMoH and CHD) spelling out for each specific responsibilities and
accountabilities. It defined profiles of key unit positions and introduced management
procedures and practices that emphasized strategic planning, continuous intra-
departmental consultations and openness to development partners. The impact of this
investment in institution building contributed to the very brief delay between Approval
and Effectiveness and enabled timely and satisfactory implementation of the whole
Programme.

26.    During preparation, the Task Team played a catalyst role that crystalized into a
partnership of trust facilitating WB/MoH consensus which was endorsed by development
partners and subsequently helped firm up UPHSD Phase II development objectives. The
corresponding components of these objectives laid out expected outcomes against which
achievements would be measured. The Task Team’s enabling role promoted joint
analysis with partners, UN agencies and NGOs through meetings in MoH and through
MDTF-SS OC meetings. These were essential ingredients for implementation follow-up.

27.     Bank performance during implementation: The Bank’s Task Team drew on
expertise from WB Headquarters and regional and in-country offices to provide sound
implementation start-up support which was greatly appreciated by MoH. This support
contributed to further expansion of coverage of geographical areas and communities with
BPHS. Amendments and extensions of the contracts of technical assistance agencies,
firms and LAs contributed to the enhancement and development of the technical and
management capacities of Directorates of MoH. Support from these technical assistance
bodies enabled the MoH to introduce administrative procedures and practices for better
health sector management and accountability. Close working relationship between the
Bank’s Task Team and MoH officials facilitated MoH’s embrace and use of the Bank’s
comparative advantage to engage UN agencies (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) in high impact
service delivery activities. The Bank’s supervision missions accorded high priority to
fiduciary aspects of implementation provided by MoH’s PMU procurement and financial



                                           63
management consultants whose terms of reference included the building of MoH’s
capacities in these important functions. The World Bank Task Team’s extensive technical
experience with operations in post-conflict countries guided and supported the two-
pronged approach to health system development which: (i) prioritized high impact
interventions with formalized strategies for community mobilization and increased
availability of basic health care services soon after effectiveness, and (ii) promoted the
use of selective TA to aid MoH in its sector management and service delivery functions.
In this context, MoH, with technical assistance from Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) designed modalities for improving pediatric and maternal health services in
South Sudan. Institutional management capacities were developed to render GoSS’ health
system responsive and efficient in meeting South Sudan’s evolving health needs. During
implementation start-up phase, the WB Task Team did a good job guiding MoH to
properly address relevant safeguards related to the implementation of this operation.
Assessed from the Bank’s performance during UPHSD Phase I, the most critical
investment of the Bank’s comparative advantage occurred during the preparation of
Phase I and was sustained through Phase II preparations. This assessment tallies with that
contained in recently completed audits of MDTF-SS, GoSS Health Assembly conclusions
and minutes of OC meetings.

28.     Contract management at MoH was backed up by the specially created MDTF-SS
PFMU at the MoFEP which centralized the processing and payment of all contracts for
civil works, goods and services under UPHSD Phase II. Initially, the slow pace of
payments generated frustrations among MoH and contractors. Good quality supervision
during Phase I was carried over to Phase II thereby improving start-up implementation
work. The Task Team’s support to MoH in resolving sector institution management
issues critical for the GoSS’ efforts to develop and strengthen health sector management
included the refinement of job descriptions and accountabilities and the establishment of
modalities for supportive supervision of sector activities at all levels. It also included the
incorporation into Lead Agencies’ contracts responsibilities for collaborating with SMoH
and CHDs to mobilize and promote community participation in generating demand for
BPHS and in supporting health facility maintenance.

   E. Assessment of the performance of donors, UN Agencies and NGOs.

29.      The performance of MDTF-SS donors was considered satisfactory by MoH
regarding funding. The performance of UN Agencies was not rated because their
operations in the health sector used modalities of funding and accounting practices
unique to each agency. The performance of Lead Agencies NGOs was satisfactory. The
participation of LAs in implementation helped MoH, SMoH and CHDs to expand and
improve coverage and quality of BPHS, which in some communities were available for
the first time. The roles of LAs in in-service and on-the-job training and in supervision
were critical for attaining UPHSD Phase II performance indicator targets. The LAs, in
collaboration with SMoH and CHD officials, improved the quality performance of
facility health staff through the conduct of periodic seminars and supportive supervision.




                                             64
30.    Modern private sector health services are at an embryonic stage and still cater
only for the needs of few urban groups. Ongoing dialogue between MoH and IFC on
expanding and forging public/private partnerships in health care, as well as work already
underway to modernize South Sudan’s health sector legislation, should open up avenues
for improved and increased quality and coverage of private sector delivery services for
South Sudanese.

       F. Main Beneficiaries and Benefits of UPHSD Phase II

31.     Four States covered by UPHSD Phase II’s Component 2 that provided the BPHS
were the primary beneficiaries. The populations in these States saw a rapid decrease in
extreme scarcity of essential BPHS26. Households in the four States were the primary
beneficiaries, especially those in rural communities where services were virtually
nonexistent before the Programme was launched or those which were are the risk of
facing an abrupt stop in services initiated under Phase I. Other households, women and
children, living in adjacent counties of neighboring States, automatically benefited from
the Program as the BPHS were accessible to them. New SMoH health sector structures,
including CHDs, were beneficiaries as investments in sector infrastructure, institutions
and operating guidelines and procedures rendered these decentralized units of MoH
credible among communities they serve. The regular supply of priority essential
medicines and related supplies rendered sector operations more responsive to client needs
and demands for health care services. In general, lives were saved and suffering
alleviated for population groups hitherto deprived of basic health care services.

32.     Notwithstanding these difficulties, the achievements of UPHSD Phase II in
setting up the basis of a structured health system were substantial under the very difficult
geo-political conditions of South Sudan. These accomplishments would have to be
consolidated in coming years. The Programme was rated by the WB in its final
implementation status report (ISR) as Satisfactory. This rating is backed up by rapid
design of the GoSS’s third health sector project funded by IDA and already being
implemented.

       G. Lessons learned:

       1. A Long term health system strategy must remain the focus of the GoSS as it
          responds in the short-term to unacceptable high levels of morbidity and mortality
          fueled by malaria, recurrent epidemics, unhealthy environments and widespread
          poverty. Phase II of UPHSD laid the foundations for improved sector policy
          analysis and initiated sector development to streamline planning, institute


2626
    BPHS ": means the Basic Package Health Services as defined by the Recipient's Ministry of Health to include, inter alia: (i)
integrated management of childhood diseases; (ii) maternal interventions including emergency obstetrical assistance and family
planning services, and (iii) interventions to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other priority diseases.




                                                                 65
   evidence-based programme budgeting aimed at improving financial management
   and accountability. Sector performance benefitted from improved monitoring and
   evaluation using the new HMIS. The current rapid staff turnover, if left to
   continue unchecked, would adversely affect South Sudan’s ability to build the
   body of knowledge and sector managerial capacity it aims for.
2. The UPHSD Phases I and II generated a large and varied body of
   information that must be protected for better sector planning and research.
   The MoH is in great need of an adequately staffed Information Reference Unit
   (IRU) serving as a repertoire for studies, reports and HMIS periodic reports which
   provides data for planning and research. The IRU, staffed with qualified and
   dedicated staff should be fully computerized to assist the planning needs of
   Central, State and County Health Officials. It should serve the research needs of
   South Sudan’s universities and other research institutions. The Faculty of
   Medicine and School of Public Health should be closely associated with the IRU
   and should be contracted by MoH to improve and upgrade its operation.
3. South Sudan needs a major health sector infrastructure development
   programme. The UPHSD II has documented through the mapping of health
   facilities, excessive shortage in health facilities in many communities in all ten
   States. The GoSS should launch a well-phased out programme of constructing and
   renovating South Sudan’s basic health delivery institutions and facilities,
   especially in rural areas. This programme must of necessity include appropriate
   housing for the doctor, nurse and/or midwife if these categories of staff are to be
   retained in rural areas where the need for their services is greatest. Qualified
   health personnel are unlikely to be retained in rural areas without appropriate
   accommodation close to their designated health facilities.
4. Develop dynamic Human Resources for Health (HRH) management system.
   The health sector is a labor-intensive sector employing different categories of
   technical and administrative staff. The MoH should therefore initiate as a matter
   of priority, work on a computerized human resources database for more efficient
   management of HRH and their careers. Personnel management guidelines,
   including each category’s technical competencies and accountabilities would be
   developed and disseminated to facilitate structured supervision and the
   programming of in-service training. Capacity building on an individual basis
   received little attention from the WB which supervised the operation and this gap
   persists in the new Rapid Results Project and needs MoH and WB attention.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments for this section were provided by Dr. Dia Timmermans Senior Advisor for
Health at the Dutch International Development Agency. She was at the time the
Developmental Partners Coordinator for the Health and the MDTF UPHSDP.

The following were noted:

   1. Most important is to clarify in the beginning which phase you are assessing: both
      or only phase II, in case the latter, than the baseline has to be taken from the end
      of phase 1 , some of the info is from 2003 or 2006, there was other info available,
      e.g. on health budgets.
   2. I started some comments and have added the rest in the document:
           a. Update financing for health data as per table provided
           b. Update data on health facilities
           c. Need to clarify on start and ending dates
           d. Austerity started in 2012
           e. South Sudan still far from SWAp.
           f. Define how the Lead Agencies were able to incentivize implementation
              for positive outcomes.
           g. Policies need to be shared at all levels for effective coordination.
           h. Include nonperformance of HLSP.

   3. Page 2: an Umbrella program to provide financial and technical support to carry
      out the Ministry of Health's (MoH) sector development program was developed
      and has been effective since July 28, 2006.
   4. Page 3: Note that financial contribution should cover the whole period with
      explicit reference to project period.
   5. Project deliverables should also show what was achieved in phase 1 as a
      continuation into phase II.
   6. Health status page 4: the report would have benefitted from the info available
      now SSHHS 2010, to observe differences in child health and antenatal
