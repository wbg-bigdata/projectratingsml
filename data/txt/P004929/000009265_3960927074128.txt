MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IITERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR THE WEST MTIDJA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed investment
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$110 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
It would help finance the second phase of the Mitidja Irrigation Project. The
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria would be the Borrower.
2.       Background.  At Independence in 1962, Algeria was an agrarian society
with a small industrial sector. The basis of Algeria's economic policy was
the promotion of industrialization and reduced dependence on foreign
investments and imports through centralized planning, reliance on public
enterprises in industry and services, an agrarian policy which included the
creation of state farms, and a shift from the export orientation developed
during the colonial period to meeting domestic food requirements. The
strategy, fueled by the development of hydrocarbons, met with some success;
the economy grew at 62 p.a. during the 1970s, compared to 32 p.a. for middle
income countries as a group. This and other achievements were, however,
accompanied by serious disequilibria. In the early 1980s, there were cautious
shifts in economic policy that emphasized improved management and efficiency
of the economy. Policy reform became all the more urgent as most economic
indicators fell sharply in response to the 1986 oil-shock. Growth slowed from
3.91 p.a. over the 1980485 period to 1.02 in 1986, 1.31 in 1987 and an
estimated 0.81 in 1988.
3.       Responding to the oil-shock and the new policy direction, Government
initiated a series of reforms cutting across most sectors of the economy.
These reforms aim to decentralize the economy, make it more market oriented,
increase efficiency through better use of existing capacity, and place greater
reliance on the small but growing private sector. The World Bank has been
asked by the authorities for an increased level of assistance to support the
far reaching structural reform program. Emphasis is currently being given to
agriculture where reforms are most advanced and which, of all sectors in the
economy, has the potential to realize the quickest supply response.
4.       The agricultural sector is of vital importance in Algeria: about 50S
of the population of 23 million live in rural areas and 252 of the labor force
is employed in agriculture. While food imports now account for as much as
15-201 of total merchandise imports, Algeria does have potential to increase
agricultural production and reduce its dependency on imports. Recognizing
this potential, and with the reform program in Algeria gathering momentum,



- 2 -
Government intensified its efforts to promote agriculture. In 1988, Algeria
dismantled the state farms which had dominated the agricultural sector and
which had been largely responsible for the poor performance of the sector; the
growth of the sector over the past 20 years, at about 2.82 p.a. in constant
terms, has been insufficient to keep pace with the growing demand for food.
Yields of most crops have either stagnated or decreased steadily over this
period. The land reform of 1988 addressed a central issue affecting
agriculture - the lack of incentives in state farms to produce efficiently.
Now that these farms have been put into private hands, this has fundamentally
changed: unlike the farm workers on the state farms who had a guaranteed fixed
wage, farmers now have an incentive to increase productivity and yields. In
the short- and medium-terms, Algeria has the potential for a rapid and
significant increase in agricultural production as farmers close the gap
between yields in Algeria and those in neighboring countries with similar soil
and climatic conditiocs.
5.       At the same time, significant production gains can be achieved in the
longer-term by the renovation sand completion of existing Irrigation projects.
In fact, irrigation development has the greatest potential to contribute to
agricultural growth in the long run. Algeria's irrigation potential,
estimated at about 750,000 ha (excluding irrigation in the Sahara), is still
largely under-exploited. The area under irrigation hardly increased during
the 1960s and 1970s because priority in investment was given to the industry
and energy sectors. The importance of the irrigation subsector is illustrated
by the fact that about 30-402 of the value of Algeria's agriculture production
is produced on the approximately 300,000 ha currently irrigated, which
represents 8-102 of the area cultivated in any year. Algeria has thus
developed only about 402 of its irrigation potential, compared to 702 by
Morocco and 802 by Tunisia. The proposed project, which aims to complete a
major project already started by Government, would form an integral part of
Government's strategy to emphasize the completion of ongoing projects. It is
also consistent with the current stringent budgetary situation which places
emphasis on maximizing benefits from past investments.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The reform program underway in
Algeria needs both financial support and support for institutional changes.
Bank support to the agricultural sector is sharply focused and responds to the
most important sources of growth available to Algeria: increasing yields and
increasing the area under irrigation. Accordingly, Bank support is tailored
to assist Government to formulate an appropriate policy framework, to
strengthen support institutions (credit to farmers, extension and research,
and input distribution), and to rehabilitate and complete existing irrigation
schemes. The proposed project is of high priority because it completes an
irrigation scheme with substantial investments already made in dams and
tunnels.  Located near Algiers, the scheme has the potential to provide much
needed fresh fruits and vegetables to the capital city. The project also
provides a vehicle for the Bank to become substantially involved ir
environmental issues associated with irrigation development and contribute to
their resolution; the project includes a strong environmental component.



7.       Prolect Objectives.  The primary objective of the project would be to
complete an existing irrigation scheme and thereby expand the area under
large-scale irrigation. The project would support the newly created groups of
private farmers (EACs) with on-farm irrigation development and services. It
would also strengthen local and national irrigation institutions, helping them
undertake project surveys, design and implementation. The project aims to
expand policy and institutional changes with respect to Q&M and cost recovery
pioneered in the Cheliff Irrigation Project. It would also seek replicable
solutions to issues of the environment as noted above.
8.       Prolect Description.  The proposed project would complete the already
started West Mitidja Irrigation Scheme. It would comprise: (a) water resource
development involving construction of the Boukourdane pipeline and the Djer
diversion; (b) irrigation, drainaRe and road development involving the
construction of a pressurized irrigation distribution network on 14,000 ha
(including 3 pumping stations) and a surface drainage and road system on
15,800 ha; (c) on-farm development involving irrigation development including
the supply and installation of sprinkler or drip systems on 22,000 ha and
agricultural development on 15,800 ha, including establishment of citrus
plantations and other orchards and greenhouses for vegetables. provision of
supplementary equipment for agricultural operations, construction of buildings
and establishment of windbreaks; and, (d) institutional development involving
strengthening: the Project Unit of the recently created National Agency for
Irrigation and Drainage (AGID) responsible for supervising construction works,
the Regional Authority for Mitidja (OPIM) in charge of OUM, the National
Agency for Water Resources (ANRH) responsible for drainage investigations and
groundwater quality monitoring, and the National Institute for Plant
Protection (INPV) to prepare a fertilizer and pest management plan; the latter
two would ensure appropriate environmental standards (para. 10).
9.       The total project cost is estimated at US$425.9 million including
taxes and duties with a foreign exchange component of US$208.3 million. A
breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. The proposed Bank Loan of US$110 million
would finance about 262 of estimated total project costs or 532 of the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the project. The European Investment Bank
(EIB) has also indicated its interest in financing part of the irrigation
infrastructure and discussions on this are underway with the Government.
Should this additional financing be arranged, direct Government financing
would be correspondingly reduced. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group Operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C
and D respectively. A map is also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7514-AL, dated May 10, 1989.
10.      Agreed Actions.  To ensure successful project implementation the
Government has agreed to (a) implement the Boukourdane pipeline by December
31, 1993 and the Djer diversion by June 30, 1995; (b) in order to minimize the
danger of groundwater contamination in the West Mitidja Irrigation Scheme
area: (i) prepare a fertilizer and pest management plan for the area by June
30, 1992 and implement the plan by June 30, 1994; (ii) undertake a baseline
environment pollution survey for the area by December 31, 1992; (iii) monitor



the quality of the groundwater and the quantity and quality of the water
discharged in the area; and (iv) prepare an action plan for discussion with
the Bank for handling possible pollutants in the West Mitidja aquifer; (c)
study and implement measures to minimize the use of groundwater for irrigation
in the area; (d) submit proposals for OPIM's organizational structure by
December 31, 1991; (e) levy water charges to recover the full O&M costs and a
reasonable percentage of capital costs; and (f) undertake a water tariff study
to determine a reasonable level of cost recovery from the farmers and, on the
basis of this study, after taking into account Bank's comments, prepare and
present to the Bank, by December 1991, a specific acticn plan for the
implementation of a water tariff structure.
11.      Prolect Benefits.  In addition to its major institutional and
environmental objectives, the project would lead to a significant increase in
cereal, fruit, vegetable and milk production which would mainly supply the
rapidly expanding Algiers markets. The project would directly benefit about
38,000 people who live in the project area by raising net farm incomes and
generating about 340,000 mandays of hired employment at full development. The
project would also help reduce the food gap and save foreign exchange through
import substitution. The internal economic rate of return is 12S.
12.      Risks.  The main risk emerges from the possible slow uptake of
irrigation by the EAC farmers resulting from lack of experience with
irrigation. Evidence to date in, and outside, the project area shows that the
newly formed EAC farmers are working harder than ever before and that they are
eager to benefit from irrigation which provides a measure of drought-proofing,
important in a country with a highly variable rainfall. Risks will be
minimized through support to farmers in on-farm irrigation and parallel
Government programs to improve agriculture research and extension, agriculture
credit and providing adequate inputs to the agriculture sector.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
