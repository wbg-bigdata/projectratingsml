                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
The proposed changes will apply to the Financing Agreement (Amended and Restated
Development Credit Agreement – Ho Chi Minh City Environmental Sanitation (Nhieu
Loc-Thi Nghe Basin) Project) governing Credit Number 3475-VN (“Original Credit?)
and Credit Number 4708-VN (“Additional Credit?), dated May 25, 2010. There will be
two changes to the Financing Agreement: (a) a reallocation among disbursement
categories of the proceeds in the Original Credit, as per the table in paragraph 2 of
Section IV.A of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement; and (b) a change of retroactive
financing date from January 1, 2010 to May 25, 2009 for the Additional Credit, as per
paragraph 1 of Section IV.B of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement.

B. PROJECT STATUS
The Project was originally approved in March 2001 with the Original Credit of
SDR127.5 million. The Original Credit Closing Date was extended several times. In
April 2010 an Additional Credit of SDR58 million was approved, together with a Closing
Date of December 31, 2011 for both Credits. The Closing Date for the Additional Credit
was subsequently extended to June 30, 2012 through a restructuring approved on
December 29, 2011. The Original Credit closed on December 31, 2011 and is currently
in the final four months of grace period for final disbursements.

The overall Project is on track to close on June 30, 2012. The Project consists of the
improvement of about 8 kilometers of the primary drainage canal in the central business
district (“CBD?) of Ho Chi Minh City (“HCMC?). This includes canal dredging, canal
embankments and landscaping. In addition, the Project consists of a 3 meter diameter
sewer interceptor running the length of the canal to a large pumping station near the
Saigon River. Connecting to the interceptor are 70 kilometers of new and upgraded
sewers. When completed, the Project will reduce flooding in the CBD and will collect
sewage from over 1 million people which will be temporarily discharged into the Saigon
River. The Project is now over 97% complete with the interceptor, pumping station and
canal embankments completed. All work is expected to be completed by June 15, 2012 at
which time the system will be fully operational. The final Project will benefit about 1.2
million people with reduced flooding and improved sanitation. The canal improvements
have already had a transformational impact on the cityscape.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

The Project restructuring involves two minor changes related to Project financing, which
are summarized below:

1.    1.      Disbursement arrangements: A change in the withdrawal conditions for
the Additional Credit will be made to allow for the retroactive financing of eligible

                                           4
payments to be made prior to May 25, 2010 but on or after May 25, 2009. This change
will allow for retroactive financing to be made for up to one year from the date of the
Additional Credit signing.        The aggregate amount of retroactive financing of
SDR6,440,000 equivalent will remain unchanged. This change was requested by HCMC
People’s Committee (“HCMCPC?) in November 2010 and endorsed by the State Bank of
Vietnam (“SBV?) by a letter submitted to the Bank on August 1, 2011. The impact of
this change will essentially allow HCMCPC to be reimbursed for the 10% of counterpart
payments made on eligible contracts during this period, thereby reducing the counterpart
funding requirement and allowing for increased disbursements of the Additional Credit.
This change was requested by HCMCPC in order to offset additional counterpart costs
incurred by HCMCPC resulting from the Additional Financing restructuring in 2010.



2.      Reallocations: On April 13, 2012, SBV submitted a letter to the Bank requesting
a reallocation of the proceeds of the Original Credit. The change is required so that the
final allocations of the Original Credit will be consistent with the actual disbursement
amounts. The Original Credit closed on December 31, 2011, but is currently within the
four month final disbursement period, which will end on April 30, 2012.

   Credit No. 3475-VN were completed before December 31, 2011, the date which the
   Credit was closed.

5. The proposed reallocation is necessary to so that the final disbursement allocations
   will be consistent with the actual disbursed amounts of Credit No. 3475-VN. No
   reallocations are being made to Credit 4708-VN.
