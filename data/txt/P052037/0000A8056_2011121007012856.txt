                         the significant progress on the canal dredging has allowed for the improved tidal flushing of the canal (as planned under the design), leading to periods of improved water quality in
                         the canal. Once all sewer connections are completed and the interceptor is fully functioning at project completion, the full benefits of improved water quality in the canal will be
                         realized as will the flood reduction benefits. Several key results indicators indicate an expected satisfactory outcome of the PDO: (i) about 200,000 households now have wastewater
                         properly collected; (ii) NLTN canal water quality is on the path to improvement at 1.50 DO (Mg/L); and (iii) the agreed tariff rate of 450 VND per cubic meter has been achieved.
