MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR THE
NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development loan to
Paraguay for US$50.0 million equivalent is submitted for your approval. The proposea loan
would be on standard Bank terms with twenty years' maturity, a grace period of five years
and a variable interest rate. It would help to finance a Natural Resources Management
Project.
2.    Backdround: The agricultural sector has played an important role in the impressive
economic performance achieved by Paraguay since 1970, and represents one of the most
promising sources of further export-driven growth. The sector generates 30% of GDP,
employs 40% of the work force, and provides 90% of registered merchandise exports.
Agricultnual products are an important source of raw materials for industry, and agro-
industry contributes some 50% of total industrial value-added.
3.    The development models emphasizing industrialization and urban growth which
characterized many Latin American countries in the period following the second World War
were not adopted in Paraguay, which has the lowest level of urbanization in the region.
Almost 60% of the population of 4.4 million lives in the rural areas. Instead of a tendency
towards rural-urban migration, with the resultant increase in the number of marginalized poor
experienced by so many countries, Paraguay has achieved a deconcentration of its population
through settlement of previously-undeveloped parts of the country. However, this strategy is
rapidly approaching its limit.
4.    The different stages of Paraguay's agricultural development have been extractive
and/or exploitive of natural resources. With land as an abundant factor, the natural renewal
of fertlity and the low level of intensity of land use allowed this to operate as a sustainable
form of production for a long period. Beginning in the early 1970s, however, the
agricultural sector and the economy as a whole underwent important structural changes. The
Government's major road-building programs quickly put vast, and hitherto undeveloped,
areas within economic access, and large tracts of state land (tierras fiscales) were distributed
to both large and small farmers. By the 1980s, the agricultural sector had become one of tae
most dynamic sectors of the economy, driven by export demand and based primarily on the
extension of the cultivated area at the expense of the natural forest.
5.    Large-scale intemal migraton of peasants occurred, coupled with the arrival of many
small- and medium-scale farmers from neighboring countries, mainly Brazil. Between 1960-
1970, an estimated 400,000 people moved to the new lands of the east and north-east. The
early emphasis on seting peasants was replaced by the introduction of large-scale
operations, with significan capital resources and a modern, higher technology approach to
agriculture. Only in the past 30 years has a trly national agrarian economy been created,
-3A 4h- A.'"--r nt - -unc  nf  ,nf the aneicltvirul sectnr have left their mark on the



- 3 -
structures of land-holding and production. Indigenous hunter/gatherers, extensive cattle
ranchers, and Miniflundiolmicrofundio subsistence farmers are all present. in addition to
numerous forms of production based on small-, medium- and large-scale commercial farms.
6.    This social and economic development strategy has increased the absolute and relative
importance of the agricultural sector, but has not had a balanced impact on the rnual
population. The acceleration of agricultural growth at the expense of the natural forest has
meant that the frontier of agricultural production based on the extension of the cultivated land
awea will soon be reached. The rate of deforestation and incorporation of land into
productive use has, in fact, accelerated in the aftermath of the change in govermment in
1989, as large land-owners have sought to avoid illegal occupation by the landless and/or
expropriation by the State for settlement purposes. In addition, there is a potentially serious
problem of increasing degradation and erosion of soils in the areas already taken into
production. After more than two decades of dynamic agricultural growth, Paraguay is
rapidly approaching a crucial juncture in the development of its rural areas; the strategy to be
adopted must go beyond the confines of purely agricultural development, and must emphasize
increases in output and productivity in tandem with a heightened concern with the
environment and the preservation of natural resources.
7.    The challenge now facing the government is that of orchestrating the change from
horizontal development (i.e., expansion of the productive area) to the vertical development of
agriculture by adopting measures to improve productivity and increase output on a
sustinable basis; its strategy must also take account of the major population growth being
experienced. The key issues in the agricultural sector are: (a) the use and protection of
natural resources in sustainable agricultural production systems; (b) the skewed distnrbution
of land, and the land tenure system; (c) the weakness and fragmentation of sector institutions;
(d) the lack of agricultural strategy and policy, and of information for their formulation; (e)
the low level of taxation of agriculture and the lack of efficient tax instruments; and (t) the
growing pressure on indigenous communities in the competition for natural resources.
8.    Ratdonale for Bank havolvement: The most recent Board discussion of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) was on December 21, 1993. The CAS drew attention to the
critical issues in land use and resource conservation and to the need for a change in
agricultural development strategy. The Bank's strategy focuses on three main objectives:
(a) private sector development; (b) agricultural development and natural resource
management; and (c) poverty alleviation and human resource development. It also draws
attention to the need to ensure that all operations supported by the Bank should strengthen
and modernize the insttutions involved, particularly given the needs of deconcentration and
decentralization of Govemment activities.
9.    The agricultural sector of Paraguay faces a number of serious issues which camot be
resolved in a single project. The present natural resource use and agricultural development
strategy must undergo a major transformation. Bank strategy is to support Paraguay's shift
from an extensive model of agricultural expansion to growth through intensification, with
emphasis on sustainable resource management and environmental protection. The transiton
from an extensive agriculture to more intensive and sustainable agriculture in a framework of
appropriate natual resource management will require: (a) an improved knowledge of land
ownership, its capability and actual use; (b) an enhanced role for the Goverment in the
provision of basic services, which will itself require major instutonal change; and (c) the



-4-
preparation and introduction of the necessary framework of incentives and restrictions
concerning land use.
10.   The Bank, through its support of the Land Use Rationalization Project (LURP) -
Ln. 3445-PA - and the implementation of Japanese PHRD grants, is playing a key role in
the definition of issues and the available means to resolve them. The multi-purpose cadastre
which will result from the LURP will provide the Government with the necessary technical
basis to tax agriculture; in a planned future operation, the cadastral data base would be
employed to improve the system of land tiing. The preparation of the technical basis for
agro-ecological zoning and the accompanying body of legal and policy measures is being
carried out under the first Japanese PHRD grant, executed by the Bank. It will be completed
by early 1994, and its recommerndation will be the basis for a dialogue between the Bank and
the Govermnent. The application of the agreed recommendations at the level of the whole
Eastern Region would be pursued under the proposed Natural Resources Management II
Project, the preparation of which is to begin shortly under the third Japanese PHRD Grant.
11.   Mreet Ojectives: The objectives of the project would be: (a) to establish the
institutional framework necessary to deal with the major agricultural and natural resource
problems of the project area; (b) to generate information through research and implement an
area-wide system of natural resource protecfion; (c) to assist small farmers in the
establishment of sustainable, diversified agricultural production systems and conservation
measures; and (d) to encourage the direct participation of the local population in project
im-plementation. The project would increase the productivity and incomes of small farmers,
to enable them to accumulate capital and put the development process on a self-sustaining
basis. It would seek to alter the attitudes of the rural community toward natural resource
mnanagement and to develop a consensus on its importance and value. The project would
seek the participation of the population in the project through the stimulation of cooperatives,
local government and other institutions.
12.   Project Desritlon: The project would have five components. An Agricultural
Development Component would assist in the restrucuring of the productive process towards
sustainable, conservation-oriented agriculture. The component would support agricultura!
and forestry research, strengthen extension and the protected areas, and plan and implement
programs of actions to slow down and ultimately reverse the degradation of natural
resources, targeted at individual catcbment areas. The component would cost US$46.4
million, including contingencies (58.6% of total project costs), of which US$32.0 million
would represent investment costs, including structures, and vehicles and equipment, land
acquisition, on-farm investments in resource protection, training and technical assistance.
13.   An Indigenous Communities Component would provide assistance to the remaining
indigenous population of the project area. The component would expand the area dedicated
to indigenous people and regularize land tenancy. It would also provide assistance to
improve and diversify agricultural production and to improve their physical well-being. The
component would cost US$3.4 million, including contingencies (4.3% of total project costs),
of which US$2.4 million would represent investment costs, including the acquisition of land,
vehicles and equipment, and technical assistance.
14. An Infrastructural Development Component would realign, rebuild, improve and
maintain part of the existing rural road network to reduce negative environmental effects and



-5 -
to support the process of agro-ecological land use zoning. Rural roads would be realigned or
rebuilt, and provision would be made for adequate maintenance. The component would cost
US$15.4 million, including contingeilcies (19.5% of total project costs), of which US$15.1
million would represent investment costs, including the construction of roads and the
acquisition of road maintenance equipment.
15.  An Institutional Development Component would strengthen the institutons involved
in project implementation. The component would support the decentralized administration of
the project, and provide the necessary technical assistance and training both for existing and
newly-created entities. The component would cost US$5.1 million, including contingencies
(6.5% of total project costs), of which US$1.3 million would be for investment, including
the acquisition of vehicles and equipment, training and technical assistance; and
16. A Pilot Agricultural Credit Component would support investments by small farmers
in productive activities. The component would finance up to 70% of individual sub-projects,
and would include support for the training and mprovement of operational efficiency of the
Sma11holder Credit Agency (CAH). The component would cost US$8.8 miniop, including
contingencies (11.1 % of total project costs), which would include US$0.6 millioni of
investment by CAH in the acquisition of equipment, training and technical assistance, and
US$1.0 million of operating costs.
17. The estimated project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The
amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the proposed disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank GrouP operations in Paraguay are shown in Schedules C & D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11606-PA, dated January 31, 1994, is attached.
18. ProJoect Implementation: The responsibility for project management would lie with
the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG). Under the overall coordination of its National
Directorate for Project Coordination and Administration (DINCAP), MAG would create by
Decree three new administrative units required for project implementation, to be located in
the project area. These entities would be the Project Technical and Administrative
Coordination Unit (UCTAP), the Rural Research and Training Center (CICAR), and the
Regional Environmental Center (CRAE). The structure and levels of authority of these
implementing entities would be defined in detail in the Decrees which would establish them
and which would describe the functions of existing MAG agencies. The Government will
give the relevant agencies the legal power and necessary degrees of administrative freedom to
perform their duties effectively.
19.   Aeed Actions: Agreement was reached between the Government and the Bank on
the following: (a) that a joint review would be carried out by June 30, 1994, by the Bank
and the Government of the technical basis for agro-ecological zoning and the accompanying
body of legal and policy instruments; and that, by December 31, 1994, the Government
would provide the Bank with an action plan on the appropriate mechanisms and timetable for
the implementation of agreed proposals; (b) that the Govermment would provide to the Bank
a resettlement plan or plans, including a compensation plan, in the event that it were to
undertake any resettlement action affecting the population within the boundaries of the San
Rafael National Park or any area to be expanded for the benefit of indigenous peoples; (c)
the terms of reference for the preparatory studies for new national parks, and the draft



- 6 -
management plans for the Kyri'y reserve and the N4acunday protection area; (d) the drafts of
the Regulations, the Operating Manual and the Model Contract of the Natural Resources
Conservation Fund (FOCORN); (e) the draft legal instruments for land acquisition and
regularization of tenancy for indigenous people; (f) the request for pre-qualification by
consultants and the terms of reference for road design, amd a schedule of monitorable actions
associated with road design; (g) the Decrees: (i) establisling UCTAP, CICAR and CRAB;
and (ii) describing new functions for MAG administrative units; (h) the agreements
(convenios): (i) to be signed between MAG and the implementing and cooperating agencies;
and (ii) the model agreement between MAG and the project area Municipalities; (i) the draft
Management Services Agreement with UNDP; (ji the Terms of Reference for studies and
technical assistance to be undertakcn by CAH; (k) CAH's: (i) Subsidiary Grant Agreement
(SGA) and Credit Regulations; (ii) necessary actions to limit the portion of its outstanding
loans affected by arrears of more than 90 days to 10% of its total loan portfolio; and (iii) or.-
lending terms; (1) procurement; (m) chronograms of the main activities of the five proposed
project components; (n) the staffing and s-upport requirements of the monitoring and
evaluation unit to be established in MAG; (o) audit requirements and procedures acceptable
to the Bank; (p) timing for the submission of the Annual Operating Plan and reporting
procedures; and (q) timing and scope of annual and interim reviews.
20. Conditions of Effectiveness and Disbursement: Before the effectiveness of the
proposed loan, the following conditions would be met by the Borrower: (a) the entry into
effect of the SGA governing the transfer of funds to INDI, and the contractual arrangement
between INDI and IBR; (b) the entry into effect of the SGA governing the transfer of funds
to CAH; (c) the legal opinion confirming the primacy of the signed loan agreement in
procurement issues; (d) the entry into effect of the Decrees establishing UCTAP, CICAR and
CRAE, the appointment of qualified staff to head such units, and the entry into effect of the
Decree describing new functions for existing MAG administradve units; (e) the
implementation of the first phase of DINCAP's action plan; (t) the adoption by UCTAP of
an adequate accoundng system; (g) the entry into effect of the convenios to be signed
between MAG and the project's executing and cooperating agencies; (h) the entry into effect
of the UNDP agreement; and (i) the establishment of the Regional Operations Committee
(COR).
21.   The conditions of disbursement would be: (a) of the protected areas program of the
forestry and environmental conservation sub-component, that the Govermment would
provide to the Bank a resettlement plan, including a compensation plan, if it were to
undertake a resetdement action affecting the population within the boundaries of the San
Rafael National Park; (b) of the FOCORN sub-component, that the fund and its account had
been established, and that the FOCORN Operating Regulations had been approved; (c) of the
Indigenous communities component, that INDI had adopted an appropriate accounting
system; and (d) of the pilot agricultural credit component, that (i) CAH had provided
evidence of staff training for environmental review of sub-loan applications; (ii) that CAH
had developed and implemented the necessary accounting systems; and (iii) that the
modifications to the Credit Regulations and operational procedures incorporadng the
necessary enviromnental safeguards and provisions had entered into effect.
22. Project Beneflts: The project has been designed to initiate a process of change in the
use of natur resources in the project area. Improvement in land use will ultimately come
from a combination of incentives and restictions. The incentives must come mainly from an



inQrease in output, productivity and net farm income, and in the achievement of this the
public sector will play a catalytic role. The project represents a first phase initiative to alter
radically the use of natural resources in agriculture. The restrictions would follow from the
enforcement of land use and conservation criteria, based on the agro-ecological zoning
exercise for the whole of the Eastern Region and associated legal and policy studies, as
described in para. 10 above.
23.   The proposed project would address many issues which are generic to agricultum  in
the whole of the Eastem Region, and their successful resolution in the project area would
allow the replication of project activities and experiences in other areas. Bank involvement
in the conception and preparation of this project has already been a catalyst in the definition
of a new approach to the use of natural resources in Paraguay. Though still at a very early
stage, this approach is the only realistic hope of sustaining the growth of output in the long
term and of mitigating the effects of the migration of landless and impoverished people into
the urban sector. A number of difficult political decisions will be required, and the Bank's
presence will be invaluable in the maintenance of a steady course.
24.   The benefits of the project would result from: (a) short-, medium- and long-term
financial benefits realized from the adoption of on-farm investment plans; (b) medium- and
long-term economic benefits accruing from the maintenance of the productive resource base;
and (c) improved management of protected areas, stabilization of indigenous people,
improved living conditions in the rural areas, and institutional development.
25.   Environmental Aspets: The environmental problems being encountered in the
project area as the result of the rapid and uncontrolled expansion of agriculture at the
expense of the natural forest are serious. The existing model of land use is not sustainable,
and only by combining appropriate systems of agricultural production in harmony with the
management of natural resources can an equilibrium be achieved. In broad terms, what is
good for the environment is also good for a model of agricultural development which is
sustainable in the long term.
26.   The project has an Environmental Assessment category A. The terms of reference
and work program for the Environmental Assessment (EA) were prepared during the pre-
appraisal by Bank staff in conjunction with staff of the SSRNMA and members of the project
preparation team. The EA was carried out by a team of consultants, and was presented to
the Bank in June, 1992. The EA followed methodology and guidelines appropriate to a
regional environmental assessment, which considered the project as a whole as presented in
the Government's project preparation document. The EA explicitly recognized that the
project aims at reversing the present abuse of natual resources by promoing diversified and
sustainable production systems. Its findings were taken into account in the further processing
of the loan, and the summary of the EA was distributed to the Executive Directors in
September, 1992.
27.   PgEar R on: Environmental degradation in Paraguay worsens the exposure of
the rural poor to the risks of further impoverishment. Inadequate natural resource
management practices, particularly those resulting in severe soil degradation, tend to reduce
farm income and increase its variabilty. Under the project, the growth prospects of
smallholders and indigenous commuities would be improved. Technical and financial
support for the adoDtion of environmentally-sound Droduction technologies. rehabilitation and



- 8-
modernization of basic rural infrastructure, and improved access to formal sources of credit
will increase productivity and create an economically-viable alternative to the existing pattern
of natural resource mining.
28.   As part of the Bank's poverty reduction effort, the project is also aimed at developing
human capital able to implement an environmentally-sound agricultural sector growth
strategy. The decentralization of project administration to regional entities (i.e., UCTAP,
CICAR, and CRAE) and the active participation of local organizations such as Agncultural
Credit Users' Associations and Local Roads Committees would promote better access for
smallholders to the decision-making process, improving channels of communication and
government's responsiveness to local needs.
'9.   Risk and  ianty: Institutional weakness is an acknowledged risk of the project.
The project's institutional structure has been carefully designed, but its implementation will
demand considerable adjustment to established patterns of behavior in multiple institutions
where over-entralization and control have been more important in the past than efficiency
and results. The project would include an active program of institutional development, and
monitorable indicators will allow progress to be followed closely during supervision and mid-
term review. The project aims to slow down and ultimately to provide the basis for the
reversal of a depredatory approach to natural resource use. This will depend on a consistent
message from the Government and the provision of a framework of incves and penaltes.
In some cases, short-term political expediency may run counter to the requirements of the
necessary long-term strategic approach. The government itself must be assisted in the
analysis of the problems faced by the agricultural sector.
30.   Re          tin: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that it be approved by the Executive
Directors.
