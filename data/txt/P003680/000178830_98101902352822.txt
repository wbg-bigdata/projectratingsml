SECOND POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA)
Guarantor:             Fiji
Amount:                US$15.5 million
Terms:                 15 years including three years of grace with
interest at 8.25% per annum.
Project Description:  The project consists of:  (a) heightening of the
Monasavu dam (part of the first power project) by 15 m
to double its storage; (b) construction of two small
diversion weirs and about 4.0 km of concrete-lined
tunnels of 2.75 m diameter to divert the flow of two
neighboring streams (Wainambua and Wainaka) into the
tIonasavu reservoir; (c) extension of civil works of
the Wailoa power station (also part of the first power
project) to its ultimate capacity (80 MW); (d)
installation of the third and fourth generating sets
(20 MIW each) and associated electrical equipment at
the Wailoa power station; and (e) provision for
overseas training of FEA's operators and extension of
training facilities. The project forms part of FEA's
program to increase the scope of Fiji's hydroelectric
generation and further reduce Fiji's dependence on
imported energy resources. Co-financing is being
arranged with the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a group
of commercial banks. There are no unusual risks
associated with the project other than those inherent
in all hydroelectric projects such as possible
geological problems and hydrological complexities.
The thorough preparatory work and extensive
precautions taken in preparation and implementation of
the project are expected to keep the risks to a
minimum.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FIJI ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF FIJI FOR THE SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) with the Guarantee of Fiji for the
equivalent of US$15.5 million to help finance the Second Power Project. The
loan would have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 8.25% per annum. The Fiji Government has obtained the commitment
of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to provide US$16.6 million for this
project; the loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3-1/2 years of
grace, with interest at about 8%. The Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) has agreed to provide US$4.8 million for the project, for a term of 20
years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 8.75%. A group of commer-
cial banks has agreed to provide US$1.9 million for this project as part of a
US$5.0 million loan to FEA primarily arranged to finance the ongoing first
power project; the loan is for 12 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 5/8% above LIBOR for the first 8 years and 3/4% above LIBOR for
the remaining 4 years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        A report entitled "Economic Situation and Pros)ects of Fiji" (No.
1296-FIJ) was circulated to the Executive Directors on January 27, 1977. An
economic mission visited the country in January/February 1980 and a report
based on its findings will be issued later this year. Basic country data are
given in Annex I.
3.        Fiji attained independence in October 1970.  It is composed of a
group of over 300 islands in the South Pacific with a total land area of some
18,000 sq km. It has a population of about 600,000 of which about 90% live on
the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Indigenous Fijians (about 44%
of the population) and citizens of Indian origin (almost 50%) comprise the
main elements of Fiji's multiracial society.
4.        A noteworthy feature of Fiji's development has been the substantial
reduction in the rate of population growth, from 3.3% in the early 1960s to
about 1.8% at present. The Government's active and successful family
planning program, changing social habits and rising incomes have all contri-
buted to this trend. Equally significant, the Indian population has tended
to grow at a lower rate than the Fijian population, largely due to the
declining birth rate of Indians and the higher emigration amongst Indians
compared to Fijians.
/1 This section has been updated and reflects the findings of the recent
economic mission. A new Economic Report is under preparation.



5.        Real GDP has increased at the average annual rate of 5% between
1970-79. Until the early 1960s, Fiji was primarily an agricultural economy,
relying heavily on sugar production as the main generator of incomes,
employment and export earnings. However, the last decade witnessed a
profound structural change, with tourism and related activities emerging as
the major source of growth. At the same time, output in agriculture,
forestry and fisheries stagnated and, as a result, the sector's share in GDP
fell from about one third to one fifth. Mainly due to growth of tourism,
the services sector now contributes about two thirds of GDP.
6.        Because of the slow-down in economic growth during 1975-78, the
average annual rate of growth in real GDP over the present plan period,
1975-80, is expected to be about 4.5% compared to the planned target of 7%.
Poor performance of agricultural production other than sugar, stagnation in
tourism during the early years of the plan period, sluggish private
investment and world-wide recession are among the main factors that account
for this shortfall. On the other hand, government spending provided
much-needed stimulus to the economy. In aggregate, government development
expenditures are expected to reach 90% of the planned amounts by the end of
the plan period.
7.        One consequence of slow growth that is viewed with great concern
in the country is unemployment. The rate of unemployment (estimated at 9%)
cannot be measured precisely but, with the number of school-leavers estimated
at about 10,000 annually and paid employment stagnating over the last five
years, it is likely to have increased in recent years. Available statistics
suggest that unemployment is particularly high among the recent school-
leavers aged between 15-19 years. The Government recognizes that job
creation must be accorded high priority in the country's next development
plan if a serious unemployment rate is to be avoided.
8.        The Government is giving increasing attention to policy initiatives
needed to stimulate private investment, particularly in the industrial sector.
However, the small size of the domestic market, large distances from possible
export markets and relatively high wage costs have restricted industrial
development so far. Industrial output contributes only 10% to GDP, and
one half of even this low proportion is related to sugar. To encourage the
establishment of suitable industries, various fiscal incentives were provided
in the last budget, and other measures are under consideration. Addition-
ally, the Government has proposed the establishment of an Economic Develop-
ment Board, with representation from both private and public sectors, to
advise the Government on economic issues, including private investment and
employment.
9.        Over the present plan period, domestic resources are likely to
finance a much higher proportion (70%) of the development expenditures than
anticipated in the plan (50%). The annual share of the surplus in the
current budget has, however, declined in real terms due to the combined
effects of a substantial expansion in recurrent expenditures and a less



- 3 -
rapid growth in recurrent revenues. Concerned by this, the Government
appointed an independent Financial Review Committee. A number of the
Committee's recommendations for restraining expenditures and raising revenues
were reflected in the 1980 budget.
10.       The country's Eighth Development Plan covering 1981-85 is currently
under preparation and is expected to emphasize more rapid and diversified
agricultural development, reduction in the country's high food import bill
through import substitution, export-oriented industrial development based on
agricultural products, and a more equitable distribution of personal and
regional incomes. Given the country's agricultural potential, the prospects
for a satisfactory rate of growth are reasonably good. There will be
significant opportunities for reducing the country's relative dependence on
sugar. The fishing industry should, in particular, become increasingly
important, and the pine scheme, under which one half of the targeted area of
60,000 hectares has already been planted, should also begin to contribute to
export receipts. Revitalization of the agricultural sector is also essential
for raising incomes of the poorest group in the country, the Fijian farmers,
who derive a high proportion of their incomes from subsistence production.
11.       Achieving a satisfactory rate of growth over the next plan period
will require an increased use of external financing as well as much greater
mobilization of domestic resources than in the past. Fiji has not
traditionally relied heavily on external resources. Reflecting this, the
country's debt servicing ratio remains moderate. At the end of 1978, the
level of external debt was about US$168 million, of which about US$104 million
was public. Debt service payments were about 10% of exports of goods and
nonfactor services. The debt service ratio should not rise rapidly over the
plan period provided a fuller use is made of possibilities for financing from
multilateral and bilateral sources. Fiji's capacity for project identifica-
tion and preparation is limited and will require strengthening in this
context.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       The Bank has so far made six loans totaling US$50.2 million to Fiji,
which have helped to finance five projects (one of the six loans provided
supplemental financing for a highway project). This lending has been
distributed among sectors as follows: transportation 32%; telecommunication
14%; agriculture 24%; and power 30%. Implementation of these projects has
generally been satisfactory, though the highway project was subject to delays
and cost overruns. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as
well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Future Bank lending will focus on:  import substitution; export
expansion; employment generation for subsistence population; and selective
infrastructure development with particular emphasis on projects that would
bring about significant foreign exchange savings or contribute directly to



- 4 -
the development of the rural areas. In view of the limitation of Fiji's
overall absorptive capacity, the Bank would also focus on institution
building, particularly in the agricultural sector.
14.       Increasing agricultural production will continue to be a major
objective of Bank asdistance. The agricultural sector represents Fiji's
best potential for raising rural incomes, substituting for imports, and
expanding exports. Realization of this potential would call for a larger
allocation of resources to the sector, diversification of crops, development
of new lands, and raising productivity. Programs for agricultural development
must also take into account the differing characteristics of the two rural
communities - the Fijians and the Indians.  Fijian agriculture is largely
traditional subsistence farming based on the cultivation of root crops.
Indian farming, on the other hand, is more market-oriented and consists of
smallholder sugarcane with subsistence rice and vegetable production.
15.       Two agricultural projects are under consideration.  The first would
assist Fiji's pine plantation scheme. Aside from its employment-creating
potential, the scheme offers considerable scope for diversifying Fiji's
exports. The second and much more difficult project in the agricultural
sector would aim at assisting smallholders through the provision of infra-
structure, extension, credit, marketing, processing, and storage facilities
and would encompass both Indian and Fijian farmers. For some years now, the
Bank has been discussing possible forms of assistance for the subsistence
sector, but so far no project has materialized. This delay reflects the
difficulties of formulating a project that would raise cash incomes of
subsistence farmers without disrupting the traditional Fijian way of life.
Bank staff will continue to work with the Government to develop a suitable
project, but it will probably be a few years before project preparation can
be completed.
16.       Meanwhile, the energy sector offers an appropriate channel for
development assistance both for financing a priority project and as a basis
for a continuing dialogue on general development policy. At present Fiji is
heavily dependent on imported oil for its energy needs and consequently the
worldwide energy crisis has affected Fiji severely. Despite strong efforts at
conservation, imported fuel represents about US$19 million (at late 1979
prices) annually or 30% of total net imports. The proposed hydroelectric
project will enable Fiji to utilize further domestic energy resources for
electricity generation, in keeping with the Government's energy policy.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Sector Background
17.       The power sector comprises small and isolated diesel generating
stations and distribution systems located mostly (95%) on the main island of
Viti Levu. Per capita consumption is about 500 kWh per annum. About half
the population has access to electricity. However, at the prevailing cost



- 5 -
of oil, diesel power stations cannot provide economic and reliable electri-
city essential to development. Government policy, based on the recommen-
dations of an Alternative Fuels Technical Committee set up in 1973 to deal
with the difficult situation caused by rapid escalation in oil prices, is to
utilize domestic rather than imported energy resources. Rapid extension of
electricity to rural areas is another urgent need.
Energy Resources
18.       Fiji has no known sources of commercial energy other than the hydro-
electric potential of 2,000 GWh annually which is available around the Nandrau
Plateau of Viti Levu - an area of about 600 sq km at an average altitude of
1,000 m and subject to an annual rainfall of about 3,300 mm. It is consid-
ered that about 80% of this potential can be economically developed. Detailed
investigations have been in progress since 1972. The results of the inves-
tigations established in 1977 that a 25-year (1977-2001) all-hydroelectric
development program would be the least cost solution for expansion of
electricity supply. The 40-MW Monasavu-Wailoa hydroelectric project (first
power project) was identified as the most appropriate first step. The
program could substantially reduce the use of diesel oil for public elec-
tricity supply in Viti Levu by 1983 but it requires: (a) investment on an
unprecedented scale for Fiji, especially during the first five years when
the diesel system will be replaced; and (b) a sound institutional and
financial framework.
Bank Role
19.       To initiate construction of the major program of hydroelectric
development described above, the Bank provided financial assistance through
its first power loan of US$15.0 million (1596-FIJ) for the Monasavu Wailoa
project in 1978 and helped to arrange an extensive co-financing package
involving the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB), the Common-
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), and the European Investment Bank
(EIB). The Bank role has been to: (a) support the Government's long-term
electricity development program to stabilize future costs of supply and
achieve valuable foreign exchange savings; (b) assist in building up a sound
institutional framework for the sector; and (c) ensure that the benefits so
derived are rapidly extended to areas hitherto beyond the reach of existing
supply systems, especially to rural areas. The Monasavu Wailoa project, now
under construction, has succeeded to a significant extent in achieving
progress on the first two objectives. The proposed project, which is the
second step in the development program, will consolidate this progress and
will complement the Government's work on the third objective - i.e. rural
electrification.



-6-
Structure of the Power Sector
20.       The power sector consists of a single public undertaking - the Fiji
Electricity Authority (FEA) - which accounts for about 75% of the power
market, and two industries - sugar and gold mining - with captive diesel
generating stations. FEA was established in 1966 as an autonomous statutory
authority, with sole responsibility for electricity supply in Fiji, which it
could discharge either by constructing its own installations or through
licensees. However, until 1978, FEA's operations were small and dispersed
throughout the country. They excluded the capital city of Suva and its
environs, which represented over two thirds of the market for public supply
and were served by the Suva City Council's Electricity Department (SCCED).
SCCED suffered from bad management, poor maintenance of equipment and
inadequate training and forward planning. To improve the reliability of
electricity supply, unification of diverse tariff systems and
rationalization of future expansion, the Bank required as a condition of the
first power operation that: (a) SCCED be taken over by FEA; and (b) FEA's
tariffs, which were about 40% higher than those of SCCED, be extended to the
SCCED supply area. These requirements were swiftly and efficiently
accomplished during mid-1978. Most of the SCCED deficiencies noted above
have since been substantially removed, reflecting considerable credit on
FEA's management.
21.       FEA serves about 35,000 consumers and has 85 MW of diesel genera-
ting capacity and a n'twork of 33 kV and 11 kV transmission and distribution
systems in all the main population centers. By mid-1980 a 132 kV transmission
line being constructed as part of the FEA's development program, with the
assistance of ADB, will be completed. It will effectively integrate operation
of the Viti Levu supply systems. Progress on construction of the Bank-
assisted Monasavu-Wailoa hydroelectric project is satisfactory. It augurs
well for the success of the ambitious development program.
Rural Electrification
22.       Rural electrification is being undertaken by FEA and the Government
through its Public Works Department (PWD). FEA provides electricity to rural
areas on a commercially viable basis through extensions of its networks, while
PWD uses small diesel installations and subsidies to reach very remote rural
areas.  FEA increased its rural connections to 1,000 last year, against an
earlier annual average of 350. The PWD program, due to the isolation and
small size of its target group, has electrified only 600 dwellings so far and
is constrained by high costs.  The Seventh Development Plan (1976-80) recog-
nized the urgent need for rural electrification and stressed the importance
of utilizing local energy resources including small-scale hydropotential,
organic waste, solar and wind energy. It allocated about US$420,000 for
research and US$1.1 million for the implemention of rural electrification.
Larger amounts are expected to be allocated for these purposes under the
Eighth Development Plan (1981-85). The second power project will enable
further acceleration of rural electrification in the country.



- 7 -
The Borrower - Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA)
23.       FEA's corporate powers are vested in its Board, which consists of a
Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and five members, all of whom are appointed by
the Minister of Communications, Works and Tourism. The day-to-day duties
are performed by FEA's staff, headed by a General Manager. The incumbent
General Manager appointed during 1979 is a former Deputy Secretary of the
Ministry of Communications, Works and Tourism and has a good administrative
background. At the Bank's suggestion FEA has been taking steps urgently
needed to strengthen its administration. It has appointed: (a) a director
(hydro projects) who would be responsible for all aspects of FEA's develop-
ment program; and (b) a suitably qualified chief financial executive. The
Board of FEA has recently approved delegation of adequate authority to the
General Manager to exercise administrative control over FEA's officers,
employees and its affairs; the Board decision will be formalized by
September 30, 1980 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
24.       By 1986, FEA would require a total of about 130 trained technicians
and 25 assistant engineers. To meet these requirements, FEA has established
an excellent training capability over the last three years for providing the
specialized orientation, retraining and upgrading programs which are necessary
because of power system expansion and the move from diesel to hydro genera-
tion. The proposed loan includes a sum of US$300,000 for special training to
cover: (a) training abroad for Fijian nationals who will be responsible for
operating and maintaining the Wailoa power station; (b) upgrading and
equipping the linemen's school to train FEA's staff for work on the 132 kV
transmission system; and (c) training selected staff in computer pro-
gramming, simple systems analysis and operating a new accounts system.
25.       FEA has a comprehensive insurance program which includes coverage
for its main operating risks and for works under construction including the
hydroelectric project. However, a recent study indicated areas of risk not
presently covered and actions to be taken by FEA to reduce its risks. FEA
will implement the recommendations of the insurance consultants by December
31, 1980 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.01 and Side Letter).
26.       FEA's management and operations are currently being reviewed by a
government-appointed Enquiry Committee with far reaching terms of reference
relating to FEA's autonomy, organization, responsiveness to the public and
its training program. This review arose out of certain criticisms of FEA's
training program by the Director of the Fiji Institute of Technology (FIT),
who felt that FEA was eroding some functions that had been assigned to FIT.
Although it is not expected that this review would result in any radical
organizational changes, the Government will review the recommendations of
the Enquiry Committee with the Bank (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02).
27.       FEA has recently appointed management consultants, Price Waterhouse
and Co., to review its management, accounting and reporting systems. The



- 8 -
study is being financed by FEA and is expected to be completed and imple-
mented before the end of 1981. In addition to the main task, the consult-
ants will review the work of FEA's Special Project Division (SPD) and make
recommendations on the delegation of powers to the General Manager on a long-
term basis. The consultants are also expected to comment on the adequacy of
FEA's organization to meet its needs after the first hydropower station is
commissioned. FEA will review and discuss the consultants' recommendations
with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02 and Side Letter).
28.       Although ERA's basic bookkeeping is good, it is difficult to estab-
lish a figure for operating income for use in calculating FEA's rate of return
performance. One reason for this is that it does not include an income state-
ment in its audited accounts. Also, it does not separate operating items
from non-operating items. In addition, a review is needed of FEA's procedures
for allocation of overheads between capital works, operations and work carried
out for the Government. These problems are being studied for FEA by Price,
Waterhouse & Co. and the requirements for necessary adjustments were confirmed
at negotiations. FEA will submit to the Bank its audited annual financial
statements, including an income statement, within six months of the end of
each fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.02 and Side Letter).
FEA's Performance
29.        FEA's performance during the period 1977-79 has been up to the high
standard expected during appraisal of the first power project. On the insti-
tution building aspect, the smooth, efficient and speedy takeover of SCCED
has been remarkable. With regard to project implementation, FEA management
has been sensitive to both the timing of activities and the costs. SPD was
quickly set up from scratch to build the Monasavu dam by force account. It
enabled completion of the project a year earlier than would otherwise have
been possible and the original objective of commissioning the first power
project by the end of 1981 is considered to be within reach at this stage.
If the measures detailed in paras. 23 through 28 above are taken, this
satisfactory situation should continue.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Historical Background
30.        Investigations carried out during 1973-78, which identified the
ongoing Monasavu-Wailoa hydroelectric project as the first step in the least
cost long-term development program, also indicated that it should be followed
by a scheme for developing the potential of the Wainisavulevu River at
the power stations to be located in that valley. However, the detailed field
surveys, hydrological observations, geological investigations and studies
carried out by PEA's consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Gibb),
during 1979 led to the conclusion that the cost of the long-term development



-9-
program could be greatly reduced by the alternative of diverting flows of
the Wainisavulevu (and other high-lying intermediate streams draining the
Nandrau Plateau) on a run-of-the-river basis into the Monasavu reservoir and
increasing the generating capacity of the Wailoa power station. The
proposed second power project represents the first phase of this river
diversion scheme. It was appraised in October/November, 1979. Negotiations
were held in Washington from March 31 to April 2, 1980. The Fiji delegation
was led by Mr. Murray MacKenzie, Deputy Financial Secretary, Ministry of
Finance. A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2867-FIJ, dated May 1, 1980) is
being distributed separately. Supplementary project data are provided in
Annex III.
FEA's Development Program and Its Costs
31.       FEA's development program, which consists of a series of hydro-
electric generating projects, a 132 kV transmission line, and extension of
the existing 33 kV subtransmission system and the low voltage distribution
network, has been updated in the context of recent studies. The estimated
cost of the program during the period FY80-86 is summarized below:
Foreign   Local   Total

Total Cost              121.2      97.5   218.7
Project Description
32.       The proposed second power project comprises:
(a) heightening of the Monasavu dam by 15 m to double its storage (the
original dam (70 m high) is a part of the first power project);
(b) construction of two small diversion weirs and about 4.0 km of
concrete-lined tunnels of 2.75 m diameter to divert the flow of
two neighboring streams, Wainambua and Wainaka, into the Monasavu
reservoir;
(c) extension of civil works of the Wailoa power station (also part of
the first power project);
(d) installation of the third and fourth generating sets, 20 MW each,
and associated electrical equipment at the Wailoa power station; and
(e)  provision for overseas training of FEA's operators and extension
of training facilities.



- 10 -
33.       The proposed project has been investigated in detail.  Preparation
of detailed designs and specifications of the diversion weirs and tunnels is
under way. The critical step in project implementation is the construction
of a 5 km access road from the Monasavu dam to the Wainambua weir site to
enable start of construction of the two tunnels by October 1980. The rest
of the civil works are extensions of the ongoing power project and present
no particular difficulties. Arrangements made under the first power project
for engineering, supervision of construction and inspection and maintenance
of works would be continued as they apply to the proposed project also. Gibb,
in association with Merz and McLellan (M/M) of Australia, is the consulting
engineer for engineering and supervision of construction of the first power
project and will continue to be responsible for the proposed project. Gibb's
performance has been generally satisfactory. Employment of consultants for
the project under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank will be a
condition of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
Timing of Prolect Construction
34.       During the period, 1969-73, the demand for electricity in Viti
Levu increased at an average annual rate of 10%. There was little growth in
1974 when steep tariff increases followed a quadrupling in the fuel costs.
Since then growth has been about 8%. During 1979 consultants have updated
the power market survey carried out in 1977 and made detailed projections up
to 1983, with trends extended to the end of the century. The average growth
rates are expected tc be about 5% per annum until 1983 and about 7%
thereafter. The market surveys carried out are adequate and the forecasts
are realistic.
35.       On the basis of the above-mentioned demand forecast, the effective
generating capacity available in the FEA system would be adequate until
about 1985. However, the firm hydro energy potential of the Monasavu-Wailoa
Scheme (the first power project) being only 159 GWh, there would be a need
for substantial diesel energy generation varying from 75 GWh in 1982 to 150
GWh in 1985. Valued at October 1979 oil prices, this would cost US$4.5
million and US$9.0 million respectively. The need for constructing the
proposed project well before 1985 arises from the established economic
advantage of increasing the scope of hydroelectric generation as early as
possible to realize the expected benefits from fuel savings. The proposed
second power project will add 88 GWh of firm energy and will provide the
energy requirements which would otherwise have to come from the diesel
units.
36.       The proposed project will be followed in a subsequent stage by the
construction of four other weirs and 7.0 km of lined tunnels varying in
diameter from 2.25 m to 2.5 m to divert the flows of the Wainisavulevu River
and two other neighboring streams into the Monasavu reservoir (map). This
will increase the firm energy potential by 152 GWh per year. Financial
arrangements for this future phase will be made by the Government and FEA.



- 11 -
Method of Construction
37.        Heightening of the Monasavu dam and powerhouse extensions will be
carried out through force account by SPD, which was built up for such work
under the ongoing first power project. Construction of the roads, tunnels,
and diversion weirs will be carried out by contracts let after international
competitive bidding. Supply and erection of the third and fourth generating
sets have already been arranged by FEA through the same supplier of the first
and second sets. Project construction is expected to be completed by May 1,
1983.
Cost Estimates
38.        The total project cost is estimated at US$50.0 million, of which
US$26.5 million (53%) would be in foreign exchange. The details of the cost
estimates are given in the Project Summary at the beginning of this report.
The estimates are based on late 1979 prices. The costs for the dam have been
calculated on the basis of detailed designs and experience on the ongoing
power project. The cost estimates for tunnelling are based on recent
construction experience in Fiji and those for equipment are based on options
on contracts with equipment manufacturers for the first power project./l The
total cost of engineering services for the works of the project including
design, procurement and construction supervision is estimated at US$4.89 mil-
lion for a total input of about 550 man-months over the period 1979-1983.
The average base man-month cost is US$8,890. This includes salaries, fees,
travel and subsistence. About 75% of these costs are for foreign
expenditures on expatriate staff and overseas disbursements. Physical
contingencies varying from 5% (for the dam) to 20% (for the tunnels) have
been allowed. Reflecting the purchase of major equipment for which the
price is fixed (or the limit of price escalation is specified) and the
relatively low rate of inflation expected in Fiji during the project
construction period, price contingencies for both foreign and local costs
have been provided at 8% annually. FEA is exempt from duties and taxes.
Financing of the Project
39.        The funds necessary to implement the proposed project would be
obtained from the following sources. The proposed Bank loan of US$15.5 mil-
lion will finance about 30% of the total cost of the project. The loan will
cover all foreign costs of training (US$300,000), and 66% of total costs of
/1 The cost estimate for generating plant is based on the option price
on the third generating set at Wailoa, offered by the successful
bidder for the supply and installation of the first and second sets
under the first power project. FEA has negotiated the same price for
the fourth set as for the third set, on the basis of concurrent supply
and erection of both sets. This is the most economic procedure under
these circumstances for this kind of equipment (which has to be specially
designed for each application) and it has been accepted by the Bank.



- 12 -
contracts for: (a) tunnels and weirs; and (b) generating plant and asso-
ciated equipment. The loan would be for 15 years with 3 years of grace.
FEA would bear the foreign exchange risk of the Bank loan and finance
interest during construction from its own sources.
40.       An EIB loan of US$16.6 million equivalent would, under a joint
financing arrangement with the Bank, cover the remaining costs of the items
financed by the Bank, as well as the costs of heightening the Monasavu dam
and roads.  The EIB loan would be repayable over 11-1/2 years, after 3-1/2
years of grace, at an interest rate of about 8%. The signing of the EIB
loan would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 7.01).
41.       Since the Bank and EIB are jointly financing the total costs of
tunnels, weirs, generating plant and equipment, they are considered to be
financing both the foreign and local costs of these items in proportion to
their respective contributions. In view of the considerable demands of this
project on Fiji's limited resources, Fiji's good overall performance in the
mobilization of domestic resources (which finance about 70% of public devel-
opment expenditures), and the crucial importance of replacing the existing
diesel generation, the extent of local cost financing envisaged under the
project is considered to be fully justified.
42.       CDC has offered to provide a loan of E 5 million for FEA's
system development. Of this amount, about US$4.8 million equivalent would
be made available for financing the heightening of the Monosavu dam under
the proposed project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
4 years of grace, with interest at 8.75%.
43.       The Government will provide at least F$9.3 million (US$11.2 million)
as equity contributions to FEA in accordance with an agreed timetable and
provide additional funds to the extent needed to make up any shortfall in
the financing plan for the project (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
44.       The remaining funds, amounting to US$1.9 million, would be obtained
from a portion of a commercial loan arranged by FEA. This loan, for the
total amount of US$5.0 million, has already been negotiated and is proposed
to be contracted under a co-financing arrangement with the Bank after the
proposed Bank loan is approved. The balance of US$3.1 million will be used
mainly for financing the costs of the first power project. All of the items
to be covered by the commercial loan are essential components of FEA's system
development program, which has been thoroughly examined by the Bank and will
enable Fiji to meet its future energy requirements at least cost. In this
context, the commercial loan is an integral part of a package of financial
assistance to FEA. As this would be our first co-financing operation with
commercial banks on Fiji's behalf, we wish to provide maximum cooperation with
the commercial banks in order to encourage their continued interest in Fiji
and to expand Fiji's exposure to the international financial market. The
Government has also indicated strong preference to have the entire amount of
the commercial loan covered by our co-financing arrangement. Thus we propose
to include the entire amount of the commercial loan in the co-financing
arrangement under the proposed project.



- 13 -
Procurement
45.       Procurement of the goods and services would be handled separately
for those sections of the project to be executed through contracts and those
to be executed by force account. For goods and services procured by contract
and jointly financed by the Bank and EIB, international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines would be used. Contractors for
Bank-financed civil works would be prequalified in consultation with the
Bank. Procurement for force account work would be the responsibility of the
Special Project Division and the consultants in accordance with FEA's
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursement
46.       The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:  (a)
66% of the total cost of the construction contracts for tunnels and weirs;
(b) 66% of the total cost for supply and erection of the generating plant
and associated electrical equipment for the third and fourth generating sets
at the Wailoa power station; and (c) 100% of foreign costs of training. The
EIB loan would finance the balance of the total cost of items (a) and (b)
above, as well as the costs of access roads and heightening of the dam. The
closing date would be December 31, 1983.
Financial Position and Covenants
47.       In July 1978, FEA took over SCCED.  The acquisition of SCCED's
plant increased FEA's gross fixed assets by about 50% to a value of F$27.2
million. It also assumed the long-term debts of SCCED, amounting to F$6.9
million, and agreed to pay the Suva City Council F$200,000 a year for 87
years. Following the takeover of SCCED, FEA's financial performance improved
because of the inclusion of revenues from Suva customers who were subjected
to FEA's higher tariffs. During the five-month period to December 31, 1978,
FEA earned F$985,000 compared to F$139,000 for the whole of the previous
fiscal year. In 1979 (the first fiscal year following the takeover), FEA
achieved a rate of return of 4.1% on its average net fixed assets in
operation after revaluation based on operating income of about F$1.8
million. The takeover adversely affected FEA's debt/equity ratio, but,
after adjusting the accounts to reflect the recent revaluation of assets, it
is estimated to be about 49/51 in 1979; a safe level and well below the
70/30 limitation required under the first power loan agreement.
48.       Under the first power project, FEA agreed to establish an appropri-
ate rate of return on currently valued average net fixed assets in operation
with effect from 1979. In this context, tariffs should be set to provide
revenues sufficient to cover FEA's operating expenses, interest and repayment
of debt and to finance a reasonable portion of FEA's investment program.
During 1979, FEA undertook a valuation of its fixed assets, which showed that
its gross fixed assets and provision for depreciation should be revalued by
about 86% to reflect current values as of January 1, 1979.
49.       Following the SCCED takeover, Suva customers were charged FEA
rates which were about 40% above the old SCCED rates. Subsequently rates
were increased for all FEA consumers by 7% in July 1979 and 12% in October



- 14 -
1979 to partially offset increases in fuel costs. However, FEA's future
financial performance depends upon its willingness and ability to pass on to
consumers increases in fuel costs at least until the hydro project is fully
commissioned around 1983. Fuel costs have already reached a level of F$238
a tonne, the price which was used by FEA in its 1980 budget.
50.       FEA has agreed to set tariffs to provide internally generated
funds of F$1.5 million (US$1.8 million) in each of its fiscal years 1980 and
1981 in accordance with its current plans. Although no specific tariff
adjustment mechanism was agreed, FEA's undertaking to achieve a specific
level of cash generation through tariff increases will ensure recovery of
fuel costs in 1980 and 1981. FEA has also agreed to maintain tariffs after
1981 at a level sufficient to produce an annual rate of return of 8% on its
revalued net fixed assets in operation (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
The method of revaluation will be agreed by December 31, 1981.
51.       Under the first power loan agreement, FEA agreed to consult with
the Bank whenever its debt/equity ratio exceeded 70/30. If FEA is able to
achieve an 8% rate of return, the level of debt to equity is not expected to
be higher than 64/36, the likely level for 1982. Debt service coverage will
be low as internal sources of funds will only meet net debt service
commitments.
52.       A review of the level and structure of FEA's tariffs, which will
take account of the m.-rginal costs of supply, is being undertaken by con-
sultants. FEA will inform the Bank of any changes it proposes to make to
the tariff rates; make available to the Bank the results of its tariff study
at least one month prior to taking any action; and furnish to the Bank any
proposals for major modifications to its tariff structure (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 5.05).
Project Justification
53.       Forecasts of the growth of electricity demand on Viti Levu island
have been reviewed for the period 1979-83 by FEA's consultants who have
carried out detailed market surveys identifying major new customers. On the
basis of the most recent review and the current trend in oil and electricity
prices, FEA and its consultants have adopted a lower growth rate of 5% up to
1983, and 7% thereafter. These growth rates could be higher if the Viti
Copper Mine project on which a decision is expected within 2-3 years is
approved or if the Emperor Gold Mines (EGM) decides to buy electricity
available from FEA.  After the commissioning of the first 40 MW of plant at
Wailoa, there would be sufficient generating capacity, including diesel plant,
to meet the anticipated demand until about 1985. However, it has been
established that it would be financially advantageous for FEA to advance the
installation of the third and fourth generating sets at the Wailoa power
station as this would obviate the need for diesel energy generation from
1983. The saving at 1979 fuel prices is estimated at about US$4.5 million
in 1983, increasing to US$9.0 million by 1985, which far exceeds the total
cost of advancing the installation of the two generating sets.



- 15 -
54.       Recent studies by FEA's consultants (Gibb) have shown that the
earliest practicable development of an all-hydroelectric system is the most
economic means of meeting the anticipated growth in demand after comparing
all available alternatives. The internal economic rate of return on the
proposed project is at least 15%.
Environment
55.       Surveys carried out by Gibb in consultation with the environmental
adviser to the Fiji Government and the University of South Pacific have
revealed no significant adverse effect as a result of the project. There is
no habitation in the project area nor are there any artifacts of any signifi-
cance which will be affected. The Department of Health has expressed the
opinion that there are no diseases existing in the rest of Fiji which do not
exist in the area adjacent to the project sites. The environmental effects of
the project are therefore minimal and within the capacity of the Fiji
authorities to cope.
Risks
56.       The risks associated with the project are the uncertainties inherent
in all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological problems, hydro-
logical complexities and construction delays. However, the competent prepara-
tory work undertaken, as well as precautions taken in organizing and super-
vising the construction works, reduce these risks in this case to a minimum.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Fiji Electricity
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Fiji and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.
58.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Signing of the EIB loan agreement has been made an additional
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01).
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.



- 16 -
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the rroposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 1140-FIJ         Second Telecommunications Pro-ject:  US$5.0
Million Loan of July 16, 1975; Effectiveness Date:
October 23, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Progress with this project is satisfactory. It suffered some delay
in its early stages due to local investments restrictions imposed by the
Government in 1976 but much of the lost time has been recovered. Project
completion is now expected by June 1980, a delay of about one year from the
original schedule. The Government approved an increase in tariffs during
1978 and this has strengthened P&T's financial position. An additional
tariff increase has also been approved effective January 1980 which should
further improve P&T's finances.
Loan No. 1226-FIJ         Sugar Development Prolect:  US$12.0 Million Loan
of April 23, 1976; Effectiveness Date: July 13,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project consists of an 8,000 acre settlement scheme for more
than 800 families to grow sugarcane on previously uncultivated land, and
drainage improvement on 26,400 acres for about 2,000 other families on
traditional coastal sugarcane land. The settlement component which accounts
for about 66% of project costs, is virtually complete and sugarcane
production from the settlement area has surpassed the target for the third
straight year. Progress on drainage improvement was delayed due to farmers'
reluctance to pay drainage rates, staffing problems, and poor contractor
performance. Action was taken to remedy the situation and performance is now
satisfactory. Disbursements are about 30% below original estimates and some
cost savings now appear likely.
Loan No. 1596-FIJ         Monasavu-Wailoa Hydroelectric Prolect:  US$15.0 Mil-
lion Loan of November 30, 1978; Effectiveness Date:
January 10, 1979; Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
All major contracts have been placed in accordance with the project
implementation program and within the cost estimates. Construction of the

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-

them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

project infrastructure, about 60% of the foundation excavation of the main
dam and the diversion tunnel have been completed. River diversion is
programed for May 1980. Construction of the main dam is on schedule for
commencement of impounding by October 1981. Work on the main water-conductor
system has fallen behind the contract schedule (which calls for completion
by June 1981) due to a delay of four months in providing access at the power
station end and because of slower than expected progress by the contractor.
Steps are being taken to synchronize completion of the tunnels and steel
lining, to enable operation of the power station by the target date - end
1981. The project cost is now estimated at about F$52 million, as against
the estimated F$49 million. The increases are on works being carried out
by force-account, viz. the infrastructure and the dam and power house civil
works.
