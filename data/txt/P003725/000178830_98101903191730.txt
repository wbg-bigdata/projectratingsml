INTEPIIATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REFORT AT\M RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DT?ECTOPu5 ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INTDONESIA FOR A THIRD TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$4 million on
standard IDA terms for a third technical assistance project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Indonesia has received sixteen IDA credits for a total amount
of US$227.4 million.   The IDA program for Indonesia reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government. To support
the Government's program for increasing agricultural production the Association
has made several credits in that sector, mainly for the rehabilitation of
irrigation systems and of rubber, palm oil and tea estates.   These account
for two-fifths of IDA lending to Indonesia, and for more than half if the
Association's share in the PUSRI fertilizer project is included.   In order
to facilitate rapid rehabilitation in those sectors,credits for highways,
power, telecommunications and education have been made.   In recognition of
the urgent need for institutional reforms, a number of IDA projects have
included major steps to reorganize existing institutions or establish new ones.
At the same time, to supplement the Government's efforts in improving adminis-
tration and management, each credit has included provision for consultant
services and other technical assistance.   In addition, the two previous
technical assistance credits have financed part of the cost of pre-investment
studies undertaken by the Government during the last two years, which have
helped to establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities.
A summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments is at Annex 1.
3.        In addition to the present project, nine others are expected to be
ready in time for presentation to the Executive Directors in the current
fiscal year.   Besides further projects in irrigation rehabilitation, agri-
cultural estates, highways and power distribution, these include a number of
projects in priority fields not hitherto assisted: family planning, agri-
cultural education, development finance, smallholder rubber, and marine
transport.   Credits for all these projects would amount to roughly $140
million.   Depending on the availability of IDA funds for Indonesia during
FY 1972, some may have to be held over until FY 1973.
4.        The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968 and
eleven of the sixteen credits were made since June 1, 1970.   The program is
thus relatively new, and largely for this reason the undisbursed portion of
the credits is large.   Another contributing factor is that virtually every



2-
one of the credits has introduced extensive institutional reform, involving
such matters as the creation of new project authorities, the drawing up of
new charters, and the enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken
rmch time.   Credits experiencing pronounced delays in disbursement include
those for the first and second agricultural estates projects (Credits Nos.
155 and 194), whose implementation has been delayed by problems of organiza-
tion and management.   These continue to cause concern;   the Government is
aware of the problems and is taking remedial action.    The Electricity
Distribution Project (Credit No. 165) was delayed for more than six months
because of problems in selecting and appointing consultants, but orders are
now being placed for equipment and progress is satisfactory.    The Education
Project (Credit No. 219) is also about six months behind schedule because of
delays in the Government's negotiations with various consulting firms, but
is now getting underway.   A three-month delay was experienced in the Second
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project due to difficulties in establishing a new
project authority, but construction contracts have now been awarded and it
is expected that disbursementswill soon rise sharply.    The effectiveness of
the Third Rehabilitation Project was delayed for three months because of
delays in recruiting expatriate advisors: planning and design are progressing
satisfactorill but construction is only just starting.    The main contractors
for the FUSRI Fertilizer Expansion Project (Credit No. 193) have been selected
and contrac-ts have been negotiated and submitted for the lenders' approval;
though disbursements will not rise until the second half of 1972, when
financing of equipment contracts will commence, the borrower's performance
on this complex industrial project can be considered quite satisfactoly.
After a long delay in choosing management consuiltants for the Telecommunications
ProJect (Credit No. 210), the contract for the main item, the Trans-Sumatra
Micro-wave Nletwork, has recently been let and is expected to lead to an early
rise in disbursements.   The overall disbursement rate of the Indonesian
lending program has risen sharply in recent months.    Total disbursements as
of October 31 were US$30 million; of this amount, US$21 million have been
disbursed since April 1, 1971.    The pace of disbursements is expected to
accelerate further, in view of the fact that orders have been placed or
contracts awarded amounting to US$59 million as of October 31.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        The latest Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a of November 30,
1971) finds that Indonesia's economic progress continues to be satisfactory.
The economy appears to be growing during 1971 at around 6-7 percent in terms
of GDP, while price stability is also being maintained.    Production of rice,
the basic commodity, has increased substantially, for the fourth successive
year.   In the industrial sector, especially in textiles, there is further
substantial growth.   With private foreign investment accelerating, and the
rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises being fostered under
official programs, the prospects of industrial growth from the present small
base are good.



-3-
6.        Nevertheless, only the beginnings of progress have been made and
the problems which remain to be tackled are enormous.   Progress is being
made in formulating concrete plans, programs and projects and in arranging
and organizing for the execution of such plans, so that deficiencies of this
type, though pronounced, are not at the moment the most pressing constraints.
The more immediate constraint at this point appears to be in the limited
material and financial resources available.   The pressure on these resources
in the current year is evidenced by the continuing high rates of interest
which prevail in the economy and by the necessity for a devaluation in August
designed in part as a precaution in the face of international uncertainties
and in part to restrain import demand following a 105S in foreign exchange
reserves.   In the coming year there is prospect of a significant increment
in both foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues as a result
principally of sharp increases in oil production and the volume and
especially the value of oil exports.   The demand for resources is so great,
however, that this increment will moderate but not reduce the need for aid to
supplement the domestic resources available for enterprise and Government
investment and the improvement of essential Government services.
7.        Govemment revenuBs in 1971/72 are nof estimated to increase by,\- 20
percent over the previous year.   A much larger increase, 36 percent, is
projected for 1972/73.   The largest item in this increase would be from
taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies.   Other revenues
are nevertheless planned to increase by 18 percent.  The increment of Rp
150 billion ($360 million) will finance increases in salaries and material
expenditures in the ordinary budget, while still allowing for a doubling to
Rp 136 billion in the size of the surplus available for the development budget.
Together with a slightly smaller amount of counterpart funds gener'ated by progrEm
aid than-in 1971/72 (an estimated Rp 95 billion instead of the Rp G7 bAIlion
forecast for this year) this will provide for a rupiah development budget hO
percent larger than tnat for 1971/72 and represent an increase of Rp 66 billion
over this year's resources.
8.        Investment levels in Indonesia are still comparatively low, 13-14
percent of GDP at most with domestic resources, including increased liquidity,
financing half of the total or less.    Savings propensities appear to be low,
and the financing of development programs in the public and private sectors
cannot rely heavily on monetary expansion.   The task of mobilizing additional
development resources rests, therefore, primarily on fiscal policy.    If
private domestic investment is to be adequately funded, it appears likely that
a larger proportion of public savings will have to be channelled to the
enterprise sector.   An increased allocation for this sector is, in fact,
provided for in next year's development budget.



- h -
9.        The devaluation on August 23, 1971, indicates how quickly and
directly the Indonesian authorities had to respond, in the first phase of
the new monetary development, to external influences on the very open
economy, following a moderate loss in the economy's already low foreign
exchange reserves.   This experience should not have to be repeated because
the prospective increase in oil export earnings offers Indonesia an opportunity
to plan with some confidence,provided that external aid inflows are maintained,
for an increase in reserves of $90 million next year.   Gross reserves were
$170 million at the end of September 1971 while net reserves amounted to
minus $85 million.
10.       Exports are expected to rise by 10 percent in 1971/72 with the
prospect of a 29 percent increase in 1972/73.   Most of this is accounted for
by oil exports which will increase by 40 percent in 1971/72 because of price
increases during the year and over 100 percent in 1972/73 with increased
production at the higher price now established; and by timber exports, up
44 percent in 1971/72 and projected to increase by 27 percent to $220 million
in 1972/73.   For all other exports, the projections are for a decline in
aggregate value in 1971/72 and modest recovery' in the following year.  Total
exports are estimated at $1,270 million in 1972/73.
11.       Imports of goods and services of $1,778 million are projected for
1972/73.    The current account deficit of $508 million would be slightly
larger than that forecast for this year.   Debt payments will be slightly
lower, the expected increase in private capital inflows somewhat higher, and
public capital inflow, at $520 million, is expected to be higher by $75 million,
because of increased project aid utilization, than that forecast for 1971/72.
12.       Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the Inter-Governmental Group
for Indonesia.   Commitments of aid have risen from $200 million of program
aid in 1967 to well over $600 million in all forms of aid for 1971/72.   The
proportion of project aid has increased over this period, but substantial
program aid remains essential for balance of payments support and, in spite of
the strong domestic revenue efforts, as a supplement to rupiah resources for
the development budget.   For 1972/73 the Government is requesting IGGI aid
commitments of $670 million of which $350 million is project aid, a higher
proportion than last year.   The program aid request of $320 million is
substantially lower than that for 1971/72, mainly because the prospect of
further growth in rice production reduces the food aid component from $160
million to $110 million for next year.   Expressed in US dollars the total
request is slightly larger than the request for 1971/72; in terms of currencies
which have revalued against the dollar in recent months, including those
of other IGGI member countries, it is somewhat less.



13.       following the rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external debt,
which culminated in April 1970 in agreement on a long-term settlement of the
debts held by W'estern creditors and Japan, and the subsequent separate
agreement on similar lines with Eastern European countries, the ratio of
external debt service to exports is currently low.    It will rise appreciably
throughout the 1970's as grace periods expire on aid received after 1966, but
should remain manageable during the decade - it is estimated at 1B percent in
1978 - if good export performance continues and if new aid remains available
on concessional terms similar tc those at present obtained from the IGGIo
I11 aid from the IGGI donors has been given on concessional terms approximating
the standards set by the DAC.   Consistently with this pattern, the Bank Group's
assistance to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has so far been provided
exclusively in the form of IDA credits.
PART III   -   THE PROJECT
14.       Foreign technical assistance is being extensively used in Indonesia,
in investment planning, at the sector and project level, in detailed engineering
and design, in the execution of physical work, in planning the creation and
reorganization of operating agencies and organizations, in assisting in the
implementation of such plans, and in the improvement of management and technical
operations generally.   Indonesia is receiving technical assistance from IGGI
members, from UNDP, from the Asian Development Bank and from the Association,
The Bank's Resident Staff assists the Government in planning, arranging for,
and coordinating technical assistance.    The Association's own technical
assistance credits have financed only a small. part of the technical assistance
beina received by Indonesia, but this part has been of great value, in that it
has financed essential work for which assistance from other sources was considered
by the Government for various reasons to be inappropriate, or likely to be less
effective, or where it coul.d not be obtained sufficiently rapidly, or at all.
Authority for selection and execution of sub-projects under these credits rests
with the Director of the Resident Stcaff in Djakarta.   Funds available under the
first two technical assistance credits are now either fully committed or expected
to be committed in the near future, and the Government of Indonesia has asked the
Association for a third credit of $4 million.
1$.       The following tables show the commitments made to date against the
previous technical assistance credits, as well as the earmarkings agreed between
the Resident Staff and the Government, pending formal conclusion of contracts
with consultants:

As of November 15, 1971, $1,209,000 had been disbursed from Credit 135-IND
and $1,063,000 from Credit 216-IND.
16.       The lending program. in Indonesia already reflects the work carried.
out under the technical assistance credits.   The preparation of the seeds
production project (Item 3 above), for example, has led to a credit (No. 246-IND)
and the exploration of groundwater resources (Item 5 above) will form part of
the Fourth Irrigation RLehabilitation Project which we expect to present to the
Executive Directors in January or February.   Detailed engineering of the
Trans-Sumatra Highway (Item 15 above) formed the basis of the Second Highway
Project; the balance of that road will be financed under the Third Highway
Project which will also include the construction of a road in North Sulawesi,
the engineering and design for which is being financed from Credit 135-IND
(Item 9 above).   The West Java electric power feasibility study is intended
to identify future power generating needs and the most efficient way of meeting
them; this, in all likelihood, will be a gas based thermal plant, the financing



-8-
of which we envisage in the FY73 lending program.   Consultant services for
water supply systems in seven cities (Item 17 above) are expected to lead in
IYM to the Association's first W[ater Supply project in Indonesia.   The
estates management study (Item 12 above) fills a need recognized during the
implementation of our estates projec-ts and will facilitate further lending.
Based on a UTFJP financed master plan, the Bali tourism area development plan
( tem 18 above) iE intended to define a specific first-phase project for
Bank Group financing.
17.       The purpose of the new credit is to continue to provide the ty-pe
o- assistance given under the -two previous technical assistance credits.  As
in the case of those credits, it will finance pre-investment planning,
including detai'ed engineering and, as necessary) consulting and advisory
servJices to project agencies.   Although much of the work financed
to date and to be financed in the future is directly related to projects already
being financed by the Bank Group or being prepared with a view to such financing,
some of it relates to projects and programs for which construction finance will
be provided by the Government itself or other aid-givers,   In a few instances,
the existing and proposed technical assistance credits finance work by the
Government which is preparatory to or associated with projects to be undertaken
and financed by private investors.
18.       The proposed credit would enable the Association to earmark, in
response to the Government's requests, further funds for high priority studies
and engineering services where no alternative suitable or timely sources are
in sight.   The Government has made several requests for studies to help
provide a policy framework in various sectors of agriculture, and has also
requested a river basin study for the P-omali-Tjomal area which alone might
cost $500,000.   In industry it is envisaged that feasibility studies would
be carried out for a second fertilizer plant and for an indigenous integrated
steel industry based on modern direct reduction processes -- as well as
technical advisory services relating to the exploitation of hydro-energy for
aluminum production at Asahan in North Sumatra.   Other potential requests are
for studies relating to development of forestry products, petrochemicals, and
engineering industries, and possibly also technical assistance to the public
power authority in preparing a rnational plan for introduction of automatic
switching equipment.   The speci+fic uses of the new credit are not yet, however,
determined in detail  its maLn justification is that it will provide the
Government with funds to tackle unfcreseen and urgent requirements, as has
been successfully done with the previous two credits.   We expect that the
proposed credit would continue to fineace, to an even larger extent than
hitherto, the final engineering of projects specifically intended for Association
financing where the use of those funds would substantially reduce the lead-time
between project identification and appraisal and between approval and disbursement.



- 9 -
19.       The proposed credit would in all essential respects follow the
Pattern used in the first two credits and would thus also be on standard
IDA terms. The Government of Indonesia would contribute to the financing
of the various technical assistance activities not less than 15 percent
of the cost of the services concerned, including contributions in kind.
In sub-projects committed so far, the Government's contribution has always
exceeded 15 percent. The Director of the Bank's Resident Staff would con-
tinue to act for the Association in dealing with matters related to the
eelection and execution of sub-projects.
20.       In assessing the need for the proposed credit, the Iesident Staff
has again reviewed the availability of technical assistance from other sources.
Again it was found that despite the considerable technical assistance avail-
able from UNDP and bilateral sources, substantial additional technical
assistance is still required for both planning and engineering of projects
for which investment funds would be available once they have been prepared.
Since some IGGI members are shifting their technical assistance from a grant
basis to a loan basis, we might expect an even greater preference by Govern-
ment for the use of IDA funds since they can be used for a wide range of
activities, can be drawn upon quickly and can finance expertise available
on an international basis. While we shall continue to make all efforts to
incorporate funds in project credits to finance studies for future lending
in the respective fields, there continues to be a pressing need for the
funding of technical assistance activities which the credit would provide.
PART IV - LEGAL INBTRUMEINTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the recommendation of the Couittee referred
to in Article V Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive DLrectors separately. The draft Development
Credit Agreement is in the usual fozn for this type of project, and its
provisions are virtually identical to those of the Agreement for the Second
Technical Assistance Credit (No. 216-IND of September 15, 1970).
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - ROOMM(ENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive DLrectors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
