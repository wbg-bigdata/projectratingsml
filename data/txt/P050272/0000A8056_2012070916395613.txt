                         Competitiveness of the private Sector and the capacity of its representative organizations? have progressed well and have accomplished a significant portion of their objectives.

                         Disbursements: As of April 2012, the Project has disbursed US$13.8 million of the US$17 million, accounting for nearly 82 percent of the total project allocation.
                         The Project has also had unforeseen foreign exchange savings of close to $1 million due to exchange rate fluctuations. To better utilize resources to achieve the project development
                         objectives, the Government has requested a five months extension of the Closing Date from August 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 via a letter dated April 5, 2012. In addition,
                         through a subsequent letter dated June 13, 2012, the Government has requested (i) reallocation of the grant and credit across project components and existing expenditure
                         categories, and (ii) revision of the PDO indicators and intermediate result indicators to streamline the number of indicators. The M&E indicators will be changed to streamline the
                         framework and to reflect the reduction of project funds to US $17.0 million as US$ 7.0 million was reallocated towards the mitigation effort in aid of the Global food crisis in November

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         After discussion with the Project team, it was agreed that the remaining activities under the Project can be implemented within 8 months and an extension by 5 months from the
                         closing date of 31 July 2012, will enable the Project to achieve its objective. The VRP audit (special audit) that focuses on the performance of VRP component was received but with
                         a delay. Thus, upon receipt of the outstanding VRP audit report, the Bank team has now initiated the processing of the Project closing date extension by an additional 5 months to 31
                         December 2012.
