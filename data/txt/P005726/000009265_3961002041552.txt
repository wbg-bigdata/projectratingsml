MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR AECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum ar.d recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Rep,uiuic of Tunisia for US$75 million equivalent are submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would help finance a Higher Education Restructuring Project which
aims at making the higher education system more cost-effective and responsive to
the needs of the Tunisian economy. The loan would have a term of seventeen years,
including a five-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    Backgro . To sustain growth, Tunisia must increase the efficiency of its
investments and continue to attract foreign investment in an environment made
more competitive by price and trade liberalization. The skills of the labor
force are critical to the drive for higher productivity and real incomes.
Successive governments have placed human resource investments center stage in
their development strategies, giving special emphasis to basic education, primary
health care and family planning, and obtaining social welfare indicators that
place Tunisia in the forefront of the African continent and the Arab world. The
current administration has also introduced major changes in the management of
hospitals and of employment training services, aimed at creating greater
accountability and responsiveness to client needs. It now intends to introduce
complementary reforms in the higher education syst3m, a seriously underutilized
development asset.
3.    Since independence in 1956, Tunisia has made considerable progress in
developing higher education.   Since the creation in 1960 of a National
U-niversity, enrollment has grown from 2 thousand to nearly 69 thousand, and in
1990, nearly 6 thousand students graduated from six universities. Nine out of
ten academic staff are now Tunisian nationals.   Higher education plays an
important role in social mobility : about 401 of enrollments are first-generation
university  students,  and the  same proportion  are women.    Despite  such
achievements, there are still serious shortcomings as measured against the needs
of the economy and the aspirations of students and parents.  The number of
available graduates falls short of the number of managerial and technical
vacancies to be filled, especially for the fast-growing service and export
industry sectors, but also for well-established professions such as secondary
school teaching. This shortage is symptomatic of rigid course offerings still
biased toward long theoretical studies designed for entry into the higher
echelons of the civil service, as opposed to shorter applied programs now in
greater demand. The university planning system is largely unresponsive to such
market signals; at the same time, arbitrary cutoffs for admission based only on
subject-specific exam scores result in many students taking courses which are not
their first choice.
4.    This lack of flexibility and motivation is compounded by the cumulative
effects of congestion. The low level of recurrent expenditures available per
student per year, combined with inadequate teaching methods and support services,



-2-
has contributed to high repetition and drop-out rates. These imply very high
costs per graduate and massive waste of physical and teaching staff resources.
The low productivity of post-graduate studies results in the declining
availability of qualified lecturers. Excessive uniformity of course structure,
content and delivery, the absence of independent evaluation, and overcentralized
management irhibit iritiatives for improvement.
5.     overMent strategy. The Government is committed to developing Tunisia's
higher-level human resources potential and opening further avenues of social
mobility for lower income groups and for women. It intends to increase enrollment
rates for 20-24 year-olds from the present 8Z to about 141 by the year 2000. To
expand access within likely budget constraints and still improve the system's
responsiveness to user needs, the Government has opted for a cost-reduction
strategy based primarily on a sharp decrease in the average duration of studies.
This is attainable through a combination of (a) rapid development of a new type
of higher education institution offering only short vocationalized courses, and
(b) restructuring of existing university programs so as to emphasize shorter,
self-contained cycles of study, and greater choice and selectivity in moving
between cycles.
6.   Rt&ionale for Bank involvement. The Bank's advice has been instrumental in
helping the Tunisian Government to design the two main institutional elements of
this strategy: an incentive mechanism to encourage reform of existing courses,
and market-friendly governance arrangements for new institutions. Continued
involvement will be essential to launch, implement, and monitor them. This effort
will also complement Bank support for the reforms initiated in primary and
secondary education (FY 89 Education and Training Sector Loan, Loan no. 3054-TUN)
and the measures taken to increase labor mobility (Employment and Training Fund,
Loan no. 3255-TUN). In particular, improved efficiency in higher education will
reduce the shortage of qualified secondary school teachers. More broadly, the
proposed project complements the macroeconomic reforms already introduced, with
Bank support, to improve the competitiveness of an increasingly outward-oriented
economy.
7.    Project objectives.   The project supports the government strategy of
modernizing and diversifying higher education programs so as to enhance labor
market relevance and student choice and shorten the average length of studies.
It would do so by developing an alternative model of para-university institutions
responsive to business needs, by providing direct incentives for internal change
within existing universities, and by improving evaluation and resource management
capacity throughout the system.
8.    Project Descrintion. The first component of the project would help create
a new generation of Higher Institutes of Tecbnology (ISET) (US$75.2 million base
cost). These autonomous institutes would offer two-year intensive programs aimed
at training technicians and middle managers. Five ISETs would be developed in
the main economic and industrial regions. Three ISETs would be constructed in
Tunis, Sousse and Sfax, and existing sites at Nabeul and Gabbs would be converted
into ISETs. They represent a radical departure from the conventional university
framework: seIection based on individual screening for aptitude and motivation



-3-
in addition to exam results; enrollment limited to some 1800 students; a total
attendance requirement of 2,000 hours in 2 years (compare 400 hours per year in
university) including compulsory internships in businesses; correspondingly
higher workload, and improved career and salary structure, for teactling staff.
Curricula would include disciplines related to industry (e.g. mechanical,
electrical and electronic engineering, and maintenance) and services (e.g.
accounting, computer science and marketing), adapted to local enterprise and
regional employment characteristics.
9.   The ISETs' specially-designed legal status would allow for incroased
financial and administrative autonomy, participation of employers iTl the
management board, ability to charge fees for services, recruitment of teaching
staff under fixed-term contracts and free-for-service training contracts with
enterprises. To reduce the serious shortage of qualified teachers in technical
sciences (1,100 positions in the existing institutions, of which 25X are
foreigners) and to avoid the wastage rates inherent in formal postgraduate
training overseas, a new postgraduate training network, relying heavily on
contracts with specialized Tunisian institutes and twinning with foreign
technical colleges, has been designed and will be implemented under the project.
Thi.s system will train the required 600 technical teaching staff for the ISETs
under the project.
10.      The second component would be a National Program for University
Improvement (PNRU) (US$31 million). This program would channel funds, through a
competitive and transparent process, towards existing universities for the
introduction of new courses, improvements and restructuring of existing courses,
and/or improvements in facilities benefiting several programs, such as libraries.
Sub-projects proposed by universities would be selected by a structured peer-
review process (the Committee for University Improvement, CRU). Resources would
be allocated according to well-defined selection criteria and operational
guidelines included in a procedural manual developed before appraisal and already
in use in draft form. The selection criteria reflect the main features of the
Government university reform program: they provide incentives for accelerated
self-contained first-degree programs, for diversification of masters-level
streams to increase career options, for improving and condensing secondary
teacher training programs, and for reorganizing doctoral studies.
11.   Finally, the project would finance improved evaluation and resource
management capacities (US$6.1 million base cost) at both the MRS and higher
education institutions levels. This would involve: the design and implementation
of a performance-based budgetary allocation system; the introduction of
appropriate management information systems, in particular with regard to student
admissions and records, facility utilization and course timetables; the
establishment of an evaluation body and the implementation of an accreditation
system for the higher education system; the training of university administrative
and management staff; and the strengthening of MES organizational structure,
through the creation of units in charge of the implementation of the PNRU and
ISET programs and of academic planning and development.

12. Cg8t and Financing. The proposed project of US$ 126.3 million equivalent,
to be implemented in seven years, would be financed as follows: (i) a proposed
IBRD loan of US$75 million would finance 1001 of the foreign exchange component
of the project, equivalent to 64.51 of total project costs net of taxes; (Hi) the
Government would finance the balance of project costs of US$51.3 million,
including US$9.6 million equivalent in taxes and duties. A breakdown of project
costs and the financing plan are shcwn in Schedule A. In order to facilitate the
timely development of project activities, retroactive financing of up to US$4
million would be included.   Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. The staff appraisal report No. 9795-TUN, dated December
20, 1991, is being dlstributed separately.
13.   Princival Actions Agreed Unon.
(i)   Effectiveness conditions as follows: (i) the formal establishment
(parliamentary approval and enabling decrees) of the legal statutes
of the ISETs and their teaching staff, and creation of the JSETs of
Tunis, Sfax and Sousse; (ii) the transmission to the Bank of the
procedural manual for the PNRU; (iii) the appointment, within MES,
of a Project Coordinator; and (iv) the establishment of the
organizational units in charge of the implementation of the PNRU and
ISET within the MES and the appointment of their managers.
(ii)  In addition, the Government has provided assurances that (i) the law
changing the legal personality of the existing institutions of
Nabeul and Gabbs to that of an ISET should be published no later
than December 31, 1992; (ii) sub-project proposals selected for
financing under the PNRU and estimated at an amount equal to or in
excess of US$500,000, and the first ten sub-project proposals
regardless of their cost, will be submitted to the Bank for prior
review; (iii) the new budgeting system will be implemented for the
preparation and allocation of the higher education Budget beginning
in 1995.
14.   Benefits. The project is expected to lower public outlays per graduate and
expand the range of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications. An improved
response by the higher education system to the demands of the economy, i.e.
producing graduates with the appropriate skills, would lead to increased economic
productivity and growth.
15.   Risks.  The success of the reform being implemented by the Government will
depend upon the ISETs' ability to fulfill their mandate as originally laid out
in their statute, as well as the willingness of the university community to
implement the reform program. These risks have been reduced through
extensive Government consultations with the academic community since 1990 to
ensure participation of all concerned parties in elaborating the objectives of
reform and the measures to be implemented. In addition, the project will minimize
the potential impact of these risks by: creating ISETs as independent entities
outside the university system, employing their staff under new conditions of



.5-
service and providing them with appropriate training; and using the University
Improvement component and the new budgeting procedures as incentives for
individual university departments to buy into the reform process.
16. E.nmromegntalimnpact. This proposed project was reviewed under the Bank's
Environmental Assessment procedures and was determined to be in screening
Category C, which includes projects which are not expected to result in
significant negative environmental impact.
17.  RecoMmendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
