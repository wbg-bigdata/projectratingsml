                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in
making its higher education system more cost-effective and respon-
sive to the needs of its labor market by: (i) increasing the number
of technical graduates; (ii) providing incentives to higher
education institutions to reform their programs and curricula; and
(iii) strengthening the higher education system's planning and
management capacity and improving the distribution and use of
resources following a normative system for resource allocation.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     Establishment of Higher Institutes of Technology (ISETs)
      Carrying out of a program to establish five (5) ISETs offering
intensive programs aimed at training technical graduates, consisting
of:
1.    Construction of three (3) new ISETs in Tunis, Sfax and Sousse,
and conversion of the ISTs in Nabeul and Gab\1as into ISETs, and
provision of equipment, furniture, textbooks and technical assis-
tance.
Page  10
2.    Development of a permanent training capacity for the teaching
staff of the ISETs as required to assure that said staff deliver the
appropriate learning and practical experience, through the: (i)
provision of: (A) training, including local scholarships, overseas
fellowships and stipends; and (B) pedagogical equipment, materials
and textbooks; and (ii) establishment of a unit to be responsible
for coordinating, designing and monitoring the teacher training.
3.    Provision of consultants' services to the ISETs for: (i)
curriculum and program development; (ii) formulation of equipment
needs; (iii) training of department managers during the first year
of ISETs' operation; and (iv) course and program monitoring and
student evaluation, including a mid-program pedagogical evaluation.
Part B:    National Program for University Improvement (PNRU)
1.    Carrying out of a program providing incentives to existing
higher education institutions to undertake programs and curricula
reform to increase their internal and external efficiency and
improve the quality of the instruction and learning process, through
funding of Sub-projects aimed, inter alia, at introducing new
undergraduate study programs, diversifying career options, improving
training programs for secondary teachers and engineers, increasing
computer availability, improving library and related services and
reorganizing post-graduate study programs, to be selected on the
basis of agreed selection criteria and operational indicators as set
forth in the PNRU procedural manual.
2.    Construction of small rehabilitation works, and provision of
equipment, furniture, educational materials and consultants'
services in respect thereof.
Part C:     Strengthening of Planning and Managerial Capabilities
      Provision of consultants' services, office equipment,
vehicles, training, local scholarships and overseas fellowships for:
1.    Development of a normative performance-based budgetary
allocation system of human, physical and financial resources
(SAGES), consisting of the: (i) setting up of a data bank on the
existing higher education resources, organization and delivery
system; (ii) definition, on the basis of such information, of norms
to optimally allocate said resources; and (iii) introduction, at the
MES's level, of a computerized allocation system to apportion, on
the basis of such norms, the annual higher education operating
budget and equipment among institutions.
2.    Strengthening of the managerial and maintenance capabilities
in higher education institutions in the areas of student admission
and records, course programming and facility utilization.
3.    Establishment of an evaluation body to evaluate the efficiency
of higher education programs and implementation of an accreditation
system for all new curricula proposed by higher education institu-
tions.
4.    Provision of training to university managers to enable them to
effectively carry out their newly-defined responsibilities under the
reformed university system.
5.    Strengthening of the MES through the reorganization of its
internal structure, including the establishment of a unit respon-
sible for academic and planning development, a Unit for Evaluation,
Projects and Programs, a Unit for Technological Studies, and, within
the Department of Planning and Statistics, a unit responsible for
the university management rationalization program.
                           *   *   *   *

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                   Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                   deposits into the Special Account at such inter-

           (ii)    Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                   the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                   documents and other evidence required pursuant
                   to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                   or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                   requested. On the basis of each such request,
                   the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
                   withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into
                   the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                   shall have requested and as shall have been
                   shown by said documents and other evidence to
                   have been paid out of the Special Account for
                   Eligible Expenditures.

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the

Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
Page  15
to the Eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
       Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible
Expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
