EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT - EWP
1. INTRODUCTION
In parallel, PWA with donor support (USAID, AFD and the WB) intends to accelerate the
implementation of a program of priority capital investments that would increase available
water in the southern West Bank by drilling and equipping five deep wells as well as laying
related primary transmission and distribution pipelines. This integrated program would convey
additional water throughout the southern area where the water supply situation is dire.
As a part of the comprehensive program, PWA proposed' an Emergency Water Project to
alleviate the deteriorated water supply services within the southern area of the West Bank by
supporting priority investment packages focusing on enhancing water conveyance and
distribution networks. The proposed Emergency Water Project would finance on grant basis
the critical components of the priority program described above where water are already
available would be quickly conveyed and distributed to consumers.
No major negative environmental impacts are envisaged since the project will invest in
activities that support rehabilitation and improvements of infrastructure and service delivery
and provide improved and systematic operational and maintenance systems. Potential negative
impacts that are localized and limited in nature will be avoided by providing instructions in
the contract document which specifically address environmental issues in a manner acceptable
to the Bank, as well as following Good Management Practices during construction and service
delivery given the above justification, this project is categorized as a "B" project in
accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998) and requires the
preparation and implementation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The
Palestinian Water Authority commissioned the Engineering and Management Consulting
Center (EMCC) to prepare the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the Emergency
Water Project to satisfy the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998).
The key implementing agencies involved in the project are the Palestinian Water Authority
(PWA) and the World Bank.
2. EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT BACKGROUND
Following nearly of two and a half years of protracted and often violent conflict since October
2000, which has caused severe damages to the West Bank and Gaza's physical and
institutional infrastructure, including housing, public facilities, as well as vital water,
wastewater and electrical networks. Municipal and village distribution networks suffered
direct damage. Municipal maintenance crews were unable to carry out effective repairs and
conduct routine maintenance. Consequently, reliable piped and safe water supplies were
severely impacted. The closures and curfews crimped the ability to supply water by tankers
on regular basis. Consequently, to the extent that tankers can deliver water the price of water
rose sharply putting additional economic burden on households. As a result, large portions of
the population continue to be without water for extended periods of time. Levels of
household water usage have decreased and health risks increased because of failed wastewater
and chlorination systems
In order to overcome these health and environmental impacts, An Emergency Water Project
(EWP) is proposed to improve the water supply conditions in the southern area of the west
bank. The proposed project will increase the capacity of the existing systems, rehabilitate
deteriorated networks, improve accessibility, quality and quantity of water.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN                                              DRAFT REPORT
EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT - EWP
Recognizing the increased threat to public health brought about by increased exposure to
water- and sanitation-borne disease and increased economic burden on households, the
Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) with support from the donor and NGO community
established the Emergency Water Operations Center (EWOC) in April 2002. The purpose of
the EWOC is to assist in responding to the humanitarian crisis described above through
restoration of basic water and sanitation services in the West Bank. In the first six months of
operation EWOC disbursed about $1.15 million for emergency repair work. An additional
US$4.4 million are available for continued emergency work, restocking of supplies and to
help improve preparedness.
2.1 EWP Objectives
The main development objectives of the proposed project are:
* yImprove the sufficiency of water and wastewater services in the Southern Area of the
West Bank (Hebron and Bethlehem Governorates).
*  Improve the efficiency of water and wastewater services supply to customers in terms
of quality and quantity.
*   Improve the management of water services by building on existing authorities; the
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WSSA) and the municipal and village water
departments within Bethlehem and Hebron Governorates.
*  Prepare for and implement an appropriate institutional framework for water and
wastewater services provision including the implementation of a performance based
management contract (MC).
*   Strengthening regulatory and institutional capacity in the Palestinian Water Authority
(PWA).
2.2 The Emergency Water Project Components
The Emergency Water Project (EWP) for the southern area of the West Bank will focus on
five packages. Table (1) below summarizes the proposed packages. Brief description and full
details of these projects are given in annex (I1)

This proposed emergency project, would contribute to environmental improvements by
sustaining water service in terms of quality and coverage.
3. OBJECTIVES AND FEATURES OF THE EMP
The main features of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) are an assessment of the
proposed packages and project components with an assessment of potential impacts and
mitigation measures. Based on the assessment, an EMP is prepared highlighting the following
main elements:
* Outline key environmental issues through an environmental assessment of the proposed
packages;
* Ensure adequate public consultation during the assessment process;
* Develop an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.
4. ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY
The EMP gives general guidance on environmental issues, as well as on site assessments and
designs that will be prepared for the water infrastructure facilities to be rehabilitated and
sustained under this project. The EMP also elaborates on potential environmental impacts and
recommends mitigation measures. The need for mitigation measures is likely to be limited
knowing the nature of the projects proposed. If any, the costs would be financed out of the
allocation of the packages.
In close coordination with the PWA team - West Bank- and the World Bank officials, site
visits to the proposed packages were arranged. The site visits are very essential in order to
draw a comprehensive overview about the projects sites and their surrounding environment.
In order to prepare the EMP and achieve its objectives, the consultant carried out the
following activities:
4.1 Data Collection
o  Collected and reviewed existing studies conducted on the environmental
situation in the West Bank specifically the environmental profiles; West Bank,
Bethlehem District and Hebron District, the Environmental Strategy and Action
Plan, the EMPs prepared under the World Bank financed Community
Development Projects and the Emergency Services Support Projects.
o Reviewing the environmental laws, strategies and actions plan that were adopted
by the Environmental Quality Authority (EQA).

•  Information on the environmental attributes 'of the study area. Infrastructure,
transportation links, and utilities are documented from available reports
produced by PWA and other relevant institutions.
o  Detailed design drawings of the proposed projects.
o  Along with the background review, the assessment is based on field survey, site
visits, and interviews to explore current practices in rehabilitation and
maintenance activities. Site visits to the selected project were conducted to
document the main features and impacts of each project on the environmental
components. Photos were also taken to different locations of the projects.
o  A set of meetings with relevant stakeholders was conducted in order to collect
the necessary information and complete the projects description and their
impacts. Brief description and full details of these projects are given in annex (II)
4.2 Impact Assessment
o  The study team conducted the environmental assessment and evaluated the
environmental impacts of the projects during all development stages; Planning
and Design, Construction and Operation Stages.
o  The potential impacts of each project are described and evaluated for the
construction and post-construction stages of the project in order to identify the
mitigation measures which should be stated in the project contract documents
and must be enforced by the responsible authorities.
The mitigation measures for the negative impacts are presented as shown in Table
(2).
4.3 EMP Development
Based on the collected data and reports, site visits, interviews with involved staff and
consultant's experience, the consultant team developed the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) for the proposed Emergency Water Project, which includes feasible and
cost effective measures to minimize or mitigate negative impacts and the actions to be
adopted during the screening process and implementation phases of the project. Also,
the EMP is prepared to integrate environmental concerns into the design and
implementation of the proposed projects. The EMP includes three basic components;
institutional component, environmental mitigation, and environmental monitoring.
The cumulative potential adverse environmental effects without these projects, however,
can be substantial, particularly as they relate to water quality, the ecology, and impact on
the regional socioeconomic and socio-cultural framework.
The projects implementation and operation should mitigate the nsks to humans, the
impacts on ecology and natural resources. All potential environmental effects and
measures to mitigate these effects must be adequately identified in a comprehensive
environmental Management Plan as outlined in the subsequent sections.

5. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND BASELINE INFORMATION
The baseline information for the Southern Area of the West Bank; Bethlehem and Hebron
Governorates considered the environmental issues listed below which are described in details
in Annex (M).
o  Climate, Air Quality and Noise.
O  Available Water Resources and Water Quality.
o  Transportation and Land use.
L  Vegetations, Wildlife and Marine Life Resources.
o  Agricultural Resources.
O  Population and Housing.
O  Employment and Income.
o  Archaeological Resources, Recreation and Tourism.
o  Public Health.
6. GENERAL FINDINGS
Through the assessment process of these projects it is expected that significant benefits would
accrue to the population. Significant environmental benefits are expected after implementation
of the EWP, which also can benefit positively the economical conditions. Women and
children as well as most community categories would benefit from the proposed project
components.
6.1 Environmental Positive Impacts
The identified positive environmental impacts would include the following:
* Improvement in the accessibility and efficiency of water supply service delivery by
further reducing the losses due to water leakage and illegal house connections and
increasing the capacity of the systems in terms of quality and quantity.
* Improve water quality (in terms of disinfection) and more regular supply to
customers with fewer breaks in service.
* Construction of water tanks can balance the water,shortage in distribution networks
and ensure long pumping periods and availability of sufficient water quantities.
* Improvement in public health and environmental conditions due to expansion and
rehabilitation of water networks.
* Such projects will improve the capacity of the distribution systems.
* After construction, the implemented projects will have no impacts on most of the
physical environment factors such as noise, dust, and air pollution.
6.2 Socioeconomic Positive Impacts
The entire population within the service areas under the Southern Area Water and Sanitation
Lmprovement Project (estimated around 450,000) of the total population of the Southern Area
of the West Bank which are 542,950 (137,286 in Bethlehem and 405,664 in Hebron) [PCBS
1997] will benefit from these projects. The proposed emergency packages are estimated to
provide 250,000 of low-income households and rural communities with adequate (100 liters
per capita per day) and reliable water supply for the medium term. This EWP will ensure the
beneficiaries access to reliable piped water supplies at much lower prices that charged by

vendors. These beneficiaries will also expenence health and environmental benefits from
improved access to water services.
In general, the project does not include any resettlement as the activities are installing of new
pipes, equipping new well and construction of a water tank. The land required for the
pumping well is allocated and fenced, so, there is no resettlement or need for compensation
for land acquisition.
Economical benefits are gained as short-term job opportunities for local skilled and unskilled
laborers. Generally, positive impacts are gained from all projects in terms of employment
generation, more efficient services provision, sustainable development and environmental
protection. Emergency infrastructure projects like EWP project will improve the economical
situation and help in improving life standards.
The project would include the following economical benefits:
* Opportunities for local private     sector participation  and  development through
consulting, contracting, working and manufactunng inputs throughout the project
period.
* Employment generation to unemployed skilled and' unskilled laborers.
* Increase revenues generation and greater cost recovery.
It is recommended to enforce the contractors to employ workers and emphasize the labor
content in the contract documents in order to create direct and indirect job which will help to
reduce the hardship situation. Knowing that it is difficult to enforce the using of labors instead
of machineries in all projects because of the natural of land in the Southern Part of the West
Bank.
6.3 Environmental Negative Impacts and Mitigation Measures
The risks and negative impacts of the proposed EWP projects can be minimized by addressing
the mitigation measures during construction and post-construction operation phases. Table (2)
below summarizes the expected impacts of each sector and the suggested mitigation measures.

7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING PLAN
Mitigation measures require a successful impact management plan implemented at the correct
time and in a correct way. This usually requires a clearly written and agreed plan of action for
managing impacts so that these are kept within the limits of acceptability. The monitoring
plan describes how and who will carry out the monitoring activities for addressing the
negative environmental issues.
This section aims to coordinate the environmental policies, plans, programs and decisions of
the varnous parties involved in the project, which exercise functions that affect the
environment. The EMP aims to minimize the duplication of procedures and provide
consistency in the protection of the environment.         I
In order to ensure smooth and uncomplicated achievement of the EMP components, it would
include three basic components:
o Institutional Component
o Environmental Mitigation
o Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement
7.1 Institutional Component
The Institutional Component details out the responsibilities for management, monitoring,
reporting and enforcement of the EMP components and activities. This section includes any
needs for capacity building, training or equipment.
7.1.1 Institutional Overview and Strengthening Needs
PWA can and should be expected to acquire the institutional and technical capabilities
required to incorporate EMP measures which are integral to the activities which it
performns or for which it has responsibility. The mobilization of other national
institutions such as EQA and Local Government Units (LGUs) is necessary. EQA is
responsible for the development of the environmental policy, legislation and
environmental planning. It is also responsible for developing standards, norms and
guidelines for creating environmentally sustainable conditions. PWA, EQA and LGUs
should have the capacity and strength which enable staff to be involved in monitoring
EWP project activities. The cooperation of the three parties will ensure proper
implementation, smooth follow up of the EMP issues and know-how transfer.

EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT - EWP
7.1.2 Strengthening Environmental Expertise
Environmental expertise will be established within the implementation agencies for the
coordination and supervision of the environmental activities funded through the EWP.
The Project Management Unit (PMU) has the overall responsibility to monitor and
follow up the project implementation activities. The PMU role includes; identify
priorities, establishing criteria for projects selection, approve projects, participate in bids
evaluation, review technical and financial reports as well as daily monitoring, site visits
and supervising of projects implementation. The PMU should also be responsible for
taking the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the monitoring plan and
mitigation measures as well as enforcing the environmental regulations. Member of the
PMU staff should also be designated to coordinate and follow up with PWA, EQA,
LGUs, and the consultant to ensure transfer of knowledge and build up the LGUs
capacity. One of the PMIU's staff members should be an environmental specialist or an
engineer with strong environmental background to participate in the screening and
monitornng processes. The expert would basically do the following:
a- Conduct environmental review of the proposed packages and monitoring the
implementation of the EMP.
b- Conduct site visits to review progress of.:and abidance with environmental
measures.
c- Coordinate environmental training activities for staff, engineers and
contractors.
Part-time environmental advisor(s) contracted from local firms could support
occasionally the implementing agency staff. The success of the project can be seen very
much dependent on the role of the environmental advisor in co-operation with PWA and
LGUs. The environmental advisor's role could include the following responsibilities:
> Monitor construction materials transportation and storage and construction
activities.
> Follow up the environmental management plan during construction activities
inside the project area.
> Coordinate with PMU, PWA, LGUs, EQA and other involved parties in order
to mitigate the environmental impacts by providing instructions for the
implementing agencies.
> Site-specific environmental screening review  and assessment of key
environmental issues through an environmental audit of sample projects.
> Preparation of the progress reports which follow-up the implementation of
EMP and recommendations that rise-up during site visits of the sample
projects.
7.1.3 Environmental Capacity Building and Training Program
The training program would be designed and implemented by local or international
consultants in cooperation with PWA and EQA. The training would target three levels:

EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT - EWP
l- On-the-job training for a dedicated PMU staff to direct activity planning, design,
and implementation with respect to environmental protection.
2- Training for staff of local authortles, municipalities, and village councils. The
training should be provided through short duration seminars and workshops.
Oriented site visits and intensive training, one-month duration, should also be
provided for selected staff members. The overseas trainings and visits will enhance
the long-term capacity of the PWA, LGUs and the MOLG staff.
3- Training for contractors should be provided, including one or two days workshops
for local contractors, focusing on: preparation and use of the appraisal/mitigation
forms, use of environmental guidelines, and implementation of mitigation
measures. Also, they should be trained on safety, measures for construction works,
proper waste disposal and cleaning measures during construction.
A comprehensive capacity building program is needed to provide a range of aids that
can be used to engender skill development and knowledge transfer. This can include:
o Developing a library of environmental assessment reports and maintaining
a database of information collected during the assessment;
o Collecting examples of good practice and establishing environmental
awards in the workplace;
o Holding an environment 'day', inviting guest speakers on environmental
issues; and
o Producing desk aids such as a yearly calendar based on environmental
themes and designing corporate environmental posters
7.1.3 Project Documentation
The TOR and tender documents of the Projects packages should reflect the importance
of the environmental management and monitoring plan. The impacts, mitigation
measures and responsibility of execution should be annexed to the contract documents
and the contractors should be informed that all the possible environmental impacts listed
in the EMP must be avoided by the appropriate identified mitigation measures.
According to the EMP, all the responsibilities of contractors that listed in the EMP
(Table 3) should be emphasized in the contract.
7.2 Environmental Mitigation
Environmental mitigation includes a matrix identifying the issues, mitigation measures,
responsibility for carrying out the mitigation measures and the approximate cost estimates for
the actions.
7.2.1   Potential Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures and Monitoring Plan
In order to implement sufficient and adequate EMP in terms of project monitoring,
reporting and supervision, the following actions are recommended:
o Site-specific environmental screening and review process conducted at least
twice a month for randomly selected projects.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN                                      DRAFT REPORT
EMERGENCY WATER PROJECT - EWP
The screening and review process should be conducted in close coordination
with PMI, PWA and EQA. Local experts shall conduct environmental
review. Specific projects that have been earmarked will be subjected to
detailed site review and the implementation of construction works shall be
closely monitored. A standard appraisal / mitigation form shall be used. The
form should basically include:
a- Current environmental problems such 'as water supply contamination
at the site, dust and air pollution.
b- Any potential environmental impacts of the project, if any, due to the
project.
c- Mitigation measures.
o Prepare a monthly progress report (Environmental Audit) addressing the
environmental  issues,  status  of  mitigation  measures  taken  and
recommendations.
The projects and activities implemented under EWP should be subjected to site
specific environmental assessment and review process. Environmental mitigation
and monitoring actions are presented in a simple matrix format. This includes
identifying the issues, mitigation measures, and responsibility for carrying out the
mitigation measures, environmental monitoring, and responsibility for carrying out
the monitoring actions. Table 3 handles these issues in more details.
7.2.2   EMP Cost Estimate and Schedule
The estimated cost for the EMP is $ 92,000 and includes hiring an environmental
expert, capacity building and training programs. Table 4 lists the main components
of the EMP and the related cost.
A schedule for the implementation of the various activities of the Environmental
Management Plan is prepared and shows the activities duration and timing of the
proposed periodic assessments. Table 5 shows the schedule of the project's major
activities during the proposed period of the project.
