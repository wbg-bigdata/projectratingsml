BRAZILIAN STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM*
APPRAISAL OF CSN EXPANSION PROJECT-STAGE III
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed Stage III expansion project of
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), the largest steel producer in Brazil.
The Company is currently implementing Stage II of its expansion program, a
US$570 million project which the Bank is helping to finance jointly with the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The Stage II loans from the Bank
(US$64.5 million) and IDB (US$43.0) million) are being used to finance in-
ternationally bid equipment and foreign engineering costs.
ii.       The Stage III project will'increase raw steel making capacity at
CSN's Volta Redonda plant from 2.4 (Stage II) to 4.4 million tons per year
(TPY) by 1979 and add rolling and finishing capacity, primarily for the
production of flat rolled products, about 46% of which will be coated.
iii.      Estimated total financing required, including working capital and
interest during construction, is US$2,115 million equivalent of which about
US$992 million will be for imported equipment and services. The requested
Bank loan is US$95 million. The IDB Board approved a loan of US$63 million
in December 1974 for the project.
iv.       The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's
raw steel making capacity from 7.9 to 22.3 million TPY between 1974 and 1979.
The original program formulated by Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), 1/ the national steel council, has been somewhat accelerated and
includes simultaneous expansion of the other two government-owned flat pro-
ducts mills, Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais (USIMINAS) and Companhia
Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA). A loan of US$60 million has been requested
from the Bank to help in financing the COSIPA expansion. The CSN Stage II
project is expected to be completed by early 1976, about 3 months behind
schedule. The estimated project cost is currently about 35% above the
appraisal estimate, due mainly to increased construction, ocean freight and
engineering costs and changes in scope of the iron ore and limestone mine
developments.
v.        CSN's Stage III project is designed to increase steel making capacity,
place more emphasis on coated products, and replace obsolete equipment in
order to satisfy market requirements, improve product quality and further
reduce production costs. Reaching the 4.4 million TPY raw steel production
level will require expansion of the Company's iron ore mine at Casa de Pedra
1/   Changed to the Conselho de Nao Ferrosos e de Siderurgia (Council for
Non-Ferrous Metals and Steel), with the same acronym, in August 1974.



- ii -
in the State of Minas Gerais, the addition of two coke oven batteries, a fourth
sintering plant, a third vessel for the two-vessel BOF shop being constructed
in Stage II, an additional oxygen plant, and two more continuous slab casters.
Additional rolling and finishing facilities will include a 66'i semi-conti-
nuous hot strip mill, a plate finishing line, a 6-stand cold reduction mill,
continuous pickling lines, annealing and temper facilities, cold strip finish-
ing lines, an additional continuous galvanizing line, a painting line, a
coil preparationi line and two additional electrolytic tinning lines.
vi.       The project will be financed witlh loans offered from (a) potential
equipment supply countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
the United States (US$493 million); (b) the Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento
Economico (BNDE) and Agencia Especial de Financiamento Industrial (FINAME)
(US$634 million); (c) the IBRD and IDB (US$158 mi.llion); as well as a capital
increase (US$284 million) and CSN's internal cash generation (US$545 million).
The IBRD/IDB loans will be used in a 60:40 proportion to finance interna-
tionally bid equipment items from a joint list. It is expected that Brazi-
lian suppliers could win about 60% or US$95 million worth of equipment from
this list, with the remaining US$63 million to finance equipment purchases
in other Bank member countries. Imported equipment not on the banks' list
will be financed (85-90%) by the above non-Brazilian countries, after com-
petitive bidding among their suppliers, taking financing terms into account
in evaluating bids. These countries are expected to provide export credits
for 15 years with 3 years of grace and at an average interest rate of 9% per
annum. The BNDE and FINAME loans are to become available for 15 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, at an average nominal interest rate of 6% plus
monetary correction to the outstanding principal. Finally, the IBRD/IDB
loans have been assumed to be made under the same terms as the Brazilian
loans, but at interest rates to CSN of 10% and 8% per annum respectively.
The Company would pay the Government a guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per year on
the Bank's loan, which is included in the 10% rate. All foreign exchange
loans will be guaranteed by the Government which will also assume the obligation
to finance any possible cost overrun. The Bank's contribution will be about
4.5% of the total estimated financing requirements of the project.
vii.      CSiq was formed in 1941 by the Government of Brazil which owns directly
or indirectly about 94% of the Company's share capital, including all of the
common shares, of which 51% are held by Siderurgia Brasileira S.A. (SIDERBRAS),
the recently formed Government-owned holding company for the public steel sector
and the remaining 49% by the National Treasury. CSN is currently completing its
Stage I expansion which will increase raw steelmaking capacity to 1.7 million TPY,
and is implementing the Stage II expansion mentioned above, which will further
increase capacity to 2.4 million TPY by 1976. The Company has been producing
good profits at capacity operation for many years. Its financial position is
sound and its management structure is currently undergoing reorganization as
part of a program being undertaken with the aid of management consultants dur-
ing the Stage II project.



- iii -
viii.     CSN has successfully executed its previous expansions and is capable
of carrying out the Stage III project efficiently. Arthur G. McKee and
Company and US Steel Engineers and Consultants, both U.S. engineering firms,
are providing technical assistance to CSN during the Stage II project implem-
entation and Armco Steel and U.S. Steel will extend operational assistance,
particularly for BOF steelmaking, continuous casting and finishing processes.
For Stage III, the Company will increasingly rely on its own engineering
subsidiary COBRAPI -- but will retain outside consultants as necessary to
provide engineering, procurement assistance, and project management. Eng-
ineering hias cormenced and the first orders for equipment financed by the
Bank are expected to be placed by early 1976, with most installations com-
pleted by mid-1979.
ix.       During the 1950's and 60's consumption of steel in brazil on
average increased by about 9% per year. Between 1967 and 1974, consumption
of flat rolled products has grown at 23.2% per year and up to 1981, is ex-
pected to grow at 12.0% annually.  In 1974, about 81% of CSN's domestic sales
were flat rolled products, with the balance non-flats (rails and structurals)
and semi-finished products (slabs and blooms). The Stage III expansion will
increase production of coated products (tinplate, galvanized coil and sheet,
painted sheet), for which CSN has a particularly strong market position,
with a view to making Brazil self-sufficient in these products. Steel imports
into Brazil have grown substantially over the past few years (preliminary
estimate of 2.6 million tons of flat products in 1974) and the Company has
itself been importing both finished products for resale and intermediate
products for further processing. It has also been exporting modest amounts
of 50,000-150,000 tons annually. Company exports are projected to reach about
230,000 tons by 1981, or 7% of CSN's expected production in that year. This
surplus, however, is forecast to be rapidly absorbed thereafter by the growing
domestic market.
x.        CSN has its own iron ore mine from which it obtains all of its
ore requirements at a favorable cost. The other principal input, coking
coal, is primarily imported, with the exception of about 30% which is pro-
cured domestically from a subsidiary company. Other rawq materials are mainly
obtained locally and no significant problems are foreseen in raw material
supply. Labor productivity is currently lower than in similar plants in
other major steel-producing countries, but conversion costs are quite com-
petitive and, with the completion of the Stage III expansion, labor pro-
ductivity is expected to improve.
xi.       The Company's selling prices on which the financial projections
have been prepared are, on the whole, below European domestic prices for
similar products. Current CIF import prices are somewhat higher than
domestic prices and it is expected that upon completion of the project the
Company could meet substantially lower import prices and still earn an acceptable
financial return. In view of the importance of steel prices, which are
controlled by the Brazilian Government, both to the steel industry and the



- iv -
economy as a whole, the Bank has reconfirmed its agreement (under the
Stage II loan) to have periodic consultations with the Government on steel
pricing policy.
xii.      The Company has a strong equity base which permits it to increase
its debt greatly without exceeding a 50/50 debt/equity ratio. Debt service
coverage is expected to remain strong and liquidity satisfactory. After
completion of Stage III, CSN will have a low profit break-even point of 53% of
production capacity and cash break-even point of 50% of capacity. The project
provides a suitable financial rate of return of 10.8%, even at the assumed
level of Brazilian steel prices which, as mentioned previously, are low by
international comparison.
xiii.     The project's economic rate of return is a satisfactory 17% and
thus about 4% above the rate that had been forecast for the Stage II expans-
ion. Sensitivity tests indicate that the return will remain adequate even
under very adverse conditions. The project will also have a beneficial effect
on foreign exchange, with net savings expected to reach about US$440 million
annually by 1981. The risks in this project are relatively small and probably
of only temporary nature, such as possible construction delays due to the
sheer size of the simultaneous execution of three large steel projects, a
somewhat slower than predicted market growth for steel and, possibly as a
consequence thereof, a minor deterioration in the present price/cost relation-
ship for CSN's output.
xiv.      The proposed new loan would make a significant further contribution
to the expansion of the Brazilian steel industry in the current decade; add
to the conversion of one of the most abundant resources of Brazil -- iron
ore -- into a competitive product; and play a key role in a financing package
in which the great bulk of the equipment would be bid internationally.
xv.       Based on satisfactory arrangements for the completion of the bilateral
and Brazilian financing and the agreements obtained on certain financial and
other covenants as described in Chapter X of this report the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$95 million equivalent for a term of 15 years including 4
years of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the expansion (Stage III) of capacity from
2.4 to 4.4 million tons of raw steel 1/ per year (TPY) of the government-owned
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) steel plant at Volta Redonda, in the State
of Rio de Janeiro. The Bank has been requested to make a loan of US$95 million
equivalent, or about 4.5% of the estimated financing requirements of about
US$2.1 billion for the project, for internationally bid equipment. CSN has
approximately 20% of Brazil's current steel producing capacity of 7.9 million
TPY of raw steel and is expected to maintain this approximate share at completion
of Stage III.
1.02  -  The proposed project will overlap with Stage II of a continuing
expansion program 2/ designed to increase Brazil's raw steel capacity to
22.3 million tons per year by 1979. This program also includes the other
two major government-controlled steel companies-Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas
Gerais (USIMINAS) and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA). The Bank,
together with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), has played a major
role in developing this program, and is assisting the ongoing simultaneous
Stage II expansions of the three companies with loans totalling US$192 million.
The Bank has also been requested to finance the Stage III expansion of COSIPA.
Annex 1 describes those features of the Stage III expansion program which
are common to all three plants as well as the sector's history and the market
for steel products in Brazil.
1.03      The project was appraised by joint missions 3/ of the Bank and
the IDB in May/June and September 1974, January 1975, and various subsequent
discussions with representatives of the Company and Siderurgia Brasileira
S.A.-SIDERBRAS, the recently formed holding company for the government-owned
steel companies.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Ownership
2.01      The Company was founded in 1941 and operations commenced in 1946
with an initial ingot capacity of 170,000 TPY. CSN's share capital at
1/   Raw steel is defined as steel in the first solid state after melting and
includes ingots, continuously cast semi-finished products and castings.
2/   See Annex 1 of this report for discussion of the program.

the Bank and Messrs, Newbery, Gould, Pokorny, and Odinec of IDB.



;iecerijer 31, 1974, a.ounted to Cr$1,697 million (US$355 riillion, 1/ divided
B).tween couimon shares (54,Z), all held by the Government, and preferred shares
( 6,i), most of which (88%) were also owned by the Government, with the
remaining 12% being in private hands.  iHalf of the Government's preferred
shares were held by the National Treasury ancl the other half by the National
Social Socurity Institute, a public savings bank and by state and municipal
governments.  Ihe common and preferred shares whiclh are now held by SIDERBRAS
were transferred from the National Treasury in April 1975.
b.   Location and Plant Facilities
2.02      The plant is located at Volta Redonda (Map 3662R), a town of about
180,000 inhabitants some 145 km northwest of Rio de Janeiro, along the main
road and rail routes to Sao Paulo and on the Paraiba River. Railroads con-
nect Volta Redonda with the principal markets (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo
and Belo ilorizonte), the Company's iron ore and limestone mines in Minas
Gerais some 420 and 470 rail km to the north, and the ports of Rio de Janeiro
and Angra dos Reis on the Atlantic Ocean. The plant therefore is centrally
located with respect to both major sources of raw materials (Map 3664R) and
markets. It is one of the largest steel mills in Latin America and supplies
a major portion (35%) of Brazil's market for cold rolled products, especially
galvaniized sheet and tinplate for which CSN has a monopoly. In 1974 the
Company produced 1.5 million raw steel tons and had steel products sales of
US$371 million equivalent.
2.03      CSN's operations are fully integrated by direct ownership or
through subsidiary companies, and include coal, iron and manganese ore
mines with washing and beneficiation plants, limestone and dolomite quarries
and coastal vessels for coal transport.
2.04      The Company's plant facilities at completion of Stage II are
described in Annex 2 and consist essentially of three batteries of coke
ovens, three sinter machines, three blast furnaces, a two 200-ton vessel BOF
shop, a two-strand continuous slab caster, a slabbing-blooming mill, a rail
and structural mill, a semi-continuous hot strip mill, two tandem cold mills,
stack annealing facilities, a continuous annealing line, two temper mills,
one continuous and two hot dip galvanizing lines, four electrolytic tinning
lines, and a structural fabricating shop. The plant is well run and main-
tained, but some of the initial facilities, such as the open hearth steel-
making shop and hot strip mill, are now obsolete or approaching the end of
their useful life, due to their high cost, low quality output. These and
some of the existing auxiliary facilities will largely be phased out upon
completion of Stage III.

-3-
C.   Subsidiaries
2.05      CSN holds all the voting shares in Companhia Siderurgica de Mogi
das Cruzes (COSIM), which produces bars, small sections and seamless pipes.
The Company also has more than 80% control of seven other subsidiaries which
are engaged in coal mining and washing, insurance brokerage, engineering
consultancy, construction and real estate management, and palm oil production.
These are shown as investments on CSN's balance sheet. Except for COSIM and
OPALMA (palm oil production) all subsidiaries were originally CSN departments.
The combined operational gross profit of the subsidiaries in 1973 was Cr$376.2
million (US$60.9 million) and aggregate net profit was Cr$18.8 million (US$3.0
million). A fuller description of these subsidiaries is given in Annex 3.
No major investments in subsidiaries are anticipated over the next few years,
but the Company is proposing to. convert its present facilities for the
production of steel structures into a subsidiary and is considering the
establishment of a pellet plant near Casa de Pedra. 1/ Investments in sub-
sidiaries or other business entities will be limited to US$4 million per
year, new debt to subsidiaries or other business entities to US$4 million
outstanding through 1981, and guarantees of debt to subsidiaries or other
business entities to US$12 million outstanding through 1981.
D.   Organization and Management
2.06      CSN has a Board of Directors (Diretoria) composed of the President,
who is appointed by the President of Brazil, and five directors, who are
elected by the shareholders to four-year terms. On the present Board all
of the five directors are exequtives of the Company, including four of the
nine functional Vice-Presidents and the Executive Vice-President (para.
2.08). Apart from the Board, the Company maintains in accordance with
Brazilian law a Fiscal Council which reviews the Company's accounts annually.
2.07        The President o:f the Company, Dr. Plinio Reis de Cantanhede
Almeida, has been a Director since 1967 and was appointed President in ?Uay
1975. Dr. Cantanhede was the former Vice President of Finance. He is 64
years old, a graduate of the Polytechnic School of Rio de Janeiro and has had
extensive experience in government, teaching and industry in the course of his
career. Colonel Antonio Carlos Goncalves Penna, who has been a Director since
1967, was formerly Vice President and is now Vice President of Engineering. In
this capacity he will continue to oversee the Company's expansion program. He
is 62 and has been with CSN for 33 years, mostly in production and engineering.
The other Directors of the Company have had considerable experience with CSH!
and in industrial managerment putside the Corpany.
2.08      The basic functional structure of the Company is shown in Annex 4.
It is based on the recommendations from the management consultants A.D. Little,
U.S., retained by the Company in accordance with the loan agreement for the

Stage II project. A key change from the former organization has been the
creation of the new position of Executive Vice-President. While the two
Vice-Presidents of Finance and Subsidiaries are responsible to the President,
the Vice-Presidents with operating functions now report to the Executive
Vice-President. In March 1975 the appointment of Mr. Joubert C. Diniz to
this new position was confirmed. Mr. Diniz is 42 and was the Commercial
Vice-President prior to his new appointment. He has been a Director since
1971 and has had extensive industrial experience. Because of the importance
to the Company, it was agreed that the Company will inform the Bank when
making personnel changes at senior management level (i.e., all Vice-Presidents
and those Superintendents responsible for the execution of the project).
2.09      The new organization structure under each of the Vice-Presidents
has also been drawn up and its implementation has either been completed or
is underway. The new organization is expected to result in clearer funct-
ional responsibilities, improved control of current operations and expansion
projects and more effective development of strategies for the future. New
procedures, training and management information systems based on the con-
sultants' recommendations and implementation assistance will facilitate these
efforts. In accordance with the agreement for the Stage II loan, the Company
continues to exchange views with the Bank regarding the implementation of the
consultants' recommendations.
2.10      In conjunction with the re-organization, explicit policies and
objectives have been established by the Board which will provide the frame-
work and guidelines for the formulation of functional objectives and the
longer-term planning of the Company's development. A set of corporate ob-
jectives has been quantified, including return on equity (15% by 1980), net
sales growth (20% per year to 1980) and net profit to sales (22% by 1980).
These are ambitious goals, which the financial projections (Chapter VIII)
indicate may be slightly optimistic.
2.11      The Government of Brazil has modified the law establishing SIDERBRAS, 1/
the holding company which now controls CSN and which has been assigned over-
all responsibility for the Government-owned steel companies. In addition to
designing and coordinating development of the public steel sector, SIDERBRAS
will hold the major share of existing and any newly-formed government steel
companies. The companies will retain their present independent corporate
form, however, with responsibility for planning and managing their day-to-day
operations. Under agreement reached for the Stage II loan and reconfirmed
for the proposed loan, CSN cannot be merged or consolidated with other
companies without prior consultation with the Bank.
1/   A decree was approved November 29, 1974, and Law No. 6159, which
authorized the new constitution of SIDERBRAS, was published on
December 6, 1974. See Annex 1, Section F for further details on
the roles of SIDERBRAS and CONSIDER.



2.12      CSN has a general know-how and technical assistance agreement with
the United States Steel Corporation (USS) and Armco Steel Corporation for
operation of the tinning and galvanizing lines respectively. In addition,
the Company has a technical training and general consultation agreement with
USS. These agreements are comprehensive and provide CSN with the technical
back-up and training facilities which it requires for the successful oper-
ation of the plant.
E.   Past Growth and Recent Financial Position
2.13      Detailed historical financial statements are given in Annex 5.
The following table analyzes developments in sales, costs and profits during
1970-74:

steel, but excluding resale of imported finished products.

tion and interest on long term debt).
2.14      Net sales revenue rose by 15.5% per year in current dollar terms
between 1970 and 1974, reflecting improved product mix plus price increases
yielding a greater income per ton sold (US$197 in 1970 compared to US$345 in
1974). Although sales price increases authorized by the Government lagged
behind rising production costs, 1/ this was partially compensated by improved
productivity. Net income after taxes shows a rising trend both in absosute
terms and in relation to sales and equity though not in relation to net fixed
1/   For example, in 1973 the cost of imported coal increased by about 50%.

assets and capital employed, primarily due to the fact that most investments
under Stage I were not yet operative in 1974. The decline in debt service
coverage was largely due to an increase in debt service and static profit
margins resulting from insufficient price increases allowed by the Govern-
ment. This situation was corrected by major price increases during 1974
(28% in current dollar terms).
2.15      During 1970-73, CSN (as did COSIPA and USIMINAS) produced at full
capacity and, while the Company was able to increase its volume of finished
products by 13% during that period, domestic production lagged substantially
behind Brazil's consumption growth of flat products of about 80%. In 1974
the demand/supply gap widened with increased consumption and some reduction in
the three companies' production due to difficulties - now overcome - in the
supply of imported coking coal. To meet the supply gap, the Government authorized
the companies to import finished steel products beginning in 1971. The sale of
products thus imported was to generate neither profits nor losses for the
companies 1/. Annual CSN imports for 1971-74 were 42,000 tons, 194,000 tons
334,000 tons and 445,000 tons respectively.
2.16      Detailed historical balance sheets are given in Annex 5.  A summary
analysis is given in the table below:

/1   The Company normally discounts about 45% of gross receivables.
/2   Defined as (cost of sales/average inventories).
2.17      CSN's long-term debt at the end of 1974 was US$235 million equiva-
lent, of which about US$145 million was in foreign exchange, on which the
Company carries the exchange risk. About half of the foreign loans out-
standing were due to the Bank and IDB, and the majority of the remainder to
1/   The Company has been adequately compensated by the Government for any
losses which would have resulted due to the high cost of imported steel
through various mechanism; including allowing the purchase by the
Company of special high yield government bonds with sales revenue from
the resale of imported products, direct subsidy, and adjusted selling
prices for all products. This last method should continue to compensate
the Company fully for any losses sustained on the resale of imported
products.



US Eximbank and Japanese Eximbank. The current ratio decreased during the
period, which reflected the Company's efforts to reduce the raw materials
inventories and accounts receivable (largely from Government agencies). Up
to 1974 the current ratio was consistently higher than the 1.30 required by
the Bank under the loan agreement, but fell slightly below that level during
1974. This situation has now been corrected by a US$75 million increase in
capital.
2.18      Although sales growth has been largely as foreseen at the time of
the Stage II appraisal, the erosion of profit margins caused cash generation
to be below that projected, resulting in the lower debt service coverage
noted in para. 2.14. Debt was not drawn down as rapidly as expected, however
(para 2.21), so that the debt/equity ratio has remained lower than projected.
Working capital also declined more rapidly than the appraisal projections had
indicated. Nevertheless, the Company's financial situation has remained
sound, having been recently enhanced as described in paras. 2.14 and 2.17.
F.   Progress of Stage II Expansion
2.19      The ongoing expansion (Stage II) to 2.4 million TPY of raw steel
has overlapped with the Stage I expansion (to 1.7 million TPY) which is now
substantially complete.  The Stage II project is expected to be complete by
April 1976, about three months later than the appraisal schedule. Delays
have occurred due to construction interference between new and existing
facilities, problems with coordinating the large number of orders in foreign
countries, more time required for detailed design and in particular difficul-
ties in arranging ocean transpQrt between Italian and Brazilian ports. Im-
plementation of recommendations from the management consultants (A.D. Little),
together with the re-organization of the Company's overall management struc-
ture (para. 2.08 to 2.10), should help to alleviate some of the project
control problems evident from such delays.
2.20      The most recent re-estimate of project costs of US$570 million is
about 35% above the appraisal report figure of US$423.7 million. Close to 90%
of the increase is due to local construction costs and quantities being sub-
stantially higher than estimated, and the remainder is accounted for by
currency realignments, higher ocean freight and engineering costs as well
as a change in project scope, e.g., addition of Arcos limestone project and
calcining kilns, a change from steam-driven to electric blast furnace blowers
and inclusion of the gas collection system (Annex 1). It would still be a
major achievement if CSN were able to stay within this latest estimate,
because of the unprecedented world-wide increase in costs over the past two
years. If the same project were to be commenced today instead of early 1972,
it would cost about 60% to 70% more than the latest estimated cost.
2.21      Procurement of equipment is largely complete, and US$43.7 million
or about 68% of the Bank's loan was disbursed by April 30, 1975. The main
payments for large equipment items and are now becoming due and it is pro-
jected that about 95% of the loan will have been disbursed by the end of



- 8 -
1975. By the end of November 1974 about 89% of the Bank and IDB loans were
committed for equipment contracts. Of these, about 62% by value had been
awarded to Japanese suppliers, 29% to Brazilian suppliers and the remainder
to suppliers in the U.S., Italy, Germany, the U.K., Switzerland, Holland and
Austria in descending order. Of the total value of equipment contracts (IBRD,
IDB and other) thus far awarded, suppliers from Japan have won about 58%,
the U.S. 20%, and Brazil 15%. Since the bidding for these contracts took
place the competitive position among major steel mill equipment supplying
countries has narrowed considerably and awards could thus be much more evenly
distributed in the Stage III project.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Recent Sales History and Sales Forecasts
3.01      The market for steel in Brazil is described in Annex 1.  This
chapter treats those aspects of the market that relate specifically to CSN's
operations. The table on the following page summarizes CSN's recent sales
history (1971-1974) and forecasts through 1981, the first full year during
which the Company is expected to operate at full capacity following physical
completion of the Stage III expansion project in 1979 (Annex 6).
3.02      Total Company sales of its own production increased from 1,062,000
to 1,200,000 tons during 1971-73 or at about 6.3% annually, but declined to
1,075,000 tons in 1974 due to the reduced hot metal production (para.
2.15). Domestic sales during the same period rose from 962,000 to 1,026,000
tons, with the share of flat products remaining steady at about 81% of total
sales. As mentioned earlier, Brazil's demand for flat products has increas-
ingly been exceeding domestic supply, and in 1974 domestic production covered
only about 70% of consumption. The Company's exports fluctuated, nearly
doubling in 1972 but declining to about half the 1971 amount in 1974, due to
the strong local market. Nevertheless, CSN continued its policy of honoring
export contract commitments, maintaining some standing in export markets
with future potential and of improving its organizational and staffing capa-
bilities in export marketing.
3.03      If demand for flat products grows at the projected rate of 12.0%
per annum during the 1975-81 period (as against 23.2% per annum during 1970-
74), there may be a small surplus for export by 1980. CSN is expected to
have a major share of these exports. However, by 1981 most if not all of this
surplus is expected to be absorbed domestically. If demand were to grow at
a rate slower than forecast (and there is no delay in completing the expan-
sion of all flat products producers), the additional surplus could also be
exported, given Brazil's favorable competitive position and the improved
efficiency of CSN's Commercial Department, including its export division.
In addition, the Company's production facilities will continue to have
sufficient flexibility to allow adjustment of CSN's sales program to changing
market conditions.

3.04       In non-flat products CSN competes with a number of privately owned
companies, although it is the only Brazilian producer of rails and shapes
larger than 4 inches. Also, part of its output will be used in its own
structural fabrication shop to produce fabricated products for sale. The
expected sales increases of rails and accessories are important for the
Government's Railway Development Program, which is now being given particular
emphasis. The projected sales and originally planned (Stage I) production
capacity for rails indicate that the demand for this expansion program may
not be adequately satisfied. SIDERBRAS and CSN are therefore studying the
feasibility of increasing the production capacity of rails and structurals.
This expansion would not affect the Stage III project, nor have any substantial
repercussion on CSN's flat steel production in general.
3.05       CSN envisages an increase in domestic plate 1/ sales from 102,000
tons in 1974 to 190,000 tons in 1981. The figure for 1981 is substantially
lower than the planned production of 310,000 tons because 64,000 tons will be
used in CSN's own structural fabrication shop and 56,000 tons for internal
consumption in the plant. Although CSN could produce heavy plate, it is
basically not in this line as distinct from coiled plate. 2/ The growing
domestic demand for heavy plate will be met by USIMINAS and COSIPA.
3.06       CSN is the only producer of tinplate and galvanized coil in Brazil.
It has not been able to meet domestic demand for these two products in recent
years and substantial imports have had to be authorized. In the future, the
Company intends to give first priority to these two products and to increase
its own output and sales to a level that would eliminate the need for imports.
To achieve this objective, combined total sales of tinplate and black plate
are therefore planned to grow from 290,000 tons in 1974 to about 990,000 tons
by 1981.
3.07       Domestic sales of the other products, i.e., hot and cold rolled
products as well as of galvanized coil and sheet, painted sheet and terne
plate are expected to develop as shown in the preceding table. In all these
product lines some exportable capacity could develop in the late 1970's and
early 1980's but any such surplus is expected to be absorbed within a few
years by the growing domestic market.
3.08      Export markets are expected to absorb about 231,000 tons or about
7% of CSN's total sales in 1981. This level of exports seems feasible given
the expected overall demand/supply situation for steel products in the world
in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the intended strengthening of the
I/   Defined as thickness over 4.76 mm.
2/   Heavy plate is normally produced in a 4-high reversing mill, and coiled
plate in a hot strip mill. CSN has a hot strip mill but not a 4-high
plate mill and uses the rougher of the hot strip mill instead.

Company's marketing organization and the fact that this amount is only some
100,000 to 200,000 TPY in excess of what CSN has been exporting in the recent
past.
3.09      Although market prospects look good and any exportable surplus is
likely to be absorbed domestically within two to three years of completion of
Stage III, SIDERBRAS and CSN will keep market developments under cortinuous
review in order to firm up market estimates and assess future requirements
in terms of quality and product mix. Also the Conselho de Nao Ferrosos e
de Siderurgia (CONSIDER) and SIDERBRAS will cooperate closely in the prepara-
tion of a new comprehensive National Steel Plan for the period 1975-85, co-
vering all aspects affecting the development and operation, including pricing
and financial policies, of the Brazilian steel industry, both in the public
and private sector (Annex 1). Consultants have been appointed to prepare
this Plan by June 30, 1976, and it was agreed that the Government and SIDERBRAS
will afford the Bank an opportunity to exchange views on components of the
Plan as and when each component is completed.
B.   Geographic Distribution of Sales
3.10      At present about 60% of CSN's domestic sales are made in the Sao
Paulo-Rio de Janeiro areas, which are the fastest growing centers of consump-
tion in the country. The Company expects to maintain its position in these
markets and may even improve its share by 1981, as its sales of tinplate and
galvanized coil and sheet substitute for imports.
C.   Marketing Organization
3.11      CSN has a well established marketing organization.  The Commercial
Department has a staff of about 200 persons divided into four major sections:
(i) market information, (ii) planning, (iii) international trade, and
(iv) domestic sales. There are five domestic sales offices in the country's
major cities and one export office. About three-quarters of CSN's sales are
made directly to the customers and the remainder through dealers. Dealers
sell in smaller quantities to smaller customers, and provide facilities for
warehousing, some processing and credit.
3.12      CSN shares a marketing information pool (serviced by electronic
data processing facilities) with USIMINAS and COSIPA. It also undertakes
periodic surveys to check the adequacy of its sales program and improve pro-
duction planning. In view of the considerable growth in s*ales envisaged and
the foreseeable competition in the field of uncoated products among the three
principal producers in the late 1970's, CSN will need to develop progressively
more dynamic sales policies and practices and improve the efficiency of the
distribution channels--both dealers and its own depots--as well as its produc-
tion planning and inventory practices. The Company began to improve its sales
organization well in advance of the planned increases in production, with more
attention being given to international trade in steel products. Two important
features of the new marketing organization are improved sales planning and an
upgrading of market information and surveys.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
4.01      The project (Stage III) is designed to increase the capacity of the
plant from 2.4 to 4.4 million TPY of raw steel to satisfy market requirements,
further reduce production costs, and improve product quality.  The project
will result in a modern balanced plant, an increased share of coated products
in the product mix, and the maximum production capacity economically attainable
at the present site.
4.02      More specifically, the following major additions are to be made as
part of the project: (i) expansion of the Casa de Pedra iron ore mine in
Minas Gerais to reach 9.2 million TPY of ore; (ii) two 400 ton/day calcining
plants for limestone and dolomite respectively; (iii) two batteries of coke
ovens with 52 and 51 ovens respectively; (iv) a 4,600 ton/day sintering plant;
(v) a 1,100 ton/day oxygen plant; (vi) a third 200-ton vessel in the BOF shop;
(vii) a 66" semi-continuous hot strip mill; (viii) a plate finishing line; (ix) two
continuous pickling lines for 1.1 million TPY each; (x) a 66" six-stand tandem
cold strip mill; (xi) expanded batch and continuous annealing facilities;
(xii) two new temper mills; (xiii) two cold strip finishing lines; (xiv) a
continuous galvanizing line for 180,000 TPY; (xv) a painting line; (xvi) a
coil preparation line; (xvii) two electrolytic tinning lines; (xviii) two
roll shops; and (xix) new railroad facilities and equipment. Revamping,
enlargement, and replacement of old equipment as well as service and utilities
installations will also be undertaken. A detailed description of the project
is contained in Annex 7.
B.   Observations
4.03      The new facilities will complement and make full use of some of
the investments being made as part of the Stage II expansion, such as blast
furnace No. 3 which together with furnace No. 1--whose capacity is to be in-
creased by 50% in the project--and No. 2, will provide enough hot metal for a
production of 4.6 million TPY of liquid steel in the BOF-shop. At 7,000
tons/day, No. 3 blast furnace will be one of the largest blast furnaces in
the Western Hemisphere and should be a highly efficient operating unit.
4.04      A pellet plant being considered for construction at the Company's
iron ore mine at Casa de Pedra, is not part of the project as it would be
undertaken by a subsidiary company to be formed jointly by CSN, Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), and COSIPA for this purpose. However, CSN's esti-
mated contribution of US$14 million to the plant, which tentatively is esti-
mated to cost US$92 million for a capacity of 3.0 million TPY of pellets, is
accounted for in the Company's financial projections. Some 58% of the pellet
output would be used to supplement CSN's blast furnace burden. Studies on
the exact scope, site and cost of the project as well as the availability of
suitable ore are still being made. Before the project is implemented, a



- 13 -
feasibility study will be submitted to the Bank for its review and approval
of CSN's investment under the covenant described in para. 2.05.
4.05      The phasing out of the existing open-hearth shop and its replace-
ment by a BOF shop (Stage II and III) will reduce steel-making costs and
improve finished product quality. The addition of a third BOF vessel in
Stage III to the two existing vessels will mean a capacity increase from
2.5 to 4.6 million TPY of liquid steel. 1/ The proposed 66" semi-continuous
hot strip mill will be one of the most modern and efficient rolling facilities
in the Western Hemisphere. The existing hot strip mill will be reserved for
small orders and specialty steel rolling.
C.   Ecology
4.06      Brazilian pollution control regulations are still in the early
stages of development. When specifying the new facilities to be installed
in both Stage II and Stage III, the Company proceeded on the premise that
air and water pollution control should be in line with U.S. practices or
Brazilian regulations, whichever are the more stringent. The replacement of
the open-hearth shop with a BOF shop will significantly reduce atmospheric
pollution. Dust collection devices, especially at the sinter plant, blast
furnace and BOF shop, a biological treatment plant at the coke ovens and
by-product plant, and water recirculation systems will be expanded or newly
added to in the project. Other anti-pollution facilities will include acid
collection and treatment plants for pickling line effluent and extra high
stacks at the coke ovens and sinter plants (Annex 8).
4.07      These facilities are provided for in the cost of the project and
are estimated to account for approximately 2% of total equipment costs, as
compared to about 5% for Stage II. The reduction is due to the fact that
many of the environmental devices needed for the project were already instal-
led as part of Stage II. An environmental study 2/ of the plant recently
completed by UNIDO consultants noted that "extreme care has been taken by
CSN to incorporate from the start latest anti-pollution measures in all the
expanded units"'. The consultants also noted the marked improvement planned
for the expansion in contrast with the existing facilities. Agreement was
obtained that the Company will install adequate air, water and noise pollution
controls, including suitable measurement devices, and also monitor emissions
to maintain them within acceptable limits.
D.   Labor Force
4.08      Currently CSN has about 19,200 employees (including about 15,600
in the steel works) and a rated capacity of about 1.6 million tons of raw
1/   Equivalent to 2.4 and 4.4 million tons of raw steel respectively.

Countries--Case Study of an Integrated Iron and Steel Plant in Brazil,"

steel. The incremental output of 2.8 million TPY of steel at the completion
of Stage III calls for the addition of about 6,300 people. The work force
maintained in 1974 is high by modern standards, but is projected to be at
a considerably lower level after the expansion, as expressed by a decrease
of the labor productivity index of man-hours per ton of finished product from
the present 35 to 16. Although productivity levels in other countries are,
of course, also improving, CSN's index upon project completion will be quite
comparable with the 1972 levels achieved in some of the most advanced steel
producing countries, e.g., Japan (12 man-hours per ton); U.S. (12.2); F.R. of
Germany (15.6); France (17.6) and the U.K. (24.9) 1/. While CSN's target
may appear ambitious, it must be realized that the 1974 labor force already
included manpower being trained for Stage I and II facilities which were not
yet in operation. On the other hand, it should be noted that the Company
has a relatively large investment in labor-intensive finishing facilities,
particularly for coated products, which require above average man-hours per
ton of finished product. Also, with a number of similar-purpose mills in
parallel, CSN cannot achieve the best labor productivity figures. As in the
Stage II project, it was agreed that the Company establish yearly targets
for the achievement of reasonable labor productivity levels. Neither CSN
nor the other steel plants have had strikes in the last six years and the
Company's labor turnover has been low and its safety record is good.
E.   Execution and Project Implementation Schedule
4.09      CSN has a competent technical organization with several expansion
programs to its credit. The engineering and procurement for Stage II was
undertaken by Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Industriais (COBRAPI), a
subsidiary of CSN and one of the largest engineering corporations in Brazil.
Some assistance was also obtained from U.S. Steel Engineers and Consultants
(UEC), especially for the BOF and continuous casting shops and, in the
initial stages, from McKee, U.S. Currently, CSN has COBRAPI perform civil,
structural, mechanical and electrical design and detailed engineering work
(Annex 3). Its capabilities are fully up to the requirements of the project.
For the Stage III project, the scope of COBRAPI's responsibilities will be
similar, and it outside consultants and subcontractors will be hired as
necessary to cover further work including engineering, procurement assistance
and project management.
4.10      The Company has received recommendations from the consultants
A.D. Little on improving the organization and management of CSN's expansion
programs and has largely accepted these recommendations. The Vice President
of Engineering will have responsibility for the closely interrelated functions
of Engineering, Construction, Supply and Control. Lines of authority will be
clarified and expansion management will be assisted by improved computerized
scheduling and cost control systems. Implementation of these improvements

Bureau of Labor Statistics.



- 15 -
will be completed during 1975, and the Bank will be kept informed of progress.
Meanwhile, the expansion team assembled by CSN has learned a great deal from
the Stage II experience, and should be much better equipped to plan, monitor
and control the progress of the Stage III project. The two projects will
overlap sufficiently to allow beneficial continuity of the management of the
expansions and the utilization of Company staff working thereon. Stage II
activities should be winding down such that the build-up in Stage III
activities should phase in smoothly.
4.11      Construction and erection will be carried out almost entirely by
outside contractors with coordination by Company staff under the Superinten-
dent of Construction. Equipment suppliers will provide supervision of
erection and assistance in start-up, along the same lines as for the execution
of the Stagc II expansion.
4.12      As shown in the construction schedule for Stage III, (Annex 9)
engineering and procurement action has commenced. Orders for the equipment
to be financed by the Bank and the bilateral agencies are expected to be
placed starting in early 1976 and most installations are scheduled for
completion by the middle of 1979, in time to permit the projected increase
in production and sales shown in the financial projections. Only some of
the finishing facilities (e.g., annealing, tempering, tinning lines) are to
be completed later, but it is projected that even these will be ready for
start-up by the end of 1979. The projections assume that 1981 will be the
first year of full capacity production for the expanded plant. The delivery
and construction times are based on information provided by potential equip-
ment suppliers and are considered achievable.

- 17 -
5.02      Capital cost estimates for equipment are based on general budget
quotations obtained from suppliers during the first half of 1974.  The base
prices used are the suppliers' estimates for fixed price contracts, and
thus already include some allowance for escalation. Spares are estimated at
7% of equipment costs. Further allowances for price escalation over the
base prices have been estimated at 12% for 1975, 10% for 1976, and 8% per
annum thereafter.
5.03      Capital costs for civil works and construction, engineering, pro-
curement, administration and pre-operating expenses were estimated on the
basis of the most recent cost experience for the ongoing expansion. The
properties of the sub-soil are known and interferences with existing opera-
tions and other difficulties encountered during Stage II are expected to be
less significant in Stage III. Allowance for price escalation above the base
cost estimate has been as follows: 16% for 1975, 14% for 1976, and 12% per
annum thereafter. Foreign freight and insurance has been estimated at 15% of
imported equipment costs, and local transport at 2% of local equipment costs.
To provide for physical contingencies, a 10% allowance has been added to the
total base cost estimate for all categories, except construction and instal-
lation, for which a figure of 20% has been used, reflecting uncertainty con-
cerning the effect of interferences with existing operations. The estimated
direct and indirect foreign exchange requirements are US$992.9 million,
including US$121.1 million for interest during construction. As indicated
n footnote 2 to the capital cost table, indirect foreign currency costs
are estimated at US$165.9 million, comprising 40% of local equipment and
spare parts costs and 10% of construction and installation costs. The high
indirect foreign exchange costs are due to the fact that Brazil is a net
importer of steel, which forms the major part of the value of such items as
structural steelwork, overhead cranes, transfer cars, etc., which are expected
to be supplied largely by local manufacturers.
B.   Working Capital
5.04      Working capital requirements for the project are estimated at
US$97.7 million, comprised of US$44.7 million in 1979 (the year of physical
completion) and US$53.0 million in 1980, when the project facilities are
expected to reach 90% of rated capacity (Annex 11 ). A further increase of
US$23.5 million during 1981 while the plant builds up to full capacity produc-
tion has not been included in the project cost estimate, and will be met by
Company cash generation.
C.   Financing Plan
5.05      The total financing requirements of US$2,114.6 million equivalent
(para 5.01) will be met as follows:

5.06      The financing plan, which calls for funds to be made available
approximately in the proportion of 39% equity and 61% debt, is based on the
objective that the Company will maintain an overall debt/equity structure
of about 50:50 throughout the construction period. The capital increase is
to be effected by the Government through SIDERBRAS and in such time that the
50:50 debt/equity limit will be observed (para 8.11). CSN's cash generation
is based on the expected build,up of production and sales during project
implementation (para 3.01) and the assumption that the Company will be able
to charge prices for its products that will maintain a gross profit margin
approximately in line with that in force in the first quarter of 1975. Such
underlying general pricing policy has been confirmed with the Government.
5.07      The combined Bank/IDB financing of US$158 million equivalent is to
be shared 60/40 between the two banks as in the Stage II loans. The Bank
loan would be made to CSN for 15 years including a grace period of 4 years
at an interest rate of 10% per annum of which the Company would pay to the
Government a guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per year. The IDB loan carries an
interest rate of 8% per annum. Commitment fees will be 3/4% for the Bank
and 1-1/4% for the IDB, both payable on the undisbursed balance of the
respective loans. In addition, IDB charges a flat inspection and supervision
fee equal to 1% of the loan amount. The exact terms of the bilateral credits
will be settled only at the time the initial bids for bilaterally-financed
equipment for Stage III of the Brazilian steel expansion program are received.
The first such bids, for No. 5 oxygen plant for USIMINAS, are due in early
June 1975. For the purpose of preparing financial projections, bilateral
credits have been assumed to ha e a term of 15 years, including 4 years grace,
at an average interest rate of 9% per annum with the loans covering 85% of
equipment cost. All foreign loans will be guaranteed by the Brazilian Gov-
ernment. The foreign exchange risk will be with the Company. Foreign exchange
costs not covered by the Bank and IDB loans or the bilateral credits will be



- 19 -
met primarily by BNDE and partly by the Company. These costs will include
interest during construction on the foreign loans and credits including the
ban' and IDB loans, and the foreign exchange component of engineering, pro-
curement, inspection, administration and pre-operating expenses.
5.08      SIDERBRAS, BNDE and the Company have confirmed the following: (a)
the favorable disposition of the appropriate bilateral lending institutions in
supplier countries 1/ to extend credits for the purchase of equipment in
amounts sufficient to insure adequate international competition, and (b) the
terms of the loans from the two Brazilian lending institutions (BNDE and
FINAME). These will have a 15-year term, including 4 years of grace, at
an assumed interest rate of approximately 10% per annum. 2/ The loan, guarantee
and project funds agreements stipulate that (a) no disbursements on the Bank
loan will be made until the IDB loan agreement has become effective; (b) the
capital contributions and the local loans be made available as and when required
by the project and on terms acceptable to the Bank (para 5.07); and (c) that
the Government will undertake to provide funds to complete the project, 3/
on terms acceptable to the Bank, to cover any cost over-run or shortfall in
financing due to whatever cause and in whatever currencies required.
VI. PROCUREMENT AND ALLOCATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF BANK LOAN
A.  Procurement
6.01      Equipment and spare parts to be financed under the IBRD and IDB
loans in a 60/40 sharing and on the basis of a common list (Annex 12) will
be procured by international competitive tender.  For purposes of bid eva-
luation, Brazilian manufactured goods will receive a margin of preference
of up to 15%, depending on the applicable import duty, which is presently
greater than 15% for the type of equipment involved. In accordance with
Brazilian regulations 4/ bids containing components manufactured in Brazil
equal to at least 50% of the value of the complete equipment are considered
domestic and qualify for preference on the entire bid price, while domestic
1/   Including the following:  Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom,
and the United States.
2/   Equivalent to an interest rate in cruzeiro terms of 6% per annum, plus
monetary correction.
3/   The project will be defined as "complete" following satisfactory
operation of the new Stage III facilities at 90% rated capacity over
three continuous months.
4/   Portaria No. 6 of January 14, il969 (Ministerial Order, Ministry of
Finance).



- 20 -
components of foreign bids are also given preference in the bid comparison.
The Brazilian definition of domestic bids is more stringent than the custom-
ary Bank threshold of 20% of value added domestically. These arrangements
are in line with those followed under the Stage II loan, which have worked
satisfactorily.
6.02      It is expected that up to US$95 million, or 60% of the combined
IBRD/IDB loans of US$158 million, would be used to finance goods procured
in Brazil after international competitive bidding and that the remaining
US$63 million will finance equipment procured from other Bank member countries,
including those from which bilateral credits may not be available. The balance
of the equipment will be bid competitivelv among the suppliers of countries
providing bilateral credits, including Brazil, with the financing terms being
taken into account in bid evaluation.
6.03      Equipment and construction materials supplied by Brazilian manufac-
turers and not financed by the IBRD/IDB loans will be financed by FINAME and
BNDE. Construction and erection (including civil works), which are not being
financed by IBRD/ IDB, are to be carried out by local contractors following
competitive bidding, unless the quoted costs and schedules indicate that the
Brazilian construction industry is becoming overextended. CSN has agreed
that, as for Stage II, if there is evidence of such over extension, it would
seek international bids for subsequent construction and erection contracts.
Agreement was also obtained with the Government that it continue to expedite
the registration of purchase contracts and approval of import licenses.
B.   Aliocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement
6.04      As mentioned in para 6.02 above it is estimated that Brazilian
manufacturers could win up to 60% of the equipment bid competitively under
the Bank and IDB loans (Annex 12). Based on this estimate and the assump-
tion regarding additional indirect foreign exchange cost stated in para. 5.03
the amount of local currency financing by the Bank would be about US$34.4
million.
6.05      The list of equipment to be financed by the Bank, the category
allocation, and the dibursement schedule, of the proceeds of the Bank loan
(Annex 12) are based on detailed package lists, estimates of order placements
and expected delivery times for equipment in line with the construction
schedule (Annex 9).
6.06      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of imported
equipment and spare parts or against the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured equipment and spare parts. Any loan funds remaining undisbursed
upon completion of the project would be used to finance additional equipment
for the project if found justified, otherwise they would be cancelled.

VII. PRODUCTION COSTS AND SELLING PRICES
A.   Raw Materials
7.01      The availability of domestic iron ore of good quality has been
an important factor in the development of Brazil's integrated steel plants.
CSN, with its Casa de Pedra mine some 420 km from the plant, has especially
economical ore costs. Partly offsetting this advantage is the relatively
higher price of coking coal in Brazil, both from domestic and overseas sources.
Brazil needs to import about 70-80% of its coking coal. Although the local
coal is slightly cheaper per ton at the plant, it is of lower quality and has
a higher ash content than the imported metallurgical coal. As for the Stage
II project, the Government will not oblige the Company to increase the 20%
domestic requirement assumed in the projections, thus leaving the Company
free to use an optimum blend of coking coal.
7.02      Brazil has massive iron ore reserves and hence an assured supply.
The outlook for coking coal supply is less assured, especially since the
impact of higher prices and the resulting uncertainty affecting all fossil
fuels. The Company, in close consultation with SIDERBRAS, has been taking
steps to diversify its coal sources. In addition to current contracts for
supply from the U.S. and Poland, negotiations are taking place with suppliers
in other countries, including Canada and Australia. The other principal raw
materials are limestone, dolomite, and to a decreasing extent, scrap. These
are available in Brazil and no difficulties are foreseen in their supply.
Further details regarding raw materials including quantities and sources are
given in Annex 13 and Map 3664R. Transportation and shipping used by the
Company are adequate and are being improved and extended. New rail lines
to be constructed as part of the rail expansion program being partly financed
by the Bank will provide a better route for the iron ore traffic from the
Company's Casa de Pedra mine to the plant at Volta Redonda. Water, fuel oil
and electric power supplies are available in sufficient quantities and at
reasonable cost.
B.   Production Costs
7.03      CBN's direct production costs for representative products are
detailed in Annex 14. It will be seen that, despite the increasing propor-
tion of coated products, which have high direct production costs in CSN's
product mix, the direct production costs per ton of finished products are
expected to decline progressively in real terms after completion of Stage II
and Stage III. Principal reasons are the elimination of the use of high
cost, purchased scrap as a result of the phasing out of the open hearth
shop, the higher yield of slabs from liquid steel in the continuous casting
machines, and the increased coil weight which can be processed on the new hot
strip mill. Furthermore, the unit cost of labor is expected to decline as
a consequence of the increasing labor productivity. These improvements are,
however, partly offset by the expected increases of indirect production costs,



- 22 -
principally depreciation. The direct and indirect production costs per ton
of finished product are shown below for 1974 (actual), for 1977 (at full
production of Stage II), and for 1981 (at full production of Stage III):
CSN - Production Cost/ton of Average Finished Product

Year              1974   1977   1981   1974 - 1977   1974 - 1981
Direct Cost /1        194    174    157        (11.5)         (23.5)

/1   Including raw materials, labor and supplies
Ti  Including depreciation, amortization and general overhead expenses
The above table shows that the total average cost per ton of finished product
decreases between 1974 and 1977 by about 2.5% and will further decrease between
1974 and 1981 only by another 1.2%. As a result of higher depreciation and
overhead expenses after the completion of both expansion stages, indirect costs
are expected to increase by almost 53% between 1974 and 1981.
C.   Selling Prices
7.04      CSN selling price assumptions shown in Table 1 of Annex 15, are
based on Brazilian domestic steel prices prevailing during the first quarter
of 1975; these prices reflect the substantial price increase of September 1974.
On a product by-product basis, most Brazilian flat product prices, by the end
of March 1975, were below domestic western European prices and slightly above
international export prices which substantially declined during recent months
(Table Y.,l!     of Annex I ).  The average (March 1975) selling price of
CSN's rolled steel products (excluding ICM and IPI taxes) is about US$350/ton.
Prices are normally established twice a year after review and approval by the
Interministerial Price Council (CIP), based on increases in costs outside
CSN's control, i.e. raw materials, labor, contractual and capital costs.
7.05      Agreements similar to those for the Stage II loan were obtained
whereby the Government will maintain steel prices at levels which would
remain reasonably competitive with imports and at the same time permit the
companies to (a) earn an adequate return on capital under efficient operating
conditions, (b) meet their financial obligations, (c) contribute to the
1/   This was particularly true during 1974.  More recently international
prices have declined, although not generally to a level as low as
Brazilian prices.

financing of further expansions, and (d) share savings in production costs
with consumers through price reductions. This also means that the price/cost
relationship in force during the first quarter of 1975 will be substantially
maintained during the execution of the project. To this end the Government
and the Bank will consult as necessary to determine whether steel prices are
appropriate. The recent price increases have resulted in a much improved
level of profitability which satisfies the above criteria. The financial
projections for the Company, discussed in the following Chapter, assume that
the growth in revenues in current terms will be somewhat slower than the
growth in production costs.
VIII. FUTURE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION
A.   Profitability
8.01      Forecast profit and loss, cash flow and balance sheet statements
through 1983, together with major assumptions are contained in Annexes 16,
17 and 18. The income statements are summarized below:

/1   Sales revenue and operating costs have been escalated at 10% and 12%
per annum respectively to 1979.
8.02       From 1974 to the full operation of Stage II in 1977, net sales are
projected to double to a level of US$849 million in current dollars, and while
profitability is projected to improve from 16% to 24% of sales, reflecting the
improvement of the plant, the improvement in profit margins due to the price
increases in 1974, and the relatively low debt burden. During the construction



- 24 -
and start-up of Stage III, sales revenue is projected to double again in
current terms to a level of US$1.90 billion by 1981. Profitability in
relation to sales and investment is projected to be somewhat lower following
project completion, reflecting the increased depreciation and interest charges
resulting from the greatly increased capital costs and the higher proportion
of debt in the Company's financial structure.
B.   Break-Even Point
8.03      After completion of Stage III, the profit break-even point is about
53% of production capacity or 1.9 million tons of finished steel. Alterna-
tively, prices at full capacity could fall by 22% before the Company would
show a loss. At 1981 debt service requirements, the cash break-even point
would be 50% of production capacity, since debt repayment of US$130 million
is less than the US$162 million annual depreciation.  In the same year,
assuming full production, prices could fall about 30% before the Company's
cash generation would be zero. Further details on break-even levels are
found in Annex 19.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.04      The project provides a suitable incremental rate of return (after
taxes) of 10.8% in constant terms. The assumptions used for the rate of
return calculations, as well as details of the sensitivity tests thereon, are
contained in Annex 20.
8.05      To determine the effect of various events on the financial rate of
return, sensitivity tests have been run which show the following:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Capital   Operating              Rate of
Case          cost        cost       Revenue   Return
1.  (Base case)   100         100          100      10.8%
2.                 110        100          100       9.6%
3.                 100        110          100       8.5%
4.                 100         110         110      12.3%
5.                 110        110          100       7.8%
6.  One year project delay                           9.3%
7.  One year project delay and 15% cost overrun   7.5%
The above sensitivity tests indicate that under rather adverse circumstances
the project would require some increase in steel prices to provide an
adequate financial rate of return. This would be possible as the assumed
prices are still low by international comparison (Annex 1, para. 48).

D.   Financial Position
8.06      Forecast balance sheets for 1974-1983 are contained in Annex 18.
Significant data from these are shown below:

/1   Including surplus cash.
8.07      The projected long-term debt/equity ratio remains favorable during
the implementation of the project with a maximum debt position of 51% being
reached in 1978. Thereafter the debt/equity ratio declines and by 1983 CSN
would have only 23% in debt. This conservative capitalization will place the
Company in a good position to finance further expansion. Agreement was ob-
tained that, except with the prior consent of the Bank, new capital investments,
other than those for the project itself and the ongoing Stage II project, will
not exceed US$18 million equivalent in any year during the execution of the
project. This amount will include "major repairs" and new investments in
subsidiaries and other enterprises, as well as improvements and modifications
to equipment not foreseen in the project and miscellaneous administrative
equipment. It was also agreed that no new debt would be incurred by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries if the consolidated debt/equity ratio would thereby
exceed 50:50.
8.08      The current ratio increases after completion of Stage III if sur-
plus funds are included in current assets during that period. It can be
assumed that these funds will be used for further expansion (para 8.14 below)
and that the current ratio would then drop to a more normal level. The



- 26 -
minimum level under the Stage II loan agreement was 1.3. During negotiations
a slightly lower level of 1:1 was agreed, but at the same time the Government,
SIDERBRAS and BNDE agreed to make appropriate financing promptly available to
the Company if otherwise the current ratio would fall below the 1.1:1 level
at any time.
8.09      The Company's financial position should allow payment of reasonable
dividends. Cash dividends (except on existing preferred shares) will not be
permitted if, after payment of such dividends, the current ratio were to
fall below 1.3:1. Also, the Company will not issue new preferred shares if
by doing so the total par value of preferred shares would exceed the total
par value of common shares.
E.   Debt Service Coverage
8.10      CSN should have little difficulty servicing its debt.  Long-term
debt service coverage forecasts indicate the following:
Long-Term Debt Service Coverage
1974  1975    1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983
Times covered    5.9   6.1      5.4   6.8   7.7   11.5/ 2.5  3.0   3.1   3.3
/1   This high figure reflects the commencement of returns from the Stage III
expansion slightly in advance of the start of debt repayment, which has
been assumed to begin in 1980.
8.11      As for Stage II, it was reconfirmed that no new loans, other than
those for the project, should be incurred if consolidated debt service
coverage would fall or is projected to fall below two times.
F.   Company Financing During Project Implementation
8.12      The detailed Sources and Applications of Funds projections for the
Company to 1983 are contained in Annex 17. The following table summarizes
these projections during implementation of the project.

A    Including remaining drawdowns on loans for Stages I and II.
G.   Major Risks
8.13      In addition to (a) possible delays caused by the demands of three
large expansion projects on the construction and equipment manufacturing
capacity of Brazil's expanding economy, (b) a market growth somewhat slower
than predicted, and (c) an erosion of the present price/cost relationship,
the risks inherent in the project basically relate to its very large scale.
The Engineering Department of CSN will be reorganized shortly (para 4.10)
and much will depend on its ability to exercise effective control over the
capital cost and implementation schedule of the project. There is full
awareness of this potential problem within CSN and the risk of the Company's
losing control is therefore not great. Experience gained from the Stage II
expansion has improved the Company's abilities to make engineering and cost
estimates and to control the cost and progress of the expansion program.
Any adverse effects on the project on account of market limitation are also
regarded as likely to be of a temporary nature only. A moderate erosion of
the present price/cost relationship has been assumed for the financial
projections (paras 7.06 and 8.01) and the impact of various changes in the
revenue/cost relationship have been assessed (para 8.05). The results
indicate that a satisfactory financial rate of return should be obtained.
H.   Further Expansion
8.14      Further expansion of the Company's steel-producing facilities beyond
1979 (physical completion of Stage III facilities) is not expected to be
carried out at Volta Redonda due to. the physical constraints at the site.



- 28 -
It is currently envisaged that a new plant might be constructed at Sepetiba
Bay to the southwest of Rio de Janeiro. In line with the Company's growth
objectives (para 2.10) and assuming a growth into the 1980's of Brazilian
steel demand similar to that for the late seventies (para 3.03), a further
increase in CSN's production capacity of between 1.5 and 3.2 million TPY of
liquid steel would be required between 1979 and 1983. Assuming this to be
the first stage of development of a new "green-field" plant with a product
mix similar to Volta Redonda's upon the completion of Stage III, the capital
requirements for its financing could be of the order of US$2.0 to 4.8 billion
at 1979 prices, using present levels of unit capital costs as a basis. The
actual figure could well be towards the higher end of this range, particu-
larly with a high proportion of coated products in the CSN product mix. Addi-
tional investment costs would also result due to site preparation, infrastruc-
ture and investment in antipollution.equipment. The financial projections for
Stage III (Annex 17) indicate that a reasonable proportion of the new plant
could be financed from accumulated cash. Alternatively, excess cash could be
wholly or partially eliminated by a lowering of prices, or dividends could be
increased. Whatever the financing, pricing and investment plans adopted, it
seems that the Company's projected rate of cash generation is appropriate for
any reasonably foreseeable expansion. The foregoing indicates the importance
of progressing the preparation of the National Steel Plan (para 3.09).
IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01      Based on projected long-term import prices for steel products over
the assumed 18 year life of the assets, the project's return to the economy
is estimated to be 17%; this is 4% above the 13% return forecast for the
Stage II expansion and reflects the further cost savings expected from this
project. The underlying assumptions and details of the economic analysis,
including sensitivity tests are presented in Annex 21. The main conclusion
of the analysis is that the project's contribution to the economy will be
quite adequate even under very adverse conditions.
B.   Competitiveness and Protection Required
9.02      As indicated in para. 7.05 and Annex 1, selling prices for finished
flat rolled steel products in Brazil are below current prices prevailing in
Western Europe, and below current international export prices. Furthermore,
a comparison of expected production costs for CSN with those costs of a
hypothetical but representative production unit in Europe 1/ indicates that
1/   Data obtained from "Atkins Planning":  The Effects of Increased Energy
Costs on Steelmaking in Western Europe, a report prepared for the Bank;
April 1974, p. 15-17.



- 29 -
CSN should be quite competitive. The project does not therefore require
tariff protection for satisfactory operation under normal trading conditions.
C.   Net Foreign Exchange Savings
9.03      Net foreign exchange savings resulting from the project are projected
to reach US$440 million by 1981. This represents a very substantial positive
impact on Brazil's balance of payments. Further details of the calculation
of these savings are shown in Annex 22.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major commitments and assurances were obtained from
the Government, SIDERBRAS, BNDE and the Company.
A.   Commitments by the Government, SIDERBRAS and BNDE
(a) Company will maintain its present corporate form and not be
merged or consolidated without prior consultation with the
Bank (para. 2.11);
(b)  Government (including SIDERBRAS and BNDE) will make funds
available to CSN for the project of not less than US$918
million equivalent in loans or equity to be disbursed
between 1975 and 1979 (para. 5.05 and 5.08);
(c) Government will guarantee repayment of all foreign loans,
and also guarantee project completion and provision of funds
to cover cost over-runs and financing shortfalls (para. 5.07
and 5.08);

as necessary to determine whether steel prices are appropriate
(paras. 7.05) and 5.06);



- 30 -
(g) The Government, SIDERBRAS and BNDE will make appropriate
financing available such that the Company's current ratio
(as calculated from the audited financial statements) will
not fall below 1.1:1 (para. 8.08);
(h) A comprehensive plan for the development of the national steel
industry to 1985 will be prepared by June 30, 1976; the Bank
will be afforded the opportunity for an exchange of views on
the components of the plan as and when each component is
completed (paras. 8.14 and 3.09).
B.  Commitments by the Company
(a)  No investments in subsidiaries or other business entities
over US$4 million equivalent in any one fiscal year, or
loans or guarantees of loans to subsidiaries or other
business entities over US$4 million and US$12 million

(e) Overseas contractors for construction work will be invited to
bid if overextension of local construction industry is indicated
(para. 6.03);
(f) No new investments in excess of US$18 million equivalent
during each year of project implementation (para. 8.07).
(g) The current ratio shall not fall below 1.1 to one; no cash
dividends on common shares to be paid if this would cause the
current ratio to drop below 1.3; par value of preferred shares
shall not exceed par value of common shares (paras. 8.08 and
8.09);
(h) No new loans to be incurred if the debt/equity ratio would
exceed 50:50; no new loans (other than for the project) to
be incurred if debt service coverage would fall or is
projected to fall below two times (paras. 8.07 and 8.11).



- 31 -
10.02     Confirmation has been obtained that bilateral credits will be forth-
coming and of the terms of the BNDE and FINAMF. loans (para. 5.08).
10.03     Given the foregoing commitments and assurances, the project provides
a sound basis for a loan to CSN of to US$95 million equivalent for 15 years,
including a 4 year grace period.

BRAZIL
STEEL EXPANSION PROJECTS - STAGE III
THE SECTOR AND THE MARKET
Introduction
1.       This Annex discusses those aspects of the Stage III expansion pro-
gram of the three government-owned flat steel producers, CSN, COSIPA and
USIMINAS, that are common to all three expansion projects. In particular it
gives a description and evaluation of the present status and plans of the
Brazilian steel industry, the market prospects for its products and its com-
petitLive position in relation to international standards as well as the
institutional framework under which the industry works.
2.       In view of the rapidly increasing demand for steel products of all
kinds in Brazil, Stage III of the country's National Steel Program has been
somewhat accelerated.  The Second National Development Plan (II F-ID) approved by the
Congress in late 1974 now calls for the establishment of 22.3 million tons of
raw steel capacity by 197Q rather than 20 million tons by 1980, as had been
expected during the appraisal of the Stage II expansion in 1971-72.1/ The three
projects, which together constitute Stage III, are designed to increase the
capacity of Brazil's flat rolled products mills from 7.1 million tons of raw
steel ecuivalent upon completioon of Stage II to 11.4 million tons as against
11.0 million tons previously.  They are expected to reauire a total investrment
of about US$5.C billion equivalent and to be completed by the end of 1979.  The
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have been recuested to
finance US$258 million for internationally procured equipment and pmterials in
a 60:hO proportion, as for the ongoing Stage II projects. Of the Bank's share
of US$155 million, US$95 million would be lent to CSIC and US$60 million to
COSIPA. Supplementary IDB loans which in total amount to USt 03 million, were
approved by the Board of IDB in December 1974.
3.       Export credits from Austria, Belgium, Cpnada, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K. and the U.S.A. are
expected to provide sufficient financing   for eauipnment imported from these
countries, while loans from Agencia Especial de Financiarmento Industrial
(FINVME) and Banco Kacional de Desenvolvimento Economico (11DE) are to provide
additional financing required for domestically manufactured equipment and steel
structures. The balance consisting of downpayments for bilaterally financed
equipment, inland freight, civil works, construction and erection costs, engineer-
ing,  terest during construction and incremental working capital will be fin-
anced_  out of the companies' cash generation, capital increases and loans from
BNDE.

B.        History of Brazilian Steel Industry
4.        The steel industry in Brazil is of comparatively recent origin.  Of
the major producers, Belgo-Mineira in the State of Minas Gerais was the first
to start up in the 1920's. Even after the Second World War, before CSN began
operations, domestic steel production was less than 300,000 ingot tons equi-
valent, and contributed less than half of domestic consumption at that time.
Since then production has grown rapidly and in 1974 Brazil was the largest
steel producer in Latin America, responsible for 42.4% of the region's output.
Prospects for further rapid growth of the industry are good.
5.        The principal steel mills are located in the area bounded by the
cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Vitoria and Belo Horizonte, which region
also encompasses the mines which supply them with iron ore and limestone and
most of Brazil's steel consuming industry.
6.        Operating at full capacity the Brazilian steel industry produced
about 7.57 million raw steel tons in 1974, of which 45% were processed into flat
products and 55% into non-flat products. This total made Brazil the sixteenth
largest steel producer in the world in 1974, coming after Australia (7.81 million
tons) and before India (6.97 million tons).
7.        The three principal producers of flat products and their present
annual capacities in raw steel equivalents are CSN (1.60 million tons), USI1MINAS
(1.45 million tons) and COSIPA (0.78 million tons). In addition ACESITA, another
government-owned company, has a capacity of 185,000 tons of special and stainless
steel coil and sheet.. Non-flat steel is produced by some 40 companies (in addition
to CSN), of which the ten largest account for 2.8 million tons or about 75% of
total capacity. The remaining 30 units are all below 150,000 tons in capacity and
work mostly on the basis of scrap.
8.        The Government plans to expand capacity to about 22.3 million raw steel
tons by 1979, of which about 11.h million tons - or 51% - would be for flat products.
This is an ambitious program, which projects an average increase of installed steel-
making capacity of about 25% per year during the remainder of the current decade.
The corresponding growth in consumption is, however, only about 12% per year, as
Lrazil expects towards the end of the 1970's to pass from being a net importer of
steel to becoming a small net exporter. Given Brazil's performance record in the
expansion of its steel industry in the past five years and the experience it has
gained during this period, there is no reason to doubt the country's conmitment to
the planned steel expansion program, nor the skill and experience which the insti-
tutions and companies concerned can bring to bear on^ its implementation.
9.        World production of raw steel increased from 595.6 million tons in 1970 to
710.1 milli-on tons in 1974 (Table I) equivalent to an average annual growth rate of
4.6% and is expected to grow at about 4.3% per annum to around 915 million tons by
1980. This expansion of world steelmaking capacity would require a minimum caDital
investment of US$150 billion equivalent not counting any investments to replace
obsolete facilities. If steel output in Brazil reaches the 22.3 million tons target
by 1979, it will account for about 2.h% of world production as against 1% at present.
The apparent per capita steel consumption in Brazil rose from 41 kg in 1960 to 75 kg
in 1973, but is still less than in some other Latin American countries, such as
Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela. In Western Europe, the lowest levels of per capita
steel consumption in 1972 were in Portugal (101 kg) and Greece (96 kg). Australia.
and Canada consumed 480 kg and 588 kg per capita, respectively and the U.S.A. 633 kg.
Absolute and per capita steel consumption in 1060 and 1972 of some 40 counbries
around the world are shown in Table II,

The above table indicates that, among those countries listed, Brazil has
experienced one of the highest growth rates in steel consamption and in 1972
had attained a per capita consumption about equal to that of Argentina, Chile,
Portugal, Spain and Yugoslavia in 1960.
C.         Past Brazilian Steel Consumption and Supply
10.        Although consumption of steel in Brazil over the last two decades
has increased by an average of about 9% annually, it has fluctuated substantially
from year to year, in step with the general econormy. Consumption exceeded one
million tons of raw steel equivalent for the first time in 1947 and by 1960 had
increased to about 2.8 million tons. It rose further to 3.5 million tons in
1963, but then declined to 2.9 million tons in 1965 and increased again to 3.8
million tons in 1967. Since then steel consumption has risen steadily as shown
in the following table, which also gives local production as well as imports and
exports of both flat and non-flat products:

11.        On the basis of the above table the cumulative annual rate of growth
of apparent steel consumption for three periods over the past 8 years has been as
follows:                         Table IV

(in %ages)

1967-1974             23.2                 13.6                      48.3
1967-1970             19.9                   9.5                     13.9
1970-1974             25.6                 16.8                      21.7
12.        As a result of continued high growth of the economy, total consumption
of steel increased at an annual rate of 18.3% in the 1967-1974 period. In 1973,
it reached the consumption level forecast for 1971 when the Stage II expansion was
appraised and in 1974 surpassed the earlier expected 1975 consumption level by



MUINE 1

about 3.4 million tons, or by 40%. This accelerated growth was even more
pronounced in flat products, consumption of which grew at an annual rate of
23.2% during the same period, approximately 70% above the growth rate for non-
flat products. Given the present limited capacity of the Brazilian steel
industry, increased consumption has been supplied mainly by imports, which
reached 3.5 million tons in 1974, as compared to 1.5 and 0.7 million tons res-
pectively in 1973 and 1972.
13.        Past consumption (1967-1974) of principal groups of flat and non-flat
products is shown in Tables XVII and XVIII at the end of this Annex. A summary of
the annual rates of growth is given below:
Table V
Brazil - Average Annual Steel Consumption Growth Rates: 1967-1974
Flat Products                  %               Non-Flat Products           _
Heavy plates                  44.6             Rods                        16.5
Hot rolled products           19.3             Wire rods                   15.7
Cold rolled products          23.9             Bars and light sections      2.3
Tin plate                      8.0             Med. and heavy sections    28.1

Others                         6.4             Seamless pipes              17.7
Total flat products           23.2             Total non-flat products    13.6
The substantial increase in consumption of most flat products can be attributed
to the growth of heavy industry, consumer durables and non-durable consumer goods
production and shipbuilding. On the other hand, construction and heavy infras-
tructure investments have been the main areas in which consumption of non-flats
has grown.
14.        Exports have represented an increasingly smaller part of production
(2.5% in 1974).  For the most part exports constitute fulfilment of previous
sales commitments and a policy to maintain future potential markets.
15.        While imports are licensed, th6e is no indication that consumption of
steel in recent years has been held back due to import restrictions. Growth of
apparent consumption is therefore judged to reflect reasonably well the increase
in the demand for steel in Brazil.
D.         The Stage II Expansion Program
16.        In January 1971 the then newly created Conselho Nacional da Industria
Siderurgica (CONSIDER) published the general guidelines of a National Steel Pro-
gram. This program called for the establishment of 20 million tons of annual raw
steel making capacity by 1980, which represented an average rate of in;,rese of
installed capacity of 12% per annum including 10% of surplus capacity, which would
be available for exports of steel products.

What had appeared at the beginning of this decade an unprecedentedly ambitious
steel expansion program is now well on the way towards achievement. The National
Steel Program served as the basis of the Stage II expansion projects of CSNI,
USDI{NAS and COSIPA, which are designed to increase raw steel making capacity of
the companies from 1.7, 1.0 and 1.0 million tons per annum at the completion of
Stage I of their expansion program to 2.4, 2.4 and 2.3 million tons respectively,
and provide additional rolling and finishing facilities. As mentioned previously,
the Executive Directors of the Bank approved loans of US$64.5 million, Us$63 mil-
lion and US$64f.5 million during the first half of 1972 to help finance the CSN,
USIMINAS and COSIPA expansion projects. They are scheduled for completion in 1976.
17.        Progress in the implementation of these projects has generally been good
and the average delay in bringing the new facilities into operation is now estimated
to about six months. If no further delays occur, this must be considered a major
achievement,, particularly in view of the difficult equipment supply conditions
prevailing over the past two years. Particularly noteworthy are the low price levels
at which the major equipment was bid and contracted. This factor has been largely
instrumental in enabling the companies to keep the overrun on total project costs
to within 40% of the original estimates, despite changes in scope arising out of
design evolution, currency realignments, higher than expected domestic inflation and
the impact of increased fuel costs and high rates of inflation in all the equipment
supplying countries. However, as the following table VI shows, by far the major
reasons for the project cost overruns were increases in civil and construction costs,
ocean freight and engineering/administration of the expansion.

The increases in costs for civil engineering and construction work were caused by
both underestimation of physical quantities and higher than expected domestic infla-
tion.  The cost increase for equipment was primarily due to design development and
to higher oeean freight costs, which are included in the equipment budget. The costs
of engineering/administration of Stage II increased due to underestimation of the
volume of work involved and proper charging of the projects within their share of
costs under these two headings.
18.        As at the, end of December 1974 about 75% of all equipment orders were
placed. Awards, after international -oopetitive bidding, either following Bank
guidelines for Bank/IDB financed items or a modified procedure, which tak4s into
account credit terms for bilaterally financed items were as follows:

Others                                 0.3
100.0
The above table indicates that Japanese suppliers were most successful in the
bidding processes. This was largely due to the competitiveness of Japanese
suppliers during the principal period of bidding (second half 1971 through first
half 1973), but also because bidding took place at a time when steel mill equip-
ment suppliers in Japan were keen on orders following a major reduction in the
previously planned steel capacity expansion program in that country. It is
expected that in the Stage III expansion equipment orders will be distributed
more evenly, since it appears that competitive prices in the world for steel mill
equipment have narrowed significantly. As the above table indicates, Brazilian
suppliers and sub-suppliers have won about 16% of total orders placed, or about
30% of orders placed with Bank/IDB financing. Their performance in terms of quality
of workmanship and adherence to delivery schedules has, with few exceptions., been
satisfactory.
19.        All the civil engineering, construction and erection work was or is beinj
carried out by Brazilian contractors. These companies have demonstrated-their
capacity and capability to take on such major contracts. In particular, they are
able to mobilize the construction management, plant, skilled labor and materials as
and when required to meet the tight schedules set by the steel companies. While
in some instances delays in construction work have been the cause for delays in
overall project implementation, these have been due more to delays in receipt of
design informAtion and unexpected additional work necessitated to minimize inter-
ruptions of ongoing operations than their inability to adhere to their original
contractual obligations.
E.         The Stage III Expansion Program
20.        Owing to the rapid growth of consumption of steel products of all kinds,
which resulted in imports in excess of about3,5--illion tons during 1974 as mention4
previously, the Government increased in II PND capacity target from 20 million
tons of raw steel in 1980 to 22.3 millidn tons in 1979 and, at the same time, advani
the buildup of capacity by about one year. The three flat products producers were
thus requested to modify their Stage III expansion plans accordingly. The Stage Il
projects have therefore been rescheduled and revised in the light of recent technic;
commercial and market developments and now call for raw steel capacity of CSN,
USVIISNAS and COSIPA to be increased to 11.4 million tons by 1979. The present
(1974) and planned capacities of the three companies shown in the following table

21.         The individual expansion projects have been well prepared and co-
ordinated with one another and incorporate the experience gained in the ongoing
expansion program (Stage II). A common feature of all three projects is that
they will balance their plants; the excesq blast furnace capacity installed in
Stage II will be fully utilized,. All three companies will therefore install
additional sinter capacity and, in the case of CSN and USIMINAS additional
o&king capacity.  COSIPA will only reprogram the production of its existing No.5
coke oven.battery from merchant and foundry coke to metallurgical coke for
its blast furrace'operations. All three companies will be installing continuous
slab casting machines and increasing the capacity of their rolling and finishing
facilities.
22.       If as SIDRBiRAS and the conianies propose, Stage II-f were implemrerted
hard on the heels of Stage I1, the construction contractors now engaged on the
Pant sites could continue working without interruptions caused by a run-down
ahd subsequent build-up of their work force and eouipment.  Accordinu,., the com-
panies have started procuremert action for the long lead-time plant items included
in their Stage Iv  expansion projects such as coke ovens and new rol:ling; miLl.8s,
and expect to place the first contracts late in 1975 or early 1976.  Civil work "'or
Stage III is not scheduled to start before the end of 1975, by which time
the Stage II projects will be in the final phase of erection and start-up.  The
timing of Stage I1I will therefore maintain the momentum which the com.panies have
built up over the past two to three years.
F.      Governrient Polic- towards the Iron and Steel Industry, Institutions
23.       The present expansion program of the public sector steel comparlies owTes
a great deal to the efforts of CON'SIDER which was established in June 197C.  CCTSI3DM'
was instrumental in preparing the National Steel Program Twhich is the basis of the
Stage II expansion projects of CSN, COSIPA and USI7N.IL.AS and in arranging the neces-
sar-y foreign and local f'inancing to permit these projects to be implemented.
24.       Tn September 1973, the Government created SiderurgiLa Brasileira, S.A.
(SIDER3RAS), a holding company, to be responsible for new public sector projects,
such as the Tubarao semi-finished products plant and Brazilian joint ventures ,.n
foreign countries, such as the proposed 100,00C  tons per year steel mill in Paraguay.
BlTDE decided also to set up a holding company for its interests in the steel indus-
try, specifically in USI4INAS and COSIPA.  Eventually these two holdin.-: compan'es
were to be merged giving SIDERBRAS control over the entire public steel sector.
25.       The new administration which came into office in Niarch 1974 decided against
this plan and announced that all public sector companies and projects would be placed
under the control of SIDERBRAS from the outset.  Accordingly, an amended version of

the SIDERBI3dS law was drafted which was approved by Congress in iJovember 1974.
In sumriary the law designates STDRBlRAS to prormote and manage Government interests
in the iron and steel industr- and the procurementl of the domestic and foreign
capital and operating resources required for the operation of the plants, tc co-
ordinate the industrial and commercial polic-es of the steel producers and to
stimulate the formation and development of the huran resources needed for the
activities of the Brazilian iron and steel industry.
26.       The Board of SIDERRBAS is appointed b. the li-nister of Tndu r  an.d
Corr..erce and consists of the President, General Alfredo Americo da Silva, previously
President of CSI!, the Director Superintendent, Director of Finance, and Director
of Raw Materials and Marketing.  The day-to-day operations ot SID'-BPAS are handled
byr a staff of some 20 engineers, financial analysts and &conomists, most of whom
transferred from CO!'SIDER to SIDERBBAS upon the latter's creation in 1973.
27.       In August 1974 a new decree modifying the original CONSIDER decree
was published.  The major change is in the scope of CO'S(DER, which now covers
the non-ferrous in addition to the iron and steel sector.  C0-SIDER is charged with
:oinulatiing r-.nd coordinatirng an industrial development policy, establishing criteria
for the granting of incentives, approving new and expansion projects, establishing
general directives for the commercial and financial policies of the industries,
planning investment, coordinating the raising of the recuired. financial resources,
and carrying out studies for the developrent of the sectors.
28.       Working relationships between COINSIDER and SIDLERBRAS are good.  The two
entities will cooperate closely in the preparation of a new National Steel Plan for
the period 1975-83. This National Steel Plan will be a comprehensive document
covering all.. asnects affecting the development and operation of the Brazilian steel
industry, both in the public and nrivate sector, such as raw material availabilities,
the growth of the domestic and,export markets, pricing of steel products, the capa-
bility of the local equipment manufacturing industry, local financing recuirements,
the development of the necessary managerial dnd L1dustrial skills and infrastructure
requirements. Some of these aspects, such as the growth of demand for steel have already
been studied (and will be updated continuously)., while work on the others has begun
or will shortly be initiated.  Consultants will be appointed early in 1975 to pre-
pare, by the end of 1975, in conjunction with CONSIDER and SIDERBRAS, the National
Steel Plan which will incorporate the findings of the various sub-studies listed
above.
G.        The Market
29.       The Brazilian Government commissioned several studies of the domestic
steel market during the past decade. The first one, the foreign exchange cost of
which was financed by the Bank, was carried out by Booz, Allen and Hamilton Inter-
national in association with Tecnometal in 1965.
30.       Tecnometal carried out another study in 1970, which served as the basis
of the Bank's appraisal of the Stage II expansion projects of CSN, USIMINAS and
COSIPA. This study, which took 1969 as the base year, produced demand projections
for the period 1970-1980 with special ermphasis on the years 1970-1975.
31.       The continued high rate of economic growth in Brazil during 1970-1974
resulted in a much greater increase of domestic steel consumption than forecast in the
1970 study.  Accordingly CONSIDER commissioned Tecnometal in May 1974 to undertake
a new study of the Brazilian steel market for the period 1975-1983.  Special emphasis
was placed on flat products, because these are exclusively produQed by public-sector
companies.



ANNEX 1
Page 20
32.       The final version of this study, which was completed in December 1974,
is based on extensive discussions between Tecnometal and the marketing departments
of the flat-products companies, CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA, and on a detailed analysis
of the sixteen major steel consuming sectors in Brazil. In addition, Tecnometal
carried out a macro-economic analysis of the entire steel demand, covering flat as
well as non-flat and special steel products.
33.       The sectoral forecast is based on an analysis of questionnaires completed
in mid-1974 by major steel consumers, which were aware of the growth targets estab-
lished in II PND which was then available in draft form. There is therefore a
linkage between the sectoral forecast of a total flat steel demand in 1980 of 10.2
million tons comprising uncoated and coated common steel flat-rolled products and a
GDP growth rate of 10% per annum in the second half of the 1970's  which is the
underlying assumption in II PND. Table IX shows the expected growth of demand durine
1975-1981 ,which averages out at 14.1% per annum.
34.       The Bank Economic Mission which visited Brazil in January 1975 formed
the view that, on account of the balance of payments constraint likely to persist
over the next few years, Brazil's GDP growth rate in the period 1975 through 1980
would be around 7% per annum rather than 10% as stipulated in II PND.
35.       Consequently the Bank prepared a new macro-economic forecast based on
a regression between apparent flat-rolled steel consumption and GDP for the period
1967 through 1973. (Table IX). The apparent consumption figures for 1974 were ignored
as it is known that heavy stock-piling of steel inventories took place in that year,
which would have introduced an upward bias in the forecast.
36.       According to the Bank's computation the demand eleasticity for flat steel
io 1.71.  The application of this elasticity to the predicted 7% GDP growth rate
gives a 12% demand growth rate for flat products. Thus the macro-economic forecast
of common and coated flat steel demand in 1980 is 8.3 million tons.
37.       Tablej3l shows the domestic demand for flat products during 1975-1981
as predicted by the sectoral and macro-economic forecasts.  It will be 3een that
for the reasono set out above, the sectoral forecast is Preater than the macro-
economic forecast; in 1980 the difference between the demand for flat products
forecast by the two methods is 1.85 million tons.
38.       The effect of the postulated lower GDP growth rate on the structure of
flat steel consumption has not yet been determined. It can be expected, however,
that a greater proportion of heavy plate will be consumed, as the use of heavy
plate is primarily associated with construction projects, while the end use of hot
and cold rolled coil and sheet is largely in consumer durables. However, using
the structure of consumption which prevailed in the recent past the Bank has, on
the basis of the macro-economic forecast, prepared a new aeries of demand projections
for the principal flat products - heavy plate, hot rolled coil and sheet, uncoated
cold rolled coil and sheet and coated coil and sheet which is shown in Table XII.



AITNEX 1
Page 21
39.       A comparison between the domestic demand projections for flat products,
excluding special qualities, and the sales forecasts of the three flat products
producers, CSN, COSIPA and USIEMINAS, is shown in Table XI. It will be seen that
in 1980 demand and supply are expected to be more or less in balance, but that
already in 1981, the first year in which the Stage III facilities are expected to be
in full operation, the deficit between supply and demand is projected to increase
to 900,000 tons of flat-rolled products.
40.       This underlines the need for the national steel study, which SIDKRBRP.S
and CONTSIDER will jointly commission, in order to determine the parameters - scope,
location and timing - of the Stage IV expansion program. The first 1 million tons
of raw steel deficit after 1980 could be supplied by the Tubarao semi-finished
products plant, if the decision to proceed is taken in 1975, but any additional
tonnages over and above this 1 million tons will require the installation of a new
blast furnace, either at COSIPA, USIMIINAS or a greenfield plant.
41.       Projected supply and demand comparisons for the individual principal
flat-rolled products groups - heavy pla-te, hot rolled coil and sheet, uncoated
cold rolled coil and sheet, and coated cold rolled coil and sheet are shown in Tables
XII, XIII, XIV, XV.
42.       For heavy plate the present supply deficit is expected to continue
throughout the period under consideration, reducing to 160,000 t..ns in 1978 but
increasing again thereafter to 550,000 tons in 1981 (Table XII). USIMINAS or
COSIPA or both companies will therefore need to install the second plate mill
stand by 1980 in order to provide additional plate rolling capacity.
43.       The projected demand and supply comparison for the hot rolled coil and sheet
shows a reasonable balance after 1975 (Table XIII). Such surpluses and deficits as
are predicted are within the order of accuracy of the estimates - rated capacities,
learning curves and product mix on the supply side and market forecasts on the
demand side. From 1979 however, additional hot rolling capacity need be installed
to cover the rapidly increasing supply deficit.
44.          For uncoated cold rolled coil and sheet (Table XIV) the demand and
supply situation is expected to become reasonably balanced after corpletion of the
Stage III expansion. No additional cold rolling capacity need be installed before
1982.
45.       For coated products (Table XV) - tinplate, galvanized coil and sheet
and, to a lesser extent, terne plate and black plate for enameling - the projections
show a continuing deficit in the 1975-1981 period.  This deficit is insignificant
in 1976 but increases thereafter to a minimurm of 100,000 tons per year. Additional
finishing facilities should therefore be installed by 1981 based on the next market
study which is expected to be carried out in 1976.
46.       In comparing the supply and demand situation for individual flat products
groups it must be remembered that there is a degree of interchangeability between
the different product groups. The companies will therefore be able to adjust their
production programs to suit the characteristics of the market at any particular time.
The projections indicate that, overall, the companies' proposals for installing
additional rolling and finishing capacity are appropriate in the light of the
expected development of the market. The next market study(to be carried out in
1976) and the conclusions of this study should serve as the basis for

determir,ing the nature and capacity of the rolling and finishing facilities to
be installed as part of Stage IV of Brazil's steel expansion program. and to be
operational by 19&32.
47.          In the field of non-flat products CSN is the only producer of rail-
road rails and accessories in Brazil. Upon completion of the revamp of the
breakdown rill included in the Stage I expansion CSN's rail producing capacity
will be 142,000 tons per annum, which is insufficient to satisfy the requirements
of the ongoing railway expansion and modernization project. Accordingly, the Bank
has asked CSN to examine the feasibility of further increasing the capacity of its
rail ani . s- :ural m'L`.L in order to reduce the need for importations of rails.
Corpetitiveness
48.        The corpetitiveness of Brazil's steel price structure is shown
in Table XVI which corpares Brazilian domestic selling prices as of hviarch
1975, exclusive of ICM tax, of representative flat rolled products with
donestlc prices in the UJnited States and with domestic and exporu prices
in West Europe, exclusive value added tax.

This comparison shows Western European and US domestic prices are above
those for Brazil and that - except for cold rolled sheet - Brazilian domestic
prices are in line with West European Export prices by the end of the first
quarter 1975.
49.        Price comparisons of this nature are always difficult to make, as
actual transaction prices may d;ffer from posted prices) the exact size and
quality of the products sold may differ from case to case, the selling price
may include a concealed discount in the form of extended credit terms or
waiving of quality and dimensional extras, and due to the frequency with which
selling prices have been adjusted of late the reference dates may not be the
same.  Nevertheless, it is clear that Brazilian domestic selling prices for
heavy plate, hot rolled products and cold rolled products are fully in line
with those prevailing in Western Europe and the US.



ANNEX 1
P age 23
50.        The remarks on the tables XVII snd XVIII on pages 26 and 27
of this annex clearly indicate that price comparisons of this nature are
not only difficult but also very quickly outdated.  'West European export
prices declined by about 35-45% during the past nine months, while the
European domestic price level for flat steel rose by approximately 10-15%
during the same period.
51.        In the recent past, Brazil's exports have been confined to ful-
filling contracts signed before the advent of the present acute domestic
supply deficit, but no new exports of flat products have actively been
promoted. As Tables XII, XIII, XIV and XV show, no significant export sur-
pluses are expected before the end of the present decade. Brazil's declared
objective of exporting 10% of its steel production will therefore have to be
deferred until the implementation of Stage IV of the country's Steel Expansion
Program.  As the analysis of CSN's and COSIPA's cost structure shows, the
implementation of the Stage III facilities will further serve to strengthen
Brazil's competitive position in the export market0

Utilities
46.       Boiler House:   The Volta Redonda plant has three sources of steam.
The blast furnace boiler house has capacity to generate 730,000 lb of steam
per hour at 475 psig and 725F., in 7 boilers. In addition, each of the
eight open hearth furnaces is provided with a firetube waste-heat boiler
and a motor-driven induced draft fan. These boilers produce steam at a
pressure of 165 psig and 450F. Three automatic out-door boilers near the
rolling mills each produce 50 tons/hour at 165 psig and 450F.
47.       Powerhouse:  Three turbo blowers for the blast furnaces are installed
in the powerhouse. Blowers No. 1 and No. 2, rated at 35 psig discharge pre-
ssure and 65,000 inlet cfm are driven by turbines and operated in parallel.
Blower No. 3 is rated at 100,000 inlet cfm and a discharge pressure of 35
psig. A fourth turbo-blower, rated at 250,000 inlet cfm and 45 psig discharge
pressure, is provided in Stage II in a separate building, for use with the
new No. 3 blast furnace.
48.       Electric Power Distribution:  Purchased power at Volta Redonda
comes from 132 KV lines and is distributed through several switchgear groups,
substations, underground systems to plant buildings and towered substation
interconnections. Power generating facilities consist of four steam-driven



ANNEX 2
Page 9
turbogenerators, two 5,000 kw units and two 10,000 kw units at 0.8 power
factor. Power is distributed throughout the plant at 6.9 KV and 34.5 KV
through existing substations for different plant sections.
49.       Water System:  The water system pumping plant, located on the
south bank of the Paraiba River, supplies directly or indirectly all water
for the plant. The inlet is provided with screens and four silt-settling
basins.
50.       The second source of general service water is the recirculating
pump house, where a portion of the discharge water from the powerhouse surface
condensers is repumped into the blast furnace cooling water system. The five
service water pumps located in the river pump house have a rating of 12,500
gallons per minute at 170 feet head. The recirculating water pumps are rated
12,500 gpm at 170 feet head and were formerly located at the river pump house.
51.       Seven circulating water pumps, which serve the surface condensers
at the turboblowers and turbogenerators in the powerhouse are located at the
main pump house and each has a pumping capacity of 15,000 gpm at 100 feet head.
52.       The water treatment plant, located near the main pump house, pro-
vides treated water to the CSN plan and to the city of Volta Redonda. It is
supplied by three raw water pumps, previously mentioned, in the main pump
house; each of these pumps has a capacity of 4,000 gpm at 60 feet head. The
treated water is delivered to the city and to points of usage in the plant,
by three pumps each rated 2,600 gpm at 170 feet head.
53.       A water clarifying facility is located adjacent to and north of the
water treatment plant, for supplying process water to the electrolytic tinning
lines and to other production operations using processed water.
54.       Compressed Air System:  Four Stage II 7,000 cfm rotary compressors
are being installed; three in the rolling mill area and one in the powerhouse,
freeing existing smaller 800 cfm compressors for service in lower consumption
areas, such as the foundry and shops that require additional supply.
55.       Sewers:  The plant sewer system collects water, industrial water
and acid. All polluted water and acids are treated before being discharged
into the Brandao and Paraiba rivers adjacent to the plant.
56.       Fuels:  Coke oven gas from the by-product plant goes first to a
1,000,000 cubic foot gas holder, and precipitator-cleaned blast furnace gas
is piped to a 5,000,000 cubic foot gas holder. There are also four oil
storage tanks with a combined capacity of over 2,200,000 gallons.
57.       Fuel oil is received t-hrough a PETROBRAS pipe-line (Caxias - Sta.
Cruz - Volta Redonda) which has sufficient capacity to meet future expansion
needs. Coke breeze, as produced, is consumed in the sintering plant. By-
product tar is used as a fuel only in the open hearth furnaces. For special



ANNEX 2
Page 10
applications, such as cutting-torch fuel, liquefied petroleum gas is available
from storage tanks and acetylene from generators located within the CSN plant.

CSN EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
Subsidiaries
The following companies are the subsidiaries of CSN:
1.   CECISA - Imobiliaria Santa Cecilia S.A.
CECISA, also located in Volta Redonda was organized on February 24,
1964, and it handles construction and real-estate activities for CSN. It
builds and sells houses and apartments to employees under the official
housing program in collaboration with BNH - Banco Nacional de Habitacao -
(National Housing Bank). It also handles the administration of CSN's
properties, supervises repairs and draws up leases and contracts, etc.
2.   COBRAPI - Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Industriais
COBRAPI, one of the largest engineering corporations in Brazil,
emerged in January 28, 1963, out of the engineering department CSN had at
that time. It is now an efficient and well established company dealing
with engineering projects not only for CSN but also for many others, espe-
cially but not exclusively in the steel industry. Besides the work performed
for CSN's expansion, COBRAPI has rendered the following services to these
companies:
COSIPA         - Expansion plan in cooperation with
Arthur G. McKee,
USIBA          - Construction of the plant
ACESITA        - Plant expansion
ICOMI          - Design of building for the manganese
pelletizing plant
FERRO E ACO
DE VITORIA    - A new electric open hearth plant,
COMINAG        - Calcination of magnesite, and
COSIM          - Expansion feasibility plan.
It has also promoted courses for specialization of technicians and draftsmen.
It is located in Volta Redonda. It works on a cost-plus basis, charging
CSN with its lowest rate.
3.   EPLAN - Emissao e Planeiamento de Seguros S.A.
EPLAN, which operates as an insurance agent, was organized on April
29, 1968. It earns a commission on the insurance handled, plus a participation
on the profits made during the year on the policies issued.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.   LAVADOR - Lavador de Capivari S.A.
LAVADOR was organized on August 18, 1968, when CSN decided to con-
centrate only on the steel producing activities, leasing some of the
secondary supporting operations to subsidiary companies. This company grew
out of the coal washing facilities at Tubarao, Santa Catarina State. The
plant also washes coal for USIMINAS and COSIPA.
5.   OPALMA - Oleos de Palma S.A.
This corporation was established in Salvador, Bahia, on May 27,
1961, .under SUDENE (Superintendency of Northeast Development) legislation,
for the production of palm oil from its own extensive plantations - still
underway, for which selected seeds were imported from Africa. CSN took over
the control of this company in April, 1964. The industrial unit is now
operating with raw material from the Company's own trees and from individual
farmers. Palm oil, used in the manufacture of tin plates, previously imported
from the Belgian Congo, is now entirely supplied to the Volta Redonda plant
by OPAIMA. Substantial quantities are still sold to soap and margarine
processing industries and for cooking purposes.
6.   PROSPERA - Sociedade Carbonifera Prospera S.A.
This is a coal producing company organized in 1924 and is located
in the State of Santa Catarina. CSN bought control on May 31, 1946. After
many years of operation, the mines CSN explored in Santa Catarina State
near Sideropolis were added to PROSPERA in 1969. PROSPERA pays CSN a royalty
for the exploration of the mines still held as CSN property. Besides coking
coal, steam coal is also produced and sold to local power plants.
7.   SOTECNA - Sociedade Tecnica de Administracao e Corretagem de Segures Ltda.
SOTECNA was organized on December 4, 1964, as an insurance broker
and administrator mainly for CSN's insurance. The firm grew out of the
Insurance Department CSN had within the accounting and financial area. In
1972 only 2% of its revenues came from CSN and its subsidiaries, compared to
76% in 1965, its first full year of operation.
8.   UTE - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A.
This company was organized on August 18, 1968, by converting a
former power producing department CSN maintained in Tubarao, State of Santa
Catarina. The company was taken over by the government as of March 1973 and
is being liquidated.

COSIM - Companhia Siderurgica de Mogi das Cruzes
COSIM was created by a specific law in 1966 but was incorporated
only on July 28, 1968. Although not considered a subsidiary by CSN, all
its voting capital is owned by CSN, which by law was directed to assume its
control. The government increased CSN's capital in order to provide the
necessary funds to invest in COSIM's capital. COSIM produces steel bars
and seamless pipes.

BRAZIL
CSN EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
Description of Stage III Expansion
Overall Concept
1.        The facilities at the CSN Volta Redonda Plant are described in
Annex 2 as at the completion of Stage II of the expansion program. The
stages of the program are as follows:
Stage          Production Capacity          Timing of Completion
(liquid steel)
I              1.7 million TPY 1/           1st quarter, 1975
(mostly complete by
3rd quarter, 1974)
II             2.5 million TPY              1st quarter, 1976
III           4.6 million TPY              3rd quarter, 1979
2.        The main factors that, characterize the overall expansion program
of CSN are the following:
(a) increased production of coke from mixtures of imported and
domestic coals in which the latter component will normally
not exceed 20% of total usage;
(b) expansion of hot-metal production in a large, modern blast
furnace operated at an optimal iron-make;
(c) introduction of BOF steel-making with rapid replacement of
open-hearth production;
(d) slab production by continuous casting supplemented by ingot-
mold teeming;
(e) expanded use of own iron ore sources for prepared blast furnace
burden containing about 94% of sinter and pellets;
1/   All tons are metric tons; TPY is (metric) tons per year.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(f) expansion of rolling capacity to process expanded steel output
in a product mix that improves profitability and is in line
with market requirements.
3.        The basis for planning the Stage III expansion has been to maximize
the steel-making capacity of the three-vessel BOF shop (2 vessels in
Stage II; third in Stage III), and expand coke, sintering, rolling, and
other facilities in balance with iron and steel making capacity.
4.        The ultimate development of the Volta Redonda site is constrained
by infrastructural limitations (especially transport), and physical con-
straints of the site itself, such as the Paraiba River, the surrounding hills
and the adjacent town.
5.        It was previously foreseen that the theoretical capacity of the
site was about 6.3 million TPY of raW steel, but the Company is currently
considering that expansion beyond the 4.6 million TPY Stage III level ought
to be undertaken at a new location.
New Installations
6.        The principal facilities that comprise the Stage III expansion are
described below:
Coke Ovens and By-Product Plant
7.        Two new coke oven batteries will be constructed west of and in
line with the existing batteries. Battery No. 4 will have 52 ovens and
No. 5 will have 51 ovens. The ovens will be of the underjet fired type
designed to burn coke gas diluted in blast furnace gas, blast furnace gas
enriched with coke oven gas, or coke oven gas alone. Each of the ovens
will be 15.4 meters long bv 6.0 meters high by 0.457 meters in width, giving
a working volume of 37.3 m3 per oven. The new batteries will be equipped
with coal bins, larry car, pusher car, quenching equipment and a coke wharf
extension. Coal and coke preparation and handling equipment included in
Stage II will be of sufficient capacity to cater adequately for the Stage
III batteries.   By-product facilities will include electrostatic detarrers,
scrubbers, and other equipment for recovery of coke oven gas, ammonia,
napthalene, and the collection and distillation of tar.
Blast Furnace
8.        Assuming that the three-vessel BOF shop will operate with an 80%
hot metal charge, and allowing for foundry hot metal requirements, the 4.6
million TPY liquid steel production level foreseen for Stage III will require
about 4,380,000 TPY of hot metal. At a 97% availability (354 days per year)
this is equivalent to 12,000 tons per day (TPD).
9.        Although the new No. 3 blast furnace has been designed for a 6,000
TPD nominal capacity, it is capable of producing at a 7,000 TPD rate. The
remaining 5,000 TPD will be produced by furnaces Nos. 1 and 2. The latter



AINEX 7
Page 3
furnace is capable of 2,000 TPD without major modification, and No. 1
furnace will be enlarged to enable a production of 3,000 TPD.
Sintering Facilities
10.       Following the completion of No. 3 sinter plant during Stage II,
production capacity will be 9,700 TPD of screened sinter. This is equivalent
to about 22.8 tons/m2 of grate area per day. Sinter plant No. 4 will be
largely a duplicate of No. 3 machine, with a rated capacity of 4,600 TPD of
screened sinter, or 1,510,000 TPY. It will have a grate area of 165.8 m2 and
a cooling capacity of 45 tons/m2 of grate area per 24 hours. Before the pro-
duction, level of 4.6 million TPY of liquid steel is reached, the 14,300 TPD
of screened sinter production from the four plants will be augmented with
sized ore and iron ore pellets in the blast furnace burdens.
11.       The new sintering installation will include a grinding station for
coke and limestone, raw material stock bins, unit proportioning system,
mixing drums, conveyor system, feeder system, ignition furnace, sinter
braker, exhaust system, hot sinter screen and cooler. A new crushing and
screening station for cold sinter will also be installed, as well as a new
conveyor belt system to transport sinter to the No. 3 blast furnace
stockhouse.
12.       A new raw material stockyard with conveyor system, stacker, and
reclaimer will be provided to supply the No. 4 machine.
Steelmaking Facilities
13.       The new BOF shop being built under Stage II has been designed for
the addition of a third 200-ton vessel, which will be added in Stage III.
The expanded shop will operate with two vessels at a time while the third is
under repair. It is planned that with two vessels in operation an average
of 63 heats per day will be tapped, with an average tap to tap heat time of
45.7 minutes. This heat time allows for the necessity of synchronizing the
converters with the continuous casters.
14.       Of the new liquid steel production rate of 4.6 million TPY by the
completion of Stage III, 3.2 million TPY will be directed to the continuous
casters and 1.4 million TPY will be cast as ignots.
15.       The new installation will include complementary equipment such as
the OG gas cleaning system, lances, hoists, additional ladles, charging
boxes, etc. The flux addition system will also be adapted for the third
vessel. There will be minimum modification to water and OG equipment.
Calcining Facilities
16.       The expansion of steel production to 4.6 million TPY will increase
lime requirements to 437,500 TPY and calcined dolomite to 109,500 TPY -
equivalent to 1,200 TPD and 300 TPD respectively. For lime calcining, these
quantities are based on CaO consumption of 70 kg per ton of liquid steel,



ANNEX 7
Page 4
92% availability of CaC in the lime, and 20% fines. Of the 437,500 tons,
350,000 TPY will be used in the BOF plant and 87,500 TPY of fines will be
used in sinter production. For dolomite calcining, MgO consumption of 17.5
kg per ton of liquid steel has been assumed, with 92% MgO availability and
20% fines. The 109,500 TPY of calcined dolomite will be consumed at the
rate of 87,500 TPY in the BOF plant and 22,000 TPY of fines in the sinter
plants.
17.       Although the requirements of lime and calcined dolomite will be
400 TPD and 300 TPD respectively, two 400 TPD plants will be installed to
achieve the economies resulting from purchasing two identically sized and
designed kilns.
18.       Auxiliary facilities for the plants will be expanded, including
additional transport sytems, screens, troughs, crusher, and storage bins.
Utilities such as the blower house, electrical substation, stand-by genera-
tors, low-pressure boilers, pump houses and fuel oil system will also be
expanded.
Oxygen Producing Facilities
19.       At the completion of Stage II, the three oxygen plants will have
a combined capabity of 1,020 TPD (one plant at 70 TPD, one at 250 TPD, the
newest at 700 TPD). At the 4.6 million TPY steel production rate for Stage
III, oxygen requirements will total 2,100 TPD, comprising 1,260 TPD for the
BOF plant, 660 TPD for the No. 3 blast furnace, and 180 TPD for other purposes.
The resulting increase in demand of 1,080 TPD will be met by the installation
of a new oxygen plant with a capacity of 1,100 TPD.
Continuous Casters
20.       The continous casting rate of 3.2 million TPY planned for Stage
III will require the installation of two two-strand casting machines in
addition to the machine being installed for Stage II. Although similar in
design to the Stage II machine, the new installation will cast slabs with
larger dimensions as follows:
Stage II Machine       Stage III Machines
Maximum Slab Length         18.3 meters            25.9 meters
Maximum Width               1,260 mm.              1,520 mm.
Maximum Thickness           150 mm (6 inches)      203.2 mm (8 inches)
21.       Although the Stage II .iachine will be initially limited to 6-inch
slabs due to limitations of the present hot strip mill, the new hot strip
mill will enable it to produce slabs of eight inch thickness. Casting speed
of the newer machines will be 2.0 meters per minute with slab dimensions of



ANNEX 7
Page 5
200 mm by 790 to 1,500 mm.  Producing 8-inch slabs, the capacity of each of
the two newer machines will be 1.2 million TPY. Like the Stage II machine,
each will be designed to accept 200 ton ladles. The Stage III machines will
be located in a building adjacent to the Stage II installation. Vacuum
degassing for certain grades of steel may be required, with space for this
being allowed for in the first machine building.
Blooming and Slabbing Mill
22.        The existing 44" slabbing-blooming mill is in poor condition and
incurs high maintenance costs. Furthermore, the planned production expansion
and the increase in slab weight also make it necessary to renew some of the
mechanical equipment in the mill. The new equipment will consist of an ingot
receiving table, a mill approach table and a mill runout table, each includ-
ing solid forged steel rollers with anti-friction bearings. The ingot
receiving table will be designed to suit the existing ingot buggy and the mill
approach and runout tables will suit existing foundations. Use will be made
of a number of existing 35 and 50 HP motors.
Hot Strip and Plate Mill
23.        The new semi- continuous 66-inch hot strip mill will be designed to
produce 3 million TPY. It will handle slabs up to 8 inches thick, 62 inches
wide, and 46 feet long. Finished strip will be up to 0.5 inches thick and
62 inches wide, with a maximum coil weight of 68,000 lb. The installation
will include two slab yards, four 250 tons/hour slab heating furnaces with
slab extractor and slab return ear, furnace approach and delivery tables, a
roughing mill with five stands, a finishing mill with seven stands, and a
combination flying shear line.
24.       Roughing mill equipment will consist of a 45-inch vertical edging
mill, two 50" x 66" two-high rouging mills, three 44" x 60" x 66" four-high
mills, and tables between the vertical edging mill and the crop shear. The
vertical edging mill will be an independent edger used as an vertical
scalebreaker. The first two-high rougher will be a horizontal mill and the
second two-high rougher and the three four-high stands will be universal
roughing mills with attached vertical edging mills. All the vertical mills
will be of the overhead driven type. The second two-high rougher will be
designed for back passing and the last two four-high stands will be close
coupled. Speeds will range from 220 feet/minute for the vertical edger to
850 feet/minute for the last stand.
25.       Other roughing mill equipment will consist of motor-operated sleds
for roll changing, motor-driven rack and pinion type side guards on the
tables, and cobble disposal equipment. Between the roughing mill and the
finishing mill a crop shear and a descaling unit will be provided.
26.       The finishing mill equipment will consist of seven 28-1/2" x 60" x 66"
four high mills. Exit speed will be approximately 3,805 feet/minute. The
installation will include an automatic gauge control system, work roll
bending equiment, loopers, roll changing equipment, run-out table equipment

coilers), upenders, a pneumatic booster system for the coilers, conveyors,
grease system, hydraulic systems, a two roll balance system, strip and roll
cooling equipment, and roll lifting and assembly rigs.
27.       Hot finishing capacity will be expanded by the installation of a
1/4" combination flying shear line, designed to produce approximately
30,000 tons/month. Strip up to 62' in width and 0.25" thick will be handled,
with 68,000 lb as the maximum coil weight and 12 meters as the maximum sheet
length. The shearing line equipment will consist of an entry coil conveyor,
payoff reel, pinch rolls, upcut shear, tension bridles, two-high temper mill,
side trimmer, retractable tension reel, rotary flying shear, leveler, reject
piler, and prime piler. Adequate entry and delivery storage area will be

the former mostly for hot band for tinplate and the latter for hot band for
sheet. Each will have a capacity of 1,100,000 TPY and will receive coil from
the new hot strip mill (No. 2). Maximum strip size will be 1/4" thick by
62" wide, with tinplate strip averaging 32" in width and sheet strip 44".

/1  The output of 4.38 million tons of raw steel is equivalent to 4.6 million
tons of liquid steel production, with continuous casting.
Utilization of Plant Units
63.       The proposed facilities are foreseen as operating by 1981 at high
levels of utilization, i.e. over 90% in most cases. This indicates a well
balanced plant, which is tne objective since no further expansions are
foreseen at the Volta Redonda site beyond the Stage III expansion.
Labor Force
64.       The Company is continuing to refine its estimates of manpower
requirements and to develop manpower plans taking into account both expansion
and replacement needs. The consultants Arthur D. Little have recommended
improved approaches to personnel planning and staff development which the
Company is proceeding to implement. The labor force of the Company is fore-
cast to grow as follows during t>e expansion:

BRAZIL
CSN EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
Ecology
1.        Although pollution control laws and regulations have been in
existence in Brazil since 1917, these are still in the early stages of
development. In 1967, the National Council for Environmental Control was
established. The execution of pollution control is carried out by state
and municipal bodies empowered by the Council. There are Federal and State
regulations concerning water, air and noise management.
2.        When specifying the new facilities to be installed in both Stage II
and Stage III, the Company proceeded on the premise that air and water
pollution control should be in line with U.S. standards and Brazilian
regulations, whichever is the more stringent. Stage III pollution control
facilities thus involve expansion of those incorporated in Stage II, e.g.,
the biological treatment plant for the coke plant effluent water, the
sinter plant dust collection system, the OG gas cleaning system for the BOF
shop. One of the major contributions to the effectiveness of pollution
control from the two expansion programs is the replacement of the open-hearth
steel-making process with the basic oxygen process. Thus the entire invest-
ment in the new melting shop facilities can be credited with vastly improved
air pollution control. Although the Company has not traditionally placed
great emphasis on environmental management, steps are being taken to obtain
measures of pollution levels produced by the waste liquids, gases, dust and
noise which result from the various iron and steel-making processes. The
Company has supplies quantitative estimates of pollution levels from the
various pollution sources in the plant expansions and will be requested during
negotiations to ensure that adequate measures are taken to monitor and control
these within acceptable limits.
3.        A summary of the main air and water pollution sources and the
methods of management is set out below. The facilities are provided for in
the cost of the project and are estimated to account for approximately 2% of total
equipment costs, as compared to about 5% for Stage II. The reduction is due to
the fact that many of the environmental devices needed for the project were
already installed as part of Stage II. An environmental study 1/ of the plant
recently completed by UNIDO consultants noted that "extreme care has been taken
by CSN to incorporate from the start latest anti-pollution measures in all the
1/ UNIDO: "Environmental Aspects of Industrial Development in Developing
Countries--Case Study of an Integrated Iron and Steel Plant in Brazil",
November 6, 1974.

expanded units."  The consultants also noted the marked improvement planned
for the expansion in contrast with the existing facilities. Noise levels in
the plant will be controlled to a maximum of 85 decibels (dB-A-85) in operating
areas, e.g., acoustic lining for sinter plant exhaust and cooler; silencer on
coke oven gas compressor.

ANNEX 13

BRAZIL
CSN EXPANSION PROJECT - STAGE III
Raw Materials
1.        The most important raw materials, from the standpoint of volume
and/or value are coking coal, iron ore (fines, sized ore and pellets),
limestone and dolomite, and scrap. Current and projected sources of supply
for these are discussed below. The table which follows summarizes estimated
major raw material consumption volumes for 1974 and the projected future
levels with full Stage III production (1981), together with the unit prices
used in the financial projections (September 1974).
Coal
2.        Of the estimated 3.2 million TPY of coking coal which will be con-
sumed at the Stage III level of production, some 2.5 million TPY or 80% will
be imported. The locally supplied coal which will make up the remaining 20%
(currently 30%) of the total will come mostly from the Company's own mines
in the State of Santa Catarina. It is government policy that a specified
proportion of domestic coal be used, even though it is of low quality (high
ash and sulfur content) and costly to transport. The Company has coal reserves
of over 270 million tons, and its subsidiary Carbonifera Prospera S.A. will
undertake expansion of its present facilities to provide for the increasing
needs. Some 1.5 million TPY of the imported coal requirements have already
been contracted for in the U.S. and Poland. Of the remainder (about 300,000
tons in 1978 and 1.0 million TPY thereafter), negotiations for supply are
being carried out in Australia, South Africa, Germany and Canada. Long-term
supply prospects in Colombia are also being investigated. Although there are
some uncertainties associated both with securing long-term coking coal supplies
and with price levels, the Company is making every effort to manage the
situation, including spreading its sources of supply and re-organizing its
supply function.
Iron Ore
3.        Iron ore, either in the form of fines for the sinter plant, sized
lumps for the blast furnaces and the melting shop, and pellets for the blast
furnaces, will continue to be supplied entirely from the Company's own opera-
tions at Casa de Pedra, some 420 km by rail from Volta Redonda in the State
of Minas Gerais. The mine has about 250 million tons of economically
minable reserves, which are mainly high in iron content (over 60%), and
low in sulfur, phosphorous and ocher impurities. As part of Stage III, the
mine operations are to be expanded to a capacity of 9.2 million TPY of
products (10 million TPY of ore), with the excess over the Stage III Volta
Redonda requirements (4.5 million TPY) to be sold. Large amounts of fines



ANNEX 13
Page 2
produced in excess of sinter plant requirements will probably be used in the
production of iron pellets in a proposed new 3 million TPY plant near Casa
de Pedra. This joint venture operation, which would be financed separately
from Stage III, would produce the 1.8 million TPY of pellets envisaged for
consumption at Volta Redonda by 1981 and would sell the excess. Final financ-
ing and cost details for this project have still to be settled, and further
exploration of the ore reserves is underway.
Scrap
4.        Although some 120,000 tons of scrap was purchased in 1974, by
1976 it is estimated that the introduction of continuous casting, the BOF
shop and other production improvements will mean that internally generated
scrap should be sufficient for steel-making requirements.
Limestone and Dolomite
5.        These fluxes, presently being purchased from independent suppliers
in Minas Gerais, will be supplied in the future by the new mining facilities
being installed at Arcos. The Arcos (Minas Gerais) project which was included
in CSN's Stage II expansion is under way and is expected to be completed in
early 1976. It will have a capacity of 2.6 million TPY of limestone and
dolomite, which will be more than the total requirements for Stage III (about
2.1 million TPY in 1981).
Other Raw Materials
6.        Ferro-alloys will be available in sufficient quantities from CSN's
own facilities and eventually from external sources. No problems are fore-
seen in the supply of fuel, power, refractories tin, zinc and other minor
materials, both from domestic and foreign sources.
Transport
7.        The transport systems serving Volta Redonda will generally require
expansion and improvements to carry the increased tonnages of raw materials
that will be needed for Stage III. New rail facilities in the form of
marshalling yards, line upgrading, branch lines and terminals are being
planned by the government railway authority. Additional rolling stock will
be needed and some of this is included in the Stage III expansion project.
Additional rail equipment will be acquired by the government railways. The
Bank is helping to finance Brazil's rail expansion program. Some road im-
provements are also planned, and new coal terminal facilities are to be
established at Sepetiba Bay to the south-west of Rio de Janeiro. Increased
handling and storage facilities for the larger amounts of materials to be
accommodated at the plant have been planned for both Stages II and III.

Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
Assumptions
1.        Financial rate of return calculations are based on the incremental
capital cost, operating cost and revenue streams shown on page 2 of this
Annex. The capital costs, operating costs and revenues were inflated at
different rates for the financial projections (see Annexes 16 and 17) but have
been deflated using a common deflator of 11% up to 1979 to reflect their
respective 1975 values in real terms over the project life.
2.        Other basic assumptions used in the financial rate of return cal-
culations are as follows:
Construction period: 4 years
Life of the project: 18 years
Revenue:  Net sales (excluding excise tax, cost of
distribution, and sales tax)

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
Assumptions
1.        All costs and revenues are expressed in real 1975 prices and are
derived on the following basis: (a) benefit stream is based on the oppor-
tunity cost of importing steel products; (b) production cost is calculated
using same prices as for financial rate of return analysis (see Annexes 16
and 17), as prices for the main inputs are consistent with world market
prices; and (c) all taxes and duties are excluded. No shadow-pricing of
foreign exchange/i or labor/2 has been employed.
Revenue
2.        CSN's net sales are valued at adjusted 1975 world market prices
(CIF Brazilian port), which are derived from projected long-term steel
export prices for the major steel-producing countries. The price levels
used for the analysis reflect the lower end of the range of current
domestic prices for those countries/3 for each of the steel products to
be produced by the project and allow about $50 per ton transportation cost
on the estimated FOB prices to determine CIF Brazil values. The resulting
prices are an average of 20% below the levels which prevailed in 1974, when
a worldwide shortage of steel pressured international prices for steel
products to an all-time high. More recently, with the world-wide slowdown
in economic activity, international steel prices have begun to decline.
In the long term, there is little risk that international prices will remain
below the levels listed below, which values (in 1975 US$) have been used to
determine the benefit stream for the economic rate of return:
Long-Term Projected International Steel Prices (CIF Brazil)

Brazil by Professor Edmar Bacha (Dean of the Department of Economics, University
of Brasilia); see Edmar L. Bacha, "Estudio de casos concretos en la estimacion
de parametros nacionales en paises de desarrollo", El uso de criterios socio-
